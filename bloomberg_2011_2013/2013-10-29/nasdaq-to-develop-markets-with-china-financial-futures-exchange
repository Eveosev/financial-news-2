Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc. and the  China 
Financial Futures Exchange said they will work together to
develop the latter’s markets.  The second-largest U.S. stock exchange operator and CFFEX,
founded by the Shanghai Futures Exchange, Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange and
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, signed an agreement to collaborate
on technology. The companies will also seek to develop markets
in China, they said in an e-mailed statement today.  The pair “will carry out extensive cooperation regarding
technology, consultation, information sharing, staff training
and explore opportunities for cooperation to promote
collaborative business projects,” Zhang Shenfeng, chairman of
CFFEX, said in the statement.  Last week, Nasdaq said third-quarter profit rose 27 percent
as technology and information services sales advanced. The
exchange is diversifying the business to offset a decline in
 stock trading . The exchange has bought the eSpeed platform for
dealing in U.S. Treasury bonds, the shareholder-relations unit
of Thomson Reuters Corp. and a 25 percent stake in The Order
Machine, a Dutch alternative trading system focused on options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
