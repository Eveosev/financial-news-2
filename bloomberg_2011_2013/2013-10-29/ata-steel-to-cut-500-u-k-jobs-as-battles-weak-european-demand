Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  will cut 500 mainly
management and administrative jobs in the U.K. to lower costs as
it struggles with weak demand from the  construction industry .  Jobs will go in Scunthorpe, Teesside and Workington, the
company said today in a statement. Cuts will “predominately”
affect management and administration, it said.  “European steel demand this year is expected to be only
two-thirds of pre-crisis levels after falls in the past two
years,” Karl Koehler, chief executive officer of Tata’s
European operations, said in the statement.  Steelmakers are shuttering plants and cutting jobs because
of excess capacity in Western Europe.  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the biggest
producer, has closed sites at Liege in Belgium and Florange in
 France  and says it’s considering halting plants in Eastern
Europe as it battles falling demand.  Tata, which bought Corus Group in 2007 for about $6.2
billion pounds ($10 billion), has been shuttering sites and
cutting jobs in the U.K. since the global financial crisis.  “Today’s news once again reflects the fragile state of our
economy and the lack of any real impetus by government to
support our manufacturing base,” Michael Leahy, the general
secretary of labor union Community and chairman of the U.K.
Steel unions’ committee, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
