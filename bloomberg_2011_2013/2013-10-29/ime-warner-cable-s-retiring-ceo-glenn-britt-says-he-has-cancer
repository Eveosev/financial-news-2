Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  Chief
Executive Officer Glenn Britt, who said in July that he will
retire at year-end, told employees today that he has cancer.  After a bout with melanoma five years ago, doctors
determined that Britt’s cancer has returned, he said in a memo
obtained by Bloomberg. Britt began having voice problems over
the summer and was undergoing tests to find the cause.  “I feel good and am optimistic about my prognosis,” said
Britt, 64. “I have no intention of letting this cancer slow me
down, and will continue to work until my retirement at the end
of the year.”  The  succession plan , which will pass the CEO and chairman
roles to Chief Operating Officer Rob Marcus on Jan. 1, was
already in place before Britt got sick, he said. The transition
has been “seamless” and is almost complete, Britt said.  Shares of New York-based Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable provider, were little changed in  New York 
trading at $118.81. The stock has climbed 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
