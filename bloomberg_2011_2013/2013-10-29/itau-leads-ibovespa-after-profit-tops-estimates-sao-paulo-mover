Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin
America’s largest lender by market value, rose the most on
 Brazil ’s Ibovespa benchmark  index  after reporting record
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Itau  climbed  3.4 percent to 34.52 reais, the highest level
since March 2012, at 11:14 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The 73-company
Ibovespa index dropped 0.8 percent.  “The bank’s earnings momentum continued to improve,”
Deutsche Bank AG analysts including  Mario Pierry  wrote in a
report to clients today. “Overall results look solid.”  Recurring net income, which excludes one-time items,
increased to 4.02 billion reais ($1.85 billion), or 81 centavos
a share, from 3.41 billion reais, or 69 centavos, a year
earlier, the Sao Paulo-based lender said in a statement today.
That compares with the  3.9 billion-real  estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal, 59, shifted toward
less risky mortgage and payroll loans and away from auto finance
after default rates on consumer loans in Brazil reached a record
8.18 percent in May 2012. Provisions dropped 26 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier.  “Privately owned banks in Brazil such as Itau and Bradesco
are more selective in giving credit,”  Pedro Galdi , head
strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora, said in a
telephone interview last week.  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , the nation’s
second-biggest bank by market value, reported record  earnings  on
Oct. 21.  Itau posted provisions of 4.54 billion reais in the third
quarter, down from 4.91 billion reais in the second quarter, and
6.12 billion reais a year earlier, according to the statement.
The lender estimated provisions will range from 19 billion reais
to 22 billion reais in 2013.  Loans overdue more than 90 days declined for a fifth
straight quarter to 3.9 percent, compared with 4.2 percent in
the previous three months and 5.1 percent a year earlier. The
portfolio of loans rose 10 percent to 481 billion reais from a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
