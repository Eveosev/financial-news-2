Stanbic IBTC Holding Co. (STANBIC) , the
Nigerian unit of South Africa’s  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , rose
the most in almost two months after reporting nine-month profit
increased 64 percent.  Net income climbed to 16.9 billion naira ($106 million) in
the nine months through September, from 10.3 billion naira a
year earlier, Stanbic IBTC said in filing to the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  today. Non interest income gained 70 percent to 36.4
billion naira.  “We expect the positives on the non-interest income line
and the other comprehensive income result to attract the
market’s attention,” Bunmi Asaolu, an analyst at Lagos-based
FBN Capital Ltd., said in e-mailed comments.  The Central Bank of Nigeria increased the cash-reserve
requirement for public funds in banks to 50 percent from 12
percent, Governor Lamido Sanusi said July 23, warning about the
risk of excess liquidity in the banking industry. The regulator
said lenders should lower fees and commissions from April 1 to
reduce conflict with clients.  Stanbic IBTC advanced 4.5 percent, the most since Sept. 4,
to 19.95 naira in Lagos trading. About 2.5 million shares were
traded, about double the three-month daily average. The stock
has climbed 81 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent
gain for the Bloomberg NSE Banking Index, which tracks  Nigeria ’s
top 10 banks by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
