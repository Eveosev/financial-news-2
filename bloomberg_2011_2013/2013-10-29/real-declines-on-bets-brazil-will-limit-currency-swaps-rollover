Brazil’s real dropped for the first
time in three days on speculation the central bank will limit
rollovers of foreign-exchange swaps that helped fuel the world’s
biggest two-month rally.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.1820 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:05 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . Swap rates on the contract
due in January 2015 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 10.53 percent.  The central bank has extended the maturities in auctions
that began Oct. 22 on only about $4 billion of the $8.9 billion
of foreign-exchange swaps maturing Nov. 1. Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  said last week that Brazil is reducing its
intervention in  currency markets .  The real has gained 12 percent since Aug. 22, when Brazil
announced a $60 billion intervention program of swaps and credit
lines to buoy the currency and curb import price increases. The
rally, the biggest among all of the world’s currencies, also
makes the country’s factories less competitive by boosting
export prices.  The central bank sold $990 million in a rollover auction
yesterday and will offer another 20,000 swaps today at 2:30 p.m.
local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
