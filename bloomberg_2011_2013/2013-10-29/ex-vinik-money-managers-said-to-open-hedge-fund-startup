Doug Gordon, Jon Hilsabeck and Don Jabro, former money managers at Vinik Asset Management LP, have
opened their own investment startup after the hedge-fund firm
run by Jeffrey Vinik shut earlier this year, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter.  Shellback Capital LP, which will bet on and against U.S.
stocks, has 10 employees, nine of whom formerly worked at Vinik,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. Vinik is investing an undisclosed amount
of his personal money in the new hedge-fund firm, which is based
in  Boston  and will start trading in January, the person said.  Vinik decided to close his $6 billion firm in May after the
money manager made ill-timed bets on gold and the direction of
stocks. Since then, managers who worked at the firm have been
setting up their own hedge funds. Vinik provided $20 million in
startup capital for Tampa, Florida-based Kopernik Global
Investors LLC, run by his former stock picker David Iben. More
than half of Kopernik’s staff of 28 came from Iben’s global-value group at Vinik Asset Management.  Gordon, Hilsabeck and Jabro together managed about $1.8
billion at the peak for Vinik Asset Management, the person said.
Gordon worked at the Boston-based firm from 2001 to 2013 and
became a money manager in 2002. He started managing a long-short
equity fund in January 2003. Long-short equity managers can bet
on rising as well as falling stocks.  Hockey Team  Hilsabeck worked at Vinik Asset Management from 1999 to
2013 and became a money manager in 2004, the person said. In
2005, he started managing a long-short equity fund. Jabro worked
at Vinik’s firm from 1998 to 2013 and became a money manager in
2002, the person said. He started managing a stocks fund in
2003.  Bradford Ali, Shellback Capital’s chief operating officer
and general counsel, declined to comment on the plans. Before
Shellback, Ali was chief compliance officer and counsel at Vinik
Asset Management, where he started in 2011, the person said.  Vinik’s hedge-fund firm, started after the money manager
left Fidelity Investments in the mid-1990s, posted annualized
returns of 17 percent since 1996. Vinik told clients in a May
letter that he would return all their money to focus on the
professional hockey team he bought in 2010 and charitable work,
after his fund declined 4.8 percent since July 2012. Vinik
bought the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League and
the St. Pete Times Forum, since renamed the Tampa Bay Times
Forum, for about $110 million in February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
