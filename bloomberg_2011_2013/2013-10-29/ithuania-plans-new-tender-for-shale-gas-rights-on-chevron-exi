Lithuania plans a new tender for
shale hydrocarbon exploration rights and will revise licensing
terms after  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  withdrew as sole bidder from a
previous contest.  The Lithuanian Geology Service was instructed by a tender
commission “to assess the changed legal and tax environment and
present the documents to organize a new tender,’ Vice
Environment Minister Daiva Matoniene said today in a statement
on the ministry’s website in Vilnius, the capital. The rights
for the sale are to explore and produce shale hydrocarbons in
the western Lithuanian region of Silute-Taurage.  The Baltic nation wants to know if its shale resources are
sufficient to be an alternative to energy imports from  Russia .
U.S. energy company Chevron abandoned its bid for exploration
rights on Oct. 8, put off by regulatory and tax issues, Prime
Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said at the time.  ‘‘This is a good decision,” Economy Minister Valentinas
Mazuronis said in the same statement. “Refusing to explore for
shale gas or oil would be unfair to  Lithuania  as a whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
