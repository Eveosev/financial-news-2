Senator  Ted Cruz  said he was
stopping efforts to delay the confirmation of Democrat Tom Wheeler as chairman of the  U.S. Federal Communications
Commission .  Wheeler, in a meeting today, said crafting rules to expand
disclosure of who pays for political advertisements wasn’t a
priority, Cruz said in an e-mailed  statement . “Based on those
representations, I have lifted my hold on his nomination,” Cruz
said in the statement.  Cruz, a Texas Republican, on Oct. 17 pledged to stall
Wheeler’s nomination.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat,
yesterday began procedures aimed at approving six nominations
including Wheeler’s in votes that could take place this week.  Wheeler, 67, a venture capitalist and former cable and
wireless trade association executive, was named in May by
President  Barack Obama .  Cruz asked during a confirmation hearing in June whether
Wheeler would use the agency to force broader disclosures of who
pays for political advertisements. Wheeler didn’t give specific
answers to Cruz’s followup questions, Sean Rushton, a spokesman
for the senator, said in an Oct. 17 e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
