San Miguel Corp. (SMC)  President Ramon Ang
said “several parties” have approached the company about
buying its majority stake in the  Philippines ’ biggest brewer.  “We’re not selling it,” Ang said today in Manila of the
51 percent holding in San Miguel Brewery Inc. “But of course
I’m not the only one who would decide.” He said the company
also received offers for its food and packaging units, declining
to identify any suitors.  A buyer would gain control over the beverage maker that
sells 9 of 10 beers in the Philippines and whose operating
margin is the industry’s second-widest in Asia. San Miguel,
which started as a brewer over a century ago, is  selling  assets
to bankroll a $35 billion investment plan to expand in airlines,
energy and infrastructure.  Japan ’s  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  bought 48.3 percent stake in San
Miguel Brewery in 2009 for $1.5 billion. The company is
expanding abroad amid Japan’s weakening demand for beer, which
declined for an eighth straight year in 2012. The seller of
Ichiban Shibori beer has the highest overseas sales ratio of the
country’s four biggest brewers, with 30 percent of sales from
outside Japan last year.  San Miguel fell 1.8 percent to close at 83.35 pesos in
Manila trading. The stock has lost 21 percent this year.  Pale Pilsen  San Miguel Brewery controls more than 90 percent of the
beer market in the Philippines, according to its website. The
beermaker, whose portfolio of 10 brands includes the namesake
San Miguel Pale Pilsen, had an operating margin of 29.6 percent
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The brewery posted a record 14.4 billion-peso ($334
million) profit last year on 75.58 billion pesos of sales.
Beverages accounted for 13 percent of the group’s revenue last
year while food made up of 14 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  San Miguel said this month it was selling its 27 percent
stake in  Manila  Electric Co., the nation’s largest power
retailer, for 72 billion pesos to  JG Summit Holdings Inc. (JGS)   The company, which started when the Philippines was still a
colony of Spain, has made more than $5.6 billion of acquisitions
since 2008. Its most recent purchase was 35 percent of Northern
Cement Corp. for 3 billion pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
