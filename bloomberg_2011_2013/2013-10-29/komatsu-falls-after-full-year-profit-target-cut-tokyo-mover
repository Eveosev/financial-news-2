Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-largest maker of construction equipment, dropped the most in
more than four years in Tokyo trading after trimming its full-year profit forecast.  The shares fell as much as 8.6 percent to 2,155 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange and were down 183 yen at 2,175 yen as of
10:11 a.m., headed for their biggest decline  since  Jan. 13,
2009. Komatsu was the biggest decliner among companies in the
 Nikkei (NKY)  225 Stock Average.  Komatsu, which sells large  dump trucks  and excavators to
customers such as Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , said
yesterday that demand for mining equipment may fall 50 percent
in the 12 months ending March 31. Net income is estimated at 136
billion yen ($1.39 billion) this fiscal year, down from the 184
billion yen the company projected in July and missing the 177
billion yen estimate of 24 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “With a large earnings downward revision and an ambiguous
recovery outlook in mining equipment, we think the upside in the
valuation is limited,” Yukihiro Kumagai, an analyst at
Jefferies Group LLC, said in a report dated yesterday. The firm
cut the rating on the stock to hold from buy.  The revision also prompted analysts from Nomura Securities
Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to cut their ratings on the
stock.  Slumping demand from mining companies in  Latin America ,
Indonesia and  Australia  is overshadowing growth in Japan and a
recovery in China, Komatsu said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
