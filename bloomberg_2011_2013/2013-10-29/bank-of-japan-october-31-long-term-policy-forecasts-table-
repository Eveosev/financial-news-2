The BOJ is likely to announce additional monetary
stimulus in the first six months of next year, according to 25 of 34 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey conducted Oct. 23-28.  Many of the economists in the survey see the bank stepping up the pace of
its asset purchases in Japanese  government bonds , exchange-traded funds, and
Japanese real-estate investment trusts as the most likely means of easing.  NOTE 1: 2H = 2nd half of the year
