Ser Educacional SA (SEER3) , the owner of 23
post-secondary schools in Brazil, fell on its first trading day
after selling shares below its intended range.  The shares  dropped  1.7 percent to 17.21 reais at 3:12 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. The benchmark Ibovespa gauge fell 1.4 percent.  The company priced shares at 17.50 reais in its initial
public offering, below the range of 19.50 reais to 23.50 reais
it estimated in a prospectus. The company and its shareholders
are raising as much as 539 million reais ($247 million) by
selling 15.4 million new and 15.4 million existing shares.  Ser Educacional’s offering was the second one by a
Brazilian education company this month. Gaec Educacao SA raised
as much as 468 million reais in an IPO on Oct. 24. Gaec has
gained 2.9 percent to 19.03 reais from the initial price.  Brazil’s government is cutting  interest rates  and easing
repayment terms on student loans as it seeks to swell the ranks
of doctors, lawyers and engineers in Latin America’s largest
economy, helping make  Kroton Educacional SA (KROT3)  the fifth-best
performer on the Ibovespa this year and sparking a 22 percent
rally this year in  Estacio Participacoes SA. (ESTC3)   The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 16 percent in dollar terms in 2013, compared
with a decline of 1.9 percent for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
