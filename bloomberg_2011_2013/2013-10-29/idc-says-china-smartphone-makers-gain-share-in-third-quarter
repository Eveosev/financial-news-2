China’s smartphone manufacturers
boosted market share in the third quarter, introducing models
based on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android mobile software and challenging
Apple Inc. and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  at the top.  Huawei Technologies Co. made up 4.8 percent of global
shipments, up from 3.8 percent a year earlier, and  Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992)  climbed to 4.7 percent from 3.7 percent, according to IDC.
Apple had 13.1 percent of the market, while Samsung remained the
top vendor with a 31.4 percent share, the researcher said in a
report today.  Android continues to fuel “vast opportunities for new
vendors to get into the smartphone space,” IDC said. Apple’s
newly introduced iPhone 5s and 5c models boosted sales by 25.7
percent to 33.8 million units. The results indicate that the
global smartphone market is on track to exceed 1 billion units
for the year, according to  Ramon Llamas , an analyst at IDC.  “It’s a significant milestone considering the market
shipped just half a billion units in 2011,” Llamas wrote in the
report. “Moving forward, what remains to be seen is how the
various companies and platforms will stay differentiated and
relevant in the increasingly competitive market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
