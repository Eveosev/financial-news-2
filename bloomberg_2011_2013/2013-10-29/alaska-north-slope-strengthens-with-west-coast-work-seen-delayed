Alaska North Slope crude
strengthened to a three-month high after a report that  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  plans to delay maintenance at its El Segundo, California,
complex, the largest single refinery on the U.S. West Coast.  Chevron will push work on a crude unit and coker back to
late April from January, according to a person familiar with the
schedule who asked not to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  ANS, a medium, sour crude used by refiners on the U.S. West
Coast, increased $1.75 to $7.50 a barrel over West  Texas 
Intermediate at 2:05 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was the grade’s largest premium since
July 12.  “For the time being, ANS is going to get affected by
refinery runs on the West Coast and also by imports to the West
Coast,” said Carl Larry, president of Houston-based Oil
Outlooks & Opinions.  California relies on  Alaska  for about  12 percent  of its
crude feedstock, according to the state Energy Commission.  Gulf Coast grades also strengthened. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet’s premium rose 40 cents to $1.90 a barrel. Light Louisiana
Sweet gained 20 cents to $2.30 over WTI. Poseidon’s discount
narrowed 25 cents to $3.60.  West Texas Sour weakened by $1.25 a barrel to a discount of
$5.50.  WTI in Midland , Texas, fell $1.05 a barrel against the
domestic benchmark in Cushing,  Oklahoma , to a discount of $4.50.  Oil produced in the Bakken formation weakened by $1 a
barrel today to a $12 discount to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
