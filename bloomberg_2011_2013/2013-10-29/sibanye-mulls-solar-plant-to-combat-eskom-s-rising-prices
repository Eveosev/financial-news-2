Sibanye Gold Ltd. (SGL) , the South African
miner spun off by Gold Fields Ltd. this year, may build a 10-megawatt solar power plant to counter rising electricity costs,
according to Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman.  “If electricity is going to become such a big part of our
cost base, we have to look at putting in energy sources
ourselves,” Froneman said in an interview at a mining
conference in Johannesburg today. “We’ve got the space and
 South Africa  has plenty of sunshine. It’s very viable and we’re
doing a lot of work on it.”  Sibanye’s electricity costs have risen 60 percent since
2007, even as the gold mining company used 16 percent less
power, Froneman said during a presentation at the conference.
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state-run electricity company
supplying 95 percent of South Africa’s power, raised prices 8
percent this year, half of the increase it had sought from the
regulator.  A further power-price increase of about 10 percent would be
rejected by the  mining industry , which will seek to get its
energy from other sources, Froneman said.  “We’re just at the point where the cost of photovoltaic
cells now starts crossing over with the cost of electricity from
Eskom,” he said. “There will come a time when we can do it
cheaper.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
