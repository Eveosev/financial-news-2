Three years after an oil pipeline rupture in  Michigan  spilled 843,000 gallons of sludge, government regulators still haven’t produced promised rules to compel operators to detect leaks.  An  oil spill  in  North Dakota  last month and the continued debate over construction of  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL Pipeline have led to renewed criticism to the government’s inaction on safety measures.  “It’s outrageous,” Rick Kessler, Pipeline Safety Trust’s president and a  Washington  lobbyist, said in an interview. “This is glacial. It’s incredibly frustrating, and there never is a straight answer about where the bottleneck is.”  Pipeline safety, a little-noticed backwater of Washington policy making, has grown in attention and political importance in recent years as the boom in North Dakota and  Texas  oil production and the hydraulic-fracturing revolution for natural gas means the U.S. pipeline network is both expanding and increasingly active.  “As the U.S. produces more oil and gas, we have to remain vigilant,” said Brigham McCown, the former head of the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. “If production is going to go up, inspections will have to go up as well.”  McCown, who’s now a lawyer in Texas, and industry representatives say it’s not new rules that are needed, but attention from regulators and for industry to adhere to the rules now in place.  Hazardous Liquids  The pipeline safety administration said it’s still working on plans to reconfigure rules for the 185,000 miles of pipes carrying hazardous liquids that it oversees. The number of serious incidents and the amount of gasoline or crude spilled has fallen since the late 1990s. Even so, over the past three years, there were 96 incidents that caused 41 deaths, 200 injuries and $400 million in property damage, according to  government data .  “We continue to try to make enhancements to safety, and we’re moving forward with the rulemaking,” said  Damon Hill , an agency spokesman. “It does take time and effort and a lot goes into getting this done.”  After the Michigan spill in 2010, the agency issued a notice that it intended to rewrite rules for leak detection and cut-off valves. It hasn’t got it done yet, and the 20,000-barrel spill at a  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  pipeline in North Dakota went undetected until a farmer came across it in his field last month.  “We remain focused on cleanup, repair and remediation,” Tina Barbee, a Tesoro spokeswoman, said by e-mail. “To date, we have reported more than 4,300 barrels recovered at the site.”  Keystone Proposal  The PHMSA proposal is now awaiting sign-off by the office of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx so that it can be sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review, Hill said.  “It’s sitting there somewhere in the bowels of the federal government,” said  Lois Epstein , a pipeline specialist at the Wilderness Society in  Alaska . “This is how government gets a bad name.”  The issue has entered the contentious debate over TransCanada’s proposal to build the Keystone pipeline from  Alberta  to the  Gulf of Mexico . Supporters say pipelines are safer than shipping oil by train, truck or barge, and point to the July explosion of a runaway train carrying oil through  Quebec  that killed 47 people. Critics point to leaks or ruptures in Michigan,  Arkansas  and now North Dakota to say the lines aren’t nearly as safe as proponents argue.  Leak Detection  In its 2010 announcement, the PHMSA said it was considering expanding requirements for use of leak detection and remote-controlled shut-off valves, which are required only on some pipelines near population centers, large water crossings or other environmentally sensitive areas. The regulator also said it was considering broadening its reach over more pipelines and expanding the number of areas considered heavily populated or near protected waterways.  The push for PHMSA to tighten its rules followed the break in an  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  pipeline near Marshall, Michigan, in 2010. Enbridge, the largest transporter of Canadian crude to the U.S., knew of cracks in its pipeline and didn’t react to the rupture for 17 hours after it was discovered, leading to the nation’s most expensive onshore oil spill, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its report on the incident.  Tesoro Comments  Oil from the spill was carried 35 miles downstream on the  Kalamazoo River . Enbridge said the incident has cost it more than $1 billion, including a $3.7 million fine from PHMSA.  In its report on that spill, the independent  National Transportation Safety Board  said PHMSA needed to take actions that include: setting specific rules for pipeline operators about detecting and repairing cracks; issuing a notice to all operators about the causes of the Enbridge spill and how to “eliminate similar deficiencies”; and extending rules governing qualifications for control-room operators.  So far, PHMSA hasn’t fully implemented any of the eight items on the NTSB’s recommendation list, which was published on July 25, 2012.  The agency said  it has made progress in improving oversight of clean-up plans, and plans to issue a number of additional proposals over the next two months.  “The areas that require regulation are the ones that are going to take longer,” NTSB Vice Chairman  Christopher Hart  said. “We know there is movement” by PHMSA, he said.  ‘Sleepy’ Agency  Critics aren’t so sanguine.  “When there is a major incident like the Kalamazoo River spill, you would think they would get right on it,” said Jeff Ruch, the head of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which is seeking public records from the agency. “Employees have come to us and said, ‘We are a sleepy, industry-dominated organization.’”  Congress passed legislation in 2011 that mandated the agency study leak detection and then formulate new rules to improve it, and allowed the agency to issue stiffer penalties against operators. The resulting report found that of 766 pipeline releases between Jan. 1, 2010 and July 7, 2012, only 23 were identified by leak detection systems. Ground crews, emergency responders and members of the public were more likely to find leaks.  The costs of a leak detection system, “are minor compared with other systems on the pipeline,” according to the report. “The difficulty lies in convincing operators of their value.”  Bi-Weekly Checks  That legislation also held up the issuance of new rules on leak detection, because the agency must allow Congress to review that study for a year before it can issue new rules, according to PHMSA.  U.S. operators must check for leaks by walking, driving or overflying their pipeline rights-of-way every two weeks, according to John Stoody, a spokesman for the Washington-based Association of Oil Pipe Lines. In densely populated or environmentally sensitive areas, operators must file plans on the impact of a spill and the leak detection systems that may be required.  The operators rely on equipment already in place that monitors the flow of oil to detect leaks, according to the Kiefner & Associates report. Advanced systems use filament along the length of a pipeline or special cameras to detect petroleum vapors.  “They’re expensive,” Stoody said. “Are they worth the money?”  To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Drajem in Washington at  mdrajem@bloomberg.net ; Jim Efstathiou Jr. in New York.1647 or  jefstathiou@bloomberg.net .
