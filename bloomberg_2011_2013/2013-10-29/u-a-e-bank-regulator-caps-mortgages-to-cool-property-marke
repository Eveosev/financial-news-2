The United Arab Emirates central
bank capped the size of mortgages banks in the country can offer
as it moves to avoid a repeat of a property bubble that caused
values to plummet after 2008.  Foreigners can borrow 75 percent of the value of a first
home priced at 5 million dirhams ($1.36 million) or less and
U.A.E. nationals can get 80 percent, according to a document
circulated by the bank and seen by Bloomberg. The limits are 65
percent and 70 percent, respectively, for homes worth more than
5 million dirhams.  Dubai, the second-largest of seven sheikhdoms that make up
the U.A.E., saw  home prices  surge at the fastest pace in the
world in the second quarter, stoking concern that another
property bubble may be growing. That prompted the emirate’s
government to double real estate transaction fees to rein in
speculation. Dubai suffered one of the world’s worst property
crashes in 2008 when speculators fled the market and saddled
banks with unpaid loans.  The regulator capped mortgages for second homes and
investment properties at 60 percent of the value regardless of
the price. Buyers of properties before they are built can borrow
no more than 50 percent of the value “given the long- term
nature of the development process and the higher level of risk
to completion,” the regulator said. Advance sales, known as
off-plan, were seen as a main cause of the previous property
bubble.  To contact the reporter on this story:
