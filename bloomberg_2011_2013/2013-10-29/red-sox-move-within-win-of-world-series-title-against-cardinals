The  Boston  Red Sox moved within one
win of capturing their third World Series championship in the
last 10 years by defeating the host St. Louis Cardinals 3-1.  Boston leads the best-of-seven World Series three games to
two and can clinch the title in Game 6 at its Fenway Park on
Oct. 30. If the Cardinals win that game, a decisive Game 7 would
be played the following night, also in Boston.  Jon Lester allowed one run on four hits in 7 2/3 innings to
win his second game of the series for the Red Sox. He struck out
seven and now has an earned run average of 0.59 after also
winning Game 1 of the World Series.  “That’s why he’s the ace of our staff, because he goes out
and pitches like that,” said Boston catcher David Ross, who had
a tie-breaking double in the seventh inning.  The Red Sox scored two runs in the seventh tonight at Busch
Stadium in St. Louis to break a 1-1 tie. After Ross drove in one
run with his double, Jacoby Ellsbury knocked in the other run
with a single.  The Red Sox had opened the scoring in the first inning on
back-to-back doubles by Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz, who went
3-for-4 tonight and now is hitting .733 in the World Series with
six runs batted in.  Matt Holliday hit a solo home run for the Cardinals in the
fourth to tie it 1-1.  The Red Sox won World Series championships in 2004 and 2007
after going 86 years without a title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
