The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell
for the first time in five days and gold and Treasuries dropped,
while the dollar reversed earlier declines, as the  Federal
Reserve  fueled speculation it will begin to slow the pace of
stimulus in coming months.  The  S&P 500  slipped 0.5 percent to 1,763.31 at 4 p.m. after
rising to a record yesterday for a  third straight day . The 10-year Treasury yield increased 2.7 basis points to 2.53 percent
after earlier dropping as much as three basis points. Gold
futures fell 0.2 percent after climbing more than 1 percent
earlier. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge of the
currency against 10 major peers, reversed a 0.3 percent drop to
rise 0.1 percent. West Texas Intermediate oil lost 1.5 percent,
sending its discount to Brent to the most since April.  The Fed decided to press on with $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases, saying it needs to see more evidence that the
economy will continue to improve even amid signs of “underlying
strength.” The Fed was expected to maintain the pace of asset
purchases before beginning to reduce them at its March meeting,
according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts in advance of
today’s statement.  “When you look at the reaction in the market, investors
are really taking the opinion that the taper may actually come
sooner than previously thought,” Chris Gaffney, senior market
strategist at EverBank Wealth Management, said by phone from  St.
Louis . “The statement is pretty strong in its view that the Fed
sees the economy continuing to improve. They did not mention the
government shutdown. All indications are that the economy is
going to continue to improve.”  ‘Underlying Strength’  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is pushing unprecedented
accommodation into the final months of his Fed chairmanship as
he seeks to shield the four-year economic expansion from the
impact of higher borrowing costs and this month’s partial U.S.
government shutdown. The 16-day closing resulted in the
furloughs of as many as 800,000 federal workers and delayed
release of data the Fed says it needs to evaluate the economy.  “Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal
retrenchment over the past year, the committee sees the
improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions
since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with
growing underlying strength in the broader economy,” the Fed’s
policy committee said.  It’s “imperative” that the Fed begin to taper its record
stimulus because it is inflating asset prices too much,
BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, whose
company is the world’s largest money manager with $4.1 trillion
in assets, said during a panel discussion in  Chicago  yesterday.  ‘Bubble-Like’  “We’ve seen real  bubble-like  markets again,” he said.
“We’ve had a huge increase in the equity market. We’ve seen
corporate-debt spreads narrow dramatically.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 161 percent from its bear-market
low in 2009. The extra yield investors demand to hold high-risk,
high-yield bonds has dropped to 444 basis points from this
year’s high of 534 in June, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index. That spread reached 440
basis points on Oct. 24, the narrowest since May 28.  Consumer-staples, utility and energy companies led losses
in all 10 of the main industry groups in the S&P 500 today.  Yelp
Inc. (YELP) , owner of a website that lets consumers review local
businesses, sank 2.6 percent after reporting a wider-than-estimated loss. General Motors Co. climbed 3.3 percent after
third-quarter profit beat estimates as the largest U.S.
automaker’s North American earnings helped buffer international
losses.  Earnings and Fed stimulus have helped extend the S&P 500’s
advance to almost 24 percent in 2013, which would mark its best
yearly rally in a decade. Of the 314 companies in the index that
have  released results  so far this quarter, 75 percent beat
analysts’ profit projections and 53 exceeded revenue forecasts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jobs Growth  Companies in the U.S. boosted payrolls by 130,000 in
October, following a gain of 166,000 last month, figures from
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed today.
The median forecast of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an advance of 150,000.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index was little changed after earlier
reaching the highest level since 2008. Automakers led gains as
VW jumped 5 percent.  Eni (ENI)  SpA, Italy’s biggest oil company,
advanced 1.3 percent in Milan after reporting adjusted net
income fell less than analysts anticipated.  Barclays Rises  Barclays Plc, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets,
rose 0.9 percent in  London  after third-quarter pretax profit
matched estimates. The Markit iTraxx Senior Financial Index of
credit-default swaps linked to 25 European banks and insurers
rose 3 basis point to 121 basis points after yesterday reaching
the lowest since Oct. 13, 2010.  This year’s rally in equities has pushed valuations on
benchmark indexes in the U.S. and Europe to the highest levels
in more than three years. The S&P 500 started today trading for
16.8 times reported earnings, the most since May 2010. The Stoxx
600 was valued at 20.9 times reported earnings and 14.9 times
projected profit, the most expensive valuations since the end of
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The European
gauge has rallied 15 percent this year following a similar gain
in 2012  Among stocks moving in  Asia  today, China Citic Bank Corp.
advanced 4.9 percent in  Hong Kong  after reporting higher
earnings, and  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) , which posted an
increase in quarterly profit yesterday, added 3.8 percent in
 Tokyo .  Emerging Markets  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose for a third day,
advancing 0.5 percent. The gauge jumped about 5.5 percent in
October, poised for its first back-to-back monthly gain since
January. India’s S&P BSE Sensex Index closed at a record high as
Bharti Airtel jumped 5.5 percent, the most in more than a month.
Brazil’s Ibovespa slipped for a second day, losing 0.7 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.5 percent,
rebounding from a seven-week low, on speculation the government
will introduce measures to boost economic growth at a Communist
Party meeting and as the largest  oil companies , PetroChina Co.
and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., reported higher profit.  ,                         Government Bonds  All sovereign debt markets tracked by Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes apart from  Australia  and  New Zealand  had positive
returns in the past month.  Germany’s 10-year  yield  fell five basis points to 1.69
percent today, dropping for a seventh day in the longest run
since August 2011.  The dollar strengthened against 13 of 16 major peers,
rising 0.2 percent to $1.3750 per euro as the American currency
appreciated versus 13 of 16 major peers.  WTI oil dropped 1.5 percent to a four-month low of $96.77 a
barrel after the Energy Information Administration said
stockpiles rose 4.09 million barrels to 383.9 million last week.
A 2.4 million-barrel gain was projected in a Bloomberg survey.
Brent for December settlement settled $13.09 higher than
WTI, the most since April 2. Brent increased 85 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $109.86 a barrel in London.  Copper advanced 1.4 percent to $3.3255 a pound in  New York ,
