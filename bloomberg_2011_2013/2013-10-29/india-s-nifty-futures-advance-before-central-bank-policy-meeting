Most Indian stocks declined before
the central bank meets for a policy review today.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the nation’s biggest maker
of power equipment, headed for a one-month low.  Larsen & Toubro
Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company, declined the most in two
weeks. Carmaker  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  rallied the most in
five weeks after its quarterly profit almost tripled.  Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the S&P BSE
Sensex Index, which declined 0.1 percent to 20,542.07 at 10:27
a.m. in Mumbai.  Reserve Bank  of  India  Governor Raghuram Rajan
will raise the key repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.75
percent, according to 32 of 42 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
 Monetary policy  must tackle elevated inflation even as growth
remains “tepid,” the RBI said in a report released after the
market closed yesterday.  “The RBI report shows there’s still some concern on
inflation,” Sandeep Bhatia,  executive director  and head of
sales at Kotak Institutional Equities, said on Bloomberg TV
India. The RBI may raise the repo rate by 25 basis points and
cut the marginal standing facility by the same amount, he said.  Rajan, who pledged to contain price increases after taking
charge of the RBI last month, faces consumer-price inflation of
almost 10 percent as the rupee’s 12 percent drop over the past
year stokes import costs. He will reduce the  marginal standing
facility rate  by 25 basis points to 8.75 percent, according to 9
of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey, as he scales back
emergency liquidity curbs imposed on the banking system three
months ago to stem a plunge in the rupee.  Banks borrow in the MSF facility window when they exhaust
the amount they can access at the repo rate.  Maruti Profit  Bharat Heavy slid for the fifth day, losing 2.5 percent.
Larsen & Toubro decreased 2.4 percent, the most since Oct. 17.  Maruti Suzuki jumped 5.3 percent, the most since Sept. 19.
The company reported after the market closed yesterday that net
income almost tripled to 6.7 billion rupees ($109 million) in
the September quarter. That exceeded the 5.48 billion-rupee
median estimate of 43 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. may report quarterly profit of
1.49 billion rupees, compared with 7.57 billion rupees a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of 28 analysts. The
shares fell 0.8 percent.  The Sensex has gained 5.8 percent this year and  trades  at
13.9 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.7 times. Quarterly profits at 13 of
14 companies in the  Indian (SENSEX)  gauge that have posted earnings so
far this season have beaten or matched estimates, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. About 47 percent of the companies trailed
forecasts in the June quarter.  Foreign investors bought a net $113.6 million of domestic
shares on Oct. 25, taking this year’s inflow to $15.6 billion,
data from the regulator showed yesterday. They have purchased
$2.17 billion of shares this month, extending September’s $2
billion inflow.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index decreased 0.1 percent to 6,095.30. The
India VIX, which gauges the cost of protection against losses in
the Nifty, gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
