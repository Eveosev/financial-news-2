Econet Wireless Zimbabwe Ltd., the
country’s biggest mobile-phone carrier, said profit for the six
months ended August declined 9.5 percent to $70.6 million as
growth in voice services slowed even as the company added users.  Revenue climbed 11 percent to $376.6 million with
subscriber numbers up 22 percent to 8.5 million, Douglas Mboweni, chief executive officer of the Harare-based company,
told reporters at a briefing in the capital today. The number of
subscribers for the money transfer unit, Ecocash, increased by
76 percent to 3 million.  “We are seeing a slowed growth even as we’ve been adding
new subscribers,” Mboweni said. “We have to find new revenue
streams. The future in this business lies in innovative
solutions to complement slowed growth in voice.”  The company is “revisiting” the idea of declaring a
dividend, said Deputy Finance Director Roy Chimanikire. Econet
has reduced the syndicated  bank loan  it used for network
expansion to $200 million from $307 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
