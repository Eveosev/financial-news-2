Dana Holding Corp. (DAN)  and  Cummins Inc. (CMI) 
plummeted after the automotive and truck industry suppliers
lowered their annual forecasts.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT)  fell
after quarterly revenue declined and missed analysts’ estimates.  Dana, a maker of axles for cars, trucks and construction
equipment, dropped 15 percent to $19.28 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-day drop since August 2011. Columbus,
Indiana-based Cummins, which makes engines for trucks, slid 5.2
percent to $127.90, the largest one-day slide since April 30.  Dana, based in Maumee, Ohio, cut its forecast for adjusted
earnings per share and sales because of slowness in the
construction, heavy truck and mining industries, according to a
statement. The company now expects profit of $1.76 a share on
sales of $6.7 billion, compared with a July forecast of $1.90 a
share and $7 billion in sales.  Cummins lowered its annual forecast for sales and adjusted
earnings, according to a statement. The engine maker said it
expects annual revenue to drop 3 percent and earnings before
interest and taxes to be in the range of 12.5 percent to 13
percent of sales. Cummins said in July sales this year would be
unchanged and profit to be 13 percent to 14 percent of sales.  Goodyear Falls  Goodyear, based in Akron,  Ohio , said separately in a
statement its third-quarter revenue declined 5 percent to $5
billion, and below the average of five analysts’ estimates for
revenue of $5.27 billion. The shares declined 5.9 percent to
$20.76 at the close. The shares had fallen as much as 10 percent
to $19.84, the biggest intraday decline in a year.  Goodyear, the largest North  American tire  maker, said
third-quarter profit rose 48 percent to $173 million.  Cummins’ third-quarter net income rose 0.9 percent to $355
million, or $1.90 a share. That trailed the $2.11 average of 20
analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 3.6
percent to $4.27 billion, compared with $4.37 billion, the
average of 15 estimates.  Dana third-quarter net income rose 21 percent to $68
million. Excluding what the company considers one-time items,
profit was 47 cents a share. That trailed the 55-cent average of
10 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Sales dropped 2.7
percent to $1.67 billion, compared with the $1.78 billion
average of nine estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
