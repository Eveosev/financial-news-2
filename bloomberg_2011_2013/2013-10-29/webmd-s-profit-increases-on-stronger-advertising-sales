WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) , owner of the
consumer health-information website, raised its 2013 forecast
and said third-quarter profit rose on strength in its core
advertising and sponsorship business.  Net income  rose to $3.2 million, or 6 cents a share, from a
loss of $900,000, or 2 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. The profit includes a $2
million after-tax loss, at 4 cents a share, for the repurchase
of $100 million on its 2.25 percent convertible notes due 2016.
A profit of 9 cents a share was the average of four analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company forecast  earnings  in excess of $12 million for
2013, up from a range of $3 million to $11 million estimated in
July. WebMD also announced the acquisition of Avado Inc., which
develops patient relationship management tools, to help connect
doctors and patients using the company’s digital technology.  “We believe we are uniquely positioned to connect our
physician and consumer audiences,” said Chief Executive Officer
David Schlanger in a telephone interview. “It’s really creating
a partnership based on improving health, and not just when the
patient is physically in front of the physician.”  Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed.  WebMD rose 3.7 percent to $36.84 at the close of  New York 
 trading  before the earnings results were announced. The shares
have more than doubled so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
