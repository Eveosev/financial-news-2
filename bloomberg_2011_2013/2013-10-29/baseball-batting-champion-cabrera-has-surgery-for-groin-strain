Major League Baseball batting
champion  Miguel Cabrera  of the  Detroit Tigers  probably will be
ready for the 2014 season after surgery today on a
left groin strain, the team said.  The 30-year-old third baseman will undergo physical therapy
for the next two months, the Tigers said in an e-mailed
statement.  Cabrera in 2012 became the first hitter in 45 years to win
baseball’s Triple Crown, leading the American League in batting
average, home runs and runs batted in. This year he hit an AL-best .348, while his 44 home runs and 137 RBI trailed only
Baltimore Orioles first baseman Chris Davis, who had 53 homers
while driving in 138.  An eight-time All-Star, Cabrera has hit .321 with 365 home
runs and 1,260 RBI over his 11-year career. He’s had at least 30
home runs with more than 100 RBI in each of the past seven
seasons and was the AL Most Valuable Player in 2012.  The Tigers (93-69) won the AL Central this season before
losing in six games to the  Boston Red Sox  in the AL Championship
Series.  -- Editors: Jay Beberman, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
