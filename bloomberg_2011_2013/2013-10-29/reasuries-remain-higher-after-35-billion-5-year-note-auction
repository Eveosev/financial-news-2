Treasury (USGG5YR)  five-year yields fell to
almost the lowest since June after the U.S. sold $35 billion of
the securities a day before the Federal Reserve is expected to
announce it will continue its bond-buying program.  The notes sold at the auction drew a yield of 1.3 percent,
the lowest at a sale of the security since May. Fed policy
makers began a two-day meeting today at which they are forecast
to maintain the central bank’s $85 billion in monthly debt
purchases used to support the economy. Reports earlier showed
wholesale prices unexpectedly fell in September, an indication
inflation remains tame, retail sales declined and consumer
confidence dropped to the lowest level since April.  “The market sentiment is still fairly positive on
Treasuries, negative on the economy,” said Thomas Roth, senior
Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc. “The data is going to have to prove more positive than the
market thinks to create a change in sentiment. Most people think
yields are headed lower.”  The yield on the current five-year note fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.26 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. The 1.375
percent note due in September 2018 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 17/32. Yields dropped to 1.25 percent
on Oct. 23, the least since June 19.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  declined two basis
points to 2.5 percent. The price of the 2.5 percent note due in
August 2023 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 99
31/32.  Volume, Volatility  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, was at $268.7 billion,
below the 2013 average of $314 billion. Volume reached a 2013
high of $662 billion on May 22 and a low of $147.8 billion on
Aug. 9.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the MOVE index rose
to 58.81 after dropping yesterday to 58.54, the lowest level
since May. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest level in
two months. It touched a record low 49 on May 9.  The auction yield compared with a forecast of 1.302 percent
in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary
dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.65 versus an average of 2.7 for the past 10 sales.  ‘Good Buying’  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 45.9 percent of the notes, the most
since July, compared with an average of 44 percent for the past
10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.2 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 15 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  Primary dealers  purchased 41.9 percent of the notes, the
lowest since August.  “Most of the market are of the mind that the Fed is on
hold until March or maybe even longer,” said Jason Rogan,
managing director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Securities LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “This part of the curve had good buying with
economic data being on the weak side. Any backup in yields will
be met by buying.”  Net Shorts  Five-year notes have lost 1 percent this year, versus a
loss of 1.8 percent by Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities returned
2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Investors in Treasuries were  short  for the first time since
Sept. 9, betting that the prices of the securities will drop,
according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The proportion of net shorts rose to four percentage points
in the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan. The percent
of outright shorts, or bets the securities will fall in value,
rose to 23 percent as of yesterday, from 15 percent the previous
week. The percent of outright longs dropped to 19 percent, from
23 percent. Investors cut neutral bets to 58 percent, the lowest
level since June 3, from 62 percent the previous week.  Today’s offering is the second of three note auctions this
week totaling $96 billion. The government sold $32 billion in
two-year debt yesterday at a yield of 0.323 percent, and will
sell $29 billion in seven-year securities tomorrow.  ‘Decent Demand’  “There is decent demand for the sector, with expectations
for rates to stay low,” Justin Lederer, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, which as a
primary dealer is required to bid at Treasury auctions, said
before today’s auction. “The Fed is going to be on hold for
longer than people expected two months ago, providing demand for
Treasuries even at these levels.”  Investors bid $2.87 for each dollar of the $1.756 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  The Conference Board’s  index  of  consumer confidence  fell to
71.2 in October from 80.2 the month prior, the New York-based
private research group said. The figure is the lowest since it
touched 69 in April. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of economists called for a reading of 75.  Government Shutdown  The 0.1 percent decrease in the producer price index
followed a 0.3 percent gain the prior month, a Labor Department
report showed. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 80
economists called for a 0.2 percent advance. The so-called core
measure, which strips out volatile food and fuel, increased 0.1
percent after being unchanged in August.  Retail sales  dropped 0.1 percent, Commerce Department
figures showed, restrained by the biggest decrease at auto
dealers since October 2012, as purchases early in the month were
included in the August data.  The partial government shutdown that began Oct. 1 probably
trimmed 0.25 percentage point from fourth-quarter economic
growth and cost the U.S. 120,000 jobs in October, President
 Barack Obama ’s chief economic adviser said on Oct. 22.  The Fed will delay slowing its monthly bond buying under
the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy until March, according
to economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Oct. 17-18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
