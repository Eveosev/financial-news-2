Warrnambool Cheese & Butter Factory
Co. (WCB) , the Australian dairy producer that’s the subject of three
takeover offers, rallied to a record in Sydney trading on
speculation a new bidder is preparing a proposal.  The Victoria state-based producer advanced as much as 11
percent to A$9.30, valuing the company at A$520.8 million ($496
million). That’s 16 percent more than the current highest offer
of A$8 a share bid from  Canada ’s  Saputo Inc. (SAP)  Warrnambool traded
up 6.2 percent at A$8.88 at 2:01 p.m. local time.  A block of 1.1 million Warrnambool shares were traded at
A$9.25 at 11:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. A record 5.31 million shares changed hands by 1:43
p.m. local time, more than 41 times the three-month daily
average.  “The speculation is that this is a new bid,” Evan Lucas,
Melbourne-based market strategist at IG Ltd. said by phone.  Saputo won support from the target’s board with its higher
A$8 a share offer last week, topping the A$7.50 cash proposal
made from Murray Goulburn Cooperative Co. and above a cash and
shares offer from  Bega Cheese Ltd. (BGA)  Warrnambool, which makes
brands including Sungold and Warrnambool Cheddar as well as
supplying milk to make Philadelphia cream cheese, said it’s not
aware of a reason for the share trading today.  The company “confirms that it is in compliance with its
continuous disclosure obligation,” the dairy producer said
today in a statement.  Bega Cheese holds 18 percent of Warrnambool and Murray
Goulburn holds 17 percent,  according to data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
