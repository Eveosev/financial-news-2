Eike Batista , facing bankruptcy
protection proceedings at an oil venture, agreed to sell his
coal projects in Colombia to  Turkey ’s Yildirim Holding AS for
about $450 million in the latest divestment of the former
billionaire.  Under a preliminary agreement,  CCX Carvao da Colombia SA ,
Batista’s  coal unit , will sell its Canaverales and Papayal open-pit mines to Yildirim for about $50 million, the company said in
a regulatory filing late yesterday. It also agreed to negotiate
the sale of its San Juan undeground mine and logistics project
for about $400 million, CCX said. The deal is worth more than
four times CCX’s market value, which stood at 233.1 million
reais ($106.7 million) as of yesterday’s close.  Batista, who ceased being a billionaire in July, this year
sold stakes in energy, logistics and mining ventures as he seeks
to raise cash to pay back debt amid a collapse in the price of
his assets.  OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA, the tycoon’s
oil company, could file for bankruptcy protection as soon as
today, said a person with direct knowledge of the plans.  CCX expects to close the sale of Canaverales and Papayal by
the end of the year after a Sept. 13 agreement to sell the mines
to Transwell Enterprises Inc. expired, the company said in
yesterday’s filing. The sale of the San Juan project is expected
to be concluded by the end of April, the company said. Yildirim
will make a $5 million payment to negotiate the purchase of the
Colombian mines in exclusivity, it said.  While Canaverales holds 27.3 million metric tons of coal
reserves and Papayal’s reserves amount to 15.6 million tons, the
flagship San Juan underground mine has 671.8 million tons in
reserves and an associated logistics project, CCX said.  Thermal Coal  Batista, 56, created Rio de Janeiro-based CCX in May 2012
through a spinoff from his power generation unit MPX Energia SA,
targeting 35 million tons of thermal coal output by 2020 from
its three mines. The company estimated in an August 2012  filing 
that developing its San Juan project would require $5.5 billion,
including costs to start production in 2017 and achieve full
capacity five years after that.  CCX, the last of the six units listed by the tycoon between
2006 and 2012, may be worth as much as $6 billion, Batista said
in 2011. Shares of the company gained 171 percent from a record
low on July 3 through Sept. 13, on speculation CCX would sell
assets. The stock  jumped  21 percent to 1.37 reais at the close
in Sao Paulo yesterday, the most since Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
