The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Australia  against non-payment increased, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to
106.5 as of 11:24 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The gauge has fallen from 125.2 at
the end of September and is poised for its first monthly decline
since July, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 133 basis points
as of 8:25 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark has slipped from 156.4
basis points on Sept. 30 and is set for a second monthly drop,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 87.25
basis points as of 9:26 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure has fallen from 97.3 at the end of
September and is on track for its largest monthly drop since
April, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
