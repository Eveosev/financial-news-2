German stocks  advanced as investors
watched a Federal Reserve policy meeting that begins today amid
optimism policy makers will hold off scaling back stimulus.  RWE AG (RWE)  led gains, rising 1 percent after the utility
restarted a nuclear reactor that it halted two days ago.
Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender, dropped 2.6 percent
after third-quarter profit fell 94 percent, missing estimates.
 Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  fell the most in two months.  Continental AG (CON) ,
Europe’s second-largest auto-parts supplier, retreated 0.9
percent after Michelin & Cie. reported a revenue drop.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  advanced 0.2 percent to 8,995.64 at 9:51 a.m.
in Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge has climbed 4.7 percent in
October as U.S. lawmakers agreed to end a fiscal impasse and
investors speculated that a worse-than-forecast payrolls report
would delay a reduction in the Federal Reserve’s stimulus
program. The broader HDAX Index also added 0.2 percent today.  The Federal Open Market Committee starts a two-day meeting
today to consider whether to start trimming the $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases. Policy makers will decide to hold off
until March, a Bloomberg survey showed this month.  A Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. New York time may
show that retail-sales growth stalled in September. Economists
forecast no change in purchases after a 0.2 percent gain the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey. Separate data
at 10 a.m. will probably show  consumer confidence  declined this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
