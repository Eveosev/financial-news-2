Israel  is preparing to free 26
Palestinian prisoners overnight as part of a U.S.-brokered deal
to renew peace talks.  “The release is expected to take place after midnight,”
Palestinian Minister of Prisoner Affairs Issa Qaraqa said in a
phone interview. The freed prisoners will be taken to the West
Bank city of Ramallah from nearby Ofer prison for a welcoming
ceremony with Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas  and their
families, Qaraqa said.  Under the U.S.-brokered plan, Israel would release 104
inmates in four stages. The first round of releases took place
in August, one month after Israel and Palestinians renewed peace
negotiations after a three-year hiatus.  “The decision to free prisoners is one of the hardest I
made,” Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said yesterday
at a meeting with members of his Likud-Beitenu parliamentary
faction, several of whom opposed the release. “This decision
was necessary in our current reality. We have to steer through a
complex international arena full of challenges.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
