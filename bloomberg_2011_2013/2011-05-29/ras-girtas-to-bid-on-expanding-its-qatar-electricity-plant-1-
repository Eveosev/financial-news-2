Ras Girtas Power Co., a partnership
involving  Qatar Electricity & Water Co. (QEWS)  and GDF Suez SA, plans a
bid to expand the 2,730-megawatt Ras Laffan C power plant that
the venture built and which reached full capacity last month.  Bids are due at the end of July at  Qatar General
Electricity & Water Corp. , the Persian Gulf emirate’s public
utility, Ras Girtas Chief Executive Officer Faisal Al Siddiqi
said today in a telephone interview.  The project will be awarded “we hope by this summer or the
end of this year,” he said.  The plant will be expanded by as much as 750 megawatts, and
capacity for desalinating water will increase 40 percent to 88
million gallons (333 million liters) a day by 2014, he said. The
facility started operating last year and reached full capacity
as of April 1.  Qatar, holder of the world’s third-largest natural gas
reserves, is increasing electricity-generating capacity to keep
pace with economic growth, which the International Monetary Fund
forecasts to be the fastest of any country this year.  Other Ras Girtas shareholders include state-owned  Qatar
Petroleum , Japan’s Mitsui & Co. and  GDF Suez (GSZ) ’s International
Power division.  No one at Doha-based Qatar General Electricity & Water
answered telephones when Bloomberg News called after business
