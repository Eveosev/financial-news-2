Israel ’s 10-year bonds rose, driving
the yield to the lowest in three months, as signs of slowing
U.S. growth and the debt crisis in Europe increased demand for
the relative safety of government debt.  U.S. 10-year yields touched the lowest since December on
May 27 as the number of Americans signing to buy previously
owned homes fell more than forecast in April. The economy grew
at a less-than-forecast 1.8 percent annual rate in the first
quarter, the Commerce Department said May 26.  “Israeli government yields are tracking a decline in U.S.
yields triggered by concern about a slowdown in the  U.S.
economy , which is also spurring demand for safer assets in the
local market,” Assaf Rosenberg, a trader at Excellence Nessuah
Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan , Israel, said by telephone.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.06
percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the lowest since
Feb. 28. Local bonds closely track those in the U.S., one of its
largest trading partners.  The  International Monetary Fund  may withhold its 3.3
billion-euro ($4.7 billion) contribution to the 12 billion-euro
payment Greece had expected to receive next month, Jean-Claude
Juncker, the head of the group of euro-area finance ministers,
said last week.  The shekel strengthened 0.3 percent against the dollar to
3.4700 on May 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
