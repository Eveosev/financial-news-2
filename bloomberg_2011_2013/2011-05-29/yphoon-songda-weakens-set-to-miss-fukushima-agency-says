Typhoon Songda is weakening and
expected to pass to the south of  Japan , avoiding the crippled
nuclear plant in Fukushima prefecture.  The eye of the storm was located about 260 kilometers (160
miles) south-southwest of Ashizurimisaki, part of Japanâ€™s Kochi
prefecture, and moving northeast at 55 kilometers per hour as of
9:50 a.m., the  Japan Meteorological Agency  said on its website.
Wind speeds may decrease to 83 kilometers per hour by 9 p.m.
from 108 kilometers per hour at 9:50 a.m., it said.  Forecasts last week projected the possibility that the
storm may pass over the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, which spewed
radiation after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out
cooling systems and left three of six reactor buildings with no
roofs after explosions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
