The Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services
rose to the highest level in more than four weeks after Middle
East News Agency reported that the government will compensate
mobile telephone operators for service disruptions during the
popular uprising in January.  The shares gained 2.2 percent to 146.94 Egyptian pounds at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the highest level since April 27.
The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose 2.5 percent.  Egypt ’s government will pay mobile telephone operators 100
million Egypt pounds ($16.8 million) for damages incurred due to
the forced service disruption after the start of the revolt that
ended the rule of President  Hosni Mubarak ,  Mena reported , citing
Communications Minister Magued Osman.  The North African country’s oldest mobile network operator
known as Mobinil, said in February it incurred damages estimated
at between 80 million and 100 million Egyptian pounds as a
result of unrest. The losses were due to the vandalism of some
of its network stations and suspension of voice, text message
and Internet services, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
