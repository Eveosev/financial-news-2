Two protesters have been killed and
more than 80 others wounded in the Yemeni city of Taiz, south of
Sana’a, when police and armed men in plainclothes opened fire.  Four people are in a serious condition, Sadek al-Shujaa,
head of a field clinic in Taiz, said by telephone.  More than 3,000 demonstrators had rallied outside a
government building in the Cairo district to demand the release
of six protesters who were detained during a gathering on May
26, said Bushra al-Maktari, an activist. The building is near
Freedom Square, where thousands have been camped out to demand
the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  Islamist gunmen earlier today occupied government buildings
in the Yemeni coastal city of Zanjibar, amid claims that groups
such as al-Qaeda are exploiting unrest caused by anti-government
protests that began Feb. 11. The Yemeni president has refused to
sign a Western-backed power transition accord, brokered by the
six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, which provides for his
departure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
