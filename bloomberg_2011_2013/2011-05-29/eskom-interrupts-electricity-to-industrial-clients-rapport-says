Eskom Holdings Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
state-owned power utility, is interrupting power supplies to
some industrial clients during peak hours as electricity supply
fails to meet demand,  Rapport reported , citing Mike Rossouw,
chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, an industry body.  Aluminum smelters were among clients affected by the
interruptions, the newspaper said, citing Rossouw, without
naming the companies involved. Eskom last week said it wouldn’t
interrupt power supplies to consumers this winter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
