Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp., the
owner of a 12.5 percent stake in East Mediterranean Gas Co.,
dropped to the lowest level in almost two weeks after Moody’s
Midroog downgraded the debt.  The shares tumbled 3.3 percent to 4.135 shekels at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since May 16. They dropped as
much as 4.8 percent.  The company’s series A, B and C debentures were lowered two
levels to Baa3 from Baa1 with a negative outlook at Midroog and
removed from “watchlist,” according to a statement filed to
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on May 26. The securities were
downgraded because of an “increase in the risk factors” from
Ampal-American’s stake in East Mediterranean and interruptions
in supply at a pipeline that transports natural gas from  Egypt 
to  Israel , according to the statement.  Egypt’s natural-gas pipeline is expected to be fixed within
two weeks, an Egyptian Natural Gas Co. official said on May 26,
a month after an explosion that suspended exports to the
country’s eastern neighbors. East Mediterranean Gas buys gas
from Egyptian Natural Gas and ships it to Israel through an
undersea extension.  “Midroog cannot estimate the likelihood of the reoccurance
of such terror attacks,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
