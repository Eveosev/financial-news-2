(Corrects yield drop in second paragraph.)  Yields on Egyptian debt fell at an
auction of treasury bills today after Group of Eight leaders
said they would support North African economies with at least
$40 billion.  The country’s  Ministry of Finance  raised 4.975 billion
Egyptian pounds ($835 million) out of 5.5 billion pounds it
targeted at an auction of local-currency securities, according
to central bank data on Bloomberg. The average yield on the
three-month notes fell 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 11.561 percent, the lowest level in almost a month. The yield
on nine-month notes dropped less than a basis point to 12.865
percent.  Yields at the North African country’s weekly auctions of
treasury bills have been climbing as its  budget deficit  widens
in the aftermath of a revolution that ousted the government.
Group of Eight leaders said on May 27 they would provide at
least $40 billion in economic aid to North African countries,
including Egypt and  Tunisia , through a mixture of loans from
international development banks and direct aid.  “The government has done a good job of opening up to the
outside world and regaining credibility,” said Ahmed Shalaby,
head of fixed income at Cairo-based Union National Bank.
“Yields should decline from now on because of the government’s
ability to control yields at previous auctions and optimism
regarding international aid and investment in Egypt because of
its rising stature.”  The yield on  Egypt ’s 5.75 percent dollar bond due April
2020 rose 2 basis points to 5.95 percent on May 27. The pound
was unchanged at 5.957 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
