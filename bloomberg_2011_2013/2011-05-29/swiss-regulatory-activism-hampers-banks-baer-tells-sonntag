Switzerland ’s financial industry may
be hampered by regulatory “activism” that has developed since
the worldwide credit crunch,  Der Sonntag  reported, citing  Julius
Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  Chairman Raymond Baer.  Switzerland acted hastily in handling assets from Tunisia
and  Egypt  following political turmoil there, and bank-industry
stability and predictability are under threat if the country
acts too swiftly after every such event, the newspaper cited
Baer as saying in an interview. That may discourage banks from
emerging markets that are considering entering Switzerland, Baer
said, according to the newspaper.  The private bank, which is based in Zurich, meanwhile has
capital for acquisitions, and will “snap up the chance if an
institution fits with us culturally,” Sonntag cited Baer as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
