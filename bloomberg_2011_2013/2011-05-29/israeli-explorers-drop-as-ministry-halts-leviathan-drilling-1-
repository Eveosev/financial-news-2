Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP (RATIL)  and
other explorers with stakes in the Leviathan natural-gas field
off Israel’s coast declined after the Ministry of National
Infrastructures ordered a halt to drilling at the site.  Ratio, which holds a 15 percent stake in the project,
tumbled 7 percent to 0.373 shekel at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel
Aviv, the lowest level since Sept. 15. Avner Oil Exploration-LP
and Delek Drilling-LP, partners in the drilling site, lost 2.6
percent and 2.8 percent, respectively.  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) , the operator of the site, suspended
drilling operations at the Leviathan 2 appraisal well location
after water flowing to the sea floor from the wellbore was
identified, Noble said May 16.  Israel ’s oil regulator sent Noble a letter May 26 ordering
that drilling be stopped at a separate reserve at Leviathan, the
Infrastructures Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.
Continuation of drilling will be dependent upon approval of the
regulator following results of an examination of the malfunction
at Leviathan 2, the ministry said.  “The problem at the site will cause a delay in the
drilling work plan but the financial impact will be minor since
it can be expected that drilling will resume in the second
half,” Liat Glazer, an analyst at Excellence Nessuah Investment
House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan , Israel, said by telephone.  Drilling at Leviathan will resume in the second half of
this year, Noble said April 28 and reiterated May 25 in slides
posted for a UBS conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
