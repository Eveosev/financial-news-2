Tokyo Electric Power Co. may not be
able to meet its year-end deadline to bring reactors at its Dai-
Ichi nuclear plant under control,  Kyodo News  reported. The
deadline was only a target, the report quoted an unidentified
company official as saying yesterday. Since setting the
deadline, the company has said meltdowns occurred at more
rectors at the plant than previously thought. The additional
damage will delay work, the report said, citing another company
official.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
