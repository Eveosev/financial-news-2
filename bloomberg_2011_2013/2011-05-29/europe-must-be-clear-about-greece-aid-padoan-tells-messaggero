European governments have to clarify
whether they intend to extend the Greek aid plan, Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, told  Il Messaggero  in an interview.  Greece  should be able to weather the crisis by implementing
the governmentâ€™s measures within the announced timeframe, Padoan
told the newspaper, adding that a rescheduling of debt would
make sense as it would allow the economic policy to produce
visible results.  A decision must be made shortly, Padoan told Il Messaggero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
