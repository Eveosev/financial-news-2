At least seven  oil tankers  belonging
to Israeli billionaire Sammy Ofer docked at an Iranian port
between 2004 and 2010, Calcalist said, based on its own
investigation.  The U.S. State Department announced May 24 it had imposed
sanctions on the Ofer Brothers Group for violating restrictions
on doing business with Iran by selling it an oil tanker. The
Ofer Brothers denied selling Iran any ships in an e-mailed
statement.  The ships that docked in Iran belonged to Ofer-owned Tanker
Pacific of  Singapore , Calcalist said.  Unidentified Ofer
“associates” told Calcalist that no laws prohibited the
tankers from docking in Iran. A message left on the office phone
of an Israeli spokeswoman for Ofer went unaswered.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
