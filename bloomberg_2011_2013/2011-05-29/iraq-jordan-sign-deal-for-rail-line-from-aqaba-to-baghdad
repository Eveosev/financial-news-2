Jordan and  Iraq  signed a Memorandum
of Understanding for a rail line linking the Jordanian Red Sea
port of Aqaba with the Iraqi capital of  Baghdad , Petra said,
citing Jordanian Transport Minister Muhannad Qudah.  The agreement for a line that would provide passenger and
cargo services was signed by Qudah and visiting Iraqi Transport
Minister Hadi al-Ameri in Amman today, the Jordanian official
agency said. There were no further details on the project. Those
will be decided later by a joint committee, Petra said.  Jordan has plans for a $3.1 billion rail network running
950 kilometers (590 miles) to connect the kingdom with Syria,
Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The kingdom is due to start the first
bids for the project by the end of June, Qudah said April 11.  Jordan’s government will provide 370 million dinars ($522
million) for the project and potential lenders include the  World
Bank , European Investment Bank, France’s state-run Agence
Francaise de Developpement, the  Islamic Development Bank , the
Saudi Fund for Development, the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic
Development, the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and
Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
