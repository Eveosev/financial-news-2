Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation that acreage will decline in the U.S. after wet
weather delayed planting.  Twenty-three of 29 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to  Chicago  on May 27 said corn will rise, and 21 of 30
respondents forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week, futures for
July delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade closed down less
than 0.2 percent, with corn at $7.585 a bushel and soybeans at
$13.7975 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s declines in corn and soybeans were a surprise
to the majority of analysts surveyed on May 20.  Bullish on corn: 23    Bullish on soybeans: 21
Bearish on corn:  6    Bearish on soybeans:  9  To contact the reporter on this story:
