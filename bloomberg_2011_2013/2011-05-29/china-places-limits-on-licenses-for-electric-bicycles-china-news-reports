China ’s provinces and municipalities
have stopped issuing licenses for electric bicycles that exceed
government speed and weight standards, the China News Service
reported yesterday, without saying where it got the information.  Electric bicycles aren’t allowed to be able to travel
faster than 20 kilometers (12 miles) an hour and must weigh no
more than 40 kilograms (88 pounds), according to standards
issued by China’s Standardization Administration in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
