Georges Tron, a junior minister for
the civil service in French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
government, resigned today after two women filed complaints of
sexual harassment.  His resignation “does not presume the outcome of the
investigation into the complaints filed against Georges Tron and
which he disputes,” an e-mailed statement from Prime Minister
Francois Fillon said.  Tron was a member of Budget Minister  Francois Baroin ’s
cabinet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
