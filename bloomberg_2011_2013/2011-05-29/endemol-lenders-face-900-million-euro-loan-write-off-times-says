Lenders to Endemol NV may be forced
to write off 900 million euros ($1.23 billion) of loans to the
company amid a financial restructuring, the  Sunday Times 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Lenders including  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  may be offered 49 percent of Endemol in return for
forgiving between 30 percent and 50 percent of their loans, the
newspaper said.  The lenders will press Endemol shareholders, including
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Mediaset SpA, to inject more equity
into the company if they want to retain control, the Times
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
