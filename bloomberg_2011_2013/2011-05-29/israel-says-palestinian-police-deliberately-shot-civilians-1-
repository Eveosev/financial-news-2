Israel ’s army said an investigation
found that Palestinian police fired “deliberately and with
intention to harm,” on Israeli civilians who arrived at a holy
site in the  West Bank  city of Nablus on April 24.  “The Palestinian officers who opened fire did so in an
unwarranted manner as there was no imminent and impending danger
to their lives,” a statement from the army spokesman’s office
said. It added that the Jewish worshippers had failed to
coordinate their visit as required and that the military “looks
severely upon Israelis who put their lives in jeopardy.”  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the
shooting a “criminal act” and demanded that the  Palestinian
Authority  take “harsh steps” against those responsible. The
shooting, which resulted in the death of a nephew of Israeli
Minister of Culture and Sport Limor Livnat, took place amid
rising tensions in the West Bank and followed the March stabbing
to death of an Israeli family in their settlement home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
