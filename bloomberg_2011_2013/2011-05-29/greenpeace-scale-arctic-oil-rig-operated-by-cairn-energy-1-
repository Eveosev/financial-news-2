Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  said Greenpeace
activists who have scaled an oil rig managed by the company have
had “no impact on operations.”  The protesters are hanging from the underside of the 53,000
tonne Leiv Eiriksson in an Arctic survival pod with enough food
and water for 10 days, Greenpeace said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The group is situated a few meters from the drill-bit in a
bid to prevent the rig starting deep-water drilling west of the
 Greenland  coast, the organization said.  Cairn confirmed that a group of protesters had boarded the
rig. It said the semi-submersible Leiv Eiriksson is due to take
part in Cairn’s exploration program off Greenland, where the
company is operating at the invitation of the government.  “Cairn respects the rights of individuals and
organizations to express their views in a safe and peaceful
manner but would be concerned with any action that presents a
risk to the safety of people and/or equipment,” the company
said in an e-mailed statement. “Wherever it is active, Cairn
seeks to operate in a safe and prudent manner.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
