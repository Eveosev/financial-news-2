Oil fluctuated in  New York  as
speculation that fuel demand will increase after the start of
the U.S. summer driving season countered concern that the
economy of the world’s biggest crude consumer is slowing.  Futures rose as much as 0.2 percent and fell as much as 0.2
percent. The peak U.S. demand period for gasoline starts after
today’s Memorial Day holiday and ends on Labor Day in early
September. Employers probably hired fewer workers in May and
manufacturing cooled, economists said before reports this week.  “The market will start to focus on the drive-time period
in the U.S., where there’s the expectation of an increase in
demand,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity
Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted oil will average
$100 this year. “The employment data will be the key this week
to really see what’s happening.”  Crude for July delivery was at $100.56 a barrel, down 3
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:48 p.m. Sydney time. The contract gained 36 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $100.59 on May 27, the highest settlement since May
25. The front-month contract climbed 1.1 percent last week and
is 36 percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for July settlement was at $114.94 a barrel, down
9 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract slipped 2 cents to $115.03 on May 27 and rose 2.4
percent over the week.  Gasoline Demand  The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$14.38 a barrel to U.S. futures on May 27. The difference
between front-month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a
record $19.54 on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  Gasoline prices in the U.S. have climbed for six straight
sessions and increased 5.3 percent last week, the first weekly
gain this month.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in crude-oil futures in the week ended
May 24, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Managed-money bets in futures and options combined that
prices will rise outnumbered short positions by 225,677 futures,
the Washington-based regulator said in its weekly Commitments of
Traders report. Net long positions increased by 4,112 contracts,
or 1.86 percent, from a week earlier.  Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said in an interview on CNN
yesterday that an oil price of $70 to $80 a barrel is in the
best interests of the kingdom because it diminishes the urgency
in the U.S. and  Europe  to develop alternative energy sources.  U.S. Economy  A Labor Department report on June 3 may show payrolls rose
185,000 after a 244,000 gain in April, according to a Bloomberg
News survey. Other reports may show manufacturing expanded at
the slowest pace in seven months and factory orders fell.  Consumer spending  in the U.S. rose 0.4 percent last month,
missing economists’ estimates, as food and fuel prices
increased, the Commerce Department said May 27.  Brent has advanced 21 percent this year as unrest in the
 Middle East  and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia and
 Egypt  and spread to  Libya , Iran and Syria. Libya’s rebels are
unlikely to resume crude production from territory under their
control for “some time,” Reuters reported yesterday, citing
Ali Tarhouni, the dissidents’ oil and finance minister.  Yemeni security forces set fire to the tents of protesters
in Freedom Square in Taiz, while army helicopters in  Syria  fired
on anti-government demonstrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
