UBS AG (UBSN) , the biggest Swiss bank, hired
Albert Momdjian for a senior position at its emerging wealth
management division, two people familiar with the matter said.  Momdjian will be based in Dubai, said one of the people,
declining to be identified because the matter is private. A
spokeswoman for UBS in London couldnâ€™t immediately be reached
for comment.  Momdjian was previously the head of investment banking for
the Middle East and North Africa at  Credit Agricole SA. (ACA)   Reuters reported the story earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
