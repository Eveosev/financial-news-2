Ireland may need an additional
emergency loan from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund , the  Sunday Times  reported, citing an interview
with Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar.  Ireland was unlikely to be able to fund itself in the
government bond markets next year and may struggle to do so in
2013, the Times quoted Varadkar as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
