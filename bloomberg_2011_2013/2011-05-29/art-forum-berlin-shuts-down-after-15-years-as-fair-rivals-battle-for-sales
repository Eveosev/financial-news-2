Art Forum Berlin, a contemporary art
fair that took place annually for 15 years, has ceased
operations and this year’s event, which was scheduled to open on
Sept. 29, has been called off, the organizer said.  Negotiations to merge  Art Forum  with a rival event, Art
Berlin Contemporary, broke off on May 27 after the two parties
failed to agree on a division of roles,  Messe Berlin GmbH , the
owner of Art Forum Berlin, said in a May 28 e-mailed statement.  “For an art event, the value of Messe Berlin’s input comes
from its organizational abilities,” Christian Goeke, the
executive director of Messe Berlin, said in the statement. “If
these are not desired, there is no basis for cooperation.”  Last year, 110 galleries from 18 countries showed works by
more than 2,000 artists at Art Forum, which took place in the
main exhibition halls of the Berlin Messe complex. The fair
attracted about 40,000 visitors annually. In 2008, two new co-
directors, Eva-Maria Haeusler and Peter Vetsch, were drafted in
from Art Basel, the world’s biggest contemporary art fair.  ABC, or  Art Berlin Contemporary , was set up about four
years ago by Berlin art dealers who also organized an open-house
Gallery Weekend that takes place in the spring. This year’s fair
is scheduled to take place from Sept. 7 to 11 and will focus on
painting, according to the website.  “It would be counterproductive to stage Art Forum Berlin
2011 without the support of those for whom we are organizing
it,” Goeke said in the statement.  To contact the writer on the story:
