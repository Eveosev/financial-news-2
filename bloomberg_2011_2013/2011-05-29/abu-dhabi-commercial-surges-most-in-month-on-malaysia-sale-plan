Abu Dhabi  Commercial Bank surged the
most in a month after the Star reported the lender is expected
to hold a board meeting on May 31 to asses bidders for its 25
percent stake in Malaysian bank RHB Capital Bhd.  The shares climbed 2.6 percent, the most since April 28, to
2.79 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Abu Dhabi.  The decision on the stake sale may be made after the
meeting, the Malayasian The Star newspaper reported, citing
people it didnâ€™t identify. Bidders for the stake are mostly non-
Malaysian banks and private equity firms, the report said.  An official for ADCB, who declined to be identified because
of company policy, confirmed the board meeting. He declined to
disclose its agenda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
