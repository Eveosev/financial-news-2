Denmark will borrow less this year
than previously estimated as the Nordic economy cuts its
reliance on funding to bridge its budget deficit, the
government, which prepares for elections, said in a report.  Denmark’s 2011 financing need will be about 3 billion
kroner ($575 million) lower than estimated in December at 149
billion kroner, the Copenhagen-based ministry said late
yesterday on its  website . The domestic financing need will be
112 billion kroner, it said.  Denmark will post the widest budget deficit in the Nordic
region this year at 4.3 percent of gross domestic product on
debt of 47.5 percent, the European Commission has estimated.
Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen’s government, which has to
hold general elections no later than November, will later today
publish new forecasts for the country’s budget deficit and for
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
