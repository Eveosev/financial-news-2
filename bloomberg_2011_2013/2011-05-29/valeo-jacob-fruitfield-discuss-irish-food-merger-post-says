Irish biscuit maker Jacob Fruitfield
and Valeo Foods are in merger discussions,  the Sunday Business

to take over Jacob Fruitfield, the Dublin-based newspaper said.
A merger of the two private Irish companies would create an
entity with sales of 300 million euros ($430 million), the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
