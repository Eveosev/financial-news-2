The leader of the Georgian separatist
region of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh  died in a Moscow hospital,
 Georgia ’s Imedi TV station said, citing Russian news agencies.  Doctors decided to turn off his life support machine this
morning and he will be buried in his homeland this week, the
station reported.  Bagapsh won a second term as president of the separatist
Georgian region of Abkhazia in a 2009 election that was
condemned by the Georgian government.  Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia after a war in
the early 1990s following the collapse of the  Soviet Union . In
August 2008, Russia routed Georgia’s army in a war over another
breakaway region, South Ossetia, then recognized both regions’
independence and agreed to defend their borders. Georgia
considers both regions part of its territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
