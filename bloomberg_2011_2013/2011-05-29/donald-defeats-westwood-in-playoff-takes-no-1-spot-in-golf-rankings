England’s Luke Donald beat  Lee Westwood  in a playoff today to win the BMW PGA Championship and
replace his countryman as No. 1 in the  Official World Golf
Ranking .  The pair finished tied on 6-under-par after the final round
at Wentworth near London, with the 33-year-old Donald taking 
the title at the first extra hole.  Donald will become the 15th player to hold the top spot.
Tiger Woods’s five-year reign atop the standings ended on Nov. 1
when  he was replaced by Westwood -- the first European to head the
list since  Nick Faldo  in 1994. Since then, Germany’s  Martin Kaymer  has also held top spot.  Donald, who collects a check for 750,000 euros ($1.1
million) to extend his lead on the European Tour’s Race to
Dubai, had a birdie four on the playoff hole as Westwood carded
a double-bogey seven after hitting his third shot into the
water.  Westwood had made up two shots in the final round to move
into a tie for the lead. Donald, playing in the group behind his
rival, missed a 30-foot putt on the final hole to leave them
both on 278.  Simon Dyson of  England  took third spot, finishing on 4-
under, with Australia’s Marcus Fraser, France’s Raphael
Jacquelin and Shane Lowry of Ireland on 2-under. Kaymer was tied
for 31st on 4-over.  It was Donald’s sixth European Tour title and second this
season after February’s Match Play Championship in Arizona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
