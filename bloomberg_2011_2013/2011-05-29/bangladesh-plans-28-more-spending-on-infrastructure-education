Bangladesh  announced a plan to raise
spending to develop infrastructure, education and health
services by 28 percent in the financial year starting July 1 as
it seeks to lift more than half its population out of poverty.  The south Asian nation plans to spend 460 billion taka
($6.3 billion), of which 251.8 billion taka, or 55 percent, will
be its own money, Planning Minister A.K. Khandker told reporters
today in Dhaka. The rest will come from foreign aid, he said.  Bangladesh ranks 130 out of 139 countries for its network
of roads, power and ports, behind  East Timor  and Burundi,
according to the  World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Report 2010 . The paucity of power alone slows growth by one
percentage point every year, the central bank said in March.  The budget will help fund 1,039 projects in the next
financial year, with 962 of them carried over from the previous
year, Khandker said. The National Economic Council has allocated
18 percent, or 82.86 billion taka, of the budget for power, oil
and natural resources, the minister said.  “The planned increase in spending is justified on the
ground of economic needs and political commitments and the
problem often lies with the huge number of projects,” said
Ahsan Mansur, executive director of Dhaka-based Policy Research
Institute.  Japan , Bangladesh’s largest aid donor, will lend the nation
about $670 million for projects including building a bridge that
will help boost annual economic growth by half a percentage
point, the Japan International Cooperation Agency said in a May
18 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
