Iran ’s parliament approved the
outlines of a bill to impose travel and financial restrictions
on 26 U.S. officials, whom it accuses of being involved in
"human rights violations,"  Mehr  reported.  The bill would also call for the officials to be tried on
charges of “crimes against humanity” and “human rights
abuses,” Kazem Jalali, the parliament’s National Security and
Foreign Policy Committee spokesman said, according to a report
published yesterday by the state-run news agency, which didn’t
specify the names.  Iran’s prosecutor general would submit the names and
relevant documents to the prosecutor of the  International
Criminal Court , Mehr said. Iran’s Foreign Ministry will be in
charge of following up on the implementation of the proceedings
at international forums, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
