The  International Monetary Fund  is
still working with  Greece  to review its efforts to meet fiscal
targets, a spokeswoman for the IMF said today.  The “discussions with the authorities continue, are making
good progress and are expected to conclude soon,” Conny Lotze,
a Washington-based IMF spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Greek
television channel Mega and German magazine  Der Spiegel  reported
yesterday that the inspection had found Greece to have missed
its targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
