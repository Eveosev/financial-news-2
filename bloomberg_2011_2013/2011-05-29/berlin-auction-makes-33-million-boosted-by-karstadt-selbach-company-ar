Villa Grisebach Auktionen GmbH raised
23 million euros ($33 million) in its Berlin spring auctions
with art from the collections of department-store company
 Arcandor AG (ARO)  and fashion retailer Dolf Selbach.  The total value in the May 26-28 sales represented an
increase of 65 percent from the previous year’s auctions,  Villa
Grisebach  said in a statement sent by e-mail. The highest price
for a single artwork was 1 million euros paid by a private New
York buyer for  Lucio Fontana ’s “Concetto Spaziale” from
Selbach’s collection, the auction house said.  “Never before were there so many international bidders in
the auction room and on the telephone,” the statement said.  Arcandor, the former owner of the Karstadt chain of
department stores, sold 114 artworks from its collection in the
Villa Grisebach sale. The company filed for insolvency in 2009.  Top lots from the insolvent retailer’s collection included
Ernst Wilhelm Nay’s 1960 oil painting “Chromatische Scheiben”
(Chromatic Disks), which a Berlin private collector bought for
915,000 euros, twice the previous highest price for the artist,
the auction house said.  An outdoor sculpture by Norbert Kricke was bought by a
private Rhineland collector for 488,000 euros. Most of the works
were by German artists of the 1950s and 1960s.  Selbach, who died last year, opened his first exclusive
men’s fashion store in Dusseldorf in 1957, followed by shops in
Berlin and Hamburg. His collection fetched 5.6 million euros in
the sale, double the estimate. A southern German museum paid
719,800 euros for a painting by Fernando Botero from Selbach’s
collection.  To contact the writer on the story:
