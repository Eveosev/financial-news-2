Saudi Arabian Airlines, the state-
owned carrier known as Saudia, aims to complete a privatization
plan that has been ongoing since 2006 by the second quarter of
2013, a company executive said.  “We have suffered many delays due to the size of the
airlines and the many activities we are involved in, however
these delays are natural,” Abdullah al-Ajhar, vice president of
public relations, said in response to e-mailed questions,
declining to elaborate on the causes.  The airline appointed international consultants to speed up
the process, al-Ajhar said, without naming the companies.
Privatizing the state-owned carrier’s catering, cargo, ground
services, aviation academy and maintenance units was initially
scheduled for completion last year.  The privatization of catering and cargo is complete, while
the ground services unit is expected to be finished by year-end,
he said.  The company is preparing for the privatization of its core
unit by modernizing its fleet and developing its technical
infrastructure, said al-Ajhar. It is presenting a proposal to
the country’s Supreme Economic Council to finish the process, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
