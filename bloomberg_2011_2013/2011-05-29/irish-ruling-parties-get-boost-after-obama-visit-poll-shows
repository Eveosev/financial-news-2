Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny’s
Fine Gael party’s support rose to a record 41 percent, the
Sunday Business Post reported today, citing a poll by Red C
Research & Marketing Ltd.  Support for Fine Gael was 2 points higher than a month
earlier after the visits of U.S. President  Barack Obama  and the
British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, to Ireland this month. The
 Labour Party , which formed a coalition government with Fine Gael
in March, was 1 point higher at 19 percent in the poll.  Red C interviewed 1,000 people across the country between
May 24 and May 26, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
