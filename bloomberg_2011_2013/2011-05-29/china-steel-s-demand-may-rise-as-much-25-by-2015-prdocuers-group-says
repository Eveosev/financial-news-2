Steel demand in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer, may rise by as much as a quarter by 2015
compared with demand last year, according to a projection from
the China Iron & Steel Association, which represents producers.  Consumption may increase between 12 percent and 25 percent
from the level in 2010 to as much as 750 million metric tons in
2015,  Luo Bingsheng , deputy party secretary of the  association ,
which is known as CISA, said at a conference in  Shanghai  today.  In the past 30 years, China’s economy has expanded on
average by 10 percent a year as it overhauled state-owned
companies and allowed more foreign investment, boosting demand
for commodities from  iron ore  to copper and coal. Iron ore is
the principal raw material used to make steel.  China’s steel production in 2011 will exceed 680 million
tons, Li Xinchuang, deputy secretary-general at CISA, said at
the conference today. That estimate is based on a forecast that
 China’s economy  will grow by more than 9 percent, he said.  CISA has suggested that the Shanghai Futures Exchange list
futures for medium-to-thick steel strips so producers and users
can hedge price risks, Luo said, without elaborating. About 43
percent of the steel that’s made in China is distributed by
traders, which make prices more volatile, he said.  The pace of growth in China’s steel demand may ease to 2.6
percent from 4.6 percent annually through 2015 as the economy
slows, the association said in April. China’s apparent steel
consumption, which includes metal for stockpiles, averaged 17
percent a year from 2006 to 2010, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on figures from the CISA’s website.  Raw-Material Costs  The aggregate profit at China’s 77 largest steelmakers fell
2.1 percent to 32.9 billion yuan ($5.1 billion) in the first
four months of this year from a year ago, Luo said. The average
margin was only 2.9 percent because of high raw-material costs,
Luo said.  These mills generated combined profit of 90 billion yuan
last year, Luo Tiejun, deputy head of the raw-material
department of the Ministry of Industry and  Information
Technology , said at the conference. Baosteel Group Corp.,
China’s second-biggest mill by output, accounted for 26 percent
of the profit, MIIT’s Luo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
