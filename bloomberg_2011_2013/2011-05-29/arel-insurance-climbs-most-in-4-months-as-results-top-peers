Harel Insurance Investments &
Financial Services Ltd. (HARL) , Israel’s third-largest insurer by
market value, rose the most in almost four months on results DS
Securities & Investments Ltd. said were better than peers.  The shares increased 4.2 percent, the most since Feb. 6, to
185.10 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  “Results were excellent relative to other companies,”
Meir Slater, an analyst at Tel Aviv-based DS Securities, said by
telephone.  Profit at Israeli insurers fell as capital markets
deteriorated and inflation accelerated. The benchmark Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange lost 0.4 percent the first quarter, while
inflation accelerated 0.7 percent over the same period.  First-quarter net income fell to 109.6 million shekels from
181.5 million shekels, Harel said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
