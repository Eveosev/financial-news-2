Benin President Thomas Boni Yayi
appointed a scaled-back cabinet of 26 ministers, including eight
women and 21 new appointees, completing his government’s
formation as his second term begins.  Adidjatou Mathys will become finance minister following her
work as a top aide to her predecessor, Government General
Secretary Edouard Ouin Ouro said today in a statement on
national television. Marcel de Souza, who was Boni Yayi’s
spokesman during the presidential campaign, will become economy
and development minister.  The appointments reduce the number of cabinet seats from 30
ministries previously, a move the government said on May 27 was
aimed at cutting costs, while increasing the number of female
members from four. Boni Yayi was sworn in on April 6 following
an election in March whose results were later contested by
opposition-candidate supporters.  The president’s Forces Couris pour un Benin Emergent party
and allied groups won control of parliament in an election on
April 30.  The new mineral and power minister will be Jonas Gbian
while Madina Sefou will take over the trade, industry and small
and medium-size enterprises ministry. Blaise Ahanhanzo-Glele, an
who is mayor of the historic city of Abomey, will become the new
minister of environment and urban planning, the single
opposition-party member of the cabinet.  “The opposition is well represented in the government as
the concern of the president is to construct a united and
prosperous country,” Ouin Ouro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
