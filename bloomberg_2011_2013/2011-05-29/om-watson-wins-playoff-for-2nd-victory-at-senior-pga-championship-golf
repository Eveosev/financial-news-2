Tom Watson  won the  Senior PGA
Championship  in a playoff over David Eger for his sixth major
title on golf’s Champions Tour.  Watson made a five-foot (1.5 meter) birdie putt on the
first extra hole at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville,  Kentucky ,
to capture his second Senior PGA Championship. His first came in
2001.  Watson, 61, is the second-oldest winner of the tournament
after 62-year-old Jock Hutchinson in 1947. Watson receives
$360,000 for his 14th victory on the  Champions Tour , which is
for golfers age 50 and over.  “This is what I’m out here to do, to compete and try to
win,” Watson, who had eight major titles among his 39 U.S. PGA
Tour victories, said in a televised interview. “Today it was a
struggle, but I made a couple key putts on the back nine. It was
a good day and I played well for most of the week.”  Eger, 59, shot a 5-under-par 67 during the final round, yet
missed a 5-foot putt on the 18th hole that would have given him
the outright lead. Watson shot a final-round 70 and tied with
Eger at 10-under for the tournament, one shot better than
Kiyoshi Murota of  Japan .  The Senior PGA Championship is the second of five majors on
the Champions Tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
