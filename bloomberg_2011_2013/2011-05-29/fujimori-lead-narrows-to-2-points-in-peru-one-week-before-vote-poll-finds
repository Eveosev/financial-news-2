Peruvian Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori
saw her lead narrow over her opponent Ollanta Humala in the
latest presidential polls a week before a runoff vote.  Fujimori had 41 percent support in the poll compared with
43 percent a week earlier, according to Ipsos  Apoyo , a Lima-
based research company. Ex-army officer Humala was unchanged at
39 percent. The survey of 1,990 people, which was published
today by daily El Comercio, was taken May 21-27 and had a margin
of error 2.2 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
