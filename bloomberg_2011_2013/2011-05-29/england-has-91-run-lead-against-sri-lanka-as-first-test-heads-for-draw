The first cricket Test between
 England  and Sri Lanka is heading for a draw after England
finished day four at 491-5 in its first innings.  The hosts lead Sri Lanka by 91 runs ahead of the final day
of a rain-affected match in Cardiff after a double-century from
 Jonathan Trott .  “You try and work as hard as you can in the nets and take
your opportunities when you can,” Trott told Sky Sports.  England, which has won five and tied three of its 11 home
Test matches against Sri Lanka, started the day on 287-2 chasing
its opponent’s 400 all out.  Trott and Alastair Cook had posted centuries yesterday to
help their team recover from 47-2. Cook added only four runs
today before top-edging to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off
the bowling of Farveez Maharoof for 133.  Trott, who went on to make 203 runs, was bowled by captain
Tillakaratne Dilshan.  Kevin Pietersen  was trapped lbw by Rangana
Herath for 3.  Ian Bell is unbeaten on 98, with Eoin Morgan on 14.  The teams are scheduled to play three Tests, a Twenty20
match, and five one-day internationals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
