Manchester United  and Chelsea are
prepared to triple the wages of Croatia midfielder Luka Modric
to tempt him to leave Tottenham, the News of the World reported.  Modric, 25, would cost about 30 million pounds ($49.5
million), with both clubs ready to pay him 130,000 pounds-a-week
wages, the newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information.  United, the Premier League soccer champion, is set to sell
striker Dimitar Berbatov, the News of the World added. Tottenham
and Borussia Dortmund have been linked with moves for the
Bulgarian, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
