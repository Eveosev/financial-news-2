India ’s  monsoon , which accounts for
more than 70 percent of annual rainfall, reached the mainland in
southern Kerala and  Tamil Nadu  states two days earlier than
forecast, aiding the timely sowing of rice, sugar cane and
cotton crops.  Conditions are favorable for the further advance of rains
into the rest of Kerala, and they are likely to reach the state
of Karnataka in the next two to three days, the  India
Meteorological Department  said in a  statement  today. The bureau
forecast on May 13 that rains would reach Kerala on May 31.  Monsoonal rains are critical to the South Asian nation,
where farming accounts for as much as a fifth of the economy. A
bumper harvest of rice, corn, sugar, oilseeds and lentils may
help Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tame inflation that’s the
highest among  Asia ’s major economies.  Rains this year may be 98 percent of the 50-year  average ,
the  India Meteorological Department  said on April 19. The
monsoon typically sets over the southern Kerala state by the
first week of June, before blanketing the entire nation by July
15.  Sowing of monsoon crops in India begins in June and
harvesting starts in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
