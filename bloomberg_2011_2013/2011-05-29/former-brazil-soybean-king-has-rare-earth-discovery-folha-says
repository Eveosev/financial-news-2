Former Brazilian “soybean king”
Olacyr de Moraes found a rare-earth deposit in the northeast of
the country that may be bigger than current reserves in China
and  Kazakhstan , Folha de S.Paulo reported.  The deposit in  Brazil ’s state of Bahia contains at least
60,000 kilograms (132,300 pounds) of thallium, a rare-earth used
in superconductive cables, the newspaper said, citing a director
at Moraes’s company, Itaoeste. The company estimates that the
reserve would meet the world’s demand for six years, Folha said.  Moraes, 80, was the world’s biggest individual soybean
producer during the 1970s before losing a significant part of
his fortune, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
