A western Chinese city fired the
local family planning bureau chief and punished other officials
after a woman was forced to abort her seven-month-old fetus.  The officials in the Zhenping region of Ankang city
violated  China ’s family planning laws in the case of Feng
Jianmei, 23, the Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday. Feng’s
family has also been offered compensation, it said.  Feng’s case sparked public outrage after photos appeared
online showing her lying next to the aborted fetus. She was
forced to have the abortion after she couldn’t pay a 40,000  yuan 
($6,200) fine to have a second baby under the country’s one-
child policy.  “Some staff of the township government used crude means to
violate her intentions,” Xinhua said, adding that there was
“no legal basis” to demand the 40,000 yuan payment.  Feng said in an interview yesterday that she was not being
allowed to leave a hospital where she’s recovering and feels
“under a lot of pressure,” the  New York  Times reported today.
The newspaper quoted her sister-in-law as saying Feng’s husband
was beaten last week when he tried to see a human rights lawyer
in Beijing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
