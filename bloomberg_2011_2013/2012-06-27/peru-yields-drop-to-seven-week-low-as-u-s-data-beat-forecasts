Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
to a seven-week low, as U.S. economic reports beat forecasts,
boosting demand for the South American nation’s assets.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.02 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That was the lowest yield on a closing basis since
May 4. The bond’s price increased 0.05 centimo to 118.50
centimos per sol.  “With U.S. rates very, very low, many real money investors
are looking for opportunities in the emerging-market space,”
said  Diego Donadio , a  Latin America  strategist at BNP Paribas in
Sao Paulo. Peru is one of the most attractive debt markets in
Latin America for investors pulling out of recession-hit
countries on the European periphery such as Spain, he said.  U.S. equities rallied as reports showed more Americans than
economist forecast signed contracts in May to purchase
previously owned homes. Orders for durable goods climbed last
month more than projected.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6635 per  U.S. dollar  at today’s
close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The central
bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot market  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
