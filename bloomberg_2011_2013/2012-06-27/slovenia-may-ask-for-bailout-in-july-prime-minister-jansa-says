Slovenia may ask for an
international bailout if lawmakers fail to adopt legislation
next month that would limit public spending, Prime Minister
 Janez Jansa  said in an interview with a local radio station.  “July will be the moment of truth since parliament will
vote on the golden fiscal rule and on changes to the way
referendums are organized,” Jansa was quoted as saying in an
interview with Koper-based  Radio Ognjisce . “If we continue to
get more and more debt, we will see a Greek scenario here and
this generation will have to pay dearly for the stupidity of
those that have delayed decisions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
