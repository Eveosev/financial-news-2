Macau’s tourism office said it
hasn’t received any notice of China tightening visa rules a day
after Hong Kong-traded casinos dropped on speculation of
restrictions on tourists from the mainland.  Casino operators including Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd.
and  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  fell yesterday following a Macau Daily
report that growth in the number of mainland visitors may have
slowed as the Guangdong local government could be tightening
rules on issuing visas.  Visitors from the mainland drove casino revenue up 42
percent last year in the only city in China where casinos are
legal, pushing up earnings at Macau operators. About 16 million
mainland Chinese visited the world’s largest gambling hub in
2011.  “We have not received any notice on China tightening visa
issuance to visitors traveling to Macau,” Gigi Chiu,
spokeswoman for the Macau Government Tourist Office said by e-
mail.  Chinese nationals need visas to go to  Hong Kong  and Macau,
which are special administrative regions.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said they called
several offices of China’s Division of Exit and Entry
Administration Department, which handles visa issuance.  “Based on their responses we are not aware of any change
in visa application process or timing,” analyst Billy Ng said
in a June 26 note to clients.  Sands China rose 1.8 percent to HK$23.10 at a 4 p.m. close
in Hong Kong.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  climbed 3.5
percent,  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  advanced 2.3 percent,  MGM China
Holdings Ltd. (2282)  gained 1.2 percent and  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  rose 1.3
percent.  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  fell 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
