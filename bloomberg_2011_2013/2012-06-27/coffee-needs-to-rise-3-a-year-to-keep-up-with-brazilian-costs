Arabica coffee prices would need to
climb by 3 percent a year to keep up with the rising cost of
production in  Brazil , the worldâ€™s largest producer, according to
independent analyst Neil Rosser.  Prices of robusta beans would have to rise 11 percent a
year to keep up with climbing production costs in  Vietnam , the
biggest grower of the variety, London-based Rosser, who has
covered coffee for more than 20 years and was a managing
director for the statistical unit of Hamburg-based Neumann
Gruppe GmbH, said at a conference in Geneva today.  The cost of producing coffee in Brazil is 330 reais ($159)
to 370 reais a bag, according to Rosser. In Vietnam, the cost of
production is 32,500 dong ($1.50) a kilogram, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
