Oil gained in  New York , erasing
losses and trading below $80 a barrel for a fifth day as
disruptions to Norway’s output and a possible shortfall from
 Iran  offset concern that use is ebbing amid Europe’s debt woes.  Futures rose as much 0.5 percent after Norwegian fields
closed in a labor dispute and as the European Union prepares
additional sanctions on Iran’s energy industry. Iranian exports
will fall “gradually” fall during maintenance on fields and
reservoirs and as the EU embargo takes effect starting July 1,
Deputy Oil Minister Ahmad Qalebani said yesterday. EU leaders
will begin a two-day summit meeting tomorrow to address the
bloc’s debt crisis.  Oil for August delivery rose as much as 42 cents to $79.78
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and traded at $78.64 at 8:19 a.m. local time. Crude
recovered earlier losses of as much as 0.9 percent. Prices have
fallen more than 22 percent this quarter, the biggest drop since
the final three months of 2008.  “Markets in general are in a ‘wait-and-see’ mode and
skewed toward the bearish side,” Filip Petersson, a commodity
strategist at Stockholm-based SEB AB, said by telephone today.
“Everything is driven by the EU summit,” he said. Supply
disruptions in Norway and potential cuts in Iranian exports may
provide “support elements in the medium term.”  Brent oil for August settlement gained 2 cents to $93.04 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
