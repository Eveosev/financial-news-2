Patrizia Immobilien AG (P1Z) , which led
Germany’s biggest real-estate acquisition this year, may bid for
Bayerische Landesbank’s property unit if it’s offered to private
investors.  Patrizia is interested in GBW Gruppe, which owns about
32,000 apartments, spokesman Andreas Menke said by telephone
today. So far, BayernLB has only considered offers from Bavarian
municipalities.  “A consortium of insurers and pension funds would be the
ideal owner for that kind of apartment portfolio,” Menke said
in an e-mail. Patrizia buys property after pooling funds from
groups of investors.  In February, BayernLB agreed to hold exclusive talks with
the municipalities on the sale of GBW Gruppe. The European
Union’s antitrust authority is expected to force the banks to
seek bids from private investors as well, according to people
familiar with the process.  Patrizia in February led a group that paid 1.4 billion
euros ($1.8 billion) for Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg’s real
estate unit. The purchase of LBBW Immobilien GmbH’s 21,000
apartments was  Germany ’s biggest property deal since 2008.  Patrizia was little changed at 4.51 euros at 10:56 a.m. The
stock has climbed 32 percent this year, while the SDAX index for
small companies has gained 7 percent.  Reuters reported earlier that Patrizia may bid for the
asset.
