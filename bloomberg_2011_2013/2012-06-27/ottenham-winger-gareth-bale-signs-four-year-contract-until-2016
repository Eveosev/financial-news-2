Tottenham winger Gareth Bale signed
a new four-year contract, the Premier League club said on its
 website .  Bale’s deal runs through 2016. The 22-year-old has been
linked in U.K. media reports with several clubs, including
Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester City, following
Tottenham’s failure to qualify for the  Champions League  and the
departure of coach  Harry Redknapp .  “The club is progressing and I want to be a part of that,
so it was great to get the deal done,” Bale, who joined
Tottenham from Southampton in 2007, said.  Bale scored 12 goals last season as Spurs finished fourth
in the Premier League. The club missed out on the Champions
League after Chelsea won the competition to secure England’s
final qualifying place.  “I’ve been here for five years now and I’ve enjoyed every
minute,” Bale said. “We’ve a good young squad and we need to
work together to get back on the biggest stage again.”  Tottenham played in the Champions League for the first time
in 2010-11 with Bale scoring a hat trick in a group match
against then defending champion  Inter Milan  in Italy. He was
also named the Premier League’s top young player that season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
