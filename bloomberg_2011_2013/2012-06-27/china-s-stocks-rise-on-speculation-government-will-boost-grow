China ’s stocks rose for the first
time in six days on speculation the government will ease
monetary policy and increase fiscal spending to prevent the
economy from slowing any further.  The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.1 percent
to 2,225.10 at 9:51 a.m. local time, with three stocks gaining
for every one dropping. The CSI 300 Index added 0.3 percent to
2,461.03, led by technology and health-care stocks. Daiwa
Securities Group Inc.,  Japan ’s second-largest brokerage, lowered
its growth forecast for China, becoming the third brokerage in
as many days to do so.  “You’re going to see more monetary as well as fiscal
easing,” said Joseph Tanious, who helps oversee $394 billion as
a market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in  New York . “There’s
reason to be cautiously optimistic that growth will pick up in
the back half of this year, which should translate into higher
stock prices.”  China may introduce “more proactive” policies to ensure
stable growth, the China Securities Journal said in a commentary
published on the front page of the newspaper today. Policies to
stabilize foreign trade, expand infrastructure investment, fine-
tune monetary policies and structurally reduce taxes may be
introduced, according to the commentary.  The People’s Bank of China may cut the reserve-requirement
ratio next month as funds are expected to remain tight even
after the 95 billion  yuan  ($14.9 billion) of reverse repos by
the central bank yesterday, the Shanghai Securities News
reported on its front page today. The ratio has been lowered
three times since November.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
