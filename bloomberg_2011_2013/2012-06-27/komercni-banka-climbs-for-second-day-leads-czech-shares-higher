Komercni Banka  AS, a unit of Societe
Generale SA, rose for a second day, leading Czech shares higher
as speculation that China will introduce additional economic
stimulus boosted demand for riskier assets.  The stock climbed 0.7 percent to 3,480 koruna by 9:38 a.m.
in Prague, adding to a 2.2 percent advance yesterday. The  PX (PX) 
index of 14 equities, in which Komercni Banka has an 18 percent
weighting, gained 0.2 percent to 885.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
