(Corrects to say global iron-ore sales in second
paragraph.)  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, expects Chinese demand for the mineral to keep
rising in coming years, Jose Carlos Martins, executive director
for ferrous minerals and strategy, said in Sao Paulo today.  China’s demand for iron-ore will rise to about 90 percent
of global sales in coming years from about 80 percent now,
Martins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
