The Panama Canal Authority said it
will delay raising tolls on the waterway for three months after
shipping companies objected to the increases.  Revised tolls for general cargo, dry bulk, tanker, chemical
tanker and other categories of shipping will go into effect in
October instead of July 1 “in response to industry requests,”
the canal authority said in an e-mailed statement today. The
authority will hold further consultations about the changes
before submitting them for approval, it said.  The Panama Canal Authority, nearing completion of a $5.25
billion expansion to accommodate larger vessels, said it needs
the higher fees to remain competitive. Ship owners representing
80 percent of the world’s fleet called for the delay, claiming
that a 15 percent toll hike to navigate the waterway was
“excessive” and likely to harm vessel owners, the
International Chamber of Shipping said on May 25.  The U.S. is the waterway’s biggest user, comprising 65
percent of trade using the 80-kilometer (50-mile) canal that
links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, followed by  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
