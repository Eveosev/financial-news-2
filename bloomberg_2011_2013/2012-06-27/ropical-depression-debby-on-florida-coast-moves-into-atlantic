Tropical Depression Debby, formerly
a tropical storm that threatened Gulf of Mexico oil and gas
interests, has become less organized with 35 miles (55
kilometers) per hour winds after reaching the Atlantic coast of
north  Florida  near  St. Augustine , the National Hurricane Center
said in a 5 a.m. Miami time advisory. The storm, which deluged
Florida with heavy rain and flooding, is moving east-northeast
at 10 mph away from Florida into the Atlantic, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
