Brazil  is studying the possibility
of requiring a percentage of local content for the electric
 energy industry  as is currently done for oil exploration, said
the country’s Energy Ministry.  Brazil’s Energy Ministry is looking at the possibility, it
said today in an e-mailed statement. Local content requirements
weren’t discussed at yesterday’s biannual ministers meeting, the
ministry said.  Oil producers are required to buy as much as 70 percent of
goods and services locally, reducing the suppliers state-
controlled oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  can tap as the
country seeks to more than double output by 2020.  The same mechanism will be added to the new mining code
that the government plans to send to Congress for appreciation,
said a government official who participated in drafting the new
rules on Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
