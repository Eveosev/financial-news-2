The most popular leader among
Russian opposition protesters is anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, whose rating has jumped this year as mass street
demonstrations against President  Vladimir Putin  continued.  Navalny, a lawyer who was elected to the board of state-
controlled OAO Aeroflot this week, is preferred by 46 percent of
those who joined the protests, up from 18 percent in February,
according to a poll published today by the All-Russian Center
for the Study of  Public Opinion . Left-leaning politician Sergei
Udaltsov is second with a 26 percent popularity rating.  Tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets of Moscow
and other cities to protest the results of parliamentary
elections in December and Putin’s return to the Kremlin in March
after four years as prime minister. Investigators have
questioned Navalny and Udaltsov in connection with charges of
inciting mass disturbances and violence against officials on May
6, when a protest ended in clashes with police.  The state-run pollster, known as VTsIOM, conducted the
survey of 531 people at the most recent Moscow rally on June 12.
