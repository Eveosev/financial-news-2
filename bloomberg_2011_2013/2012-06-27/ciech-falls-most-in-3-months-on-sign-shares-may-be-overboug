Ciech SA (CIE) , a Polish chemicals maker,
declined the most in more than three months as a technical
indicator suggested the stock’s rally was overdone.  The shares tumbled as much as 8.6 percent to 19.6 zloty,
the steepest intraday decline since March 20, and traded 3
percent lower at 20.8 zloty as of 9:43 a.m. in Warsaw. Ciech’s
14-day  relative strength index  stood at 83 at the close
yesterday. A reading above 70 indicates to some technical
analysts a security may fall. The RSI was at 71 today.  Ciech,  controlled  by the government, has risen 19 percent
 this year , compared with a 5.3 percent gain in the WIG20 Index.
Poland’s Treasury Ministry said this month it’s seeing investor
interest in the country’s chemicals producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
