Swedish Prime Minister  Fredrik
Reinfeldt  called European proposals to reshape the
crisis-struck euro area “far-reaching” as he outlined Sweden’s
stance today in the Riksdag ahead of a June 28-29 European Union
summit.  The 10-year road map, released yesterday by four officials
led by EU President  Herman Van Rompuy , centered on
common banking supervision and deposit insurance and a
“criteria-based and phased” move toward joint debt issuance.
It also suggests that the EU could impose upper limits on annual
budgets and debt levels of nations that use the euro.  Reinfeldt told parliament’s European Union committee that
he does not think Sweden will recommend the proposals without
significant changes and deeper study.  “I don’t see any chance that to, as far as  Sweden  is
concerned, stand behind the proposals,” he said. “More
analysis is required.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
