Temperatures in Chicago and
Washington are expected to break 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38
Celsius) in the next five days while New York City may reach 96
and  Newark , New Jersey, 99, according to forecasters.  Heat spreading from the Midwest to the East Coast may send
temperatures to an average of 5 degrees above normal from Utah
to Massachusetts, with parts of the central U.S. and southern
Ontario reaching 8 degrees above normal, until July 1, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The puddle of heat will expand and contract over the area
through at least July 11, boosting demand for electricity as the
large cities of the East and Midwest start to bake, Rogers said.  “The coverage and intensity of hot weather for the first
half of July continues to look very impressive this morning and
the latest outlook adds even more demand,” Rogers said in a
note to clients.  Power plants  account for 36 percent of U.S. natural gas
demand. Natural gas futures on  New York Mercantile Exchange 
extended their longest streak of gains in more than a month on
the threat of higher temperatures today after rising yesterday
to settle at a five-month high of $2.767 per million British
thermal units.  Heat advisories have been issued from  Nebraska  to Ohio and
from Minnesota to Texas by the  National Weather Service .  St.
Louis  is expected to reach a high of 99 today and 108 tomorrow,
according to the agency.  Midwest Heat  Temperatures in St. Louis are expected to remain above 100
into next week.  Oklahoma City  broke 100 two days ago and is
expected to remain above that mark for the rest of the week.  Chicago may reach 101 tomorrow before dropping back down to
90 over the weekend, according to the Weather Service.
Temperatures in Washington are forecast to rise steadily until
reaching 101 by July 1, and in New York the high may be 90 by
tomorrow and stay above that mark for the rest of the week.  The high in Newark is expected to be 99 on June 29.
Temperatures in Boston will reach into the 90s over the weekend,
according to the Weather Service.  Toronto may reach near 90 tomorrow, according to
Environment Canada.  For July 1, the normal average temperature in  New York City 
is 76, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland . It’s 72 in Boston; 79 in Washington; 80 in Atlanta; 74
in Chicago; 84 in Houston; 64 in Seattle and 73 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
