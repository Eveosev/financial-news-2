Kazakhstan  charged  Vladimir Kozlov ,
a leader of the Alga opposition party, with incitement to
overthrow the central Asian nationâ€™s government, AP reported,
citing party representative Mikhail Sizov.  Kozlov has been in jail since January and is accused of
fomenting violence in December among striking oil workers in
western Kazakhstan, where at least 14 people died, AP said. If
found guilty of this and another charge of inciting social
unrest, Kozlov may face more than 10 years in prison, AP said,
citing Alga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
