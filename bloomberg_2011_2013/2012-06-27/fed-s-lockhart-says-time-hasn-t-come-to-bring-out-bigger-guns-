Dennis Lockhart , president of the
 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta , said that while additional bond
purchases to boost the economy remain an option, it’s too soon
for the central bank to “bring out bigger guns.”  “I don’t think the conditions have developed that require
us to bring out bigger guns quite yet,” Lockhart said in an
interview today with Nightly Business Report. Large-scale bond
purchases, known as quantitative easing, are “certainly an
option,” he said. “I would say that if the circumstances call
for it more stimulus could be provided.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
