The brother of an ex- Army Corps  of
Engineers official at the center of a $20 million bribery and
false-billing scheme involving federal contracts admitted he
helped hide more than $600,000 in kickback payments.  Nazim Khan, 49, pleaded guilty today in federal court in
 Washington  to one count of conspiracy to commit interstate
transportation of stolen property. Khan, who agreed to forfeit
more than $83,000, faces as long as five years in prison when he
is sentenced.  Nazim Khan is the brother of Kerry Khan, a former program
manager at the Army Corps who prosecutors called “the
ringleader of largest bribery and bid-steering scheme in the
history of federal contracting.” He is also the 10th person to
plead guilty in the probe.  Kerry Khan, formerly of Alexandria,  Virginia , pleaded
guilty on May 17 to taking bribes and conspiring to launder
money. The scheme took advantage of a five-year technology
contract with the Army Corps under the so-called TIGER program,
according to an indictment unsealed on Oct. 4.  William Miller, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, declined to comment on today’s plea.  The case is U.S. v. Khan, 12-00098, U.S. District Court,
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story: Tom Schoenberg in
