Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the third-largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, rose to a one-month high after a tax
benefit and improving demand fueled a surge in its fiscal
second-quarter profit.  Net income for the three months through May rose to $452.7
million, or $2.06 a share, from $13.8 million, or 7 cents, a
year earlier, the Miami-based company said today in a statement.
The results included $403 million from the partial reversal of
deferred tax assets tied to losses during the housing crash.
Earnings excluding the gain were 21 cents a share, beating the
16-cent average  estimate  of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “Lennar’s quarterly performance was impressive and
provides further evidence that the U.S. housing market is, in
fact, in recovery mode,” Vincent Foley and  Cedric Morris ,
analysts at Barclays Plc in  New York , wrote in a note today.  Purchases of U.S. new homes have begun to rebound as low
 mortgage rates  help attract buyers amid a limited  supply  of
existing properties.  New houses  sold at an annual pace of
369,000 in May, up 7.6 percent from the previous month and the
highest rate since April 2010, when buyers rushed to take
advantage of federal tax credits designed to stimulate the
market, data from the Commerce Department show.  ‘Slow Recovery’  “Evidence from the field suggests that the ‘for sale’
housing market has, in fact, bottomed and that we have commenced
a slow and steady recovery process,” Chief Executive Officer
 Stuart Miller  said in the statement.  Lennar gained 4.8 percent to $28.70 at the close in New
York, the highest since May 29. The shares increased 46 percent
this year, compared with a 41 percent advance for the 11-member
Standard & Poor’s 1500 Homebuilding  Index. (S15HOME)   Revenue for the quarter climbed to $930.2 million from
$764.5 million a year earlier. Orders rose to 4,481 homes from
3,204 a year earlier and the cancellation rate was 16 percent.
The company’s backlog, an indication of future sales, jumped 61
percent to 3,970 from a year earlier. The average sales price of
homes delivered increased to $250,000 from $245,000 in the same
period last year.  Lennar is the first publicly traded builder to reverse some
of its deferred tax assets, which auditors advised companies to
write down after losses soared in 2007 when home sales
plummeted, Megan McGrath, an analyst with MKM Partners LLC, said
before the report.  ‘Continued Profitability’  The reversal reflects “the expectation of continued
profitability, as well as the improved housing market,” Miller
said in the statement.  Lennar, which has reported a profit in every period since
the second quarter of 2010, trades distressed real estate and
notes through its Rialto Investments unit to supplement its
homebuilding revenue.  Rialto had operating earnings of $4.3 million in the second
quarter, down from $9.8 million a year earlier. The unit’s
revenue fell to $33.5 million from $42.6 million.  In another sign of a strengthening housing market,
 contracts  to buy existing homes rose 5.9 percent in May from the
previous month, matching a two-year high reached in March, the
National Association of Realtors reported today. A shrinking
supply will spur demand for more new houses,  Lawrence Yun , the
association’s chief economist, said in a statement from
 Washington .  “If housing starts do not rise in a meaningful way over
the next two years due to the difficulty in getting construction
loans, and barring an unexpected shift in the economy, the
steady shedding of inventory could lead to shortages where  home
prices  could get bid up close to 10 percent in 2013,” Yun said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
