Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet
approved a spending plan that balances Germany’s  federal budget 
three years earlier than required by its own rules.  Cabinet members meeting in Berlin today backed the 2013
draft budget and a spending blueprint through 2016, a government
spokeswoman said by telephone.  Germany’s net federal borrowing will decline from 18.8
billion euros ($23.6 billion) next year to 13.1 billion euros in
2014, 4.7 billion euros in 2015 before touching zero in 2016,
according to the plan presented by the  Finance Ministry  on June
22, which now goes to parliament.  The so-called structural deficit of the federal budget will
shrink to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product next year,
equal to the limit set in Germany’s national debt-reduction
rules, according to the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
