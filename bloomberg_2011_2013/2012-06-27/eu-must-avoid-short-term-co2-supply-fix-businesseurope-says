The European Union should start a
debate about 2030 carbon-reduction targets and avoid short-term
tools to curb the supply of permits in its cap-and-trade system,
said BusinessEurope, a Brussels-based employers’ federation.  The European Commission, the EU regulatory arm, is
considering a review of the carbon-permit auctioning rules to
postpone some sales of allowances in the early phase of the next
trading period in the emissions market that runs from 2013 to
2020. That would aim to help carbon prices recover after they
slumped to a record low earlier this year on oversupply.  BusinessEurope supports the “central role” played by the
emissions trading system, or ETS, and called on the EU to begin
discussions about post-2020 emission-reduction trajectory as
soon as possible, according to a letter to European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  e-mailed today.  “Prior to this longer-term view being developed and
accepted, short-term measures such as changes to the ETS
auctioning regulation to withhold allowances must be avoided as
these would interfere with a more constructive discussion on how
to achieve a systemic solution,” said the lobby, representing
more than 20 million companies in 35 European countries.  Measures of such importance can’t be implemented without a
dialogue with companies, policy makers, industry associations
and non-governmental organizations, according to BusinessEurope.  “Pre-emptive short-term measures would create a precedent,
resulting in greater uncertainty, which has to be avoided, and
could have major repercussions for EU industry, which is already
under strain from the economic crisis,” it said.  EU Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  reiterated
yesterday she’s aiming to present the auction-delay proposal and
a report on long-term structural options to improve the ETS
before the end of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
