Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  suspended
ethanol production at its plant in Linden, Indiana, for
“economic reasons.”  The temporary shutdown yesterday follows the closing of
Valero’s Albion, Nebraska, ethanol plant June 19,  Bill Day , a
San Antonio-based spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail.  “We expect to resume production once market conditions
improve,” Day said.  Both plants have a capacity of 110 million gallons of
ethanol a year, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
