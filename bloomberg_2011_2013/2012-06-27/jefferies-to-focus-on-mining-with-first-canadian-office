Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  has opened its
first Canadian office in Toronto, with former Credit Suisse
Group AG investment banker Steven Latimer leading its focus on
mining for the New York-based firm.  “Initially we’re going to be focused on metals and mining,
but clearly we are going to build this business around the core
competencies and strengths of Jefferies,” Latimer, head of
Canadian investment banking, said today in a phone interview.  Jefferies may bring some of its global industry practices
including energy, health care, technology, chemicals and
renewable energy to its Canadian operations, Latimer said.  “We are very excited about  Canada ; it’s a very important
market any way you look at it,” he said. “We’re going to be
building this business and we look forward to serving our
clients with global capabilities and ideas.”  Latimer has more than 22 years experience, most recently as
head of Canadian metals and mining  investment banking  for
Zurich-based Credit Suisse in Toronto, the firm said in a
statement. He spent 15 years working as an investment banker for
UBS Securities in Toronto and Calgary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
