three-day losing streak, after U.S. home prices fell at the
slowest pace in more than a year and builders rose ahead of a
planned tax increase.  Contractors and developers gained the most in the  Topix (TPX) 
Index after Japan’s lower house yesterday approved legislation
to double the  sales tax  by 2015.  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  rose 3.7
percent on speculation the higher sales tax may give the
cigarette maker an opportunity to raise prices. Satori Electric
Co., an electronic equipment trader that gets a third of its
sales from  China , climbed 1.7 percent amid speculation mainland
policy makers may boost stimulus.  “There’s a last-minute jump in demand for houses ahead of
the consumption tax increase, so property and construction
shares may benefit,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has 33 trillion yen ($415
billion) in assets. “Still, the tax increase isn’t good for the
economy in the long run.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.8 percent to 8,730.49

less than one means that companies can be bought for less than

gauge added 0.5 percent in New York yesterday as the S&P/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities dropped 1.9

decline since November 2010. The median forecast of 28
economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected a 2.5 percent
drop.  “The U.S. housing data certainly shows good movement,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief strategist at Toyota
Asset Management Co., which manages the equivalent of $23
billion. “The U.S. housing market is starting to bottom out.”  Builders Advance  Contractors and developers gained the most among the 33
