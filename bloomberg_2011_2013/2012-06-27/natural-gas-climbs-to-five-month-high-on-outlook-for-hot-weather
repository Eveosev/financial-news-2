Natural gas futures jumped to a
five-month high in New York on forecasts for hotter-than-normal
weather that would boost fuel demand from  power plants .  Gas advanced as much as 6.5 percent as MDA EarthSat Weather
in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted above-normal temperatures
across most of the continental U.S. through July 11. The high in
Chicago tomorrow may be 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), 18
above normal, according to the  National Weather Service  in
 Silver Spring , Maryland.  “The main market driver is this heat and increased cooling
needs in the coming weeks,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “Prices
have some momentum but we’ll need to see six weeks of these
kinds of temperatures to push gas above $3.”  Natural gas for July delivery gained 9.2 cents, or 3.3
percent, to $2.859 per million British thermal units at 11:53
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after rising to $2.946
per million Btu, the highest intraday price since Jan. 10. Gas
has climbed 50 percent since falling to a 10-year intraday low
of $1.902 per million Btu on April 19.  July gas futures expire today. The more actively traded
August contract gained 8.9 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.896 per
million Btu.  The weather will be hotter than normal in the Northeast
through June 25, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 7
percent above normal on June 23, data from Weather Derivatives
in Belton, Missouri, show.  New York  The high in New York tomorrow may be 90 degrees Fahrenheit,
7 higher than the usual reading, according to the National
Weather Service, which issued heat advisories from Nebraska to
Ohio and from Minnesota to Texas.  Electricity producers account for about 36 percent of U.S.
gas consumption, according to the Energy Department.  Current natural  gas prices  aren’t sustainable,  Rex Tillerson , chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest
U.S. natural gas producer, said at the  Council on Foreign
Relations  in New York today.  Energy producers are “losing our shirts” amid low gas
prices, Tillerson said.  Energy Department data scheduled for release tomorrow at
10:30 a.m. in Washington may show gas inventories climbed 53
billion cubic feet in the week ended June 22, according to the
median of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-
year average increase is 85 billion, department data show.  Gas Production  The department cut its forecast for natural gas output in
2012 by 1 percent in the June 12 monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. Marketed gas production will average 68.47 billion
cubic feet a day this year, down from 69.14 billion estimated in
May, the department said.  Gas prices at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $2.55 per million British thermal units, up from
the previous estimate of $2.45, according to the report.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
fell by 21 to 541 last week, the lowest count since August 1999,
according to data released June 22 by Baker Hughes Inc. in
Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
