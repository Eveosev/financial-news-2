Brendan Hansen and cancer survivor
Eric Shanteau were among those earning spots on the U.S. team at
the Olympic swimming trials, where  Michael Phelps  and  Ryan Lochte  are set for their second showdown of the meet today.  Hansen won last night’s 100-meter breaststroke with a time
of 59.68 seconds. Hansen won the silver medal in the event at
the 2004  Athens  Games, one of his four Olympic medals. Shanteau,
who is returning to the Olympics four years after he was
diagnosed with testicular cancer, was second in 60.15 seconds.  “To know we’re going to London, the pressure is off,”
Hansen said in a televised interview at poolside in Omaha,
 Nebraska .  Also last night, Dana Vollmer, who won a gold medal in
Athens, reached the wall in the women’s 100-meter butterfly in
56.50 seconds, more than a second ahead of Claire Donahue, who
was second.  Allison Schmitt won the women’s 400-meter freestyle in 4
minutes, 2.84 seconds and will go to  London  with Chloe Sutton,
who covered the distance in 4:04.18.  Today, Lochte and Phelps will meet in the 200-meter
freestyle final. Lochte, 27, beat Olympic champion Phelps in the
event to win the gold medal at the World Championships last
year. Lochte qualified fastest for the final, in 1:46.25, two
hundredths of a second faster than Phelps.  Lochte pushed Phelps into second place in the 400-meter
individual medley at the trials on June 25.  That event was one of a record eight in which Phelps, 26,
won gold at the 2008 Olympics. Lochte, the American Swimmer of
the Year the past two years, won five golds at last year’s world
championships.  Also today, finals will be held in the men’s and women’s
100-meter backstroke, and the women’s 100-meter breaststroke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
