American Equity Investment Life
Holding Co. (AEL) , the seller of fixed annuities, named John M. Matovina as chief executive officer following the death of Wendy
Waugaman this month.  Matovina, 58, the chief financial officer and interim CEO
since Waugaman took a medical leave about three weeks ago, will
also serve as president, the  West Des Moines , Iowa-based insurer
said today in a statement. Ted M. Johnson, 42, the firm’s
controller, was named to replace Matovina as CFO, the company
said.  Waugaman, who joined the insurer in 1999 and became CEO in
2009, died June 18 after a struggle with cancer. The firm
advanced 50 percent in New York trading since she took over
through June 7, compared with the 52 percent gain of the Russell
2000 index.  “The board has a great deal of confidence in Mr. Matovina,
Mr. Johnson and the entire management team,” the company said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
