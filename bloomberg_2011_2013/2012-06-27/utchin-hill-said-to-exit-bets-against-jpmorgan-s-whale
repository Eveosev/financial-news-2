Hutchin Hill Capital LP, the hedge
fund founded by Neil Chriss, has exited trades betting against
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  trader Bruno Iksil in a credit-derivatives
index, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Chriss, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader who later
managed a portfolio at SAC Capital Management LLC, was among
hedge-fund managers who took advantage of gaps between the price
of the index and its constituents created by Iksil’s outsized
bets that earned him the nickname London Whale.  JPMorgan is seeking to contain a trading loss in its chief
investment office that stood at $2 billion when it was disclosed
almost seven weeks ago. Bloomberg News first reported in April
that Iksil had amassed positions in Series 9 of the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index that were so large he drove
the cost of contracts on the index below the average cost of
credit swaps on the 121 companies it’s tied to.  Chriss started Hutchin Hill in 2008 with $300 million from
Renaissance Technologies Corp. founder  James Simons .  Saba Capital Management LP, the hedge fund run by  Boaz Weinstein , closed similar trades, a person familiar with that
fund said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
