A Hungarian court suspended the
opening of a state-run mobile network until the resolution of an
appeal by existing providers,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing a
court decision.  The Budapest court decided on June 25 that the state
company may not use the 900 Mhz frequency it won this year as
Magyar Telekom Nyrt. and  Telenor ASA (TEL)  disputed the tender
results, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
