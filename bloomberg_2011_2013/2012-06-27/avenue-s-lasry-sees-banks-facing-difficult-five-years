Marc Lasry , the billionaire co-
founder of Avenue Capital Group LLC, said banks will have a
“difficult time” in the next five years.  “I think it will be very hard. If you look back, the
reason banks made a lot of money is because they used a lot of
leverage and now that they can’t use the leverage, they will not
be able to make enough money,” he said today in an interview
with Stephanie Ruhle and  Erik Schatzker  on Bloomberg
Television’s “Market Makers.”  Banks are struggling to lift profit amid stricter  capital
requirements  and as new rules force them to dismantle their
proprietary trading desks. Lasry, 52, said boutique banks will
have an “easier time” getting started and competing with the
big banks.  Lasry, whose firm is based in New York, reiterated that he
sees a “huge amount” of distressed debt investing
opportunities in  Europe . While buying equity there is risky,
senior debt protects from losses, he said.  “In Europe, you’re getting overpaid for the risk,” Lasry
said. “I don’t think Europe will blow up and that over time
things will work out.”  In the U.S., Lasry said he likes energy and that there will
be good companies to buy at low prices after natural gas prices
fell to a 10-year intraday low in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
