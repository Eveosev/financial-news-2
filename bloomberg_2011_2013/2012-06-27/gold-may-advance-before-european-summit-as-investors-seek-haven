Gold in  New York  advanced for the
second time in three days on speculation that  China  may take
more steps to boost economic growth.  China may introduce “more proactive” policies to ensure
stable growth, the China Securities Journal said in a commentary
today. The Asian country will topple  India  this year as the
world’s largest consumer because rising incomes will bolster
demand, the World Gold Council has forecast. European leaders
will meet tomorrow in another attempt to find a solution to the
region’s debt crisis.  “The Chinese news is positive for gold,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The gains will
be limited as some investors are waiting for some kind of
statement from the European leaders.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle
at $1,578.40 an ounce at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
precious metal has fallen 5.6 percent this quarter, heading for
the biggest such decline since 2004, as the dollar gained and
the  Federal Reserve  refrained from announcing further debt
purchases.  Prices surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 0.4 percent
to $27 an ounce on the Comex, extending this quarter’s drop to
17 percent, which would be the biggest loss since September
2008.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 1.2 percent to $1,413.30 an ounce,
retreating for the second straight day. Palladium futures for
September delivery slumped 2.3 percent to $579.75 an ounce,
falling the most since May 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
