The ruble depreciated against the
dollar and yields on  Russia ’s local debt rose as oil, the
country’s main export, declined.  The Russian currency lost 0.2 percent to 33 per dollar by
the close in Moscow after earlier appreciating as much as 0.4
percent. The country’s 28 billion rubles ($850 million) of
domestic debt due 2027 fell, increasing the yield by two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.91 percent.  Urals crude dropped 0.8 percent to $89.88 per barrel after
a report said U.S. inventories climbed by 507,000 barrels last
week, a sign demand may fall. Oil and gas contribute about 50
percent of Russia’s state revenue, according to the government’s
estimates. The ruble was earlier supported by companies
converting revenue from abroad to make monthly tax payments,
according to Craig Lynch, a Madrid-based currency trader at
 Banco Santander SA. (SAN)   “Over the next few days we should remain capped below
33.15 to 33.20, assuming there are not significant external
shocks,” he said by e-mail.  The Russian currency was little changed at 41.09 per euro
and slid 0.2 percent to 36.6405 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket. Investors increased bets on the
currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
ruble at 33.4889 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 33.4217 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
