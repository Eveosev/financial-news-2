Chile’s peso gained as copper, the
country’s biggest export, jumped on higher-than-forecast  orders 
for durable goods such as aircraft, cars and washing machines in
the U.S.  The peso rose 0.7 percent to 504.90 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:28 a.m. in Santiago, trimming its decline this quarter to 3.3
percent. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index
 gained  0.3 percent today.  Copper for September delivery gained as much as 1.2 percent
and U.S. stocks advanced after orders for durable goods rose
more than forecast in the world’s biggest economy. The euro
weakened ahead of a meeting of European Union leaders starting
tomorrow in Brussels at which they will seek a solution to the
region’s debt crisis.  “There was improved data in the U.S. and copper is
rising,” said Rodrigo Sarra, a currency trader at Celfin
Capital in Santiago. “The volatility will continue until Friday
when we know the outcome of the European summit. The market
isn’t expecting much but it is very attentive.”  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $10 billion short peso position on June 25, up from $9.8
billion on June 22, according to central bank data published
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
