The top minor league in men’s golf
is now the  Web.com (WWWW)  Tour under a new 10-year title sponsorship
agreement.  Web.com, a Jacksonville, Florida-based provider of Internet
and marketing services for small- to medium-sized businesses,
replaces Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.  Financial terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed at a
news conference in Bethesda, Maryland, by U.S.  PGA Tour 
Commissioner Tim Finchem.  It’s the fifth new title sponsor for the tour, which was
started in 1990 by the PGA Tour as a place for professionals to
compete as they try to earn their way to the top circuit.  Other previous sponsors were the Ben Hogan Golf Co.,  Nike
Inc. (NKE) , and Buy.com. Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, had been
the title sponsor since 2002 and announced in September 2010
that it would not continue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
