Pacific Hydro Pty., the Australia
renewable-energy developer, plans to build 500 megawatts of wind
farms in Brazil to meet growing industrial demand for energy.  The company will sell some of the electricity to  Vale SA (VALE) ,
the world’s biggest iron-ore producer, and additional buyers may
include other industrial clients seeking to cut their energy
costs, Rob Grant, chief executive officer of Melbourne-based
Pacific Hydro, said today in a telephone interview.  Brazil’s industry is consuming more power to provide
commodities for markets in  China  and India, Grant said.  “About 10 percent of our business is in Brazil now and we
want to boost that to 30 percent” when the planned wind farms
are complete in about three to five years, Grant said.  Pacific Hydro is already developing two wind farms with 140
megawatts of capacity for Vale in the northeastern state of  Rio
Grande  do Norte.  It has received inquiries from other potential energy
customers in Brazil since announcingthose projects June 22. The
remaining 360 megawatts of projects will be structured similarly
to those its building for Vale, which agreed to take a 50
percent stake in the wind farms and buy all their output, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
