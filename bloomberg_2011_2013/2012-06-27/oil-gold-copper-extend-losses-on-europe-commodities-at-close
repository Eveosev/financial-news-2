time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.2
percent to 1430.058.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell in  New York  to trade below $80 a barrel for a
fifth day on speculation demand is faltering as U.S. crude
stockpiles rise, countering signs that output from Iran and
 Norway  will be disrupted.  Oil for August delivery fell as much as 37 cents to $78.99
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $79.04 at 3:06 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday rose 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $79.36, the
highest close since June 22. Prices have fallen 23 percent this
quarter, the biggest drop since the final three months of 2008.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in New York extended their longest
streak of gains in more than a month as forecasts for hot

barrel at 10 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker. The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude,

PVM data showed. Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent
crude futures rose $24.65 to $46.59 a ton as of 11:22 a.m.,

refining profit from the petrochemical and gasoline feedstock.  Singapore fuel oil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining profits for the fuel, increased 15 cents to 91 cents a

products were little changed at 2,409 metric tons yesterday,
within 0.1 percent of the all-time high set in March, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  BASE METALS  Copper declined for the first time in three days after data
showed U.S.  consumer confidence  fell this month and Spanish and
Italian bond yields jumped, worsening Europe’s debt crisis
before a leaders’ summit.  Three-month copper lost as much as 0.6 percent to $7,317.25
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, before trading at
$7,324 by 2:52 p.m. Shanghai time. Copper has lost 13 percent
since March 30, set for the first quarterly fall in three. Comex
September futures dropped 0.3 to $3.311 per pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  fell on concern that the European leaders may fail
to take steps to contain the region’s debt crisis at a summit,
weakening demand for commodities.  The September-delivery contract dropped as much as 0.6
percent to 3,013 ringgit ($944) a metric ton on the Malaysia

ringgit. Prices have lost 12 percent this quarter.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 0.5 percent to $14.20
a bushel in  Chicago . December-delivery  soybean oil  was little
changed at 51.84 cents a pound.  Corn advanced to the highest level in more than seven
months as dry weather wilted plants in the U.S., producer of 40
percent of the global crop, curbing supply.  Corn fell in Chicago on speculation investors were cashing
in gains from a 13 percent, three-day rally as they awaited the
effect of predicted rains on crops in the Midwest, the largest
U.S. growing region. December-delivery corn fell 0.3 percent to
$6.22 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 10:09 a.m. in
London. The grain climbed as high as $6.2475 yesterday.  Wheat for September delivery slid 0.7 percent to $7.4175 a

yesterday, on concern that a meeting of European leaders this
week will fail to halt the region’s debt crisis that threatens
to hurt global growth and demand for commodities.  Rubber ended little changed as concerns that a European
Union summit beginning tomorrow will fail to produce a lasting
resolution to the region’s debt crisis countered optimism that
 China  will boost its economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
