Iran ’s foreign minister called on
the European Union to reconsider a ban on its oil set to start
July 1, saying a confrontation over the nation’s nuclear program
will yield no benefits, the  Islamic Republic News Agency  said.  “We are used to sanctions; it isn’t new,”  Ali Akbar
Salehi  said yesterday during a visit to  Cyprus, the official
state news agency reported. “We hope that the European Union
takes this into account and acts with more rationality.”  The EU boycott of Iran oil, aimed at derailing the Persian
Gulf state’s nuclear-enrichment program, will come into effect
after a third round of nuclear talks this year between Iran and
world powers failed to reach a breakthrough. EU foreign policy
chief  Catherine Ashton  confirmed two days ago that the sanctions
will begin as previously agreed by the bloc’s governments.  “No one will benefit from confrontation and we don’t see a
reason for advancing on the wrong path,” Salehi told reporters
after a meeting with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias,
according to IRNA. “Iran and the EU can cooperate together.”  Iran says its nuclear program is civilian and its
activities are lawful under the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, to which it is a signatory. The U.S. and its western
allies accuse it of developing nuclear weapons capability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
