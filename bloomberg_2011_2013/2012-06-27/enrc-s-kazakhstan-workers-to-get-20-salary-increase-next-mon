Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., a
producer of metals in  Kazakhstan , agreed to raise salaries for
its 65,000 employees in the country by an average 20 percent.  The increase is effective July 1, London-based ENRC said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Metals and mining companies in Kazakhstan have boosted
salaries after pay disputes in the country’s oil industry
triggered strikes and violent protests in 2011. ArcelorMittal’s
Kazakh unit offered a 10 percent pay increase to coal workers
this month, backdated to the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
