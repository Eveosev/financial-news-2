Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s largest
seed company, posted third-quarter earnings that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as U.S. farmers bought more of the company’s
genetically modified corn.  Net income climbed 35 percent to $937 million, or $1.74
cents a share, in the three months through May 31, from $692
million, or $1.28, a year earlier, St. Louis-based Monsanto said
today in a statement. Profit excluding a legacy tax matter was
$1.63 cents a share, topping the $1.60 average estimate of 13
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The company forecast profit of
$1.57 to $1.62 on May 30.  Sales of corn seed and genetic licenses rose 35 percent as
U.S. farmers planted the biggest crop in 75 years. Soybean sales
gained 15 percent, driven by demand for the newest seed
engineered to tolerate Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide. Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer  Hugh Grant  also is expanding in
 Latin America  and Eastern Europe.  “Corn is clearly the driver now,” Chris L. Shaw, a New
York-based analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who recommends
holding the shares, said today in a phone interview. “It was
strong across the board, and they maintained their guidance for
next year.”  Monsanto rose 1 percent to $78.65 at 9:18 a.m. in  New York 
before the start of regular trading.  Price Gains  Sales climbed 17 percent in the quarter to $4.22 billion
from $3.61 billion. Monsanto reiterated its earnings  forecast 
for the year through August of $3.65 to $3.70 a share, excluding
the tax issue, settlement of pollution claims and discontinued
operations. The average estimate of 16 analysts in the survey
was $3.70 a share.  Profit in fiscal 2013, which begins in September, will
increase by a percentage in the “mid-teens,” Monsanto said,
repeating its long-term earnings target. Growth drivers include
corn and soybeans in the U.S. and  Brazil , Argentine corn,
vegetables, and price gains associated with seed improvements,
Monsanto said in a  presentation  on its website.  U.S. farmers have doubled planting of Monsanto’s
insecticide-producing corn in 2012, exceeding the top end of the
company’s 25-million-acre forecast by more than 1 million acres,
Monsanto said in the presentation. More acres will be planted in
2013, the company said.  Roundup Ready 2 soybeans were planted on about 30 million
acres, an increase of more than 10 million acres, and plantings
will rise again next year, Monsanto said.  Sales of insect-fighting corn will increase next year in
Brazil and Argentina, according to the presentation. Sales of
similar technology engineered into Intacta soybeans will begin
next year in Brazil, with farmer trials planned for  Argentina 
the following year.  (Monsanto scheduled a conference call at 9:30 a.m. New York
