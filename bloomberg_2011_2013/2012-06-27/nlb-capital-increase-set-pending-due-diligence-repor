 Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.’s main
shareholders are set to agree on a 500 million-euro ($624
million) capital boost pending due diligence on Slovenia’s
biggest bank, Finance newspaper reported, citing acting-Chief
Executive Officer Bozo Jasovic.  The Slovenian government holds an indirect majority at NLB
with Belgium’s  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  the second largest investor with a
25 percent stake, the Ljubljana-based newspaper said.  Due diligence will probably be completed early next month,
Irena Ferkulj, spokeswoman at the  Finance Ministry  said by
phone.  The government wants to avoid injecting state funds into
the bank and proposed the sale of contingent convertible bonds
to improve the lender’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, Finance
Minister Janez Sustersic has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
