OAO Acron jumped the most in almost
two weeks after posting a 34 percent first-quarter net income
gain from a year earlier as increased demand for food supplies
boosted the Russian fertilizer producer’s sales.  The stock rose 1.5 percent to 1,147.50 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest advance since June 15. The shares have
dropped 7.4 percent in the quarter.  Profit in the first quarter jumped to 5.123 billion rubles
($169 million), according to an e-mailed company statement.
Revenue rose 33 percent from a year earlier, climbing to 18.422
billion rubles, the statement said.  “The world’s increasing demand for food supplies requires
increased output from fertilizer producers,” Chairman Alexander Popov said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
