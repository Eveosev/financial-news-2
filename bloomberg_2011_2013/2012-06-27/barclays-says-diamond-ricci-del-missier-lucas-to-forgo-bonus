Barclays Plc, the U.K.’s second-
largest bank by assets, said Finance Director Chris Lucas, Chief
Operating Officer Jerry Del Missier, Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Diamond  and Rich Ricci, head of the lender’s investment
banking unit, will forgo their annual bonuses this year.  The decision comes as the lender agreed to pay 290 million
pounds in penalties to settle U.S. and U.K. probes into whether
it sought to rig the London interbank offered rate.  The company commented in a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
