New Zealand is writing down the
value of its commercial rail assets, adding to the size of the
 budget deficit  this year, Finance Minister  Bill English  said.  The charge of about NZ$1.8 billion ($1.4 billion) will be
incurred in the year ending June 30, English said in an e-mailed
statement released in Wellington. The government last month
forecast a deficit of NZ$10.64 billion and will finalize the
figures in coming months, he said.  The non-cash charge won’t affect net debt or the
government’s borrowing program, English said. In the May 24
budget, he forecast the operating balance excluding revaluations
would be in surplus by 2014-15.  “This will leave KiwiRail with a balance sheet that better
reflects commercial reality and gives the company an opportunity
to earn a return over time,” English said in the statement.  Government-owned  New Zealand  Railways Corp. will reduce the
value of the assets, which exclude the land on which rails and
buildings sit, by about NZ$6.7 billion. It will reverse an
existing NZ$4.9 billion revaluation reserve, leaving the
remainder to reduce its bottom line.  The commercial assets including freight, passenger and
ferry businesses, rolling stock, plant and equipment will
transfer to a new state-owned company under the existing
KiwiRail brand. The previous government revalued the assets
upward in 2007 by about NZ$5 billion after buying them back,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
