The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.8 percent to 577 at 5 p.m. New York time
after cocoa and sugar advanced on concern that wet weather in
West Africa will hurt crops.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose 0.7
percent to 1,443.656.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa futures climbed the most in more than seven weeks on
concern that too much rain will hurt crops in West Africa, the
world’s top growing region. Sugar advanced, while coffee fell.  Showers and thunderstorms from  Ivory Coast , the biggest
cocoa grower, to Nigeria and Cameroon through June 29 will be
0.2 inches (0.5 centimeters) to 0.7 inches daily, AccuWeather
Inc. said in a report.  Cocoa for September delivery surged 3.9 percent to settle
at $2,232 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. That was the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since May 1.  Sugar for October delivery, the contract with the most open
interest, jumped 3.6 percent to settle at 20.95 cents a pound on
ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery decreased 0.5
percent to $1.6485 a pound on ICE.  Cotton futures for December delivery slid 0.4 percent to
67.96 cents a pound in  New York . The fiber has tumbled 27
percent this quarter.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery climbed 2.1
percent to $1.1345 a pound on ICE. The price is still down 33
percent in 2012.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose to a one-week high on signs the  U.S. economy  is
recovering, easing concern that demand from the world’s biggest
crude-consuming country will decline.  Futures gained 1.1 percent after Commerce Department data
showed orders for durable goods climbed more than forecast in
May. More Americans than estimated signed contracts to purchase
previously owned homes last month, the National Association of
Realtors reported.  Crude oil for August delivery advanced 85 cents to $80.21 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement in a week.  Brent oil for August settlement increased 48 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $93.50 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slid as the Energy Department reported that
stockpiles of the motor fuel jumped to a seven-week high and on
concern that European leaders can’t contain the region’s debt
crisis.  Prices sank as gasoline supplies rose 2.08 million barrels
to 204.8 million, larger than the 1-million-barrel gain
projected in a survey by Bloomberg. European Union leaders are
preparing for a two-day summit beginning tomorrow in Brussels.  July-delivery gasoline fell 2.47 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $2.6204 a gallon on the Nymex.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 1.72 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $2.5937, the highest level in a week.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.4
cents to $3.383 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest level since Jan. 25.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas  futures rose to a five-month high in New York
on forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather that would boost
fuel demand from  power plants .  MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted
above-normal temperatures across most of the U.S. through July
11. The high in Chicago tomorrow may be 101 degrees Fahrenheit
(38 Celsius), 18 above normal, according to the  National Weather
Service  in  Silver Spring , Maryland.  Natural gas  for July delivery gained 0.7 cent to $2.774
per million British thermal units on the Nymex, the highest
settlement price since Jan. 11.  BASE METALS  Copper rose the most in a week as a measure of U.S. home
sales and orders for durable goods in May climbed more than
expected, easing concern that demand will fade with slowing
growth in the U.S.  Copper futures for September delivery gained 1.1 percent to
settle at $3.3565 a pound on the Comex in New York, the biggest
increase since June 19.  Aluminum and tin also advanced on the London Mercantile
Exchange. Zinc, nickel and lead were lower.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold in New York advanced for the second time in three days
on speculation that  China  may take more steps to boost economic
growth.  China may introduce “more proactive” policies to ensure
stable growth, the China Securities Journal said in a commentary
today. The Asian country will topple  India  this year as the
world’s largest consumer because rising incomes will bolster
demand, the World Gold Council has forecast.  Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle
at $1,578.40 an ounce on the Comex.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 0.4 percent
to $27 an ounce on the Comex, extending this quarter’s drop to
17 percent, which would be the biggest loss since September
2008.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for October delivery dropped
1.2 percent to $1,413.30 an ounce, retreating for the second
straight day. Palladium futures for September delivery slumped
2.3 percent to $579.75 an ounce, falling the most since May 23.  LIVESTOCK  Hog prices rose the most in almost four weeks on
speculation that pork supplies will shrink as rising
temperatures in the U.S. reduce animal weights. Cattle futures
climbed to a one-week high.  Temperatures may average 5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
from the Midwest to the East Coast until July 1, with parts of
the central U.S. reaching 8 degrees above average, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC. On June 25, the average hog carcass
weighed 204.1 pounds (92.6 kilograms), down 1.3 percent from the
previous session, government data show. Livestock use more
energy to stay cool during hot weather, reducing weights.  Hog futures for August settlement surged 3 percent to close
at 91.7 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since May 31.  Cattle futures for August delivery advanced 1.5 percent to
settle at $1.1725 a pound. The price has dropped 3.5 percent
this year.  Feeder-cattle futures  for August settlement climbed 0.8
percent to settle at $1.4885 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn futures rose, capping the biggest four-session gain in
14 months, on signs that hot, dry weather in the next two weeks
will reduce yields in the U.S., the world’s top producer.
Soybeans fell.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for December
delivery, after the harvest, rose 1.4 percent, to close at $6.33
a bushel.  Soybean futures  for November delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$14.12 a bushel.  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to
settle at $7.5125 a bushel on the CBOT on speculation that
livestock producers will use more of the grain in  animal feed  as
corn prices surge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
