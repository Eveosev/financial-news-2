Thailand ’s baht fell toward a three-
week low on speculation dollar demand from importers will exceed
local-currency purchases by exporters.  Government bonds  were
little changed.  The nation had a trade  deficit  of $1.7 billion in May as an
18 percent increase in inbound shipments outstripped export
growth of 7.68 percent, government data showed this week. The
Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  was steady before European
leaders begin a two-day meeting in Brussels tomorrow to discuss
ways to tackle the region’s debt crisis.  “The deficit in the  trade balance  may continue for a while
as imports of machinery related to last year’s floods have been
climbing,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life
Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “The baht tends to see
downward pressure from this aspect. Risk sentiment is quite
neutral as investors are waiting for the results of the European
Union summit.”  The baht retreated 0.2 percent to 31.88 per dollar as of
3:12 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 31.96 on June 25, the weakest level since
May 31. It has dropped 3.2 percent this quarter and 1 percent in
2012. The baht’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was
little changed at 3.33 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
