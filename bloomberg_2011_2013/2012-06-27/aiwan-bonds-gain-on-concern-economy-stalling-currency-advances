Taiwan’s five-year government bonds
traded at the highest level in more than a week on speculation
investors are seeking the safest assets as the island’s economy
slows. The local currency strengthened.  The central bank held  borrowing costs  unchanged at 1.875
percent on June 21, a day after government data showed  export
orders  declined for a third month in May and the jobless rate
climbed. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told lawmakers
yesterday that she “doesn’t see” shared debt happening in the
euro area, ahead of a two-day summit of European leaders to
tackle the region’s financial crisis that starts tomorrow.  “Economic uncertainties continue to favor bonds,” said
George Pu, a bond trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. in Taipei.
“But now that the central bank decided to hold rates, the room
for yields to go down even more is very limited.”  The yield on the 1 percent bonds due January 2017 was 0.930
percent, compared with 0.932 percent yesterday, according to
Gretai Securities Market. That was the lowest level since June
19. The  benchmark  five-year yield fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, this quarter.  Taiwan ’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.960 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It has dropped
1.4 percent since the end of March and reached NT$30.070 on June
5, the weakest level since Jan. 17. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 25
basis points to 4.30 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.51
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
