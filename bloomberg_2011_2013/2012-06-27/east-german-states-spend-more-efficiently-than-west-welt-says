East German federal states spend
taxes in a more transparent and efficient way than their peers
in the west, holding public tenders a lot more often which
increases competition,  Die Welt  reports, citing a study by
German Tender Agency DTAD commissioned by the newspaper.  Brandenburg leads the ranking with 2,038 tenders for each 1
billion euros spent while the city of Hamburg ranks worst
holding 477 public tenders for that amount, Die Welt said,
citing the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
