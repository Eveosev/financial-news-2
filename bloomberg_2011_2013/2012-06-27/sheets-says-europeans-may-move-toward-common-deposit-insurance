Nathan Sheets, global head of
international economics at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , said European Union
leaders meeting at a summit starting in Brussels tomorrow may
agree on a program to ensure the safety of  bank deposits .  “I do think we are going to hear from the summit some move
toward common deposit insurance probably coupled with common
bank supervision and regulation,” Sheets, former head of
international finance for the  Federal Reserve , said in a
Bloomberg Television interview on the “In The Loop” program in
New York. “The key question is what is the timetable.”  “The markets want to see something happen in weeks or
months,” Sheets said. “The euro-area leaders tend to think in
terms of years or decades. Bridging that divide in perspectives
has really been one of the fundamental issues.”  If the plan were put in place in a few months, “that would
go a long way to restoring confidence,” Sheets said.  The leaders will discuss a plan for closer European
integration spearheaded by EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  that
centers on common banking supervision and deposit insurance
along with a “criteria-based and phased” move toward joint
debt issuance. It also suggests the group could impose upper
limits on annual budgets and debt levels of nations that use the
euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
