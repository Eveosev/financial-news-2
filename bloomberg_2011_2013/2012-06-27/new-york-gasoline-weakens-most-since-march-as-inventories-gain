New York  gasoline’s premium to
futures fell the most since March after inventories of the fuel
made to East Coast specifications increased.  Stocks of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, rose a second
week, climbing 537,000 barrels to 17.2 million in the region
last week, Energy Department data show.  The premium for RBOB in New York Harbor fell 11 cents to 7
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 3:58 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The differential reached 22 cents on June 22. Prompt delivery
fell 13.47 cents to $2.6904 a gallon.  The surplus of tankers available to haul European gasoline
across the Atlantic Ocean is poised to increase, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  As many as 63 Medium Range vessels may be available for the
voyage over the coming two weeks to July 11, the median estimate
yesterday of eight shipbrokers, traders and owners who
specialize in transporting gasoline showed. That’s the biggest
supply in at least a year and a 34 percent surge from the prior
two-week period, according to survey data.  The premium for RBOB in the  Gulf Coast  rose 0.75 cent to
6.75 cents a gallon.  Flint Hills Resources LLC reported flaring at the Corpus
Christi West refinery in  Texas , according to a community notice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
