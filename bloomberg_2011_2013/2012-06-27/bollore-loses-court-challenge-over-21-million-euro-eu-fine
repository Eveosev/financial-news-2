Bollore SA (BOL) , an  investment company 
controlled by French billionaire  Vincent Bollore , lost a court
challenge to a 21 million-euro ($26.2 million) European Union
antitrust fine for fixing the prices on some paper products.  The EU’s General Court rejected the company’s arguments
that the fine should be canceled or reduced because regulators
didn’t respect Bollore’s defense rights in fining its former
Copigraph unit, the Luxembourg-based tribunal said today.  “None of the grounds raised by the applicant in support of
its conclusions, both for annulment or reformulation, are well
founded,” the court said in its ruling.  Bollore previously won an appeal in 2007 against a 22.7
million-euro penalty imposed in 2001 for colluding with rivals
to fix prices and share markets for carbonless, or self-copying,
paper intended for the duplication of documents. Regulators then
had to reimpose the fine with a 1.4 million-euro reduction in
2010 to correct the procedural error faulted in the 2007
decision. Bollore had earlier challenged the EU’s decision to
hold it responsible for its unit’s fine.  Bollore will appeal the ruling to the EU’s highest court,
the  European Court  of Justice, Michel Calzaroni, an external
spokesman for the company in Paris, said in an e-mail.  France ’s Bollore, Papierfabrik August Koehler AG and
Distribuidora Vizcaina de Papeles, known as Divipa, were among
10 companies the European Commission fined a combined 314
million euros in 2001 for rigging prices in the 850 million-euro
market for carbonless paper from 1992 to 1995.  The case is  T-372/10  Bollore v Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
