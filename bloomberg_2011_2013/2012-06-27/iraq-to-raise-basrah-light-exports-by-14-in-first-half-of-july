Iraq will increase its daily exports
of Basrah Light crude from the  Persian Gulf  by 14 percent in the
first half of July compared with shipments in the previous two
weeks, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The  nation  will ship 18 cargoes from the Basrah Oil
Terminal, unchanged from the second half of this month,
according to the plan. Exports will total 32.8 million barrels,
or 2.19 million barrels a day, compared with 1.91 million a day
two weeks earlier.  The program for the first half of July comprises 13
consignments of 2 million barrels each, two 1.9 million-barrel
lots and three 1 million-barrel shipments.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
