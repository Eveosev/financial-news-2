Lidl, a German discount retailer,
picked four sites in  Serbia  and is looking for more land to
build stores as it moves into the Balkan country.  Lidl bought two lots in the northern cities of Subotica and
Zrenjanin and is “close to completing” purchases in Novi Sad
and Valjevo of land for stores of about 2,000 square meters
(21,500 square feet) each, the company owned by the Neckarsulm,
Germany-based Schwarz Group, said in e-mailed comments today.  The aim is to “secure a bigger number of locations in
Serbia, then open the stores simultaneously,” Lidl said,
declining to comment further on timing and total investment.
Serbia’s  Investment Promotion Agency  for the northern Vojvodina
province said Lidl will open the stores next year, after
agreeing to pay 187.43 million dinars ($2.02 million) for a
11,140 square-meter lot in Novi Sad.  Lidl will be the first major discounter in the biggest
former Yugoslav republic, where average net salary in May
equaled $435. The three largest supermarket chains on the market
of 7.2 million people are owned by Brussels-based  Delhaize Group
SA (DELB) , Croatia’s Agrokor d.d., and Slovenia’s  Mercator Poslovni
Sistem d.d.   To contact the reporter on this story:
