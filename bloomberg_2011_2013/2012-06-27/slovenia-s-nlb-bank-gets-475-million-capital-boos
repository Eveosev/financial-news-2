Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. will get
381 million euros ($475 million) from its shareholders to
strengthen the capital at  Slovenia ’s biggest bank.  The Slovenian government, which holds an indirect majority
in NLB, will purchase 320 million euros of contingent
convertible bonds, while  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , the second largest
investor, will buy 61 million euros in shares, Mojca Strojan,
the spokeswoman of the Ljubljana-based bank, said by telephone
today.  NLB, which in 2011 reported a loss for a third consecutive
year on surging bad loans, must improve its core Tier 1 capital
ratio to meet the requirements of the European Banking Authority
and the Slovenian central bank. The bank is relying on loans
from the  European Central Bank  for liquidity because of limited
access to wholesale funding.  Nova Ljubljanska took 1.2 billion euros of loans out of a
total 2 billion euros taken by Slovenian lenders from the ECB,
the country’s central bank said earlier this month.  The government plans to cut its NLB holding to 25 percent
plus one share, which may happen by the end of the year, Finance
Minister Janez Sustersic has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
