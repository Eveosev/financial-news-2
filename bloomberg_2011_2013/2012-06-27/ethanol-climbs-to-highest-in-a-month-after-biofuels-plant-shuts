Ethanol increased to the highest
price in more than a month as Valero Energy Corp. idled
production at its Linden biofuels plant in  Indiana  because of
“economic reasons.”  Futures gained as the plant, which has an annual capacity
of 110 million gallons, was temporarily halted yesterday, a week
after Valero closed its Albion, Nebraska, ethanol plant.  Bill
Day , a spokesman at company headquarters in  San Antonio , said in
an e-mail that Valero expects “to resume production once market
conditions improve.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 3 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $2.216 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest level since May 18. The increase was the
fourth in a row. The biofuel today traded 8.2 percent below its
average the last year of $2.414 a gallon.  “Ethanol is up today and it needs to be up because the
margins have been poor,” said  Christian Mayer , a market advisor
at Northstar Commodity Investments LLC in Minneapolis. “The
corn market has been going up significantly and so ethanol needs
to work higher.”  Corn for December delivery climbed 9 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $6.33 a bushel on CBOT. Corn is the primary feedstock in U.S.
ethanol production. Futures have surged as much as 30 percent
since touching a 20-month low June 15 as hot, dry weather
threatens U.S. yields.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 3 cents to $2.275 a
gallon in the U.S. Gulf and 2.5 cents to $2.35 on the West
Coast. The biofuel advanced 3 cents to $2.27 in New York and 1.5
cents to $2.195 in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
