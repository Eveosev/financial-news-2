Pitcher  Andy Pettitte  left today’s
start for the New York Yankees after being hit by a batted ball
on his right foot during the fifth inning against the Cleveland
Indians.  With New York ahead 2-1 at Yankee Stadium, the 40-year-old
left-hander was struck on the right foot by a ball hit by Casey
Kotchman. Pettitte landed gingerly on the foot while making the
next pitch, and manager  Joe Girardi  removed him.  Pettitte walked off the field with a limp. There was no
immediate word on the extent of the injury.  The Yankees today placed their No. 1 starter, CC Sabathia,
on the 15-disabled list with a strained groin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
