Saudi Arabia’s shares declined the
most in almost a month as  oil prices  traded below $80 a barrel,
raising investor concern that the world’s top oil exporter may
reduce the size of a $500 billion government stimulus.  Nama Chemicals Co. (NAMA) , a developer of industrial projects,
plunged 6.1 percent.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s biggest lender
by market value, fell the most since June 2. The Tadawul All
Share Index lost 1.7 percent, the biggest drop since June 2, to
6,585.63 at the close in Riyadh. The measure has lost 16 percent
this quarter, poised for the worst since the fourth quarter of
2008. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index retreated 0.8 percent.  “Oil below $80 just creates a psychological effect that
the government will reduce spending and the economy will be
affected,” said  Marwan Shurrab , assistant  fund manager  and
chief trader at Gulfmena Investments Ltd in Dubai. The drop “is
more related to global growth and global demand for
commodities,” he said.  Oil traded below $80 for a fifth day on speculation demand
is faltering as U.S. crude stockpiles increase. Prices had risen
to as much as $110.55 a barrel this year, enabling the Saudi
government to push through with spending plans that have
cushioned economic growth. The economy may expand 4.8 percent
this year, second only to Qatar in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, according to the estimates of 12 economists
on Bloomberg.  ‘Further Deterioration’  Oil for August delivery fell to as low as $78.68 in
electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange before
trading at $79.75 at 4:47 p.m. in Dubai. The GCC, which also
includes the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and
Oman, holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  “Today is the last day of the week so there are fears of
further deterioration of commodity prices over the weekend and
this is affecting sentiment aggressively,” Shurrab said. Saudi
Arabia’s weekend falls on Thursday and Friday.  Nama declined to 13.80 riyals, the lowest close since June
9.  Al Rajhi  lost 2.1 percent to 71.75 riyals.  Dubai’s DFM General Index fell 0.2 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s
ADX General Index retreated 0.5 percent. Qatar’s QE Index
declined 0.3 percent, Bahrain’s gauge lost 0.4 percent and
Oman’s MSM30 Index fell 0.1 percent. Kuwait’s measure was little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
