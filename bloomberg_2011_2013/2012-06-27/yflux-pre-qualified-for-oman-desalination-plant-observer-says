Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) ,  Singapore ’s largest
water treatment company, is one of seven groups pre-qualified to
develop a water desalination project in Oman that may cost $350
million to $400 million, according to the Daily Observer.  The seven have set up consortiums and partnerships ahead of
the July 9 deadline for bid submission for the Ghubrah water
project and that partnering with Hyflux in its bid are Mitsui
Corp. and the Al Tahir group, the Oman newspaper said.  Others reportedly prequalified include Spanish and
Malaysian companies, the paper said. The successful bidder will
be granted a license to design, construct, own, finance, operate
and maintain a 42 million gallon-per-day desalination plant
based on seawater reverse osmosis technology. Oman is the
