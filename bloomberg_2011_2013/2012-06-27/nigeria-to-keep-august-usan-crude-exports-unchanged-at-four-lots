Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, plans to export four 950,000-barrel cargoes of Usan
crude in August, unchanged from July, according to a loading
plan obtained by Bloomberg News.  The nation will also export five shipments of Brass River,
comprising three lots of 950,000 barrels, and one consignment
each of 250,000 and 350,000 barrels, separate plans showed.  Loadings of Abo crude will increase to two cargoes
totalling 1.1 million barrels, compared with 700,000 barrels for
July, a schedule showed.  Shipping plans for Akpo, Erha and Pennington grades haven’t
been released. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
