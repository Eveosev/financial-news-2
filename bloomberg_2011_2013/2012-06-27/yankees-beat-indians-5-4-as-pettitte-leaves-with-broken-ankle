The New York Yankees defeated the
Cleveland Indians 5-4 today at Yankee Stadium after  Andy Pettitte  left in the fifth inning with a broken left ankle.  Robinson Cano had three hits, including a go-ahead two-run
home run in the sixth inning, as the Yankees won their fifth
straight game.  Eric Chavez  had two hits and batted in three runs.  Pettitte, 40, won’t need surgery to repair the fracture,
which he sustained when a ball hit by Casey Kotchman struck his
ankle, the team said. He landed gingerly while making the next
pitch and limped off the field when manager  Joe Girardi  removed
him. The Yankees today placed their No. 1 starter, CC Sabathia,
on the 15-disabled list with a strained groin.  “Bad day for left-handers,” Girardi said in a televised
interview. “Guys are going to have to step up.”  New York relievers Cody Eppley, Clay Rapada, Freddy Garcia,
David Robertson and  Rafael Soriano  combined to allow two runs
over the final four innings following Pettitte’s departure.
Soriano loaded the bases in the ninth inning and walked in a run
before getting a fly out to secure his 17th save of the season.  New York is 46-28, in first place in the American League
East division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
