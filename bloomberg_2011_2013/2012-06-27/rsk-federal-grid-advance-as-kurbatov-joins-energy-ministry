OAO MRSK Holding (MRSK)  and Federal Grid
Co. rallied on speculation the appointment of MRSK’s deputy
general director as deputy energy minister will spur power-
industry reforms that benefit the companies.  MRSK, the country’s largest electricity distribution
company, jumped 10 percent to 1.750 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest gain on the Micex Index and the biggest jump
since August 2009. Federal Grid, the high-voltage transmission
monopoly, jumped 5.5 percent to 19.28 kopeks, the most since
June 6. Federal Grid has lost 39 percent this quarter and MRSK
has fallen 47 percent, the worst quarterly performers on the
Micex.  Mikhail Kurbatov said his new role as deputy to Alexander Novak will make him “useful” for the industry, according to an
interview with  RBC Daily  published today.  “Kurbatov’s appointment may be viewed as a positive
sign,” Dmitry Bulgakov, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
Moscow, said by phone. “During the RAO UES reorganization he
worked at the Economy Ministry supervising reform, so we think
that he may favour more market-oriented decisions in his new
capacity.”  The MSCI Russia Utilities Index gained 3.2 percent, having
declined 40 percent this quarter.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Robert Valpuesta  To contact the reporter on this story:
