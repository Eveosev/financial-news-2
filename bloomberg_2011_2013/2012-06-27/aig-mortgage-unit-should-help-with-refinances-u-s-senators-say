American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
mortgage-insurance unit should remove policies that can prevent
homeowners from refinancing mortgages, three U.S. senators wrote
in a letter today.  United Guaranty Corp. is the only mortgage insurer that
hasn’t removed barriers to refinancing, senators  Barbara Boxer 
of California,  Robert Menendez  of New Jersey and Herb Kohl of
Wisconsin, all Democrats, wrote in the letter addressed to Chief
Executive Officer Kim Garland.  The unit of the bailed-out insurer is unwilling to offer
the same protections on defective loans that competitors are
granting to aid the Home Affordable Refinance Program, Bloomberg
News reported in November. President Barack Obama has said
expanding HARP will make cheaper credit available to more
homeowners with mortgage rates near record lows.  “United Guaranty’s policies are harmful both to your
customers and to the taxpayers,” the senators wrote in the
letter. “This is particularly troubling given that United
Guaranty is a subsidiary of American International Group, which
itself has benefited from taxpayer assistance.”  United Guaranty has participated in HARP since 2009 and
refinanced more than $5.3 billion worth of loans, the firm said
in an e-mailed statement.  “United Guaranty’s review of new servicer loans in no way
interferes with borrowers’ ability to take advantage of HARP or
other loan-modification programs that help families retain their
homes,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
