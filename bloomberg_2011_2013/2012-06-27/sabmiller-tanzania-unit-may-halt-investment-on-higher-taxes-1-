SABMiller Plc (SAB) ’s Tanzanian unit said
it’s considering suspending a $23 million capital investment
plan this year because a tax increase announced by the
government this month may curb beer consumption.  Finance Minister William Mgimwa in his June 14 budget
speech announced a 25 percent increase in excise duty on beer
made from imported unmalted cereals to 525 Tanzanian shillings
(33 cents) a liter (2.1 pints).  “We are reviewing capital expansion based on expected lower
volumes,” TBL Managing Director Robin Goetzsche said in an e-
mailed response to questions today from Dar es Salaam, the
commercial capital. “The rest of our East Africa operations are
unaffected at this stage.”  Tanzania Breweries estimates volume growth this year will
be flat or “marginally negative” because of the tax increase,
against a budgeted forecast of 8 percent, he said. It is “far
too early” to determine how many jobs may be cut, he said.  SABMiller plans to invest $420 million to expand production
at plants in  Dar es Salaam , Mwanza, Arusha and Mbeya, the
company said in a statement published in the Daily News
newspaper today, without specifying the time period.  TBL brews beer including Safari Lager, Kilimanjaro Premium
Lager, Ndovu Special Malt, Eagle Lager, Balimi Lager, Castle
Lager and Castle Lite. Tanzania’s second-biggest brewer after
TBL is Serengeti Breweries Ltd., a unit of  Diageo Plc (DGE) ’s  East
African Breweries Ltd. (EABL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
