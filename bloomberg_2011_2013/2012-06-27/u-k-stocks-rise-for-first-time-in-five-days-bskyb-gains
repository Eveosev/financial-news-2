U.K. stocks  climbed for the first
time in five days after better-than-estimated U.S. data helped
ease concern about the strength of the global economy before
tomorrow’s European Union summit.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and BP Plc climbed with crude oil, while  CRH
Plc (CRH)  and  Wolseley Plc (WOS)  led construction-industry shares higher.
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  rallied 3.1 percent as Britain’s second-
largest bank by market value reiterated its forecast.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 76.96, or 1.4 percent, to 5,523.92
at the close in London, the biggest gain since June 19. The
gauge had lost 3.1 percent over the previous four days amid
concern this week’s summit in Brussels won’t produce decisive
measures to contain Europe’s debt crisis. The FTSE All-Share
Index and Ireland’s ISEQ Index each increased 1.3 percent today.  “Durable goods and pending home sales data both enjoyed
positive reads,” said Will Hedden, a sales trader at IG Index
in London. “Generally, the mood is a little more positive today
despite the pending EU summit.”  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
 Francois Hollande  meet today in Paris before the summit in
Brussels. Merkel faces an increasingly united bloc of euro-area
nations demanding more drastic measures to fight the debt crisis
and preserve the currency union.  Rajoy Measures  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he will urge
other European leaders to take measures to “stabilize markets
using the available instruments.”  “Investors are not expecting a miracle” from the EU
meeting, Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard
Life Investments, wrote in a report. “The best that might be
hoped for is a series of good decisions that begin to steer the
euro zone away from crisis.”  Stocks extended gains today after U.S. data showed more
people than forecast signed contracts to purchase previously
owned homes and orders for durable goods climbed more than
projected.  BG Group led energy companies higher as oil rose as much as
2 percent to $80.92 a barrel in New York. BG rallied 3.8 percent
to 1,256 pence, BP advanced 1.7 percent to 408.5 pence and Royal
Dutch Shell Group Plc, Europe’s largest oil company, added 1.4
percent to 2,106 pence.  CRH, the world’s second-biggest building-materials maker,
advanced 4.2 percent to 1,132 pence in London and Wolseley, the
largest supplier of heating and plumbing products, jumped 3.7
percent to 2,294 pence. Both companies generate more than 40
percent of their revenue in the Americas.  Standard Chartered  led a rebound in banks, climbing 3.1
percent to 1,375 pence as the lender reiterated its forecast for
profit in 2012.  Standard Chartered  The bank is “comfortable” with estimates for 2012 pretax
profit of $7.46 billion, Finance Director Richard Meddings said
on a conference call with analysts today. That’s a 10 percent
increase on the $6.78 billion year-earlier figure.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  also
rebounded from four days of losses. The shares advanced 1.9
percent to 196.05 pence and 2.4 percent to 233.1 pence,
respectively.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc gained 3.5 percent to 31.16 pence
after the Financial Times reported the lender may sell 630
branches to Co-Operative Group Ltd. as early as today.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  climbed 1.3 percent to 72.9 pence, rebounding
from a two-day selloff. The world’s largest publicly traded
hedge fund manager said the net asset value of its Man AHL
Diversified fund increased 1.1 percent last week, boosted by
“bearish positioning” in commodities and stocks.  Northgate Gains  Northgate Plc (NTG) , a provider of leased vans in Spain and the
U.K., surged 17 percent to 209 pence, the largest gain in almost
three years. The company reported an increase in pretax profit
and said it will pay its first dividend since 2009.  Glencore International Plc fell 1.5 percent to 298.3 pence
after Qatar Holding LLC demanded the company’s 16.9 billion-
pound ($26.4 billion) bid for the rest of  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  be
increased by 16 percent.  Qatar, which built an 11 percent stake in Xstrata since
February at a cost of about $4.3 billion, wants the agreed offer
raised to 3.25 Glencore shares for each of Xstrata’s, compared
with the existing offer of 2.8 terms. Xstrata shares gained 1.4
percent to 796.6 pence.  Evraz Plc (EVR) , the steelmaker part-owned by Russian billionaire
 Roman Abramovich , sank 2.9 percent to 248.9 pence after German
rival Salzgitter AG said it can no longer forecast that its
steel division will break even this year.  Yule Catto & Co. (YULC)  sank 22 percent to 138 pence, the largest
drop since at least 1989, after the maker of specialty chemicals
said demand in North America and Europe has deteriorated.  Safestore Holdings Plc (SAFE) , the U.K.’s largest self-storage
operator, plunged 9.7 percent to 102 pence after reporting a
first-half net loss. That was the biggest drop since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
