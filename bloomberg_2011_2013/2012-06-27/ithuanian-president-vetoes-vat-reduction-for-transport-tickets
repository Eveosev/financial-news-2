Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite vetoed a value-added  tax cut  passed yesterday by
lawmakers after calls from Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius to
reject the changes.  The VAT reduction to 9 percent from 21 percent for public
transportation would cost 70 million litai ($25 million) in
budget revenue and gives “no guarantee” that tickets would be
cheaper, the president said today in an e-mailed statement.  Grybauskaite backed a lower VAT for newspapers and
magazines and car repairs for the disabled starting Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
