Last month, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  became the first Indian head of state in 25 years to  make a visit to Myanmar  (formerly  Burma ), the eastern neighbor that has for 50 years been ruled by a repressive military junta. The visit was both a welcome gesture of reconnection and a reminder of a wasted half-century in relations between two newly independent states ( Burma  was decolonized in 1948, a year after  India ) that  share a border  of more 1,500 kilometers (900 miles). The meeting of top representatives of the world's largest democracy and an authoritarian but liberalizing regime was also a reminder of how the ideology of the nation-state -- appearing in this region in response to colonization, straining against local traditions of feudalism, despotism and dynastic rule to fashion a secure transition to democracy, and eventually spawning a fresh jostle for power and influence in an often arbitrarily broken-up subcontinent -- has served to disrupt  age-old civilizational links  in South  Asia , probably for good. Realists would also say that the rapprochement was  geopolitically inevitable , given Burma's vast reserves of natural resources (including  natural gas ) and  China's growing influence  over its economy, a reward for a no-questions-asked engagement with the junta. A team of prominent Indian businessmen accompanied Singh on his visit, seeking  new markets  in areas such as telecommunications and manufacturing. The door to Singh's visit was opened by a  series of reforms  over the last 18 months by Myanmar's president,  Thein Sein , that led to the release of many political prisoners, a road map for a return to democracy and the party of the country's foremost dissident,  Aung San Suu Kyi , being readmitted into national politics. Myanmar has ceased to be the pariah state that it was for several decades;  the U.S., too , eased sanctions on investments and appointed an ambassador after 22 years. In April, Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, contested by-elections for 46 seats in the 664-seat parliament,  winning 43 in a landslide . Last week, Suu Kyi, who was  freed in 2010  after more than 15 years under house arrest,  left the country  for the first time in 24 years, having been given an assurance that she would be allowed to return. Among the many stops on her travels was Oslo, where she belatedly accepted the  Nobel Peace Prize  awarded to her in 1991. There remains a concern, though, that these concessions are merely the price agreed upon by Myanmar's junta to keep its hold and to resuscitate the country's ravaged economy. In " Delhi Takes First Step For Great Leap To Myanmar " in The Telegraph of Kolkata, probably India's most readable English daily, Ashis Chakrabarti reported from Naypyitaw, the capital of Myanmar, on May 29: And in  India Today , the Member of Parliament  Shashi Tharoor  supplied an overview of India-Myanmar relations and some thoughts about what lay ahead: But let's not assume that realpolitik and self-interest are the only principles on which foreign policy or political action must be pursued. If that were the case, there would be no frame to understand the heroic struggles and many sacrifices made for the cause of Burmese democracy by Suu Kyi, the subject of a good  recent biography  by Peter Popham. The historian Ramachandra Guha focused in  the Telegraph  not on the junta's engagement with India, but on the relationship of Suu Kyi's nonviolent resistance with a similar tradition in Indian politics represented by  Mahatma Gandhi . Guha wrote: For Guha, "Suu Kyi is far closer to Gandhi, and a much better Gandhian, than any Indian now living." And in a long essay called " Burmese Days " in the  New York  Review of Books, Christian Caryl advocated a skeptical attitude to the recent political thaw in Myanmar: In one of the greatest Indian novels,  Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's "Srikanta ," the eponymous protagonist, a weak-willed young man who has just had his heart broken, heads by ship to the old Burmese capital of Rangoon (now Yangon) to start a new life. The Burmese scenes in the book are based on Sarat Chandra's own experiences as a young man in Burma in the early years of the 20th century, at a time when Rangoon was the  second-busiest immigration port  in the world. But these aren't scenes that any modern Indian writer has been able to update because of Burma's retreat from the world. If Myanmar's ruling elites prove to be serious about opening a road for a return to democracy, the resultant softening of borders would be a step into the future that would also be a step back into the past.
