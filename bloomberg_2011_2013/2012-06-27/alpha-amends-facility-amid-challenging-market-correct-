Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , the
second-biggest U.S. coal producer, amended its $1.6 billion
secured credit facility to increase the company’s financial
flexibility after domestic demand for the fuel slumped.  The amendment allows Alpha to suspend the covenant
restricting the ratio of its  debt  to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization or Ebitda, the Bristol,
Virginia-based company said in a statement distributed today by
PR Newswire.  “We continue to navigate a challenging market
environment,” Frank Wood, Alpha’s chief financial officer, said
in the statement.  Alpha is among U.S. coal producers who have closed mines
and cut spending this year after demand was curtailed by a
combination of cheaper natural gas, a warm winter and regulatory
moves to curb emissions from coal-fired power stations.  Peabody
Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. producer, said today its capital
expenditure will be $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2012, compared
with an April forecast of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.  Alpha rose 6 percent to $8.19 at the close in New York. The
shares have dropped 60 percent this year. Peabody increased 5.5
percent to $22.27.  Debt Holiday  Lenders gave Alpha a “holiday” from a “net leverage
ratio”  requirement  to keep its total debt level at or below
3.75 times Ebitda through 2014, according to today’s statement.
In exchange, the company will be required to maintain its net
secured debt level at no higher than 2.5 times Ebitda during
that same period.  Alpha’s net leverage ratio covenant will be restored in
2015. The company said it will have to keep it total debt level
within 4.25 times Ebitda starting in the first quarter of that
year, and that the requirement would be reduced to 4 times in
the second quarter of 2015, and 3.75 times in the following
quarter.  Lenders also agreed to lower Alpha’s interest coverage
requirement, a measure of how easily a company can pay interest,
by 25 basis points to 2.25 times during the fourth quarter of
this year, and to 2 times in the first quarter of 2013. Alpha
obtained its loan in May 2011 from Morgan Stanley and Citigroup
Inc. to back its purchase of Massey Energy Corp.  The company must maintain at least $500 million of
liquidity for the rest of this year and in 2013, according to
the statement.  Coal’s Share  Coal’s share of U.S. power generation has fallen to 34
percent, the lowest level since at least 1973, the Energy
Information Administration said in a June 5 report. U.S. coal
demand will drop by 100 million to 120 million tons, Peabody
said today in a statement.  “Peabody will continue to evaluate U.S. production levels
as the year progresses,” the St. Louis-based company’s Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce said in the
statement.  Peabody also said that it repurchased $240 million of bonds
and $100 million of shares during the second quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
