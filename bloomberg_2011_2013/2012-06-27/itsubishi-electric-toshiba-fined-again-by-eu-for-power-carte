Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  and
 Toshiba Corp. (6502)  were fined a second time by European Union
regulators in a price-fixing probe over power-generation
equipment after prior penalties were overturned by an EU court.  Mitsubishi Electric must pay 74.8 million euros ($70.8
million) and Toshiba 56.8 million euros for agreeing with rivals
to set prices for gas-insulated switchgear, which power
companies buy to control electrical flow. The two companies were
also jointly fined 4.7 million euros.  The fines are lower than the original 2007 penalties when
Mitsubishi Electric was fined 118.6 million euros and Toshiba
was fined 90.9 million euros. The  EU General Court  last year
ruled that the European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s antitrust
agency, had punished the two Tokyo-based companies more harshly
than European competitors in the electrical-equipment cartel.
The decision forced EU officials to recalculate the fines.  “Today’s decision ensures that Mitsubishi and Toshiba
receive an appropriate fine for their participation in the
cartel,” said the EU in a statement. “The decision ensures
that companies that have infringed EU competition law do not
escape sanctions due to procedural shortcomings.”  The EU fined 10 companies, including  Areva SA (AREVA)  and  Alstom
SA (ALO) , a total of 750.7 million euros in January 2007 for fixing
prices and carving up the market for gas-insulated switchgear
from 1988 to 2004.  The court canceled the EU’s initial fines for Mitsubishi
and Toshiba because regulators used sales figures for a
“reference year” that differed from the one used for other
companies. The new fine is based on the “same parameters as in
the 2007 decision with the exception of the reference year,”
the EU said.  Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba didn’t immediately respond
to e-mails before normal business hours in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
