Italian two-year notes extended
their gain after the country sold 9 billion euros of bills.  The yield on Italian notes maturing in April 2014 decreased
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.63 percent at
10:09 a.m. London time. Ten-year  yields  were also five basis
points lower at 6.14 percent.  Italy  sold  185-day treasury bills at 2.957 percent, up from
2.104 percent at the last sale of similar-maturity debt on May
29. Investors bid for 1.62 times the amount offered, similar to
the 1.61 times last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
