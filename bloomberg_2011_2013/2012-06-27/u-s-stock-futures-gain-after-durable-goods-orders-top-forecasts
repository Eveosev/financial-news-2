U.S. stock futures increased after
government data showed orders for durable goods increased more
than forecast.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1
percent to 1,317.3 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York .   Bookings rose 1.1 percent, the first increase in three
months, a Commerce Department report showed today in  Washington .
The median forecast of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 0.5 percent gain. Excluding the volatile
transportation equipment, orders for goods meant to last at
least three years advanced 0.4 percent.  U.S. stocks advanced yesterday, sending the S&P 500 up 0.5
percent, as optimism about the housing market tempered concern
about a worsening of  Europe ’s debt crisis.         The S&P 500 has risen 3.3 percent after slumping 9.9
percent from a four-year high on April 2 through the first day
of June. The rebound came after the index’s valuation slid to
12.9 times reported earnings, the cheapest level since November.  Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, is
scheduled to report second-quarter results on July 9 to start
the earnings season for Dow Jones Industrial Average companies.
Profits at  S&P 500  companies fell 1.1 percent in the April-June
period, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That would mark the first year-over-year decrease since 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
