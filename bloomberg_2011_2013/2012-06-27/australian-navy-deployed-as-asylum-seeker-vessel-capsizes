Australia  deployed its navy to help
with a rescue operation after a boat carrying as many as 150
suspected asylum seekers capsized in Indonesian waters, the
second such incident within a week.  A merchant vessel and tug are at the scene recovering
survivors about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of  Christmas
Island  after a distress call was received at about 6 a.m. Sydney
time today, Jo Meehan, a spokeswoman for the  Australian Maritime
Safety Authority , said by telephone. Two navy ships are expected
to arrive later today to help with the effort, she said.  About 90 people may have died after a similar incident June
21 near Christmas Island, an Australian territory about 2,600
kilometers northwest of Perth that is used as an immigration
detention center for asylum seekers. There have been at least
four such fatal incidents since 2010 as refugees seeking asylum,
usually from the  Middle East , pay illegal people smugglers in
Indonesia thousands of dollars to ferry them in overcrowded
boats to Australia.  The so-called boat people issue is hurting Prime Minister
 Julia Gillard , whose Labor government is in a political
stalemate with  Tony Abbott â€™s opposition over where to base
offshore refugee processing centers.  A group of backbench lawmakers, including independent
members of parliament that support the minority government, are
pressuring Gillard and Abbott to reach a compromise and devise a
policy that will discourage people smuggling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
