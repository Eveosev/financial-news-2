Metalloinvest (METIN) , Russian billionaire
 Alisher Usmanov ’s mining company, said it plans to spend $850
million to build the biggest hot-briquetted iron plant, raising
by 75 percent its capacity in the steelmaking material.  It will invest the funds in the “the world’s largest HBI
plant” with annual capacity of 1.8 million metric tons by 2015
at its LGOK unit in central Russia, said Chief Investment and
Strategy Officer Dmitry Babkin at a Metal Bulletin conference.  HBI is used as an alternative to producing steel from scrap
in electric-arc furnaces. Unlike iron-ore, the material doesn’t
require the use of coking coal to make steel. Metalloinvest
decided to expand production of the value-added material because
of the risk of a possible “sharp correction” of iron-ore
prices at some point, Babkin said in Moscow.  Steel producers in  Russia  including OAO Severstal and OAO
Novolipetsk Steel are building mini-mills that use scrap as a
primary raw material. Russia may see a shortage of scrap, making
it profitable for steelmakers to switch to HBI, Babkin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
