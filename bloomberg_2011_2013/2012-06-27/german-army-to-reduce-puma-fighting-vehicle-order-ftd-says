Germany ’s armed forces plan to cut
an order for Puma fighting vehicles, reducing the appropriation
request by 340 million euros ($425 million), the Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing government documents submitted to
parliament’s budget committee.  German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere said last fall
he would order 350 of the German-built vehicles instead of the
405 originally planned, the Hamburg-based  newspaper  said in an
e-mailed version of article to be published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
