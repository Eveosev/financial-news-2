Vietnam  said it may fail to achieve
its goal of attracting at least $15 billion of committed foreign
direct investment this year amid a faltering global recovery and
a domestic growth slowdown.  “It will be very hard to meet the target,” said Do Nhat
Hoang, head of the Foreign Investment Agency at the Ministry of
Planning & Investment. “We are facing domestic economic
difficulties, fueled by unfavorable developments in global
markets that have negatively impacted foreign investment into
Vietnam this year,” he told reporters in Hanoi today.  The Southeast Asian nation has been buffeted by a credit
crunch after the central bank pushed up  interest rates  last year
to fight the fastest  inflation  in  Asia , and with some Vietnamese
banks’ ability to lend constrained by a lack of capital. The
 economy  expanded 4 percent in the first quarter of the year, the
slowest pace since 2009.  Disbursement of foreign investment may fall to $10 billion
this year, lower than an earlier forecast of $11 billion, Hoang
said. Vietnam aimed to attract $15 billion to $16 billion of
pledged foreign investments in 2012, according to a Dec. 30
government statement.  To contact the reporter for this story:
