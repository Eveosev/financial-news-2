A group of builders consisting from
 Skanska AB (SKAB)  and  Strabag SE (STR)  placed the cheapest offer in the
Slovak goverment’s tender for a highway section,  Sme  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The group offered to build a 13.5-kilometer (8.4 mile)
section of the main east-west highway for 338 million euros
($422 million), the newspaper said. This compares with the
government’s estimates of 896.5 million euros of the costs for
the project, which includes an eight-kilometer tunnel, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
