Units of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s
biggest bank, and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  closed a $444
million funding for a 200 megawatt Invenergy LLC wind farm being
built in Illinois.  The financing will support the development of the
California Ridge wind farm which is under construction northwest
of Danville, Illinois, Santander’s Boston-based unit Sovereign
Bank N.A. said today in a statement.  Bank facilities syndicated among five banks totaling $270
million and a longer term $174 million senior note tranche
provided by Prudential Capital Group and another institutional
investor made up the financing, Sovereign said.  California Ridge will  consist  of 134  General Electric Co. (GE) 
1.6 megawatt turbines. Chicago-based Invenergy will sell power
from the project to the  Tennessee Valley Authority  under a long-
term power purchase agreement once completed later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
