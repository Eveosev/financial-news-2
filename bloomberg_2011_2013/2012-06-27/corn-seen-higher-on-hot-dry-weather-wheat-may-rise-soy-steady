What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade as hot, dry weather curbs crop
prospects, Mike Zuzolo, president of Global Commodity Analytics
in Lafayette,  Indiana , said by telephone. Temperatures are
expected to be hotter than usual and rainfall will be below
normal this week and next, Telvent DTN said in a report today.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange , as demand for the grain as a source of livestock
feed increases along with corn prices, Zuzolo said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel lower in
Chicago, Zuzolo said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.1 cent to 0.2 cent lower per pound, and soybean-meal futures
may open $2 to $4 lower per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
