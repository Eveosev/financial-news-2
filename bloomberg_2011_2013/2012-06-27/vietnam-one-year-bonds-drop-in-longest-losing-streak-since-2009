Vietnam’s one-year bonds fell for a
sixth day, the longest losing streak since November 2009, on
speculation government measures to increase credit are spurring
banks to accumulate cash for lending. The dong strengthened.  The government will target loan growth of 2 percent a month
in the second half and full-year expansion of 12 percent to 13
percent, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said June 15
without giving comparative numbers.  “Banks want to take profits to get more cash for lending
activities,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at Viet Capital
Securities Co. in  Ho Chi Minh City .  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark one-year bonds rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.54 percent,
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since May 9.  The dong strengthened 0.2 percent to 20,890 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of
Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade
as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
