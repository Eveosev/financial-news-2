Sony Corp. (6758)  Chief Executive Officer
 Kazuo Hirai  and predecessor  Howard Stringer  didn’t get bonuses
last year after the maker of Bravia TVs posted a record loss.  Hirai’s base salary in the year ended March 31 rose 29
percent to 88 million yen ($1.1 million), from 68 million yen
the previous year, when his total pay was 101 million yen, the
company said in securities filings today.  Stringer’s base salary was cut 6 percent to 277 million
yen, from 295 million yen the previous year, when his total pay
was 345 million yen, excluding stock options, the company said.  Hirai, 51, replaced Stringer, 70, on April 1. Stringer,
whose tenure was capped by four straight years of losses at the
Tokyo-based company, ended his operational role and was elected
chairman of Sony’s board of directors today.  Speaking at Sony’s annual shareholders meeting, Hirai vowed
to accelerate reform at its electronics business to revive the
company after it reported a 457 billion-yen net loss in the year
ended March 31. The maker of PlayStation game consoles is
cutting 10,000 jobs as part of a turnaround plan and  forecasts 
net income of 30 billion yen in the year started April 1.  Sony’s general counsel, Nicole Seligman, also didn’t
receive a bonus in the year ended March. Her total compensation,
excluding stock options, fell to 128 million yen from 170
million yen the previous period, today’s filings show.  The executives’ compensation compares with the 987 million
yen earned by  Carlos Ghosn , chief executive of Nissan Motor Co.,
 Japan ’s most profitable carmaker. The 58-year-old CEO’s pay
increased from 982 million yen a year earlier, Ghosn said at the
company’s annual general meeting yesterday in Yokohama.  Publicly traded companies in Japan are required to disclose
executive pay exceeding 100 million yen a year. Ghosn was the
highest-paid executive in the past two years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
