VTB Capital is advising investors to
buy Russia’s local OFZ bonds due in 2018 before Euroclear Bank
SA is allowed access to the Russian market later this year.  The yield premium on the bonds over the ruble Eurobond due
the same year has risen 69 basis points this year to 130 basis
points. That spread may decline again “within the next few
weeks” if the government announces when OFZs will become
available through Euroclear, Nikolay Podguzov, VTB Capital’s
head of fixed-income strategy, wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
