The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  climbed 1.7
percent to 1,365.93 by the close in Moscow, gaining for the
second day. That pared the benchmark’s quarterly decline to 10
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index advanced 1.4 percent
to 1,306.82.  The following are among the most active equities in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Acron (AKRN RX) jumped 1.5 percent to 1,147.50 rubles,
the most in almost two weeks. The Russian fertilizer producer
climbed after posting a first-quarter net income gain of 34
percent from a year earlier.  OAO Lukoil (LKOH RX) added 2 percent to 1,773.70 rubles,
the highest level since April 28. Russia’s second-largest oil
producer gained after Interfax reported shareholders approved
interim dividend payments.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MTSS RX) gained 2.9 percent to
228.15 rubles, rising for the second day. Shareholders of
 Russia ’s biggest mobile-phone operator approved paying a total
of 30.4 billion rubles ($924 million) in 2011 dividends, 72
percent of last year’s net income.  OAO MRSK Holding (MRKH RX) surged 10 percent to 1.750
rubles, the steepest jump since August 2009, making it the
biggest gainer on the Micex. Federal Grid Co. (FEES RX) rose 5.5
percent to 19.28 kopeks. The country’s largest electricity
distribution company and the high-voltage transmission monopoly
rallied on speculation the appointment of MRSK’s deputy general
director as deputy energy minister will spur power-industry
reforms that benefit the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
