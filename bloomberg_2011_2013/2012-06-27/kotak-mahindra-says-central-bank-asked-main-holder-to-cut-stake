Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB)  said its
controlling shareholder has been asked by the central bank to
reduce his stake to 20 percent by March 31, 2018.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will “take a view on dilution”
over the two years following that deadline, according to a
statement filed by the Mumbai-based bank with the stock
exchange. The holding may have to be reduced to 10 percent
“depending upon the prescription of promoter holding in the new
bank guidelines,” it said.  The controlling shareholder’s current stake is 45.21
percent, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
