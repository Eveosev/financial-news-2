New York Times Co. (NYT) , aiming to
capture readers in one of the world’s largest consumer markets,
is introducing a Chinese-language Web version of its flagship
newspaper in China today and will expand the service over the
next several months.  The  free site  is designed to serve China’s growing
population of educated and affluent readers, the New York-based
company said in a statement. The site will have a dedicated
staff of 30 researchers, engineers and editors based in  Hong
Kong  and Beijing, producing a combination of original stories
and translated articles. New York Times journalists working in
the Hong Kong and Beijing bureaus will also contribute.  Times Co., based in New York, has been accelerating its
shift to the Internet and has recently added people with a
technology background to its board as it looks for a new chief
executive with digital experience.  Joseph Kahn, foreign editor of the New York Times, will
oversee editorial operations from New York.  Craig Smith , a
managing director, will manage business operations, based in
Beijing.  The Chinese edition will feature advertising from luxury-
goods retailers, including  Salvatore Ferragamo Italia SpA (SFRGF) ,
Cartier Ltd.,  Prada SpA (PRDSF)  and  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMUY) ,
said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the publisher. Times Co.
is looking to bring in financial-services advertisers as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
