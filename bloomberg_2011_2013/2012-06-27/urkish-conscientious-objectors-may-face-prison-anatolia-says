Turkey  may send young men to jail if
they decline to do military service for reasons of conscience,
Anatolia news agenmcy reported, citing Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz.  Military service is compulsory for all males over 19 years
of age, and the European Court of  Human Rights  has delivered
rulings against Turkey several times over its treatment of
conscientious objectors, the news agency cited Yilmaz as saying.  The government is working to prevent what the Strasbourg-
based court calls “civic death,” or repeated conviction each
time a man refuses to do military service, Yilmaz told Anatolia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
