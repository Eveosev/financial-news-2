Energy Transfer Partners’
Transwestern natural gas pipeline is returning the Station 4
compressor in Arizona to service after a cooling motor outage at
one of the units, said Vicki Granado, a spokeswoman for the
company in  Dallas .  “Repairs are nearly complete,” she said in an e-mail.  Transwestern declared a force majeure event for the gas
compressor station, according to a posting on the pipeline’s
website. The notice said capacity for the Thoreau/West system
will be reduced to 1.175 billion British thermal units a day
from 1.225 billion. The system’s capacity may return to 1.225
million Btu a day tomorrow, according to the notice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
