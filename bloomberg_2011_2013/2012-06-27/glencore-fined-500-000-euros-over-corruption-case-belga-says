A  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  unit
and Union Invivo were each fined 500,000 euros ($622,800) by a
Belgian court in a corruption case involving a European Union
official, Belga reported.  The criminal appeal court in Brussels gave a 14-month
prison sentence to a European Commission official for providing
confidential information on agriculture markets to companies,
the  news agency  said. The official was also fined 55,000 euros.  Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Glencore in Baar,
Switzerland, said the company received the ruling and is
considering its position.  Union Invivo didnâ€™t immediately answer a call after
business hours seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
