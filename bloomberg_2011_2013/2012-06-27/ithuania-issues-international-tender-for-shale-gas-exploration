Lithuania announced an international
tender for shale gas exploration to help diversify energy
resources in the Baltic country.  Shale gas could become “a realistic and economically
competitive alternative to sole supplier Gazprom,” the Energy
Ministry said in a statement on its website today.  Lithuania plans to issue licenses for two exploration
fields and sign an agreement with the winners in the first
quarter of 2013, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
