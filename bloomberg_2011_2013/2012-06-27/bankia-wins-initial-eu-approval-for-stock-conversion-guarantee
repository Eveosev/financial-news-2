Crisis-hit Spanish lender  Bankia SA (BKIA) 
won temporary approval from European Union competition
regulators to convert 4.465 billion euros of preference shares
in an attempt to boost the bank’s core capital.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm,
also provisionally approved a 19 billion-euro liquidity
guarantee for the lender, the regulator said in an e-mailed
statement. The measures apply to both Bankia and its parent firm
BFA, the commission said.  “There is no doubt that the beneficiary will need to
undergo deep restructuring,”  Joaquin Almunia , the bloc’s
antitrust chief, said in the statement.  Spain  formally requested a bailout for its banks this week
as the nation struggles to bolster the resilience of some of its
lenders. The request followed the nationalization of Bankia,
which subsequently sought 19 billion euros of government funds.  “The conversion of preference shares into capital will
simplify the ownership structure of BFA, which becomes fully
state owned, thus making the necessary restructuring decisions
easier to take,” Almunia said.  Spain has committed to provide a restructuring plan for
Bankia and BFA to EU antitrust regulators within six months, the
commission said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
