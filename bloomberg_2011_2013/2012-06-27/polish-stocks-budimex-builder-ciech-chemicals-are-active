Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  gained for a
second day, adding less than 0.1 percent to 2,253.44 as of 10:08
a.m. in Warsaw, trimming the quarterly decline to 1.5 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Budimex SA (BDX PW) rose 2.6 percent to 66.7 zloty after a
group led by Poland’s largest construction company won a 333
million-zloty ($98 million) contract to design and build a waste
incinerator in Bialystok, eastern Poland.  Ciech SA (CIE)  , a Polish chemicals maker, declined 2.1
percent to 21 zloty as a technical indicator suggested the
stock’s rally was overdone. Ciech’s 14-day relative strength
index stood at 83 at the close yesterday. A reading above 70
indicates to some technical analysts a security may fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
