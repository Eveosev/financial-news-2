The  U.S. chemical industry , which is
building factories to take advantage of low-cost natural gas,
risks over expanding unless producers take steps now to increase
exports, KPMG LLC said.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and other producers may spend $25 billion
on new and expanded factories that convert ethane and other
natural gas liquids into chemical building blocks and plastics,
according to a KPMG report released today. Increasing exports is
the only way to avoid a drop in earnings that will result from
building too much capacity, the report said.  U.S. chemical exports rose to a record $86.9 billion last
year, Census Bureau data show, as an abundant supply of gas from
shale formations provided a cost advantage over producers in
Europe and  Asia , where chemicals are made mostly from oil.
Accelerating exports may require companies to invest in supply
chains and form joint ventures with partners in faster-growing
regions,  KPMG  said.  “U.S. chemical companies need to take actions today that
will guarantee markets for products to be produced in four or
five years’ time,” Mike Shannon, global and U.S. leader of
KPMG’s chemicals and performance technologies practice, said in
a statement. “This will require a significant transformation of
operating models for U.S. companies who have traditionally been
focused on the domestic marketplace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
