Apple Inc. (AAPL)  will start sales of music
and movies through the iTunes store in  Hong Kong , Singapore,
Taiwan and nine other Asian markets as it expands in the region.  Customers in Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Vietnam will also be able
to buy music and rent movies through the iTunes store, Apple
said in a  statement  posted on its website today. Consumers in
these countries have so far only been able to buy apps from the
App Store.  The Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan accounted for 21
percent of Appleâ€™s revenue last fiscal year, growing from 13
percent a year before, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The share of sales generated in the Americas, Europe and Japan
declined for the Cupertino, California-based maker of iPod music
players and iPad tablet computers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
