Naspers Ltd. (NPN)  may acquire 10 to 20
Internet companies this year as Africa’s largest media company
considers expansion in eastern Europe, Chief Executive Officer
Koos Bekker said.  “We see some investment opportunities in the e-commerce
space, although opportunities are lower than we’ve had in the
past,” Bekker said today in a phone interview from  Cape Town ,
where the company is based. The company will probably study  100
to 200 potential acquisitions this year, after having examined
as many as 300 annually in the last two years, he said. “We
close about one in 20 deals that we look at.”  Most of the opportunities are in eastern Europe, where the
company owns an 80 percent interest in  Turkey ’s Vipindirim
Electronic Services Plc. The South African company is
considering fewer and smaller deals as the number of attractive
targets declines, the CEO said.  Naspers, which spent 1.85 billion rand ($221 million) on
acquisitions in the year through March, had 9.8 billion rand in
cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period, up from 8.7
billion rand a year earlier, it said in a statement today.  “There isn’t much to buy with the cash,” said Bekker.  Revenue in the year through March 2013 will rise at the
same pace as in fiscal 2012, he said. Profit growth will remain
“fairly flat” as the company will also use cash to invest in
existing businesses, Bekker said.  “We’re the number one  Internet company  in eastern
Europe,” Bekker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
