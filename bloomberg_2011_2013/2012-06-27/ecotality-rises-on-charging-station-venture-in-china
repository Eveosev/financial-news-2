Ecotality Inc. (ECTY) , a U.S. provider of
electric-vehicle charging systems, rose the most in more than
two years after forming a joint venture to build charging
stations in  China .  Ecotality gained 35 percent to 56 cents at the close in New
York, the most since August 2009.  Ecotality and China’s Changchun Eco-Power Technology Co.
formed Tianjin Eco-Power Technology Co. to install chargers
across China, according to a statement today. The venture will
build and distribute equipment to provide power for two- and
three-wheel vehicles, buses and airport ground-support units.  “China is rapidly expanding its leadership position in the
electric vehicle market by implementing fleets and public
transit applications that require high-power charging
solutions,” Jonathan Read, chief executive officer of San
Francisco-based Ecotality, said in the statement.  With today’s gain, Ecotality has a market value of $13.4
million. The joint venture is subject to the final approval of
the Chinese government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
