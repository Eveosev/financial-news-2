The European Union will publish an
action plan later this year to rein in illegal and
“unregulated” online gambling.  The paper will include measures to clamp down “on the many
illegal websites, often hosted in offshore havens,” that offer
gambling services,  Michel Barnier , the EU internal market chief,
said in a speech in Brussels today.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm,
will also propose measures to “effectively regulate and
supervise” legal gaming sites, Barnier said. The action plan
will be published “in the autumn,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
