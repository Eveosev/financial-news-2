Economic reports are due to take a
turn for the better that will lift U.S. stocks, according to
Binky Chadha, chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.  Investors are suffering from “data disappointment” that
has become extreme by historical standards, Chadha wrote in a
report two days ago. “The typical pattern from here would be
for fewer negative surprises and then positive ones.”  The CHART OF THE DAY is similar to one that he used to
illustrate the link between economic figures and share prices.
The chart compares the four-week average of initial claims for
 unemployment benefits , as compiled by the Labor Department, with
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 2007.  Changes in jobless claims explain 88 percent of the  S&P
500 ’s performance during the period, according to statistical
analysis cited in the report. The figure is near a 100 percent
limit when two values move in lockstep.  As the relationship suggests, economic data “have been the
key driver of equities,” Chadha wrote. They largely explain why
stocks have retreated in the past few weeks, the New York-based
strategist added. The S&P 500 has fallen as much as 9.9 percent
from this year’s high, set on April 2.  Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and slowing growth in
 emerging markets  have contributed to the decline, the report
said. Any stock-market rebound triggered by policy changes on
these issues won’t last unless the economic data turn around, he
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
