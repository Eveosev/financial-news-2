Indonesia ’s rupiah gained, snapping
a three-day drop, after global investors raised holdings of the
nation’s bonds. Government notes declined.  International funds bought 1.6 trillion rupiah ($165
million) more sovereign  notes  than they sold last week, finance
ministry data show. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares rose
after European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  submitted a  10-
year road map  to reshape the euro area through common banking
supervision and  deposit insurance  ahead of a summit of the
region’s leaders tomorrow.  “We have seen foreign investors return to Indonesia’s
bonds,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the Jakarta-based head of
treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “The rupiah is
still driven by sentiment, and investors are expecting results
from the summit that can produce long-term solutions.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.2 percent to 9,489 per dollar as
of 3:35 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has lost 3.5 percent since
the end of March, headed for its biggest quarterly decline since
the first three months of 2009.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, slid two percentage points to 8.5
percent today. That was the biggest drop since Jan. 13.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.28
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. The yield rose 35 basis points this quarter and 25
basis points this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
