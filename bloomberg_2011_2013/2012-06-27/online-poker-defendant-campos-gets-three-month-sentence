Former SunFirst Bank official John
Campos, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor banking charge, was
sentenced to three months in jail for his role in processing
payments for an illegal Internet poker site.  Campos, 59, a former part-owner and vice chairman of the
 St. George , Utah, bank, received the sentence in a hearing today
before U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  in  Manhattan . Kaplan
rejected Campos’s request for a non-jail sentence.  Kaplan told Campos he was “shocked” by testimony by a
former lawyer for the bank that he had advised Campos that
accepting the poker payments business would violate the law.  “You knew that what you were doing in connection with this
bank was illegal and you went along anyway,” Kaplan said.  In addition to the jail time, Kaplan sentenced Campos to
three years’ probation. As part of a plea deal, Campos
agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a
bank.  Campos is one of 11 people charged last April, among them
the founders of Pokerstars, Full Tilt Poker and  Absolute Poker .
Prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan claim the three companies illegally circumvented a
2006 law that bars banks from processing payments to offshore
gambling websites.  The case is U.S. v. Tzvetkoff, 10-CR-00336, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
