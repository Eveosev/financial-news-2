Cantor Fitzgerald LP, the investment
bank with a workforce of about 8,000, plans to add another 800
employees to its broker-dealer in coming years through
acquisitions and hiring.  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the institutional broker-dealer
that employs 1,600, would add workers, Shawn Matthews, the
unit’s chief executive officer, said today in a phone interview.
The New York-based firm is expanding in asset management and
investment banking, looking at regions including  South America 
and Eastern Europe, Matthews said.  “We’re just looking to get bigger and better at the things
we do,” said Matthews, 45. “There’s a lot of opportunity for
us to take advantage of.”  Matthews said the 800 workers would be in addition to the
200 employees the firm is adding in 2012. The biggest U.S. banks
have been retrenching amid stricter regulations and capital
rules. Concern that U.S. economic growth will remain weak and
the European sovereign-debt crisis may worsen have hurt earnings
at larger banks.  Workers will be looking for alternatives beyond the biggest
firms, Matthews said.  “They’ve historically thought, when times were bad, they
assumed it would get good again and the compensation structure
would go back to what it was,” Matthews said. “People now are
starting to understand that this is a new normal and the
compensation structure has changed forever.”  Dow Jones reported the expansion earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
