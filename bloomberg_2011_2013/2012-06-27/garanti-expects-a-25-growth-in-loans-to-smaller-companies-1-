Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkey’s
biggest lender by market value, expects loans to small- and
medium-sized companies to expand 25 percent this year, Deputy
Chief Executive Nafiz Karadere said.  Loans to SMEs grew 12 percent in the first four months from
a year ago, Karadere said at a news conference in Istanbul
today. The  shares  rose 1.5 percent at 6.90 liras at 3:21 p.m. in
Istanbul, gaining for a second day, to the highest level in more
than two months.  “We support small-and medium-sized enterprises and
tradespeople who play a large part in Turkey’s economic growth
in every way,” he said.  Garanti’s loans to SMEs totaled 22.4 billion liras ($12.4
billion) “at the moment,” according to Karadere. Its total
loans rose 18 percent to 83.3 billion liras over a year to
March, according to the lender’s first-quarter results filed
with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  last month. Total lending by
the industry grew 21 percent to 741.6 billion liras in the year
to June 15, according to the  banking regulator .  Garanti expects the value of credit-card transactions to
grow between 18 percent to 19 percent this year, from 55 billion
liras in 2011, Onur Genc, the bank’s general manager for payment
systems, said in an interview today.  “We saw slight growth in non-performing credit-card loans
in the first six months of the year due to the shrinking
economy,” Genc said. “The growth in non-performing loans is a
bit slower now, but still faster than last year.”  Garanti holds a 17 percent share in  Turkey ’s credit-card
market and expects to issue about two million new cards this
year, according to Genc.  Turkey is targeting 4 percent  economic growth  this year,
compared with the previous year’s 8.5 percent.  A 15 percent rise in loans will be “reasonable” this year
as economic growth slows, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said
on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
