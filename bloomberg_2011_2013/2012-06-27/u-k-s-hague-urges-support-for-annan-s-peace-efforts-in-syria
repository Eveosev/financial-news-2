U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
“welcomed the important role that the Arab League is playing”
in the efforts of the United Nations Joint Special Envoy  Kofi Annan  to end the violence in Syria, the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office said in an e-mailed statement today.  Hague met Arab League Secretary General Nabil al-Araby in
London to discuss the Syria crisis, according to the statement.  Hague and al-Araby “agreed on the importance of opposition
groups adopting a unified vision for a future democractic
Syria,” the statement cited the secretary as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
