New York’s highest court upheld the
dismissal of a lawsuit filed by Oddo Asset Management accusing
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  of using structured investment vehicles as a
“dumping ground for toxic assets.”  Oddo, a fund management unit of Paris-based Oddo & Cie,
sued London-based Barclays in state court in Manhattan in 2008,
claiming Britain’s second-biggest bank by assets transferred
subprime mortgage-backed securities to two SIVs it had created
at “inflated prices.”  Justice Barbara Kapnick, the trial-level judge, dismissed
all of Oddo’s claims in April 2010, saying that the  fund manager 
was a “sophisticated entity” that knew the risks of investing
in debt securities. An appellate court in Manhattan later upheld
the dismissal, a decision that was endorsed by the Court of
Appeals in  Albany  today.  “In hindsight, it is apparent that a greater degree of
vigilance was necessary from all concerned before soliciting
funds for, committing funds to, and rating esoteric entities
with little understood risks, such as the SIV-Lites -- whose
fate was dependent almost exclusively on subprime residential
and commercial mortgage-backed securities,” Chief Judge
Jonathan Lippman wrote in a consensus  opinion .  The case is Oddo Asset Management v.  Barclays Bank ,
109547/08, New York Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
