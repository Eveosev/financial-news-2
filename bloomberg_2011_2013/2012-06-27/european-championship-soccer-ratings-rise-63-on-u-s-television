U.S. television ratings for soccer’s
European Championship are up by 63 percent from four years ago,
with quarterfinals rising by 31 percent, according to ESPN.  The June 21-24 quarterfinal games averaged 1.9 million
viewers this year, compared to 1.1 million viewers for Euro
2008, the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  network said in a statement.  The increased viewership follows ESPN’s coverage of the
2010 World Cup. Spain’s win against the Netherlands in the final
two years ago drew 15.5 million viewers, the most-watched men’s
soccer match in U.S. history.  “There’s no question that interest in soccer is growing in
the U.S.,”  Rick Gentile , a sports management instructor at
 Seton Hall University  in South Orange,  New Jersey , and a former
senior vice president at  CBS Sports , said today in a telephone
interview. “The last World Cup did a great job of spurring
interest. In the U.S., we never paid attention to it before.
‘It’s the European Championship, what do we care?’ Obviously,
now we do.”  The semifinals begin today, with Portugal playing Spain.
Italy meets Germany tomorrow, with the championship on July 1.  The most-watched quarterfinal match was the June 24 game in
which Italy beat England 4-2 on penalty kicks after the teams
tied the match in Kiev 0-0 after 120 minutes. The game, which
drew 2.97 million viewers, was the sixth time in seven occasions
that England lost a shootout at a European Championship or  World
Cup .  This year’s games, being played in Poland and Ukraine, have
drawn an average of 1.1 million viewers for the first 28 group
stage and quarterfinal matches, up from an average of 703,000
viewers in 2008, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
