Harvest Natural Resources Inc. (HNR) , the
U.S. oil producer seeking to shed Venezuelan assets, has had
support from the South American country to sell a joint-venture
stake to Indonesia, Chief Executive Officer James Edmiston said.  The Houston-based company sees no reason why the $725
million deal won’t be approved by Venezuelan officials and state
oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA , known as PDVSA, Edmiston
said today on a conference call with investors and analysts.  “PDVSA and the Venezuela side in general have been very
supportive of our efforts throughout this process,” he said.
“This transaction is also a bilateral arrangement between two
sovereign countries. We would never have come to this point had
the feedback thus far not been wholly positive.”  Harvest jumped 87 percent on June 22 after announcing it
would sell its 32 percent stake in the Petrodelta SA venture
with PDVSA to  Indonesia ’s state-run PT Pertamina. The deal may
take “some time” to be closed and needs approval from the
Venezuelan and Indonesian governments as well as Harvest
shareholders, Edmiston said.  The two companies will hold meetings in the week of Sept. 5
to assess progress in governmental approvals and have the right
to terminate the purchase agreement at that time, Harvest said
in a U.S. regulatory  filing  on June 21.  Harvest fell 4.3 percent to $8.57 at 12:47 p.m. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
