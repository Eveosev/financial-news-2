Chilean lender  Corpbanca (CORPBANC)  is looking
for acquisitions in Peru, Chief Executive Officer Fernando Massu
told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.  Corpbanca wants to buy a Peruvian bank with characteristics
similar to Banco Santander SA’s Colombian unit, which the
Santiago-based lender is buying this month, Massu was quoted as
saying.  Brazil  is not in the banks’ plans, Dow Jones reported.  An official from Imaginaccion, Corpbanca’s external public
relations representative, wasn’t available to comment, an
assistant said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
