Sweden’s underlying growth has
slowed “sharply” amid a clouded outlook for the country’s
European trading partners, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Sweden’s economy may grow 1 percent this year and by 2.3
percent next year, the IMF said in an Article IV report
published today and dated June 4.  “On the monetary side, policy should continue to be set
according to the baseline scenario, as it can be adjusted
rapidly if tail risks are realized,” the Washington-based group
said. “Macroprudential instruments should be deployed further
if the housing market reflates once again.”  Swedish policy makers will announce their next rate
decision on July 4. The bank kept rates unchanged in April after
cutting them twice since December after the economy contracted
in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
