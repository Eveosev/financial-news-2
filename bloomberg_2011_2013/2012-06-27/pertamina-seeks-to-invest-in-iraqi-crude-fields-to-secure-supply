PT Pertamina, Indonesia’s state-
owned  oil company , is seeking to buy stakes in at least two
fields in  Iraq  to secure crude supply, according to President
Director  Karen Agustiawan .  The company may acquire 10 percent shares in an area that
produces 2.5 million barrels a day and another that pumps 1.8
million barrels, Agustiawan told reporters in Jakarta today
during meetings between Iraqi and Indonesian government
officials. Pertamina also plans to resume operations in the
Block-3 Western Desert acreage, she said. The company obtained
rights to the field, which is in an exploration stage, in 2002,
it said in a statement.  Indonesia, which left the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in 2009 after becoming a net crude importer
because of depleting domestic production, is seeking supplies
from overseas through acquisitions.  “If we can have 10 percent shares in each field, we could
supply 180,000 barrels and 250,000 barrels for  Indonesia ’s
energy security,” Agustiawan said. The company still needs to
negotiate with the operators of the fields and obtain approval
from the Iraqi government, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
