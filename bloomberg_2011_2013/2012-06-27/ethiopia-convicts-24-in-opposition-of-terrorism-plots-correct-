(Corrects first paragraph to say writer was not exiled.)  An Ethiopian court convicted a
writer, an opposition leader and 22 others of terrorism-related
offenses for plotting to overthrow the government, Judge
Endeshaw Adane said today.  The group, 16 of whom were tried in absentia since they are
abroad, were accused of committing acts of terror, and working
with a banned U.S.-based group and neighboring  Eritrea , which
has hostile relations with Ethiopia, Endeshaw said today in the
Federal High Court in  Addis Ababa , the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
