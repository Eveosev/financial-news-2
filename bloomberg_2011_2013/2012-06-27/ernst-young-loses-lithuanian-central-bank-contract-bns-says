Ernst & Young Baltic UAB and the
Lithuanian central bank agreed to end their auditing contract
after an employee at the company lost a permit because of Bankas
Snoras AB’s bankruptcy, the  Baltic News Service  reported today.  The central bank and Ernst & Young ended the contract to
prevent “reputation risk,” the BNS cited Rima Kaziuliene, an
adviser to the central bank governor, as saying. Lithuanian
authorities canceled an auditor license for an Ernst & Young
Baltic employee on June 20 and told the company to improve
controls after reviewing his financial reports on Bankas Snoras
issued before the lender’s bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
