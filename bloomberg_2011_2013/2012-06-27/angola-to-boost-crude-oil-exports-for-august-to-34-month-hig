Angola ,  Africa â€™s second-largest oil
producer, will increase its crude exports in August to the most
in 34 months, after one extra cargo of Kissanje grade was added,
according to a final loading program obtained by Bloomberg.  The nation plans to ship 62 consignment totaling 58.96
million barrels, or 1.9 million barrels a day, the most since
October 2009, the plan showed. This compares with 51 lots
amounting to 1.58 million barrels a day in July.  Kissanje exports were raised to five shipments from the
original plan for four, the schedule showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo sizes are
listed in multiples of 1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
