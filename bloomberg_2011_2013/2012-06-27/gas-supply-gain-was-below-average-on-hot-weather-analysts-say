U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose by less than the seasonal average last week as hotter-than-
normal weather boosted demand from  power plants , according to
analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories climbed 53 billion cubic feet, or 1.8 percent,
to 3.059 trillion cubic feet in the week ended June 22, based on
the median of 22 estimates. The five-year average stockpile
change for the week is an increase of 85 billion, according to
 Energy Department data . Supplies gained 84 billion cubic feet a
year earlier.  The weather was hotter than usual in the Northeast and most
of the Midwest last week, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland. The high in New York on June 21 was
94 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius), 13 above normal, according
to the  National Weather Service .  “Temperatures in the Consuming East region last week were
exceptionally warm,” Eric Bickel, an analyst at Summit Energy
Services in Louisville,  Kentucky , said in a note to clients
today. “Cooling-degree days were 45 percent above the 30-year
normal and 63 percent above the prior week.”  Cooling-degree days are a measure of weather-related demand
for electricity. Power producers account for about 36 percent of
U.S. gas consumption, according to the Energy Department.  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 46 billion
to 62 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly supply
report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington .  Natural gas for July delivery gained 15.8 cents, or 6.4
percent, to $2.625 per million British thermal units last week
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices today rose 0.7 cent
to settle at $2.774.  To contact the reporter on this story:
