Output of  greenhouse gases  at 467
companies that will probably be in South  Korea ’s proposed carbon
market starting in 2015 rose 9.1 percent in 2010, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Emissions rose to 515.5 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent from 472.7 million tons in 2009, London-based
New Energy Finance said in a June 22 note published on its
website, citing data from the Greenhouse Gas Inventory &
Research Center of Korea in Seoul.  Emissions at  Posco (005490) , the country’s largest steel-mill
operator and biggest producer of greenhouse gases, jumped 13
percent to 73.5 million tons, New Energy said. That compares
with 140.1 million tons last year for  RWE AG (RWE) , the Essen,
Germany-based power utility that’s Europe’s biggest emitter.  South Korea approved a cap-and-trade system to cut
greenhouse gases in May as President  Lee Myung Bak  seeks support
for new restrictions on factories and power plants in the
fastest-growing emitter among industrialized democracies.  The National Assembly passed a bill to establish the
market-based program, which requires companies exceeding their
emission quotas to buy permits from those that discharge less,
with the backing of ruling and opposition parties. The bill,
which calls for emissions trading to start in 2015, was passed
in a 148-0 vote, with three abstentions.  The biggest-emitting industry was power, with 233.2 million
tons in 2010, or 45 percent of greenhouse gases, according to
New Energy Finance. The  steel industry  followed with 94.6
million tons, or 18 percent.  “The fundamentals of the South Korean  emissions trading 
system will be very different to those of the EU ETS, which is
forecast to only have flat or declining emissions over the
period to 2020,” said Matthew Cowie, an analyst at New Energy
Finance in London. Emissions in the EU market rose 2.8 percent
in 2010, less than one third of South Korea’s 9.1 percent pace,
he said today by e-mail. EU carbon-market emissions fell 2
percent last year to 1.9 billion tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
