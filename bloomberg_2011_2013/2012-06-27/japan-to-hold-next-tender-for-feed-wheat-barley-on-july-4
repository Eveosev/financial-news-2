Japan  will hold a tender for a
maximum of 120,000 metric tons of feed wheat and 200,000 tons of
feed barley on July 4, according to the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries.  The ministry, which holds feed-grain import tenders every
Wednesday, didn’t purchase anything today because of a lack of
demand from end-users, Tomonori Kimoto at the ministry’s grain-
trade division said by phone.  Tenders are held under the so-called simultaneous buy-and-
sell system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
