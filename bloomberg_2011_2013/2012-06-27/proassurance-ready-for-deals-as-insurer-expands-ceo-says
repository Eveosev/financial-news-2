ProAssurance Corp. (PRA) , the insurer that
announced two acquisitions today, will be “opportunistic” as
it considers more deals to grow in health-care liability
coverage, Chief Executive Officer Stan Starnes said.  ProAssurance must “support a whole spectrum of health-care
providers from home health-care aides to neurosurgeons” and
device makers, Starnes said today on a conference call with
analysts. “We are attentive to every opportunity that presents
itself” and “when the right ones come along, we’re in a
position to move and move very quickly.”  The firm, which sells professional coverage for doctors,
agreed to buy Chantilly, Virginia-based Medmarc in a $153.7
million cash deal to expand in medical technology insurance, the
companies said today in a statement. Medmarc writes policies for
human trials and medical devices such as artificial knees and
hips.  ProAssurance also will acquire Independent Nevada Doctors
Insurance Exchange, which covers physicians in that state, the
Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in a separate statement
today. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Standard & Poor’s  affirmed its BBB  rating  on ProAssurance
after the announcements. The Medmarc acquisition will
“modestly” increase ProAssurance’s risk and may help improve
the company’s offerings, the ratings firm said in a statement.  ProAssurance advanced 0.5 percent to $86.21 at 12:48 p.m.
