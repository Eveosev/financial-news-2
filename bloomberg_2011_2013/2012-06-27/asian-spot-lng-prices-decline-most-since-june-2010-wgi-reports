Spot liquefied natural gas prices
for Northeast Asia this week fell the most since at least June
2010, World Gas Intelligence reported.  Prices for cargoes delivered in the next four to eight
weeks declined $1.20 to $15.80 a million British thermal units,
according to WGI’s own assessment of the market made on June 25
and published today. That’s the biggest drop since WGI started
the appraisal, it said.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  held tenders for supply from its
Pluto and North West Shelf projects in  Australia , boosting
supply, according to WGI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
