The  New York Yankees  placed pitcher
CC Sabathia on the 15-day disabled list with a strained groin,
his first time on the list in four seasons with the American
League team.  Sabathia, 31, is expected to miss two starts and will
return after the Major League Baseball All-Star break, the team
announced today on its Twitter account. Sabathia is tied with
Ivan Nova for the team lead with nine wins.  “He understands it’s the best thing to do,” Yankees
manager  Joe Girardi  told MLB.com. “Missing two starts is better
than seven or eight.”  Sabathia originally felt pain during his last start, on
June 24 against the New York Mets.  Freddy Garcia , 35, will
replace him in the rotation.  A five-time All-Star, Sabathia is 9-3 this season with a
3.45 earned-run average and a team-high 105 strikeouts. He won
the American League Cy Young Award in 2007 as a member of the
 Cleveland Indians  and a World Series title with New York in
2009, his first year with the Yankees.  The Yankees are 45-28 this season, four games ahead of the
Baltimore Orioles in the American League East division. Their
first action after the July 10 All-Star Game is three days later
against the Los Angeles Angels at Yankee Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
