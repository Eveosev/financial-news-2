German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said introducing euro bonds would prompt countries to
spend more, L’Hebdo reported, citing an interview.  “Anyone who has the possibility to spend money at the
expense of others will not hesitate to do so,” the Swiss
 magazine  cited him as saying in an e-mailed pre-release of an
article in tomorrow’s edition. “You would, I would. The markets
know that. And that is why you would not be convinced either by
euro bonds.”  Spain ’s banking woes “show once again that  Europe  would be
better off under a banking union,” Schaeuble told the magazine.  Schaeuble said that he “doesn’t believe in the collapse of
the euro,” according to L’Hebdo. Asked whether he was hoping
that the euro-region turmoil would eliminate the area’s
“congenital handicaps,” he said that “it’s not quite as
serious. I’m neither in despair nor resigned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
