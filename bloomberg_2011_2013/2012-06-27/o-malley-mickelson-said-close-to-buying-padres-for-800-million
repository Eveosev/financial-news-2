A group that includes the family of
former Los Angeles Dodgers owner  Peter O’Malley  and golfer  Phil Mickelson  is close to buying baseball’s San Diego Padres from
John Moores, a person with direct knowledge of the transaction
said.  The purchase group also includes Ron Fowler, chairman of
closely held Liquid Investments Inc., a Del Mar, California-
based beer distributor. Fowler was a member of the group led by
Jeff Moorad, whose agreement to buy the Major League Baseball
team was scuttled.  The sale may be completed as soon as this week, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the deal isn’t
finished.  Padres spokeswoman Sarah Farnsworth had no comment. T.R.
Reimer, a spokesman for Mickelson, didn’t immediately return a
telephone message seeking comment.  The sale price, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune,
is about $800 million, including $200 million in up-front
television money from the team’s new broadcast contract with
 News Corp .’s Fox.  The Padres are worth $458 million, according to Forbes.  The Dodgers were sold in March to a group that includes
basketball Hall of Fame player  Magic Johnson  and Guggenheim
Partners executive  Mark Walter  for a record $2.1 billion.  The O’Malley family moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles from
Brooklyn, New York, after the 1957 season. The family sold the
franchise to News Corp. in 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
