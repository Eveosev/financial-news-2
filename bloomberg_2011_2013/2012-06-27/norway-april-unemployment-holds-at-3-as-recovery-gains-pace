Norway’s  unemployment rate  was
unchanged in the April quarter as record spending in the
nation’s oil and gas industry is feeding through to the rest of
the second-largest Nordic economy.  The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate remained at 3 percent
in the quarter,  Statistics Norway  said today. The median
estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an
unchanged rate at 3 percent.  Record investments in the country’s offshore oil and gas
fields have shielded Europe’s second-largest oil and gas
exporter from the region’s debt crisis. The central bank this
month raised its growth forecast for the mainland economy, which
excludes oil and gas output, to 3.75 percent this year from an
estimate of 3.25 percent.  The bank held  interest rates  unchanged this month for a
second meeting, after two cuts since December, and signaled it
may start raising rates in the first quarter, earlier than
previously projected. Low borrowing cost and falling
unemployment have boosted consumption and household borrowing.  That bank cut its unemployment forecasts to 3 percent this
year and next, from a March forecast of 3.25 percent in 2012 and
3.5 percent in 2013.  Consumer confidence  rose to a 12-month high this quarter,
while  home prices  rose an annual 7 percent last month, and are
up almost 30 percent since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
