Oil rose to a one-week high on signs
the  U.S. economy  is recovering, easing concern that demand from
the world’s biggest crude-consuming country will decline.  Crude gained 1.1 percent after Commerce Department data
showed orders for durable goods climbed more than forecast in
May. More Americans than estimated signed contracts to purchase
previously owned homes last month, the National Association of
Realtors reported. Oil retreated from the day’s highs after the
Energy Department said U.S. gasoline supplies jumped last week.  “The durable goods number is giving the market the sense
that things aren’t too bad, at least in the U.S.,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in
Chicago. “The economic data recently seems to be raising
expectations for more oil demand.”  Crude oil for August delivery advanced 85 cents to $80.21 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement in a week. Prices traded below $80 after the release
of the inventory data at 10:30 a.m. Oil has fallen 22 percent
this quarter, heading for the biggest drop since the final three
months of 2008.  Brent oil for August settlement increased 48 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $93.50 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Durable goods bookings rose 1.1 percent, the first increase
in three months, the Commerce Department reported. The median
forecast of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.5
percent gain. Excluding the volatile transportation equipment,
orders for goods meant to last at least three years advanced 0.4
percent.  U.S. Economy  The  index  of pending home resales climbed 5.9 percent to
101.1, matching a two-year high reached in March, after a 5.5
percent decline in April. The median forecast of 39 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 1.5 percent gain in May.  Oil also followed gains in U.S. equities. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.9 percent.  “Everything popped at the same time,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and founder of Iitrader.com
in  Chicago . “Oil is down more than 20 percent and, in the short
term, we are all looking for some kind of reasons to get in the
market.”  Brent oil gained for a fourth day as Norwegian fields
closed in a labor dispute.  Statoil ASA (STL) , the country’s biggest energy company,
estimates the industrial action is curbing national crude
production by as much as 250,000 barrels a day while  Norway ’s
Oil Industry Association said today that a North Sea strike has
cut oil output an estimated 240,000 barrels a day and gas output
by 11.9 million standard cubic meters a day.  Oil from the Oseberg field, along with Forties, Brent and
Ekofisk, is used to determine Dated Brent, a benchmark price for
more than half the world’s petroleum supplies.  U.S. Supply  New York  futures pared gains after the Energy Department
said gasoline stockpiles increased more than twice as much as
expected last week.  Gasoline inventories  climbed 2.08 million barrels to 204.8
million as refineries raised their production levels to a five-
year high, Energy Department data showed. Stockpiles were
forecast to gain 1 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  Gasoline futures for July delivery fell 2.47 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.6204 a gallon on the Nymex.  “There is too much inventory and oil will be going
lower,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at Adam Mesh
Trading Group in New York. “I am going to continue to sell any
rally in crude oil. At the end of the day oil may be back under
$80 again.”  Refinery Utilization  Refineries raised their utilization rate to 92.6 percent,
up from the previous week’s 91.9 percent and the highest level
since July 2007, the report showed.  “The markets are very sensitive to any changes from what
was expected,” said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio manager of the
Encompass Fund in  San Francisco , which has about $300 million in
assets.  Demand for gasoline increased 1.8 percent to 8.85 million
barrels a day. Consumption of the fuel is still 4.5 percent
lower than a year earlier, Energy Department data showed.  Crude inventories declined 133,000 barrels to 387.2
million, falling from the highest level in 22 years. Stockpiles
were forecast to decrease 1.3 million barrels, according to the
Bloomberg survey.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 432,454
contracts as of 4:08 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 454,088
contracts yesterday, 18 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.43 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
