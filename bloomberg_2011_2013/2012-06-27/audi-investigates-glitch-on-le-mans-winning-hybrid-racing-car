Audi AG’s racing team  is
investigating a computer glitch that affected its winning hybrid
car at the 24 Hours of  Le Mans .  The etron-Quattro’s software dropped out of a setting that
distributes energy from braking in the most effective way for
the 8.5-mile circuit in central  France , Audi’s head of
motorsports Wolfgang Ullrich said.  After twice trying to correct the fault at pit stops, Audi
gave up and stuck with a default mode, Ullrich said. The part-
electric engine still operated in the same way.  “We have not yet found out why the computer was not able
to go into the optimal mode when we rebooted,” Ullrich said in
a telephone interview.  The car -- driven by Marcel Fassler, Andre Lotterer and
Benoit Treluyer -- still went on to win the endurance race on
June 17, beating Audi’s other e-tron Quattro by a lap.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s two hybrids didn’t finish because of a crash and a
mechanical fault.  Audi didn’t disclose the error publicly after the race
because it didn’t want to give inside information that might
help the team’s rivals, Ullrich said. He declined to say at what
point during the 24 hours it occurred.  To contact the reporter on this story:
