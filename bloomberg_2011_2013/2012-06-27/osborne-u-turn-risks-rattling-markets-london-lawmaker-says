Conservative lawmaker Mark Field,
who represents London’s financial district, said the government
needs to reassure international markets about its commitment to
 deficit reduction  after abandoning a planned tax increase.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s decision
yesterday to scrap an increase in fuel duty that was due to take
effect in August will cost the Treasury 550 million pounds ($860
million). The announcement came hours after official figures
showed an unexpected increase in Britain’s budget deficit.  “I think the public are rightfully convinced that we are
determined to reduce the deficit,” Field said in a telephone
interview today. “But I have a bit of a sense that the markets
may begin to take fright, that they may start to think that we
are not entirely up for this.”  Yesterday’s figures showed the recession hit taxes
and pushed up welfare spending in May, fueling concern that
Osborne may miss his full-year budget deficit target. The
shortfall widened to 17.9 billion pounds from 15.2 billion
pounds a year earlier.  “The markets may think we are softening in our resolve, so
we need to redouble that resolve to convince them we are serious
in the coming months,” Field said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
