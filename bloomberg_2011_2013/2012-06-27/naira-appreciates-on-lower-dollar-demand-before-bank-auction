Nigeria ’s naira appreciated on lower
demand for the dollar as investors awaited the central bank’s
auction and as  oil companies  were said to sell the U.S.
currency.  The currency of Africa’s largest biggest oil producer
appreciated 0.2 percent to 162.4000 naira per dollar in
interbank trading as of 1:48 p.m. in Lagos, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  supplies dollars to the market
on Mondays and Wednesdays to support the naira. The oil
industry, which sells dollars to lenders around the end of each
month, is the second major supplier of the U.S. currency. The
central bank sold $350 million at a foreign-currency auction on
June 25, matching the amount sold on June 20, at 155.91 naira
per dollar, the Abuja-based bank said.  “Many traders are waiting for the central bank’s supply
and sales expected from  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  to
enable them to make transactions at better rates,” Abubakar
Muhammed, chief executive of Lagos-based Forward Marketing
Bureau de Change Ltd., said by phone today.  Nigeria’s  inflation rate  fell to 12.7 percent in May from
12.9 percent in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said
June 19, staying above the central bank’s target and adding to
expectations interest rates will remain unchanged at a  record
high  of 12 percent.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
rose to a record, gaining eighteen basis points to 15.89
percent, according to the June 26 data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website. The Debt Management Office will
offer as much as 30 billion naira ($184 million) of the five-
year notes at an auction today.  Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021
fell nine basis points to 5.596 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi climbed 0.2 percent to 1.934 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
