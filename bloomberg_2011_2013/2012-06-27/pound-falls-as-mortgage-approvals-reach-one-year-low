The pound weakened after an industry
report showed  U.K. mortgage approvals  fell to their lowest level
in more than a year, supporting the case for the central bank to
resume stimulus measures.  Sterling dropped versus all its 16 major peers as Barclays
Plc was fined 290 million pounds ($451 million), the largest
penalties ever imposed by regulators in the U.S. and U.K., after
admitting it submitted false interbank offered rates. Bank of
England Governor  Mervyn King  told lawmakers yesterday he voted
for more so-called quantitative easing this month because of a
deteriorating global economic outlook. U.K. government bonds
were little changed.  “QE is quite likely at the next meeting in July,” said
Peter Kinsella, a senior currency strategist at Commerzbank AG
in  London . The pound will probably move “a little bit lower in
the next couple of weeks” against the dollar, he said.  The U.K. currency fell 0.6 percent to $1.5554 at 5:04 p.m.
London time, extending this quarter’s decline to 2.8 percent.
The pound weakened 0.3 percent to 80.12 pence per euro after
appreciating to 79.85 yesterday, the strongest since May 30.  The number of loans granted to buy homes dropped 5.8
percent to 30,238 last month, the least since April 2011, the
British Bankers’ Association said. Britons repaid more mortgage
debt than they borrowed in May for the first time in at least 15
years as consumers sought to improve their finances, the
Association said.  False Submissions  Britain’s Financial Services Authority said derivatives
traders requested the false submissions in the Libor and Euribor
setting process, as they were “motivated by profit and sought to
benefit Barclays’ trading positions.”  King was defeated in a push to expand the bond-purchase
program by 50 billion pounds to 375 billion pounds at this
month’s  Bank of England  policy meeting. The Monetary Policy
Committee voted 5-4 to keep its target unchanged.  Nomura Holdings Inc. yesterday brought forward its forecast
for when the central bank will extend the plan, predicting an
increase of 75 billion pounds to 400 billion pounds next month.  Sterling has weakened 1.5 percent in the past month, the
worst performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
slid 0.6 percent, and the euro fell 1.2 percent in the period.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yielded 1.69 percent. The 4
percent bond due in March 2022 traded at 120.59.  Investors demand an  additional yield  of 140 basis points to
hold the 10-year bonds over two-year gilts. The spread may
struggle to narrow beyond the June 8 low of 136 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.K. debt has returned 2.7 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained 2.6 percent,
and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
