OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s biggest oil
company, plans to invest about 200 million euros ($250 million)
in its Petrobrazi refinery by 2014, the company said in a
regulatory filing to the Bucharest Stock Exchange today.  Petrom invested about 100 million euros to upgrade the
crude vacuum distillation unit at the refinery, which resumed
operations this week after a six-week shutdown.  “The upgraded unit is very important in the refinery’s
modernization process because it will allow us to improve the
product mix in order to respond to the market demand,” Neil
Anthony Morgan, Petrom’s board member responsible for refining
and marketing said in the statement.  Petrom, majority owned by Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV) , is seeking to
increase its refining efficiency and stabilize local oil and gas
output, while searching for new resources to help offset
declining production. The  company  said it has invested 400
million euros in the refinery upgrade since 2010 and the
refinery is now able to process all its domestic crude
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
