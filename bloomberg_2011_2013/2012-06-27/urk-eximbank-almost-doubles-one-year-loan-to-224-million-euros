Export Credit Bank of  Turkey , a
state-owned lender that provides loans for exporters, boosted a
loan to 224 million euros ($280 million) after banks provided
more money than originally sought, according to a statement from
lenders.  The one-year facility pays interest of 120 basis points, or
1.2 percentage points, more than the euro interbank offered rate
and will be used to fund the exports of the bankâ€™s clients,
according to the statement. The Ankara-based bank, known as Turk
Eximbank, originally sought 125 million-euros.  Turk Eximbank , established in 1987, supports foreign trade
and Turkish contractors and investors working overseas through
various credit, guarantee and insurance programs.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Commerzbank AG, Deutsche
Bank AG, ING Groep NV, Standard Chartered Bank, Turk Ekonomi
Bankasi A.S. and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., were among the 14
lenders in the so-called club loan, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
