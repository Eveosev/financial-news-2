For every gallon of water used in an
average U.S. household, five times more water is used to provide
that home with electricity via hydropower turbines and fossil-
fuel plants, River Network said today in a report.  The  Portland , Oregon-based environmental group’s report
said the water footprint of electricity is the highest for
hydropower. “Each day, enough water to meet the demands of more
than 50 million people evaporates from reservoirs behind
hydroelectric dams,” it said.  The report also said electricity production by coal,
nuclear and natural gas power plants is the fastest-growing use
of fresh water in the U.S., making up at least half of all
fresh, surface water withdrawals from rivers, more than any
other sector, including agriculture.  “The days of taking water for granted in our decisions
about energy production must come to an end,” said Cindy Lowry,
 executive director  at the Alabama Rivers Alliance.  Link to Report:
