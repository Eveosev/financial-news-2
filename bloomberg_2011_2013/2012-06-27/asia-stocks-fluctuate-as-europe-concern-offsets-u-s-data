Asian  stocks  rose, snapping a four-
day decline, as speculation the U.S. housing market is bottoming
and  China  may step up economic stimulus tempered concern that
the 19th summit on Europe’s debt crisis in three years won’t
result in progress toward a resolution.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the biggest Chinese
developer by market value listed in Hong Kong, climbed 4.3
percent. Techtronic Industries Ltd., which makes 72 percent of
its sales in  North America , gained 2.6 percent in Hong Kong.
Oracle Corp. Japan climbed the most in three months in Tokyo as
its profit forecast topped estimates.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 0.8 percent to 114.19
at 8:13 p.m. in Tokyo after retreating 3 percent in the previous
four days. The gauge fell 0.5 percent this year through
yesterday amid concern that growth in the U.S. and China is
slowing as Europe’s debt crisis spreads.  “Markets have already priced in a lot of the bad news,”
said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation 
at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages almost $100
billion. “All you need for a rally in equities is for the
backdrop to become less bad. When the housing sector improves it
has a strong trickle-down effect to the wider  U.S. economy . But
there’s still a struggle with what’s going on in Europe.”  The decline in MSCI’s Asian gauge this year  compares with  a
gain of 5 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s drop of 0.8 percent. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index trades at 11.5 times estimated profit, versus 12.7
times for the  S&P 500  and the Stoxx 600’s 10.2 multiple.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 1 percent, while Japan’s
Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.8 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi Index slid less than 0.1 percent, all but erasing an
earlier decline of 1.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 0.7 percent.  U.S. Stocks  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Francois Hollande  are due to meet today before the European
Union starts a two-day summit in Brussels tomorrow. France and
Italy are urging Germany to help end the debt crisis.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent
today. The underlying index gained 0.5 percent yesterday after
data showed  house prices  decreased at the slowest pace since
2010. The report tempered concern over a drop in the Conference
Board’s  consumer confidence  index to a five-month low.  Techtronic Industries climbed 2.6 percent to HK$9.54.
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which makes
more than half of its sales in the U.S., gained 0.4 percent to
24.8 Hong Kong cents.  The MSCI Asia Pacific retreated 12 percent through
yesterday from this year’s high on Feb. 29 and dropped 11
percent since the end of March, heading for its first quarterly
drop since September.  China Stimulus  China may introduce “more proactive” policies to ensure
stable growth, according to a commentary in the China Securities
Journal by reporter Zhang Zhaohui. The government may expand
infrastructure investment, fine-tune monetary policies and
reduce taxes, according to the commentary, which was published
on the front page of the newspaper.  Chinese property developers advanced. China Overseas Land
gained 4.3 percent to HK$17.94,  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) 
advanced 4.9 percent to HK$15.56 and Guangzhou R&F Properties
Ltd. rose 1.6 percent to HK$10.26.  China will seek to strengthen ties with Hong Kong by
promoting tie-ups between the two financial markets and
increasing cooperation in investments overseas and
infrastructure, the official Xinhua News Agency said today. The
15th anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China is on July 1.  Oracle Japan advanced 3.6 percent to 3,165 yen, the most
since March, on  trading volume  that was almost 250 percent of
its five-day average. The company also increased its full-year
dividend forecast 4.2 percent to 75 yen.  Boral Slides  Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) , a Hong Kong-based chain
with more revenue than Tiffany & Co., climbed 6.4 percent to
HK$9.81 after posting higher full-year profit.  Glencore International Plc fell 3 percent to HK$36.25. The
stock touched the lowest price since the company first sold
shares in May last year. Qatar Holding LLC, Xstrata Plc’s
second-largest shareholder, asked Glencore to raise its offer
for Xstrata.  Boral Ltd. (BLD) , the Australian seller of building materials,
slumped 1.9 percent to A$3.13, a seventh straight day of
declines to its lowest since March 2009, after cutting its
profit forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
