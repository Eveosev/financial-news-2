Naspers Ltd. (NPN) ,  Africa ’s largest media
business, reported full-year profit that beat analysts’
estimates as pay-television and Internet revenue increased.  Adjusted net income rose 15 percent to 6.95 billion rand
($824 million) in the year through March, the Cape Town-based
company said in a statement today. That beat the 6.84 billion-
rand median of nine analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Sales increased 19 percent to 39.5 billion rand. Naspers shares
advanced as much as 3.1 percent, the biggest intraday jump since
June 11.  “The Internet segment remains the fastest-growing area,
with several new services under development,” Naspers said in
the statement. “The pay-television segment recorded
satisfactory progress in subscribers and is currently focused on
expanding into online services and the delivery of digital
terrestrial television services.”  Pay-TV subscribers increased by 684,000 to 5.6 million in
the period. The pay-TV division’s revenue climbed by 15 percent
to 24.1 billion rand, making up 61 percent of total sales. The
Internet unit, which includes a 35 percent stake in  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) ,  China ’s largest Internet service provider,
boosted revenue by 59 percent to 19.2 billion rand.  Naspers shares rose 2.7 percent to 467.46 rand at 2:32 p.m.
in Johannesburg, bringing the advance this year to 32 percent.  Acquisition Strategy  Naspers spent 1.85 billion rand on  acquisitions  of Internet
services businesses, including 80 percent of Vipindirim
Electronic Services Plc, a Turkish e-commerce company.  The company will make about 20 acquisitions in the fiscal
year through March 2013 as it considers as many as 200 deals in
the period, Chief Executive Officer Koos Bekker said in a
telephone interview from  Cape Town  today.  Naspers increased its dividend by 24 percent to 3.35 rand
per share and had 9.8 billion rand in cash and equivalents at
March 31, up from 8.7 billion rand a year earlier.  “The dividend growth is much higher than we’ve had in many
years,” said Bekker. The company won’t consider paying a
special dividend as it is “comfortable” with its cash
holdings, Bekker said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
