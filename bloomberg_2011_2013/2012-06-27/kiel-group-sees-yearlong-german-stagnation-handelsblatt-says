Germany  might enter 12 months of
stagnation in the fourth quarter of this year as a result of the
euro areaâ€™s weakness, according to Kiel Economics, a private
research institute, Handelsblatt reported.  Recession risks have increased again and while unemployment
is likely to decline until the end of the year, the institute
sees the possibility of a slight rise in 2013, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
