Flamco Wemefa GmbH and Reflex
Winkelmann Gmbh & Co agreed to pay 13.7 million in antitrust
fines to end a European Union antitrust probe over collusion to
fix water management products.  The European Commission said Flamco and Reflex operated a
cartel with Pneumatex AG to fix prices for products used in
heating, cooling and sanitation systems in  Germany  from 2006 to
2008. Reflex and Pneumatex also colluded over sales in 13 other
EU states for three months, regulators said.  Closely held Reflex Winkelmann was fined 9.8 million euros
and Flamco was fined 3.87 million euros. Pneumatex escaped a
fine because it was the first to inform regulators of the
cartel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
