Cia. Paranaense de Energia , the
Brazilian utility known as Copel, is seeking to purchase assets
from European electricity companies in need of cash.  “There are many companies, primarily European companies,
that due to the economic crisis need to sell assets,” Chief
Executive Officer Lindolfo Zimmer said in an interview in  New
York . “And we are a company that’s interested in buying them.”  Copel is looking to buy generation, transmission and
distribution assets, Zimmer said, without elaborating.  Spain’s  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , EDP-Energias de Portugal SA and
 France ’s  GDF Suez (GSZ)  are among European companies that have assets
in  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
