Libya ’s former premier Baghdadi
Mahmudi was beaten by Libyan security officers in Tripoli after
being extradited from  Tunisia , his French lawyer said. Libyan
authorities denied the claim.  “He has been beaten,” said Ceccaldi in a telephone
interview from Paris. “People said to me he has broken ribs, he
has a perforated lung, and he fell into a coma. He is in the
hospital, under guard.”  Saleh Darhoub, spokesman for Libya’s ruling National
Transitional Council, said there had been no mistreatment.
Mahmudi “has not been tortured,” he said in a telephone
interview. “All his rights will be respected. He will be
brought to justice lawfully.”  Mahmudi was Muammar Gaddafi’s prime minister until he fled
to Tunisia after the fall of Tripoli to rebel forces in August.
He was extradited two days ago.  Human Rights Watch  said earlier
this month that Libya was holding an estimated 7,000 detainees
in detention centres around the country.  Tunisia’s president Moncef Marzouki has already branded the
extradition as “illegal” saying it was done behind his back.  The Tunisian consulate in Tripoli was attacked yesterday
with an explosive device, the country’s Foreign Ministry said in
a statement. No-one was hurt in the incident, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
