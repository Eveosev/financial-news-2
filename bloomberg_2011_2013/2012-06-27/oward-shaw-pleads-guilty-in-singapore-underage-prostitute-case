Howard Shaw, a member of the family
that built an Asian movie production and real estate empire,
pleaded guilty today in  Singapore  to having paid sex with an
underage prostitute.  Shaw, 41, was among 48 charged involving a minor selling
sex to men in Singapore in a scandal that has expanded to
include a former bank executive and a school principal. Shaw was
the executive director of the Singapore Environment Council, a
non-profit organization.  “Mr. Shaw is not asking for any special treatment” given
his family background, said his lawyer Harpreet Singh, who asked
the judge to impose a fine instead of a prison term as he had
made a “honest and reasonable mistake” in believing the girl
was at least 18 at the time of the offence.  The incident happened on October 2010, when Shaw paid S$500
($391) at a budget hotel at the edge of the city’s downtown. The
offence for paid sex with someone under 18 carries a maximum
seven-year jail term as well as a fine. While prostitution is
legal in Singapore, soliciting for customers isn’t and offenders
may be fined as much as S$2,000 or jailed for as long as six
months, according to the city-state’s  statutes .  Shaw, who’s out on bail, declined to speak with reporters
after the hearing. The next hearing is scheduled on July 30.  The plea came after two of the city’s top civil servants
were charged this month with corruption for obtaining sexual
favors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
