German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said the budget plan for 2013 shows the government is
continuing its “policy of growth-friendly deficit reduction.”  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Cabinet approved a spending plan
today that balances Germany’s  federal budget  three years earlier
than required by its own rules. Ministers backed the 2013 draft
budget and a spending blueprint through 2016.  Germany’s net federal borrowing will decline from 18.8
billion euros ($23.6 billion) next year to 13.1 billion euros in
2014, then 4.7 billion euros in 2015 before touching zero in
2016, according to the plan presented by the Finance Ministry on
June 22, which now goes to parliament.  The so-called structural deficit of the federal budget will
shrink to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product next year,
equal to the limit set in  Germany ’s national debt-reduction
rules, according to the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
