General Mills Inc. (GIS) , the maker of
Cheerios cereal and Pillsbury baked goods, projected full-year
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates amid increased marketing
and investments in its U.S. yogurt business.  Profit for fiscal 2013, including a decrease from its
acquisition of Yoki Alimentos SA, will total $2.65 a share, the
Minneapolis-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected $2.76 a share, the average of 18 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell has boosted
marketing and raised prices on some products to counter rising
costs for raw ingredients such as wheat and sugar. Increased
pension expenses and a higher  tax rate  may also reduce annual
earnings growth, the company said.  General Mills  fell  1.6 percent to $37.55 at the close in
 New York . The shares have dropped 7.1 percent this year.  The company expects 2013 net sales to grow at a “mid-
single-digit rate.”  Fourth-quarter net income rose 1.6 percent to $325.4
million, or 49 cents a share, from $320.2 million, or 48 cents a
share, a year earlier, General Mills said today. Sales rose 12
percent to $4.07 billion, falling short of the $4.11 billion
average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Excluding some items, profit totaled 60 cents a share.
Analysts projected earnings of 59 cents a share, the average of
17  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  International Segment  Sales in the U.S. retail business rose 2.9 percent to $2.4
billion, driven by the Snacks and Small Planet Foods divisions.  The company has been growing through acquisitions, having
announced or completed four of them in fiscal 2012. The Yoplait
acquisition played a big role in boosting quarterly sales at the
company’s international segment, which grew 46 percent to $1.13
billion. Yoplait sales accounted for all of the company’s
international growth and more than offset price declines.  General Mills announced in May that it agreed to buy
Brazilian foodmaker Yoki for about 1.75 billion reais ($840
million) to boost snack sales in  Brazil . The transaction will
close during the first half of fiscal 2013. The deal, which will
give General Mills nine brands and more than 600 items, also
includes the assumption of about 200 million reais of
outstanding debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
