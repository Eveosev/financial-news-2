Gasoline fluctuated as U.S. durable
goods orders rose in May and on a report stockpiles of the motor
fuel rose last week.  Futures swung between gains and losses as bookings for
durable goods rose 1.1 percent, the Commerce Department said.
The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said yesterday
that gasoline supplies climbed 373,000 barrels last week and the
Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration is
expected to report this morning a 1-million barrel increase, the
median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The market is waiting on EIA statistics,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “We
continue to get mixed news about the  U.S. economy .”  July-delivery gasoline fell 0.47 cent to $2.6404 a gallon
at 9:45 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after swinging
between $2.6565 and $2.625.  The department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in Washington. Heating oil and
diesel stockpiles climbed 1.23 million barrels last week,
according to the survey, while refinery utilization was
unchanged at 91.9 percent.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 0.93 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.5858, after touching $2.5545.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.4
cents to $3.383 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest level since Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
