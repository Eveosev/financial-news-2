Tyco International Ltd.’s (TYC)  ADT
security systems unit sold $2.5 billion of bonds as it prepares
for a spinoff and its parent entered into a five-year, $1
billion revolving line of credit.  Proceeds from ADT’s sale will be used to repay intercompany
debt to Tyco as it seeks to become an independent entity by the
end of September, Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based Tyco said
today in a statement. Tyco will guarantee the debt until the
split occurs.  ADT issued $1 billion of 10-year, 3.5 percent notes that
yield 190 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also sold
$750 million each of 2.25 percent, five-year notes that yield
150 basis points more than their benchmark and 4.875 percent,
30-year debt at a spread of 225.  The loan was arranged by Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Bank of America Corp., according to a regulatory filing
today. The company terminated a $750 million loan.   The Tyco loan will reduce the banks’ commitments under an
existing five-year credit agreement that is set to mature in
September to $500 million from $640 million, according to the
filing.  ADT, with Tyco as the guarantor, entered into a separate
agreement for a $750 million revolver. The Boca Raton-based
provider of electronic security will become a stand-alone
company after Tyco splits into three independent publicly traded
companies, according to a Sept. 19 news release.  The sale of ADT’s bonds, to which  Standard & Poor’s 
assigned a BBB rating and Moody’s Investors Service ranked an
equivalent Baa2, was managed by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and JPMorgan, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
