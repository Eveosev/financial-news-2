Defending champion  Spain  was tied
0-0 against Portugal at the end of regulation play in their
semifinal at soccerâ€™s European Championship. The teams will now
play 30 minutes extra time.  If the teams remain tied, the match at the Donbass Arena in
Donetsk, Ukraine will be decided by a penalty shootout. There
have been three shots on target so far, two for Portugal and the
other for Spain.  The winner will play record three-time winner Germany or
Italy in the July 1 final.  Spain, also the current world champion, is aiming to become
the first team to successfully defend the title. Portugal,
without a major title, was runner-up in 2004.  The other semifinal will be played tomorrow in Warsaw.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
