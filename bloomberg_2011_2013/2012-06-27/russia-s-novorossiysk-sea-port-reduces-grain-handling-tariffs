OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port
will reduce grain-handling tariffs by as much as 30 rubles (91
cents) a metric ton on July 1 to help farmers boost exports.  The measure is expected to increase the competitiveness of
Russian grain on international markets, the company said today
in a website  statement , citing Rado Antolovich, acting general
director of the port. It didn’t specify the discounted tariff.  Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port is Russia’s largest port
operator by freight handling, according to company data. It runs
one of two major grain terminals at the Black Sea harbor. The
company is held by Russian oil-pipeline operator OAO Transneft
and billionaire Ziyavudin Magomedov’s Summa Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
