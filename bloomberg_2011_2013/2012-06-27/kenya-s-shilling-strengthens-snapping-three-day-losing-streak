Kenya ’s shilling snapped a three-day
losing streak, gaining the most in a week, as the central bank
tightened liquidity in the market.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent and strengthened 0.2 percent to 84
against the dollar by 2:47 p.m. in Nairobi. That’s the biggest
one-day gain on a closing basis since June 20.  “The shilling has gained as the central bank resumes its
operation of removing liquidity from the market,” John Muli a
dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone
interview today.  Kenya’s central bank, which had stayed out of the market
for five days, accepted all 6.55 billion shillings ($78 million)
of bids for seven-day  repurchase agreements  and term-auction
deposits at a sale today, said a central bank official, who
declined to be identified in line with policy. The bank accepted
bids for 3.6 billion shillings of seven-day repurchase
agreements at a weighted-average rate of 17.733 percent and 2.95
billion shillings of 14-, 21- and 28-day TADs at a rate of 18
percent, the official said. The bank offered 10 billion
shillings.  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,576 per dollar,
while  Uganda ’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,475 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
