Italyâ€™s Sara Errani defeated
American Coco Vandeweghe in a first-round match that was
suspended on match point last night because of rain and bad
light at the Wimbledon tennis tournament.  Errani, who lost the final of the French Open, won 6-1,
6-3, today when Vandeweghe doublefaulted when the women returned
to the court.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
