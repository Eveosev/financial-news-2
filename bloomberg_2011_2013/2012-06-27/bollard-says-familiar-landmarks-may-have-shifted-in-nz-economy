New Zealand ’s central bank said that
changes to the nation’s potential growth rate, the neutral level
of  interest rates  and other benchmarks may make policy settings
more challenging.  “We are aware that familiar landmarks may have shifted,”
Governor Alan Bollard wrote in the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand’s
 statement of intent , published today on its website. The
comments were dated May 22.  Indicators such as long-run unemployment levels and the
sustainable level of the  exchange rate  have also changed, and
the central bank needs to ensure that monetary and macro-
prudential policies are calibrated accordingly, Bollard said. On
June 14, Bollard lowered his economic growth outlook and
signaled that the  official cash rate  may stay at a record-low
2.5 percent until 2013.  “The global economic and financial landscape has become
more complex and is still vulnerable and unpredictable,” he
said. Within New Zealand, the inflation outlook is currently
subdued, domestic activity has been supported by strong farm
incomes and housing activity has picked up, he said.  The government yesterday named Graeme Wheeler, a former
World Bank managing director, as governor-designate to succeed
Bollard from Sept. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
