Spain ’s recession probably
intensified in the second quarter as the European sovereign debt
crisis worsened, the Bank of Spain said.  “The most recent information for the second quarter
indicates that activity continued declining at a more intense
pace,” the Madrid-based central bank said in its monthly
bulletin on its website today. It will publish an estimate of
second-quarter gross domestic product next month.  Spain’s economy contracted 0.3 percent in the first three
months of the year as the second recession since 2009 pushed the
 unemployment rate  to 24.4 percent. After the deepest austerity
steps in three decades failed to reverse a surge in borrowing
costs, the government sought a 100 billion-euro ($125 billion)
European bailout this month to help rescue lenders.  “In recent weeks the Spanish economy has been strongly
affected by the worsening of tensions in financial markets in
the euro region,” the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
