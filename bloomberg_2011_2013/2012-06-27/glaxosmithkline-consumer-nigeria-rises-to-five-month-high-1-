GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria
Plc (GLAXOSMI) , a unit of the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker, advanced for the
first time in three days, closing at a five-month high.  The stock rose 2.2 percent to 23 naira by the close in
Lagos, the commercial capital, its highest since Jan. 24.  “The company has a lot of ethical and common drugs that
command a lot of patronage in the market,” Raheem Mohammed,
chief operating officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said by phone
from Lagos today.  Glaxosmithkline plans to raise revenue by 25 percent this
year as it expands sales of branded retail items, the company
said on Feb. 21. Full-year profit rose 16 percent to 2.3 billion
naira, ($14 million), the company said on March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
