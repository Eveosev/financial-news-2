Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (CY) , a maker
of digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, obtained a $430
million revolving line of credit.  The five-year debt pays interest at 2.25 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, the company said
today in a statement distributed by  Business Wire . Lenders are
being offered a 37.5 basis-point fee on the unused portion of
the revolver. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The company expects to borrow $153 million immediately and
is permitted to use the proceeds for working capital,
acquisitions, stock repurchases and other general corporate
purposes, according to the statement.  Morgan Stanley arranged the financing for the San Jose,
California-based company, according to today’s statement.  “We are pleased to secure this revolving credit facility
at attractive  interest rates  from a core group of lenders.”
Brad Buss, chief financial officer of Cypress, said in the
statement. “The facility enhances Cypress’s credit profile and
provides us further financial flexibility to support our long-
term corporate objectives.”  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
