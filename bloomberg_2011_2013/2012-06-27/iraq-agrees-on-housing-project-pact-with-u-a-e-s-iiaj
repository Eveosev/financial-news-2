Iraq  agreed on a $245 million
contract with the United Arab Emirates’ IIAJ Ltd. to build 1,083
housing units in the southern region of Diwaniya, according to a
provincial official.  The project, the al-Zahra residential compound, will be
built within two years on the southwestern side of Diwaniya
city, Majid al-Mehanna, spokesman for the Diwaniya Investment
Commission, said by telephone today. The province needs 100,000
residential units, he said.  Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest reserves of
crude oil, is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an
economy and infrastructure damaged by years of war, sanctions
and underinvestment. Iraq plans to spend $4 billion on housing
through 2016 to reduce the housing shortage, Construction and
Housing Minister Mohammad Saheb al-Darraji said May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
