Supplying electricity to the
“billions of people living in abject poverty” is a more
important goal than curbing greenhouse-gas emissions,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  Chief Executive Officer  Rex Tillerson  said.  Electricity will do more to improve the quality of life for
people who still cook food by burning animal dung than trying to
prevent climate change, which will be “manageable,” Tillerson
said at the  Council on Foreign Relations  in  New York  today.  Environmental groups and scientists are urging reductions
in the use of fossil fuel-fired power plants, the largest man-
made source of greenhouse-gas emissions tied to global warming.
Tillerson said other issues should take precedence.  “There are much more pressing priorities that we, as a
human race, need to deal with,” he said. The world’s poorest
residents “don’t even have access to fossil fuels to burn.
They’d love to burn fossil fuels because their quality of life
would rise immeasurably.”  People will adapt to rising sea levels and changing weather
patterns resulting from  climate change , he said.  “Increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere will have a
warming impact,” Tillerson said. “It’s an engineering problem
and it has an engineering solution.”  Farmers may shift crops to new regions as temperatures
rise. “As a species, that’s why we’re all still here,” he
said. “We adapt.”  Exxon Mobil, under prior CEO Lee Raymond, funded groups
that questioned the impact of global warming. Since Tillerson
took over the company in 2006, he has spoken more openly about
climate change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
