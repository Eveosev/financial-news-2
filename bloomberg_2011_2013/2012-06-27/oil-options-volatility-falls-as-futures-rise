Crude-oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures settled above $80 a barrel for the first time
in five days after government reports showed gains in U.S.
durable goods orders and the housing market.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.5 percent at 3:05 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 31.5 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for August delivery gained 85 cents to settle at
$80.21 a barrel on the Nymex.  U.S. durable goods orders rose 1.1 percent in May, the
Commerce Department reported. The  index  of pending home resales
climbed 5.9 percent to 101.1, matching a two-year high reached
in March, figures from the National Association of Realtors
showed.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were September $100 calls, which were unchanged at 16 cents a
barrel at 3:09 p.m. with 2,791 lots trading. August $75 puts
were the second-most active options, with 2,064 lots changing
hands as they lost 27 cents to 66 cents.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 64 percent of the 83,657
contracts traded in the previous session. August $90 calls were
the most actively traded, with 3,453 lots changing hands. They
fell 4 cents to 12 cents. The next-most active options,
September $70 puts, declined 19 cents to $1.03 on volume of
3,328.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,285
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,639 lots and
December $100 calls with 38,555.  To contact the reporter on this story:
