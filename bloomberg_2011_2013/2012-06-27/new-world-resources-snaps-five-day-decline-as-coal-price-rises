New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, snapped five days of losses as
speculation China will add to economic stimulus boosted demand
for riskier assets and the price of coal rose.  The stock jumped 1.5 percent to 100 koruna by 10:33 a.m. in
 Prague , after a 5.3 percent drop in the previous five sessions.
Europeâ€™s benchmark coal derivatives rose 0.4 percent to $98.85 a
metric ton in the Netherlands, a second day of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
