The group representing U.S.
insurance regulators will hold a hearing into coverage that
homeowners are required to buy if they lapse on payments for
their original policies and whether the practice harms
consumers.  “We want to know more about rates, consumer disclosures
and how the relationships many of the insurers have with the
lenders affects the transactions,” said Sharon P. Clark,
chairman of the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners ’
Market Regulation and Consumer Affairs Committee, in an e-mailed
statement today. The hearing is scheduled for Aug. 9 in Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
