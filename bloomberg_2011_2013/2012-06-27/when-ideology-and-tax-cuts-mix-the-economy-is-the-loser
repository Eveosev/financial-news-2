One of the most important findings
in my book “The President as Economist” is that ideology and
good economic policy don’t mix, except by accident. Nowhere is
this more evident than in  tax policy .  The book examines several major tax cuts by postwar
presidents and finds that prevailing economic conditions are a
crucial determinant of whether a tax cut is effective. The
design and magnitude of the cut also must conform to the
economic conditions of the time.  I analyze the Kennedy-Johnson tax cut of 1964, the Reagan
tax cut of 1981 and the  George W. Bush  tax cut of 2001. The
comparisons show that an ideological approach, without regard to
the country’s broader economic circumstances, can be costly.  When President  John F. Kennedy  assumed office in 1961, the
economy was experiencing frequent downturns -- 1954, 1958 and
1960 were all recessionary years. Marginal tax rates were also
extraordinarily high, topping out at 91 percent. Rarely did
anyone pay such a rate, however, as  tax revenue  relative to
gross domestic product vividly shows: Presidents  Dwight D. Eisenhower  and Harry Truman recorded the fourth- and second-
lowest ratios of the 12 postwar presidents.  Little Downside  The Kennedy-proposed tax cut, signed by President  Lyndon B. Johnson  in February 1964, reduced the top rate to 77 percent and
dropped it further to 70 percent in 1965. Corporate income tax
rates fell to 22 percent on the first $25,000 of taxable income
and to 48 percent on the remainder.  The major economic indicators suggest that the Kennedy-
Johnson tax cut was effective, with little apparent downside.
The frequent recessions disappeared (at least until 1970). The
lower tax rates seem to have helped stimulate growth, which
averaged about 4.5 percent for the next six years. The tax cuts
also didn’t hurt the debt-to-GDP ratio, which fell to 37.6
percent in 1970 from 49.3 percent in 1964.  The context for President  Ronald Reagan ’s tax cut was the
stagflationary economy he inherited from President  Jimmy Carter .
During the Carter administration, taxpayers were pushed into
higher tax brackets, not because their real incomes had
increased but because of inflation. Such “bracket creep”
occurred without Congress voting to raise taxes and without any
real increase in incomes.  Reagan set out to correct this. His 1981 tax cut took
effect over three years, with rate reductions of 10 percent in
each of the first two years and 5 percent in the third year. The
top rate of 70 percent ultimately was lowered to 50 percent.  After the first year of the tax cut, 1982, the economy fell
into a deep recession, with GDP dropping 1.9 percent and
 unemployment  averaging 9.7 percent. At the same time, Federal
Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker ’s anti-inflationary monetary
policy -- basically, high  interest rates  -- had a depressing
effect on the economy. By 1984, the reduction of inflation and
the full effect of the tax cuts had produced a GDP growth rate
of 7.2 percent.  Growth continued at rates between 3 percent and 4 percent
from 1985 to 1989. So there seems to have been a good growth
response to both the tax cut and the reduction of inflation,
which fell to 4.8 percent in 1989 from an average of 10.3
percent in 1981.
But there was a serious fiscal downside. Despite the GDP growth,
the debt kept climbing. From 1981 to 1989, the debt-to-GDP ratio
increased every year, to 53.1 percent of GDP from 32.5 percent.  Too Generous  The conclusion: Although economic conditions were conducive
to a tax cut, it was too generous. Even when the economy was
growing robustly, high deficits persisted and the national debt
increased.  By 2001, as George W. Bush took office, the expansion under
President  Bill Clinton  was slowing; GDP growth was a sluggish
1.1 percent. At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio was
steadily declining, to 56.4 percent in 2001 from 67.1 percent in
1995. Unemployment stood at 4.7 percent.  The economic case for tax cuts, therefore, wasn’t overly
compelling. The national debt was still high, albeit going in
the right direction. The economy was at near-full employment. In
only one year, 2001, was growth below par, while four previous
years showed growth rates in excess of 4 percent.  Still, Bush insisted that Americans were being
“overcharged” and that tax cuts were needed. The Economic Growth
and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 lowered the existing
15 percent bracket to a new 10 percent bracket and reduced
others, including the top bracket, by 2006. It increased the
estate-tax exemption, phasing it out completely by 2010. The tax
cut’s design favored the wealthiest taxpayers, even though it
rebated $300 to individuals, $500 to single parents and $600 to
married couples.  Presumably the Bush tax cuts were meant to reignite growth
without harming the U.S. fiscal position or employment. Although
other factors contributed to what followed, including a housing
bubble that burst in spectacular fashion, growth averaged about
2.7 percent from 2002 to 2006 before collapsing from 2007 to
2009. The bias of the tax cut toward the wealthy -- unlike
middle-class taxpayers, they tend not to spend tax-cut proceeds
-- may explain the modest growth response.  The fiscal deterioration was dramatic: A $128 billion
surplus in 2001 turned into a $157 billion deficit the next
year. The shortfall grew to $378 billion in 2003 and then to
$412 billion in 2004. Deficits then declined the next three
years before soaring again in 2008 and 2009. The debt-to-GDP
ratio, however, continued upward every year of Bush’s
presidency, to 85.2 percent in 2009 from 56.4 percent in 2001.  These examples show that if the context is right and the
tax cut is appropriately designed (Kennedy-Johnson), it will
yield good results. If the context is right, but the tax cut
isn’t well-calibrated (Reagan), the results will be mixed. If
the economic context and the design aren’t right (Bush), a tax
cut can be disastrous.  (Richard J. Carroll is an economist at the  World Bank . This
