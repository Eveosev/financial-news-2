Ceske Aerolinie AS, the Czech state-
run airline known as CSA, had a full-year pretax loss for 2011
as a result of costs linked to fleet leasing and higher oil
prices.  The pretax loss for the twelve months ended Dec. 31 was
241.4 million koruna ($11.6 million) after a pretax profit of
76.2 million koruna a year earlier, the Prague-based carrier
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
