Asian currencies strengthened as
signs the  U.S. economy  is improving outweighed concern European
leaders will be unable to prevent the region’s debt crisis from
worsening.  The Philippine peso and Taiwan’s dollar advanced for a
second day as Asian stocks rebounded from a four-day slide. The
S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 U.S. cities fell
1.9 percent in April from a year earlier, the smallest drop
since November 2010, the group said yesterday. European leaders
meet for two days in Brussels from tomorrow and Italian Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  said the talks will be “very difficult.”  “You get some good data on and off and that is keeping the
market range-bound,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, head of
regional currency strategy at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala
Lumpur . “The market is hoping for progress in  Europe .”  Indonesia’s rupiah advanced 0.6 percent to 9,450 per dollar
as of 3:50 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The peso rose 0.2 percent to 42.370,
Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.960 and South
Korea’s won climbed 0.2 percent to 1,156.17.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, was little
changed after rising the most in a week yesterday. The gauge has
declined 2.3 percent this quarter. Its 60-day historical
volatility was steady at 2.92 percent today, compared with 3.42
percent on March 30.  Indonesian Bonds  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  hardened her opposition to
joint euro-area bonds ahead of the European summit, while Egan-
Jones Ratings Co. cut Germany’s credit ranking to A+ from AA-
yesterday after downgrading  Spain  last month.  The rupiah snapped a three-day drop after global investors
raised holdings of the nation’s bonds. Overseas funds bought 1.6
trillion rupiah ($169 million) more sovereign notes than they
sold last week, finance ministry data show.  “We have seen foreign investors return to Indonesia’s
bonds,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the Jakarta-based head of
treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “The rupiah is
still driven by sentiment, and investors are expecting results
from the summit that can produce long-term solutions.”  Thailand’s baht fell toward a three-week low on speculation
dollar demand from importers will exceed local-currency
purchases by exporters. Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy
had a trade deficit of $1.7 billion in May as an 18 percent rise
in imports outpaced 7.68 percent gain in overseas sales,
government data showed this week. The currency lost 0.2 percent
to 31.88, extending its decline this quarter to 3.2 percent.  Rupee Drops  “The deficit in the  trade balance  may continue for a while
as imports of machinery related to last year’s floods have been
climbing,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life
Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “The baht tends to see
downward pressure from this.”  India ’s rupee dropped 0.2 percent to 57.1612 per dollar.
The currency touched a record-low 57.3275 on June 22 and has
lost 11 percent this quarter, making it Asia’s worst performer.  Elsewhere, the  yuan  gained 0.12 percent to 6.3554 per
dollar after the People’s Bank of  China  set its reference 0.06
percent stronger. Malaysia’s ringgit weakened 0.1 percent to
3.1939 and the Vietnamese dong advanced 0.2 percent to 20,888.  To contact the reporters on this story:
