Three Republican chairmen in the
U.S. House introduced legislation calling on the Obama
administration to designate the Pakistan-based Haqqani network a
Foreign Terrorist Organization.  “Republicans and Democrats in both houses of Congress
agree that the Haqqani Network is a violent terrorist
organization and grave threat to our security,” Representative
Mike Rogers of Michigan, who heads the House intelligence
committee, said today in an e-mailed statement. “The Haqqanis
are responsible for killing hundreds of our troops, and their
indiscriminate attacks have also murdered countless innocent
Afghan men, women, and children.”  The measure also was sponsored by Representatives Howard “Buck” McKeon of  California , chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of  Florida , who
heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  has blamed the Haqqani
network for a series of attacks on U.S., allied and Afghan
targets in  Afghanistan . The Obama administration has been
debating the terrorist designation, which could help stem the
flow of money to the organization, although the issue is
complicated by allegations that Pakistan’s intelligence service
supports the group.  The measure is H.R. 6036.  To contact the reporter on this story:
