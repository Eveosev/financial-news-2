ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and  Voestalpine AG (VOE) ,
 Germany ’s and Austria’s largest steelmakers, slumped after
 Salzgitter AG (SZG)  scrapped guidance for a break even for its steel
unit this year.  Salzgitter  plummeted  as much as 7.8 percent and was trading
down 6.3 percent at 1:45 p.m. in  Frankfurt , heading for its
lowest close since September 2005. ThyssenKrupp  fell  0.8 percent
to 11.925 euros in Frankfurt, while Voestalpine  declined  1.3
percent to 20.4 euros in Vienna.  Germany’s second-biggest steelmaker said yesterday after
markets closed that given the deteriorating economic outlook for
Germany and the euro area, many steel processors and traders
were expecting business to stagnate, adopting a “wait-and-see
stance.” This in turn has had a “notably negative” impact on
demand for rolled steel, Salzgitter said.  The steel unit accouned for about 30 percent of
Salzgitter’s sales last year. The company’s other four units --
Tubes, Trading, Services and Technology -- “are developing in
line with the results forecast,” Salzgitter said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
