Sunoco Inc.’s (SUN)  Marcus Hook refinery
in Pennsylvania, which was shut last year after the company
failed to find a buyer for it, could be used as a liquefied
natural gas export facility or gas-fired power station,
according to a report by  IHS Inc. (IHS)   Other possibilities include using the site to process
natural gas liquids, store gasoline or make chemical product
ingredients, according to the study released today and funded by
the Delaware County Industrial Development Authority. The
facility could host two of the options simultaneously.  “These options could potentially provide an economic
second life to the complex,” Joseph Waldo, director of state
and local government consulting for Englewood, Colorado-based
IHS, said in a statement. “Most of these opportunities are
possible as a result of the recent phenomenal growth of the U.S.
shale oil and gas market.”  The Marcus Hook facility was idled in December and Sunoco
said Feb. 2 it didn’t get a single proposal to buy it. Sunoco
began talks with  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  in April to sell its
Philadelphia refinery and has said it would close the facility
in July if it can’t sell it.  Pennsylvania lawmakers in February joined members of the
United Steelworkers union at a rally in Washington to oppose the
planned closing of three refineries in the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
