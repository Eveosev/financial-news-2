Hungary ’s five-year bond yields fell
to the lowest in almost two months before an auction tomorrow
after the  International Monetary Fund  said amendments to a
central bank law address concerns blocking aid talks.  The government is offering 38 billion forint ($165 million)
in notes maturing in 2015, 2017 and 2028 at the biweekly sale
tomorrow, according to data from the Debt Management Agency on
Bloomberg. The five-year yields fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.93 percent, the lowest since May 3. The
forint slid 0.2 percent to 286.78 per euro by 5:30 p.m. in
Budapest, paring its gains this year to 9.9 percent.  The IMF is ready to start talks with Hungary on an aid
package as soon as legislators approve the proposed changes,
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said in a June 25 letter to
the Hungarian government and central bank, a copy of which was
distributed to reporters today. Negotiations have been held up
for more than seven months since Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
requested the aid because of IMF and European Commission
objections on the law.  “The market is reacting cautiously on fear there will be
further complications after the earlier delays,” Andras Sovany,
a Budapest-based trader at ING Groep NV, wrote in comments sent
by e-mail, adding that bond yields fell by as much as seven
basis points on Lagarde’s letter.  Hungary will pass the amendments by July 12 at the latest
and talks can start in mid-July,  Mihaly Varga , Hungary’s chief
negotiator for an aid deal, told reporters in Budapest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
