The  San Diego Padres  may be sold by
the end of this week to a group that includes golfer  Phil Mickelson  and relatives of former Los Angeles Dodgers owner
 Peter O’Malley , the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.  Padres owner John Moores is negotiating with one potential
buyer group, which also includes San Diego businessman Ron
Fowler, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with the
situation who requested anonymity.  The sale price may be about $800 million, which includes
$200 million that Fox Sports San Diego paid in its $1.2 billion
deal to televise the Major League Baseball team for 20 seasons,
the Union-Tribune said.  The purchase of the Padres could go before MLB owners for
approval at their quarterly meeting in August if the deal is
completed soon, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
