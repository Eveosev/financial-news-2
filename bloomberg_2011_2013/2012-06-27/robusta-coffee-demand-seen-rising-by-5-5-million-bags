Global robusta coffee demand may
rise by about 5.5 million bags this season, boosted by
consumption in  emerging markets  and producing countries as well
as a shift from arabica beans, according to Holland Capital LLP.  Consumption in  Brazil  will rise by 1.5 million bags, while
Vietnamese demand will climb by 500,000 bags, Euan Mann, a
partner at the London-based agricultural fund, said at a
conference in Geneva today. Coffee consumption in emerging
markets is set to gain another 750,000 bags and usage in
producing countries other than Vietnam and Brazil will account
for 750,000 more bags. About 2 million bags of demand will arise
from a shift away from arabica beans, he said.  “There has been general demand growth at origin countries
and the increase in the last couple of years is a response to
the wider arbitrage between  New York  and London,” Mann said in
an interview at the World Coffee Outlook Conference. “We had a
wide arbitrage for about a year before the switch to robusta
started to occur,” he said, referring to the difference in
prices between arabica coffee traded on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York and robusta beans traded on NYSE Liffe in London.  Robusta beans, harvested mainly in  Asia  and parts of
 Africa , are used in instant drinks. Arabica, grown mainly in
 Latin America , is favored for specialty drinks such as those
made by Starbucks Corp.  Vietnam Crop  Robusta coffee supplies will be about 2 million bags
greater than demand in the 2011-12 season that started in
October, Mann said. The crop in Vietnam, the biggest robusta
producer, will be 24.5 million bags, up from 20.3 million a year
earlier, he estimated. In  Indonesia , the third-biggest robusta
grower, farmers will harvest 7.4 million bags of the variety in
the 2012-13 season that started there in April, up 2 million
bags from a year earlier, he estimated.  Farmers in Brazil, the world’s biggest coffee producer,
will harvest 16.5 million bags of conillons, as robusta beans
there are known, Mann said. That compares with 15 million bags
in 2011-12, according to the fund.  The development of El Nino weather conditions could warrant
“significant concern” for production in  Vietnam  and Indonesia
in 2013-14, he added. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132
pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
