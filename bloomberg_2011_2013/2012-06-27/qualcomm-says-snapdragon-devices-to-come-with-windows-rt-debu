Qualcomm Inc., the largest maker of
mobile-phone semiconductors, said devices powered by its
Snapdragon processors will be available later this year, when
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  releases its Windows RT software.  Snapdragon will run some of the thinnest and lightest
computers available, Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer  Paul Jacobs  said today at a company event in San Diego.  Qualcomm is one of three chip companies partnering with
Microsoft to bring devices using ARM Holdings Plc. technology-
based processors to market with software designed to make
Windows better compete with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad. Microsoft is
enabling ARM-based chips, which dominate mobile phones and are
the heart of the iPad, in a computer operating system for the
first time.  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  and  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)  are also working
with Microsoft to deliver ARM-based computers and tablets. Intel
Corp. and  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , whose processors have
traditionally run Windows computers, are working on a similar
Microsoft touch-screen operating system.  Windows 8, for Intel and AMD chips, and Windows RT, for
ARM-based chips, is Microsoft’s first computer operating system
based around touch.  San Diego-based Qualcomm rose 1.8 percent to $54.89 at 2:38
p.m. in New York trading. The shares had dropped 1.4 percent
this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
