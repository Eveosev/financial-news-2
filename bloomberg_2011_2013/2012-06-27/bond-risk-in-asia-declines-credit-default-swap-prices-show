The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  decreased 1.5 basis points to
186.5 basis points as of 9:10 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The benchmark had risen 34.4 basis points this
quarter through yesterday, according to CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 186 basis points
as of 8:08 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices. The index has traded in a 153.5 to
210 basis-point range since the end of March, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  was little changed at 191
as of 10:08 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show.
The gauge had increased for four trading days through yesterday
and was up 43.2 basis points this quarter, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
