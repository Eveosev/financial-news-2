Romania’s  Constitutional Court  said
a law eliminating a minimum electoral threshold for lawmakers in
not constitutional, following a challenge by the opposition, the
court’s head Augustin Zegrean said.  The law, adopted by the Parliament on May 22, and proposed
by the country’s Prime Minister Victor Ponta and his coalition
partner Crin Antonescu, had aimed to implement a new system that
allowed candidates to win a seat in Parliament regardless of the
score obtained by their party.  The current electoral system will remain unchanged,
following the court decision, and the candidate who wins the
highest number of votes in a district in the first ballot will
keep the seat only if his party passes the minimum 5 percent
threshold of total valid votes cast.  Romania  is scheduled to
hold general elections in November or December.  The Court also ruled in favor of President Traian Basescu
in a dispute with Prime Minister Victor Ponta over the country’s
representation at the next meeting of the European Union heads
tomorrow, saying Basescu should represent Romania.  The decision triggered another round of accusations from
Ponta over Basescu’s alleged abuse, after blaming the president
of instigating a plagiarism accusation over his doctoral thesis.  Ponta, who is backed by a majority in Parliament of Social-
Democrats and Liberals, said he still has the right to go to
Brussels, based on political statement approved previously by
the lawmakers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
