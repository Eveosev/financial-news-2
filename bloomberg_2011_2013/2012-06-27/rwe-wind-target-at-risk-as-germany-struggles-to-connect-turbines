     June 27 (Bloomberg) -- RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, said delays connecting wind farms in the  North Sea  put
at risk the company’s target for renewable energy  “Without the wind parks we won’t reach our enlargement
goal concerning renewable energies,” Rolf Martin Schmitz, RWE’s
chief operating officer, told reporters in Berlin today. RWE
wants to more than double the share of renewable power in its
total output to 20 percent in 2020.  Grid operator TenneT TSO GmbH has said it doesn’t know when
it will be able to connect RWE’s 1 billion-euro ($1.25 billion)
North Sea East wind project to the German grid because of
technical issues.  “If the wind park can’t work, it costs us 100 million
euros a year,” Schmitz said in Berlin, where he is attending a
conference organized by the BDEW, a lobby group for German
utilities.  Building offshore wind farms in the North Sea is a key
element in Germany’s shift to renewable energy after it decided
to close all its nuclear reactors. Delays in connecting the
projects threaten to undermine investment, RWE said.  “Offshore wind power is still at the very initial stage in
Germany,” Peter Terium, who will take over as RWE chief
executive officer on July 1, said at the conference. “We lose
speed before we have even got started.”  Speaking at the same event, Federal Environment Minister
 Peter Altmaier  announced plans to clarify liability for  wind-
farm connections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
