Adidas AG (ADS) , the world’s second-
biggest sporting-goods maker, said it signed a 500 million-euro
($625 million) credit line to refinance.  The five-year revolving credit can be extended by as many
as two years and will replace the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based
company’s 2 billion-euro facility signed in October 2005 that
expires this year, according to a statement today.  Adidas agreed to pay interest of 40 basis points more than
the euro interbank offered rate and a 14 basis-point commitment
fee for the financing coordinated by  Bayerische Landesbank , HSBC
Holdings Plc and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. the company said. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “Throughout the last few years, we have continuously
strengthened our  capital structure  and diversified our
financing,” said Robin Stalker, chief financial officer of
Adidas. “The ongoing strength of our cash flow generation
allows us to reduce the size of the new revolving credit
facility.”  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Chartered Plc,
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of
America Corp. and UniCredit SpA joined the deal as bookrunners,
according to the statement.  Adidas said on June 21 it expects record soccer-related
sales of more than 1.6 billion euros this year, boosted by the
European Championship tournament in Ukraine and  Poland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
