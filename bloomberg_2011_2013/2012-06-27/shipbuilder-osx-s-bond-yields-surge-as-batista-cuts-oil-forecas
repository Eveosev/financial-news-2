Yields on  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) ’s $500
million of 9.25 percent notes due in June 2018 surged to the
highest level since they were issued after the oil-vessel
builder’s main client cut production targets.  Yields on the debt jumped 90 basis points to 9.5 percent as
of 12:40 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The notes fell 2.05 cents to 100.15 cents on the
dollar. OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA cut production
estimates at its first project by as much as 75 percent. Both
companies are controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista .  To contact the reporters on this story:
