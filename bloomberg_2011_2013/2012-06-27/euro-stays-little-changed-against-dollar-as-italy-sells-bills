The euro stayed little changed
against the dollar and yen as Italy sold 9 billion euros of 185-
day bills.  The 17-nation shared currency was at $1.2489 as of 10:10
a.m. London time, and was at 99.36 yen.  Italy sold the bills at an average yield of 2.957 percent,
compared to 2.104 percent at a similar auction on May 29.
