Nigerian security forces killed 17
militants, while a policeman died and another was injured as
they repelled attacks on four police stations and a prison in
the northern city of Kano, an official said.  “Extremists” launched attacks with bombs and assault
rifles, Kano state Police Commissioner Ibrahim Idris told
reporters in the city today.  Police arrested three attackers and recovered five assault
rifles, 14 improvised explosive devices, some planted at a
school, Idris said.  Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin,” has
carried out a series of bombings and attacks since 2009 in what
it says is a campaign to establish an Islamic state in  Africa ’s
biggest oil producer. Jonathan in January called the insurgency
a more serious threat than the 1967-1970 Biafra civil war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
