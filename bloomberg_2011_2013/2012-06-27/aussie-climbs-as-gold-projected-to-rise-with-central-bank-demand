The Australian currency gained
against most of its major peers on speculation the price of gold
may rise on increased demand from global central banks.  Australia ’s dollar erased an earlier loss against the
greenback after the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics
announced gold exports will increase 9 percent in the year
starting July 1 as volatility in the  U.S. dollar  and the euro
increase demand. The New Zealand currency rose even after data
showed the nation’s annual trade deficit in May was the widest
in more than two years.  The South Pacific nations’ currencies “tend to be higher
beta, so if you see this increase in  risk aversion  or the
deteriorating environment, then it’s going to be hard for them
to sustain much of a rally,” said David Grad, a foreign-
exchange strategist at Bank of America Corp. in  New York .
“That’s going to weigh on them going forward.” High-beta
currencies tend to have the greatest volatility.  The Aussie advanced 0.2 percent to $1.0080 yesterday in New
York. It rose 0.4 percent to 80.36 yen.  The so-called kiwi climbed 0.1 percent to 79.17 U.S. cents
and gained 0.3 percent to 63.12 yen.  Gold may average $1,660 an ounce, 6 percent higher than
over the last year, the bureau said. Exports from Australia will
increase 361 metric tons in the year beginning July 1, it said,
maintaining its March forecast. Several countries including
Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Kazakhstan have already boosted
their bullion imports, according to data on the International
Monetary Fund’s website.  Gold for immediate delivery advanced to $1,577.50 an ounce
in New York.  New Zealand  had a trade deficit of NZ$805 million ($636
million) in the 12 months ended May 31, the most since November
2009,  Statistics New Zealand  said. The currency has fallen 3.3
percent since the end of March and is set for the first
quarterly decline since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
