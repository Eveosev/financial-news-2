First Niagara Financial Group Inc. (FNFG) ,
the worst performer for the past 12 months in the KBW Bank
Index, said it earned $16 million before taxes after selling
$3.1 billion of mortgage-backed securities.  The proceeds will be used to repay short-term debt, the
Buffalo, New York-based lender said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer John R. Koelmel is expanding
through acquisitions. Last month, the company completed a $900
million deal for more than 100 HSBC Holdings Plc branches in
 Connecticut  and Upstate  New York , a May 24 filing shows.  “Given the expected duration of this historically low-rate
and volatile economic environment, we took decisive actions to
better position our balance sheet without impacting the longer-
term business fundamentals,” Koelmel said in the statement.  First Niagara listed $10.3 billion of mortgage-backed
securities on its balance sheet as of March 31, a 5.8 percent
increase from the end of last year, according to the company’s
first-quarter regulatory filing.  “We have become more hardened in our view that the
recovery is going to be delayed,” Chief Financial Officer
Gregory Norwood said in a conference call with analysts and
investors. “Keeping the bonds would have added even more
tail risk if the global economic environment suffers a severe
shock.”  First Niagara climbed 5.7 percent to $7.94 in New York
trading, the most since October. The shares have declined 39
percent in the past year, compared with a 4.7 percent drop for
the 24-company KBW index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
