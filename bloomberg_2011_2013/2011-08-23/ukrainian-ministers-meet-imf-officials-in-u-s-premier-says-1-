Ukrainian Finance Minister Fedir Yaroshenko and Coal and Energy Minister Yuriy Boyko are in
 Washington  for talks with International Monetary Fund officials,
Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  Ukraine and the IMF “are constantly in the process of
talks and contacts as they are our creditors and need to know
how we manage the economy,” Azarov said in a  statement  on the
government’s website today.  The eastern European nation expects an IMF mission to visit
between Aug. 29 and Sept. 6 for a review of the country’s loan
program after the third disbursement of its $15.6 billion
bailout, initially planned for March.  “External market volatility increases the chances for the
IMF program going back on track,” said  Olena Bilan , chief
economist at Kiev-based Dragon Capital, by phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
