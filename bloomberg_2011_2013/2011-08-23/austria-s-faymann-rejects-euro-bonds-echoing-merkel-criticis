Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann
joined  Germany  and  France  in rejecting common euro-area bonds
and said a centralized economic government for the region is
unrealistic because it would require a treaty change.  “This is a mere theoretical debate,” Faymann said,
referring to both euro bonds and an “economic government,”
according to a statement by the chancellery following the first
government meeting in Vienna after the summer recess. “If you
know how difficult it is to change the European Union treaty,
given we have 44 political parties in the governments, you also
know that this isn’t practical,” he added.  Social Democrat Faymann’s comments on euro bonds echo the
views of his conservative Finance Minister, Maria Fekter, and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas
Sarkozy .  Merkel said this week joint euro bonds would require treaty
changes that would “take years” and might run afoul of
Germany’s constitution, and that bringing them in at this time
would further undermine economic stability.  Faymann, who has promised voters to call a referendum on
any significant change of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, is opposing
Merkel’s push for a more centralized economic policymaking in
the region sharing the euro currency. He said last week that he
rejects the EU interfering with Austrian wage-setting rules or
with its pension system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
