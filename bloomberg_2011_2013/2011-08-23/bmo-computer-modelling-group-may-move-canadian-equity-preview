Canadian stocks rose for a second
day as lenders gained after Bank of Montreal reported earnings
that beat the average analyst estimate and energy companies
advanced with oil and natural gas.  Bank of Montreal,  Canada ’s fourth-largest lender by assets,
increased 4.3 percent.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the
country’s second-biggest energy company by market value, climbed
6 percent as forecasts for hotter U.S. weather boosted gas

by market value, fell 5.3 percent as the metal dropped from a
record.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 269.97

accounting for 41 percent of the gain.  “Out of the gate, the first bank to report looks like a
positive signal and above what people were anticipating,”

oversees about C$200 million ($202 million).  The index plunged 11 percent in the month ending yesterday

earlier, according to a U.S. Agriculture Department report
released yesterday.  Copper climbed after a preliminary reading indicated an
