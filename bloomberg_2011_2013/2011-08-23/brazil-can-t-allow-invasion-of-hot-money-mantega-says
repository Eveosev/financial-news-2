Brazil  can’t allow an invasion of
“hot money” and must deter speculation in the currency
derivatives market, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said.  The so-called “currency war” will continue in the coming
years, Mantega said during an event in Sao Paulo yesterday.
Brazil’s government still has “a lot of ammunition” to respond
to any global slowdown in economic growth, he said.  If needed, Brazil can adopt measures such as reducing the
country’s “high interest rates” and reducing the amount of money
banks must hold at the central bank to fight lower growth,
Mantega said. He said Brazil could have “a more active monetary
policy.”  The real strengthened 44 percent against the dollar since
the start of 2009 until yesterday.  Brazil’s IPCA index of consumer prices will increase 0.3
percent to 0.4 percent on a monthly basis until the end of 2011,
Mantega said. He maintained gross domestic product forecasts of
4.5 percent expansion for this year and 5 percent expansion for
next year.  Brazil depends less on external markets than other
countries and has investors’ confidence, Mantega said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
