Jordan ’s energy import bill rose by
74 percent in the first half of 2011, the Department of
Statistics said.  The kingdom spent 1.69 billion dinars ($2.4 billion) to
ship in natural gas and oil products and 104 million dinars for
electricity, it said in an e-mailed statement. The country spent
13.8 million dinars on power in the first half of last year.  Jordan, which imports almost all of its energy needs, has
been forced to switch its  power plants  to more expensive heavy
fuels after repeated cuts in gas shipments following attacks on
Egypt’s export pipeline since unrest erupted in the North
African nation earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
