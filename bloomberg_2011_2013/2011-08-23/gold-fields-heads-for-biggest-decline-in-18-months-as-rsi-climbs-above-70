Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , Africa’s second-
biggest gold producer, slumped the most in 18 months on
speculation its 25 percent rally since reaching the lowest level
this year was overdone.  The stock fell 4.3 percent to 119.25 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, its first decline in three days. The
shares have risen 13 percent this month and 25 percent from
95.60 rand on June 24, the weakest level this year. Gold has
surged 15 percent this month to a record.  AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s largest producer, fell 2.3 percent today.  Gold Fields’ 14-day relative strength index, which shows
how rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a specified time
period, was 72.3 yesterday, its third move above 70 this month.
A reading of 70 or above may be a signal to some investors who
study technical charts that prices may be set to decline.  “The gold price has come off and AngloGold has come down
as well, although not as much as Gold Fields,”  David Davis , a
gold analyst at SBG Securities, said by telephone from
Johannesburg. “It’s just correcting and possibly some profit-
taking as well.”  Gold traded at an all-time high above $1,900 an ounce
earlier today on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  will signal further measures to stimulate the  U.S.
economy  later this week and as debt crises spurred demand for a
safe haven for wealth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
