Nintendo Co., the world’s largest
maker of video-game players, rose to the highest in more than
three weeks in  Osaka  trading amid speculation the company will
make an announcement at an event on Sept. 13.  Nintendo shares gained 8.4 percent to 13,100 yen at the
3:10 p.m. close in Osaka, the highest since July 28.  “Yesterday’s invitations from Nintendo for an event on
Sept. 13 seems like the main reason for today’s jump,” Yusuke Tsunoda, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., said in a
telephone interview.  Yasuhiro Minagawa, a spokesman at Nintendo, declined to
comment on the event when reached by phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
