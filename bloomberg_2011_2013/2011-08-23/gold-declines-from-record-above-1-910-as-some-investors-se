Gold dropped the most in a year as
some investors sold the metal after signs of slowing growth
spurred a rally to a record $1,917.90 an ounce.  The relative-strength index of futures in  New York  has
topped 70 since Aug. 8, a signal to some investors that prices
were poised to decline. Bullion has jumped 14 percent in August
amid speculation that Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
will signal further measures to stimulate the U.S. economy later
this week and as debt crises spurred demand for haven assets.  “Gold looks very bubbly,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.
“Gold’s going to continue to suck everybody in. There’s too
much risk of a wicked correction lurking around the corner to
enter the trade right now.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $30.60, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $1,861.30 on the Comex in New York. In
after-hours trading, the metal plunged as much as 3.5 percent,
the biggest intraday decline since July 1, 2010.  Before today, prices surged 17 percent in three weeks. The
metal is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest winning
streak since at least 1920 in  London , as investors seek to
diversify their holdings away from equities and some currencies.
Bullion also reached all-time highs in euros, British pounds and
Swiss francs today.  ‘Liquidation’  “A little stability in the stock market triggered this
trailing stop liquidation,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer
at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose as much as 3.4
percent.  Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products fell
for a second day yesterday, sliding 4.7 metric tons to 2,206.4
tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record
2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8.  UBS AG raised its one-month gold forecast to $1,950 from
$1,725 and increased its three-month outlook to $2,100 from
$1,850. Yesterday, the bank’s physical sales to  India , the top
global buyer, were the highest since May 10, according to UBS
analyst Edel Tully said.  Bernanke is scheduled to speak Aug. 26 in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, at an annual conference sponsored by the Fed Bank of
Kansas City.  “In the long-term, gold is attractive,” Zeman of
Kingsview said. “Fiscal deficits are completely out of control.
It’s no wonder that investors are losing faith in  paper money .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
