Floor trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  wasn’t halted after a 5.9-magnitude
earthquake in  Virginia  shook buildings along the Eastern
Seaboard, and the exchange wasn’t evacuated, said New York-based
Damon Leavell, a spokesman for CME Group Inc., which owns the
exchange.  Some traders left the building voluntarily, Leavell said in
a phone interview. The exchange is in  New York City ’s Financial
District.  To contact the reporter on this story:
