Four-time champion Bayern Munich and
Villarreal won their playoffs to reach the Champions League
group stage, while Dinamo Zagreb held off Malmo to return after
an 11-year absence.  Mario Gomez  got the only goal as Bayern, whose  Allianz
Arena  will host the May 19, 2012 final, won 1-0 at FC Zurich
last night to advance 3-0 over the two-match series. Villarreal
beat  Denmark ’s Odense 3-0 at home for a 3-1 total.  Croatian champion Dinamo sealed a place in the Aug. 25 draw
with a 4-3 aggregate win over Malmo following its 2-0 loss in
 Sweden . Dinamo, which last played in the group stage in the
1999-2000 season, played the final 40 minutes with 10 men after
Sime Vrsaljko was red-carded. Genk and Apoel Nicosia also
advanced last night.  The 10 playoff winners join 22 automatic entrants in the
32-team group stage of  Europe ’s elite club soccer competition.
Clubs received a minimum of 7.2 million euros ($10.3 million)
from tournament organizer  UEFA  for participating last season.  Arsenal, Lyon and Viktoria Plzen take leads into today’s
five second-leg playoff matches. Two-time champion Benfica and
Sturm Graz host return games after drawing on the road.  The 32 teams will be split into four seeding pots at the
group-stage draw in  Monaco  with one from each drawn into eight
groups. Teams from the same country can’t meet each other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
