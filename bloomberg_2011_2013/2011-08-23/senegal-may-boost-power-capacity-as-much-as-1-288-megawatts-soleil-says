Senegal is building and planning to
build  power plants  to boost electricity capacity by as much as
1,288 megawatts, Le Soleil reported, citing Sedina Kane, the
director general of state-owned utility Senelec.  The projects include a proposed 500-megawatt plant to be
build by an unidentified Chinese company and a planned 250-
megawatt plant, the Dakar-based newspaper cited Kane as saying.  Power outages caused by fuel shortages will end next month
as the government secures enough gasoline to meet demand and as
power plants producing 150 megawatts start operating, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
