Swiss stocks advanced for a second
day as investors speculated that the  Federal Reserve  will take
steps to bolster the U.S. recovery.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s biggest watchmaker, gained 2.1
percent as exports of timepieces increased.  Lindt & Spruengli
AG (LISN) , the largest maker of premium chocolate, rallied 8.2 percent
on higher earnings.  Flughafen Zuerich AG (FHZN)  gained the most since
2009 after reporting first-half results.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  advanced 1.7 percent to 5,230.58 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. Even so, the gauge has tumbled 22
percent from this year’s record high on Feb. 18 amid concern
that  Europe ’s leaders won’t contain the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis and that the U.S. recovery will stall. The broader Swiss
Performance Index increased 1.5 percent today.  “We think the Fed will show investors what weapons they
have to support growth,” Thomas Haerter, chief strategist at
Swisscanto Asset Management AG, said by telephone. “It’s about
influencing the animal spirit; it’s about fighting against the
complete loss of confidence.”  Swiss stocks continued their rebound from Aug. 18’s biggest
drop in two years before central bankers meet this week in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming. Last year, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s
hint of a second round of asset purchases triggered a 28 percent
rally in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index through April.  ‘Important Driver’  Amid evidence of a weakening U.S. recovery, central bankers
will meet on Aug. 26 at the annual conference sponsored by the
Fed Bank of Kansas City. Bernanke said at last year’s meeting
that the Fed was prepared to “do all that it can” to ensure
economic recovery and suggested it would purchase more
securities if growth slowed.  “Last week’s losses on equity markets were exaggerated,”
said Thomas Stucki, who helps manage about $3.8 billion as chief
investment officer at Hyposwiss Private Bank AG in Zurich. “For
the further development in the markets, it is important that the
 U.S. economy  gets stronger again. That’s why a third round of
quantitative easing could be an important driver, similar to
last year.”  A U.S. report in  Washington  today showed that new home
sales fell 0.7 percent in July, after sliding 1 percent in June.
Economists had projected a 0.6 percent drop, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  Swatch, Richemont Rise  Swatch, the maker of Breguet and Omega watches, climbed 2.1
percent to 327.20 Swiss francs and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA,
the world’s largest jewelry maker, rose 2.7 percent to 41.62
francs. Swiss watch exports increased 21 percent in July, the
Federal Customs Office said today.  Lindt & Spruengli rallied 8.2 percent to 2,370 francs, its
biggest advance since October 2008, after the company said
first-half net income increased 29 percent to 32.1 million
francs ($40.6 million), compared with a year earlier.  Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food company, rose 1 percent
to 49.44 francs. The company said it will invest more than 38
million francs to double pet  food production  at its Purina
PetCare factory in Russia’s Kaluga region.  Flughafen Zuerich gained 7.2 percent to 335.50 francs, its
biggest jump since October 2009, after the airport operator
reported that first-half profit surged 48 percent to 73.5
million francs from a year earlier. Sales gained 7.4 percent to
438.3 million francs and the company said it expects a 15
percent to 20 percent increase in net income this year.  Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the world’s largest maker of
computer mice, rallied 6.7 percent to 7.71 francs, its highest
price in almost a month, as a gauge of European technology
companies was the best performer of the 19 industry groups in
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Kudelski SA (KUD)  dropped 11 percent to 7.45 francs, its lowest
price since October 1997, after the maker of digital-television
applications reported a first-half loss of 11.5 million francs,
compared with a profit of 32 million francs in the year-earlier
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
