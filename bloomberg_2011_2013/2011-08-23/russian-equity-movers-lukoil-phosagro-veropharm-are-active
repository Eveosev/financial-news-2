The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  traded
little changed at 1,444.11 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow,
erasing an earlier advance of as much as 1.7 percent. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index closed little changed at 1,578.91.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO PhosAgro (PHOR RX) jumped the most since it started
trading in July after Citigroup Inc. and Troika Dialog initiated
coverage and recommended buying stock in  Europe ’s largest
phosphate-fertilizer maker. The shares surged 7.4 percent, their
most since the company’s initial public offering, before closing
2.2 percent higher at 10,166 rubles.  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX),  Russia ’s largest lender, dropped
to its lowest in almost a year, losing 2.3 percent to 77.26
rubles. Russia’s central bank is undecided on whether to sell
7.6 percent of Sberbank’s shares in September, Vedomosti
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
situation.  OAO  Veropharm (VRPH)   climbed for the second day in three
after the Russian pharmaceutical company increased sales by 18
percent to 3.15 billion rubles ($109 million) in the first half
from a year earlier. The shares jumped 2.9 percent to 995
rubles, erasing yesterday’s 2.1 percent loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
