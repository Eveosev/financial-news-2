Ghana ’s cedi appreciated for the
third day against the dollar as mining companies sold the U.S.
currency to pay for expenses in the economy of Africa’s second-
biggest gold producer.  The currency strengthened as much as 0.7 percent to 1.5150
per dollar before trading 0.4 percent up at 1.5200 as of 1:16
p.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The market today got dollar supplies from mining firms,
who sold the U.S. currency to pay for expenses,” Chris Nettey,
a currency trader at the local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
said in a telephone interview. “Some offshore investors bought
the dollars to manage their liquidity positions, but supply
exceeded their demand.”  Johannesburg-based AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Newmont
Mining Corp. of  Greenwood Village , Colorado, have mines in
Ghana, which follows  South Africa  in output of gold on the
continent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
