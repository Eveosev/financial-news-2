South Korean stocks advanced, with
the benchmark index rising the most in Asia, as losses this
month drove valuations to the cheapest level in almost three
years and amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take steps
to bolster the faltering U.S. economic recovery.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  climbed 3.9 percent to 1,776.68 at the 3
p.m. close in Seoul, halting a three-day, 9.6 percent drop. The
gauge sank 20 percent this month through yesterday to the lowest
level since July 8, 2010, amid concern the U.S. economic
recovery is faltering and  Europe ’s debt crisis may spread.  “There seems to be a bit of bargain-hunting interest here
after recent sell-offs left valuations of many stocks quite
attractive,” said Lim Chang Gue, a fund manager in Seoul at
Samsung Asset Management Co., which oversees about $30 billion.  The Kospi has dropped 13 percent this year, pushing
valuations of the 780 member stocks down to 8.9 times estimated
profit, the second-lowest valuation in  Asia  after Pakistan’s
benchmark gauge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
multiple fell to 8.6 times yesterday, the cheapest since
November 2008. The rout in the stock market this month prompted
South Korea to ban equity short sales and the nation’s central
bank to keep  interest rates  unchanged.  Shares are rebounding before central bankers meet this week
in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, where Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s
hint of a second round of asset purchases last year spurred a 28
percent rally in the  S&P 500  that ended on April 29. Preliminary
data showed an index of Chinese output may have climbed to 49.8
in August from 49.3 in July. Separate reports will probably show
German manufacturing grew at a slower pace and U.S. home sales
declined.  Hyundai Motor, Mando  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , which tumbled 31 percent this month
through yesterday, advanced 10 percent. SK Innovation Co.
rallied 11 percent. It’s dropped 39 percent in the same period.  Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. rose 9.6 percent,
leading South Korean builders higher, after Mirae Asset
Securities Co. said the companies may benefit from expected
reconstruction works in Libya. Hyundai Engineering &
Construction Co. climbed 9.8 percent.  Hanjin Shipping Co., South Korea’s largest shipping line,
jumped by the daily limit of 15 percent as a rebound in freight
rates raised expectations earnings may recover in the third
quarter.  Mando Corp. (060980) , an automotive parts maker, jumped 12 percent,
the biggest advance since May 2010, after announcing a plan to
buy back 200,000 shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
