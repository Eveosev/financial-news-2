Equatorial Guinea  will reduce
exports of its Zafiro crude to four cargoes in October, one less
than September, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The west African nation will also export three cargoes of
its Ceiba blend, unchanged from September, a separate shipping
schedule showed. Zafiro and Ceiba shipments are of 1 million
barrels each.  Chad  will export three 950,000-barrel consignments of Doba
grade in October, compared with four next month, according to a
loading plan.  All three crudes are low-sulfur, or sweet. Exxon Mobil
Corp. operates the Zafiro and Doba oil fields and Hess Corp.
runs Ceiba.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
