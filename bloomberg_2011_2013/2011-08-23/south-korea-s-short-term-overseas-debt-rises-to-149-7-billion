South Korea ’s overseas short-term
debt rose for a second straight quarter as foreign investors
bought more bonds.  Overseas debt maturing in one year or less gained $1.3
billion to $149.7 billion in the three months through June from
the previous quarter, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement
today. Long-term external debt increased by $14.1 billion to
$248.2 billion.  South Korea will continue its efforts to act
“preemptively” against any external risks while closely
monitoring changes in external debt, capital flows and the
financial markets, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said in
a separate statement today.  South Korea tightened limits on currency-forward positions
starting July 1 and imposed a levy on non-deposit foreign-
currency liabilities held by domestic and foreign banks
beginning Aug. 1, with short-term debt facing higher charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
