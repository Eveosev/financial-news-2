Hog futures fell for the first time
in three sessions on signs of ample U.S. pork supplies and
prospects for slowing demand. Cattle prices also fell.  U.S. warehouses held 453.9 million pounds of the meat on
July 31, up 16 percent from 391.2 million a year earlier, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday in a  report  after
the close of futures trading in Chicago. Spot-market hogs fell
2.3 percent yesterday to 97.56 cents a pound, a four-week low,
and wholesale pork slid 0.9 percent to $1.0669 a pound, the
lowest since Aug. 2, USDA data show.  “That excess pork” is pressuring prices,  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa,
said in a telephone interview. “The cash market is starting to
soften up a little bit.”  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.775 cent, or
0.9 percent, to settle 88.225 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The commodity has advanced 11
percent this year.  Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.65 cent, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1.1505 a pound in  Chicago . The commodity
has gained 6.2 percent in 2011.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement declined 0.225
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.3435 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
