Copper gained after data showed
Chinese imports rebounded to the highest level since January and
on speculation that the U.S. will announce additional measures
to shore up the recovery. Zinc and lead also advanced.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange climbed as
much as 1.5 percent to $8,850 a metric ton and traded at $8,839
as of 3:03 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract declined 1.2 percent
yesterday, after losing 10 percent in the past three weeks. The
November-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
closed 1.1 percent higher at 66,650 yuan ($10,418) a ton.  Both scrap and refined copper imports in July rose from the
previous month and were above the year-to-date average, Chinese
customs data showed yesterday. Inbound shipments of refined
metal gained for a second month to 194,280 tons and scrap
imports rose to 432,317 tons, the highest level since December.  “This, together with strong growth in domestic refined
output paints a robust picture of metal demand in  China ,”  Gayle Berry , an analyst at  Barclays Capital , said in a research report
yesterday. “This buying is all the more impressive since it
comes at a seasonally slower period of end-user activity.”  China’s refined copper production climbed 18 percent from a
year earlier to a record of 478,000 tons in July, said the
National Bureau of Statistics on Aug. 9.  Metals were also boosted after the country’s August HSBC
flash Purchasing Managers’ Index stood at 49.8 after a final
reading of 49.3 for July, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said in a statement today. The final August reading is due Sept.
1. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.  Better Than Rumored  The preliminary manufacturing gauge of 49.8 was better than
the “rumored” number of 45, and could provide some relief to
the market, according to Ting Lu, a Hong Kong-based economist at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The official PMI index for August
to be released by the National Bureau of Statistics may be above
the 50-threshold for expansion, he wrote in a note.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is holding its annual symposium in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , this weekend. This time last year
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  hinted that the central bank might
embark on a second round of asset purchases, kicking off a 28
percent rally in the  S&P 500  that ended in a three-year high on
April 29.  “The chance for additional stimulus is quite big,” Wang
Jingjing, an analyst at Founder Futures Co., said by phone from
Changsha city in  Hunan province . “If it comes out as expected,
at least in the short-run, it will help to boost market
confidence.”  Aluminum in London rose 0.3 percent to $2,344.25 a ton,
zinc gained 1.4 percent to $2,183 a ton, and lead climbed 1.2
percent to $2,287 a ton. Nickel climbed 1.1 percent to $21,075 a
ton, and tin advanced 2 percent to $23,300 a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
