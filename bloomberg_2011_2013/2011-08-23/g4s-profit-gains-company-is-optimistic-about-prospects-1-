G4S Plc (GFS) , the world’s largest
publicly traded provider of security services, reported higher
first-half profit and sales and said it’s optimistic about the
rest of the year, prompting the biggest stock gain in 32 months.  Net income rose to 108 million pounds ($179 million) from
94 million pounds a year earlier, in line with estimates of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose to 3.76 billion
pounds, G4S said in a statement today, also tracking analyst
predictions.  “Organic growth is accelerating in most regions and
business sectors and we have a healthy pipeline of bidding
opportunities, particularly in the U.K. government market,”
Chief Executive Officer Nick Buckles said in the statement.  Buckles said the company will take on more work from
governments, and that G4S is benefiting because security is an
expense that’s “very difficult to cut,” according to a
Bloomberg Television interview today. G4S will provide at least
10,000 security guards for the  London  Olympics next year and it
will continue to focus on the  Middle East , as that’s been a
“very strong area,” he said.  G4S rose as much as 23.6 pence, or 9.7 percent, to 267.2
pence in London, the biggest intraday gain since Dec. 8, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
