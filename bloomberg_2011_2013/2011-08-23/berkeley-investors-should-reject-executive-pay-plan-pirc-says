Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) 
shareholders should reject the real-estate developer’s
executive-compensation plan at the company’s Sept. 5 annual
meeting, said  Pensions Investment Research Consultants Ltd. , an
 investment adviser .  Incentive pay at the U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market
value, including a bonus of as much as 300 percent of base
salary, is “excessive” for a U.K.-listed company, PIRC said in
a statement today. Stock options in long-term incentive pay
would be granted at a 73 percent discount to the current share
price and “no performance target is required,” PIRC said.  “Potential and actual payouts for executive variable pay
are excessive,” PIRC said. “This concern is compounded by the
fact that salaries rank at the top” in comparison with peers.  Berkeley spokesman Tim Robertson wasn’t available for
comment when called by Bloomberg.  Berkeley, the best-performing U.K. homebuilder this year,
has benefited from its concentration in London and southeast
England, where the recovery in  house prices  has been the
strongest. The Cobham, England-based company abandoned high-
volume homebuilding in 2004 and concentrated on houses rather
than apartments in urban areas.  Berkeley has risen 17 percent in London trading this year,
beating the Bloomberg EMA Homebuilders Index, which has fallen
4.6 percent in that time.  PIRC, based in London, provides consulting services to
institutional investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
