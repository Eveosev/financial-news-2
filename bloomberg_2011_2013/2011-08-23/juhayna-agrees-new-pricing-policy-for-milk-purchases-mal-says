Juhayna Food Industries, Egypt’s
biggest producer of packaged milk, agreed to adjust prices paid
to farmers in line with fluctuations in the cost of fodder,  Al
Mal  reported, citing Safwan Thabet, the chairman.  The measure, which came into effect at the start of July,
will reduce the Cairo-based company’s profit margin, the
newspaper cited Thabet as saying. Juhayna will take steps,
including cutting costs, to mitigate the impact of the policy
change on profit, according to  Al Mal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
