The crisis threatening the global
financial system exceeds the capabilities of developed nations
and requires a new International Monetary Fund “debt
facility,” former IMF head H. Johannes Witteveen said.  “Unusual problems require unconventional solutions,”
Witteveen wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times
today. “The world’s financial system is threatened by a new
crisis that could be even worse than that of 2008.” He was IMF
managing director from 1973 to 1978.  Renewed signs of economic weakness globally and the
downgrading of  U.S. debt  by Standard & Poor’s have rekindled
concern about the quality of government borrowing, especially in
Europe. Slumping confidence has wiped $8 trillion from the value
of equities in four weeks.  The leaders of euro zone nations have done everything
politically feasible to counter the crisis, while the European
Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve are close to the limit
of their capabilities, Witteveen said. A new fund could tap the
currency reserves of China, Japan, the  Middle East  and European
nations such as Germany, he said.  It “would allow the fund to borrow large amounts from all
surplus countries and so provide temporary financing even for a
big country such as  Italy ,” the former official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
