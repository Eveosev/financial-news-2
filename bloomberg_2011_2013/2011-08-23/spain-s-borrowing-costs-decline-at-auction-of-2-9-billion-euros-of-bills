Spain sold 2.9 billion euros ($4.3
billion) of bills, near the maximum target, and its borrowing
costs fell after the  European Central Bank  bought bonds in the
secondary market.  The Treasury said it sold three-month bills at an average
yield of 1.357 percent, compared with 1.899 percent in a July 26
auction. It also sold six-month debt at 2.187 percent, down from
2.519 percent in July.  Demand for the three-month bills was 7.62 times the amount
sold, from 6.27 times in July, and the bid-to-cover ratio on the
six-month debt 3.6 from 2.15. The Treasury had set a maximum
target of 3 billion euros for the sale.  The ECB started buying Italian and Spanish bonds on Aug. 8
as the sovereign-debt crisis threatened to engulf the euro
region’s third- and fourth-biggest economies. As part of policy
makers’ efforts to stem the surge in borrowing costs, both
countries agreed to take additional austerity steps and  Spain ’s
parliament is set to vote on the cuts today.  The ECB bought 14.3 billion euros of government debt last
week, compared with 22 billion euros the previous week, as
Spanish 10-year bond yields fell as low as 4.96 percent on Aug.
17, from 6.28 percent on Aug. 4.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond was little
changed after the sale, gaining 1 basis point to 4.97 percent.
The gap between Spanish and German yields narrowed to 282 basis
points after the sale from 286 yesterday.  Spain’s Socialist government, which faces a general
election on Nov. 20, passed a decree to bring forward corporate-
tax receipts and reduce health-care spending on Aug. 19 that
Parliament must ratify. The government, which has already cut
public wages and frozen pensions, applied the additional
measures to bolster public finances by 5 billion euros as it
tries to cut the deficit to 6 percent of gross domestic product
this year from 9.2 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
