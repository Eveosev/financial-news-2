Gold for immediate delivery rallied
after dropping the most in more than a year yesterday.  Bullion increased as much as 0.5 percent to $1,837.85 an
ounce and traded at $1,836.18 an ounce at 7:47 a.m. Singapore
time. The metal jumped to a record $1,913.50 yesterday on
speculation that Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will
signal further measures to stimulate the  U.S. economy  later this
week and as debt crises spurred demand for haven assets.  “Gold looks very bubbly,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “Gold’s going to continue to suck everybody in.
There’s too much risk of a wicked correction lurking around the
corner to enter the trade right now.”  Spot gold dropped 3.7 percent yesterday, the most since
February 2010. Today, futures for December delivery fell 1.2
percent to $1,838.90 an ounce, extending yesterday’s slide.  Before yesterday, prices surged 17 percent in three weeks.
The metal is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in  London , as investors seek
to diversify their holdings away from equities and some
currencies. Bullion also reached all-time highs in euros,
British pounds and Swiss francs.  “A little stability in the stock market triggered this
trailing stop liquidation,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer
at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago yesterday. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 3.4 percent.  Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products fell
for a third day, sliding 24.8 metric tons to 2,181.6 tons, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record 2,216.8 tons
on Aug. 8. UBS AG raised its one-month gold forecast to $1,950
from $1,725 and increased its three-month outlook to $2,100 from
$1,850. Bernanke is speaking Aug. 26 in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming,
at an annual conference sponsored by the Fed Bank of Kansas City.  “In the long-term, gold is attractive,” Zeman of
Kingsview said. “Fiscal deficits are completely out of control.
It’s no wonder that investors are losing faith in  paper money .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
