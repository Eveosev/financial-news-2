Swiss exports fell in July as the
strengthening franc curbed companies’ competitiveness.  Foreign sales, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation,
declined 3 percent from the previous month, when they gained a
revised 3.8 percent, the Federal Customs Office in Bern said in
an e-mailed  statement  today. Imports rose 0.1 percent after
increasing a revised 1 percent in June, and the  trade balance 
widened to 2.83 billion Swiss francs ($1.27 billion) from 1.77
billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
