U.S. gasoline demand fell 0.8
percent last week as average prices at the pump dropped 4 cents,
according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Motorists bought 9.06 million barrels a day in the week
ended Aug. 19, down from 9.14 million the previous week, the
second-biggest payments network company said in its
SpendingPulse report. Demand was down 4.2 percent from a year
earlier.  The average pump price was $3.59 a gallon, down from $3.63
the previous week and up 32 percent from a year earlier.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline consumption was 3.8
percent below a year earlier, John Gamel, director of economic
analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the report. It was the 22nd
week in a row that demand fell on that basis, Gamel said.  “This year gasoline demand has not been able to climb
above 64 million barrels per week, even though August is
typically the last month of the busy summer driving season,”
Gamel said. Drivers bought 63.4 million barrels last week, the
report showed.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
