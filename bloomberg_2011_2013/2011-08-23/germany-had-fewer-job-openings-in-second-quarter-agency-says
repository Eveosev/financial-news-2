The number of registered job
vacancies in  Germany  slipped in the second quarter, signaling
that companies may be slowing expansion of their payrolls as
economic growth weakens.  Europe ’s biggest economy had 974,000 vacancies in the
second quarter, about 80,000 less than in the previous period,
the Federal Labor Agency’s  IAB  research unit reported today.
Germany’s economy almost stalled in the second quarter, growing
0.1 percent.  The Nuremberg-based labor agency will publish its monthly
unemployment figures on Aug. 31. Germany’s jobless rolls shrank
in July for a 25th straight month, declining a seasonally
adjusted 11,000 to 2.96 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
