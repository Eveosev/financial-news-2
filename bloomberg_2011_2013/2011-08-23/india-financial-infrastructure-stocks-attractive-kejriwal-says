Arun Kejriwal, director of Kejriwal
Research & Investment Services Pvt., comments on the outlook for
Indian equities. Kejriwal spoke by phone from Mumbai.  On markets:  “The markets were weak at the beginning of the day but
have recovered. A lot of this bullishness is primarily on
account of the expiration of the August series on Thursday. We
started off the series just short of 5,500 on the Nifty and had
gone close to the 4,800 mark, so this is an attempt to bridge
that gap to some extent.  ‘‘Currently, you don’t have any overseas cues which are
positive, except that the market did not fall yesterday. So
there seems to be some sort of respite. Going forward, the
foreign selling is still happening. If that subsides or reduces,
that could be a positive because our markets are very heavily
dependent on their influence.’’  Nifty stock-index futures expire on the last Thursday of
every month.  On macroeconomic factors:  ‘‘A macroeconomic factor that could be of some significance
would be the crop details, which will be available by September-
end. Everything in  Europe  and the U.S. is still in a state of
flux. Unless some clarity comes in, we will continue to see
volatile and depressed movement in the market.  On stocks:  ‘‘I would recommend some financial institutions and
infrastructure stocks and avoid everything else in general.
Because valuations are looking decent, we are investing in these
two sectors.’’  -- Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
