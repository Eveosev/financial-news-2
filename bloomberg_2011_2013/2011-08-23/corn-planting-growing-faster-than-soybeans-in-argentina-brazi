Corn plantings in Argentina and
 Brazil  will grow faster than the dominant soybeans crop in the
2011-12 marketing year, Hamburg-based researcher Oil World said.  Corn planting in Argentina will rise 13 percent to a record
4.9 million hectares (12.1 million acres), and the soybean area
will climb 2.2 percent, Oil World said in a report today. Corn
planting in Brazil will rise 4.5 percent to 14.3 million
hectares, against 2.2 percent growth in soybeans, it said.  “Although soybeans will still remain the dominant crop in
terms of acreage, we expect a slowing down of the growth,” Oil
World said. “The biggest expansion is likely to occur in corn.
This year soybeans are facing greater competition not only from
grains but also from other oilseeds.”  Corn futures have climbed 18 percent this year while
soybeans have dropped 0.6 percent.  The total grain area in  Argentina  will rise 7.5 percent to
13.3 million hectares as oilseed planting climbs 3 percent to
21.7 million hectares, Oil World said. Brazil’s grain seeding
will rise 3.5 percent to 20.5 million hectares and the oilseed
area will expand 2.2 percent to 26.5 million hectares, it said.  Cordoba is the only region in Argentina where soil moisture
is inadequate, according to the report. In Brazil, parts of Mato
Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goias are all suffering from a
lack of precipitation. Agronomists have said at least 100
millimeters (3.9 inches) of rain is required in the first three
weeks of September before plantings begins, Oil World said.  “Timely plantings of corn and soybeans are jeopardized by
unusually low soil moisture supplies,” the researcher said.
“In several regions there was no rainfall for 100 to 120 days.
This has created severely dry conditions. Current forecasts do
not show any noticeable rainfall until early September.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
