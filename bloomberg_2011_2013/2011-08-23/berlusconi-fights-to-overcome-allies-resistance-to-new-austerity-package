Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  is fighting to overcome resistance among allies to
newly imposed austerity measures, which still need to be
approved by lawmakers.  Angelino Alfano, leader of Berlusconi’s People of Liberty
Party, today holds talks with party dissidents, including
Defense Undersecretary Guido Crosetto and Antonio Martino, to
secure an agreement on a measures that include cuts to local
administrations and a surtax on the highest earners.  Seeking to stem surging borrowing costs amid Europe’ debt
crisis, Berlusconi’s Cabinet on Aug. 12 approved 45.5 billion
euros ($64 billion) in spending cuts and tax increases, the
second austerity package in a month. It aimed to balance the
budget by 2013 and includes plans to liberalize labor rules and
to lift the  retirement age  for women faster than planned.  Berlusconi faces clashes over pension reform with the
 Northern League , his closest political ally. Lawmakers have
begun debating the measures at committee level.  The measures are likely to be approved, economists at
Barclays Capital including Fabio Fois said in a note published
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
