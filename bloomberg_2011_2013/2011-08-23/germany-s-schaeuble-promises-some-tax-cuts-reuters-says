German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he plans to introduce some limited tax cuts,
while the government gives priority to reducing debt,  Reuters 
said, citing comments by Schaeuble made yesterday.  The changes should eliminate a progression of tax rates
that eats away wage increases offset by inflation, and will
result in some reduction of  tax revenue  for the government,
Schaeuble was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
