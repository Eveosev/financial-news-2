since Aug. 15. The rate has declined 40 basis points this month.
The yield on Koor Industries Ltd.’s 5.1 percent bond maturing in
September 2016 dropped 12 basis points to 8.04 percent.  “The panic in recent weeks that pushed fixed government
bond yields down was exaggerated and investors feel prices rose
to unattractive levels,” Shraga Stern, a trader at Union Bank
of Israel Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone. “Appetite for
riskier assets of large corporates is returning as institutions
look for investments after large redemptions over past weeks.”  Investors withdrew 930 million shekels ($260 million) from
Israeli funds last week, bringing the total amount this month to
5.7 billion shekels, Meitav Investment House Ltd. said Aug. 21.
Last week’s redemptions included 640 million shekels from
corporate-bond funds and 50 million shekels from stock funds.  The yield on IDB Development Corp.’s 4.5 percent bond
maturing June 2018 dropped 10 basis points to 7.94 percent. The
extra yield investors demand to hold IDB bonds instead of
Israeli sovereign debt also declined 10 basis points.  CPI-Linked Bonds  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who is scheduled

expectations for inflation over the time period, increased three
basis points to 210, implying an average annual inflation rate
of 2.10 percent. Israeli consumer prices are expected to rise
