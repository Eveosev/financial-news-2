The German state of Hesse, governed
by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic Union party,
demanded a say in the efforts to stabilize the euro,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine  reported, citing an internal letter.  The Bundesrat, the national parliament’s upper house,
should be involved in plans how to tackle the euro-area’s debt
crisis, Hesse’s European Affairs and Justice Minister Joerg-Uwe Hahn wrote, according to the report.  Hahn also said that financial help for euro region member
states should be “the last resort.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
