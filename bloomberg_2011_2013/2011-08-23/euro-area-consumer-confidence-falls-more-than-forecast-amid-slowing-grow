European  consumer confidence 
weakened more than economists forecast in August as growth in
the euro-region slowed amid the sovereign debt crisis.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
fell to minus 16.6 from minus 11.2 in July, the Brussels-based
European Commission said in an initial estimate today. That’s
the lowest since June 2010. Economists forecast a drop to minus
12.4, the median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Europe ’s economy is struggling to gather strength as
governments from Italy to Spain step up budget cuts to fight the
debt crisis. Pledges of 365 billion euros ($525 billion) in
official loans to Greece, Portugal and Ireland, and 110.5
billion euros of bond purchases by the  European Central Bank 
failed to fix the finances of those countries or prevent
speculative attacks on Spain and Italy.  The euro pared losses after the data were released, trading
at $1.4398 at 4:28 p.m. in Brussels, up 0.3 percent on the day.  The commission will release its final August consumer
confidence survey on Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
