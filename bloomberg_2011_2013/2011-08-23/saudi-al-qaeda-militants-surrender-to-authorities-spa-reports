Two Saudi Arabian suspected al-Qaeda
militants turned themselves in to authorities, the  Saudi Press
Agency  said, citing an unidentified Interior Ministry spokesman.  The families of the two suspects, who had been in  Pakistan ,
contacted security authorities and expressed the individuals’
“desire to be assisted in returning home and to surrender
themselves,” the Riyadh-based news service said.  Saudi Arabia  has arrested 11,527 people since Sept. 11,
2001, for their alleged involvement in terrorism, the ministry
said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
