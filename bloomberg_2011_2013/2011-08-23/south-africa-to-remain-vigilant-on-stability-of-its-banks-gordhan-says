South Africa  remains “vigilant” on
maintaining financial stability to keep the country’s banking
industry stable and well capitalized in the face of global
uncertainty, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  Lenders still need to cut fees, improve access to credit
and implement international principles on executive
compensation, Gordhan told a conference in Johannesburg today.
About 63 percent of the adult population has a bank account, a
figure the industry wants to increase to 70 percent.  “There is a perception that the financial sector isn’t
doing enough to support the real economy,” he said.  South African banks and regulators should be congratulated
for the lenders’ positive performance at a time when the global
economy is in turmoil, with the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index having
lost 17 percent this year in the wake of uncertainty about debt
defaults in Europe and growth in the U.S. South Africa’s six-
member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index has dropped 6.2 percent this
year, reaching lows not seen since June last year.  Cas Coovadia, head of the country’s  Banking Association ,
said it was unlikely the government would heed a call by the
ruling African National Congress’s youth wing to nationalize
banks.  “I don’t think nationalization will happen in South
Africa,” Coovadia said at the conference. Gordhan didn’t
comment on the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
