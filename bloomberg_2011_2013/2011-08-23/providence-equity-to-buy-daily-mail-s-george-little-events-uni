Providence Equity Partners agreed to
buy  Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGO) ’s U.S. conference unit for
about 106 million pounds ($175 million), enabling the publisher
of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper to pay down debt.  The disposal of  George Little Management , a company that
runs events for industries such as jewelry retailers and
restaurants, will bring about 90 million pounds in cash for the
U.K. publisher, with the remaining payment in the form of an
interest-bearing note, London-based Daily Mail said in a
statement today.  The unit was among divisions that have helped make up for
losses at Daily Mail’s newspaper operations. The publisher’s
fiscal third-quarter business-to-business sales, excluding
currency shifts and acquisitions or disposals and including the
events unit, rose 8 percent, versus a 7 percent drop in
advertising revenue at the media business.  The group had net  debt  totaling 820 million pounds at the
end of the three months through June, the company said in July.
Earlier this month, Daily Mail & General Trust sold its Indian
information-services division for a “nominal consideration.”  Daily Mail  rose  as much as 7.2 pence, or 1.9 percent, to
384.9 pence and was up 0.3 percent as of 9:40 a.m. in London
trading. That pared the stock’s drop this year to 34 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
