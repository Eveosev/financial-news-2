Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s
government has dropped a planned bonus tax on Italians earning
more than 90,000 euros ($131,000) a year from a package of
austerity measures that aims to balance the budget in 2013.  The levy will be replaced with other measures that aim to
target tax evaders, Berlusconi’s office said in an e-mailed
statement. The decision came after Berlusconi and Finance
Minister  Giulio Tremonti  met with Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi , a coalition ally that opposed some of the key aspects of
the austerity plan passed by Berlusconi’s Cabinet on Aug. 12.  As a result of today’s agreement, the plan will also be
modified to reduce the cuts in transfers to regional and local
governments. The note did not give details of how the government
would compensate for the lost deficit reduction from today’s
changes.  “Maybe this is not all we wanted, but it is also important
to keep a solid majority.” Defense Undersecretary Guido Crosetto told the Ansa news agency.  Crosetto, who is a member of Berlusconi’s party, criticized
the previous version of the austerity plan. The new package will
go ahead with efforts to reduce the size of the parliament, the
statement said.  The Italian Senate is due to vote on the austerity bill
next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
