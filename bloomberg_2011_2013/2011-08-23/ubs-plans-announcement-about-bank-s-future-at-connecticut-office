UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
and Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy will make a “major
announcement” today about UBS’s future in the state, the
governor’s office said.  UBS is no longer negotiating to lease space at lower
Manhattan’s World Trade Center, a person familiar with the
matter said in July. The Zurich-based lender had been
considering moving staff of its U.S. investment-bank unit from
Stamford, Connecticut, to the site, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said in June.  UBS completed its Stamford expansion in 2002, building a
trading floor the size of two football fields for 1,400 people.
The office is about an hour by train from Manhattan’s Grand
Central Terminal. UBS leases more than 3 million square feet of
office space for various operations in the  New York ,  New Jersey 
and Connecticut region, Torie von Alt, a spokeswoman for the
company, said in June.  Christiaan Brakman, a spokesman for the company, declined
to comment on the press conference scheduled for 3 p.m. Colleen Flanagan, Malloy’s spokeswoman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
