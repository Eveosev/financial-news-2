Tingyi ( Cayman Islands ) Holding
Corp.,  China ’s biggest maker of packaged food, said cost
“pressure” will continue in the second half as its gross
margin stayed near the lowest level in at least a decade.  “It may take a longer period of time for prices to return
to a lower level,” the maker of Master Kong noodles and ready-
to-drink tea said in its earnings statement today. First-half
gross profit margin was 26.1 percent, the second-lowest level
for a six-month period since at least 2001, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income rose 16 percent to $229 million in the six
months ended June 30, Tingyi said in a statement to  Hong Kong ’s
stock exchange. Sales climbed to $4.1 billion as revenue from
instant noodles rose 22 percent.  Foodmakers in China, including smaller rival  Want Want
China Holdings Ltd. (151) , are contending with higher costs of raw
materials such as sugar and plastic packaging. China’s consumer
prices accelerated to 6.5 percent in July, the fastest pace in
three years.  “Since last year and in the first half of this year, our
Group faced tremendous pressure from surging costs in raw
materials which had significantly affected our profitability,”
Want Want said in a filing today. Marketing and promotions in
the second half will help improve product margins, it said.  Shares Slide  Tingyi dropped as much as 11 percent, the biggest intraday
loss since Jan. 22, 2008, to HK$22.05 before trading at HK$22.50
as of 2:27 p.m. in Hong Kong. The stock has advanced 13 percent
so far this year, compared with a 14 percent slide in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   The global economy’s recovery “is not smooth,
uncertainties in economic growth and instability in the
financial markets have increased significantly,” Tingyi said.
“It may take a longer period of time for prices to return to a
lower level.”  Tingyi will strengthen cost controls and optimize
production to deal with rising raw materials and labor costs, it
said. “The domestic driving force for domestic economic growth
remains strong.”  Tingyi had a gross profit margin of 25.97 percent in the 
second half of last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Net income for Want Want rose 3.6 percent to $167 million
with sales growing 28 percent to $1.3 billion.  Want Want fell 3.2 percent to HK$6.35 and has declined 6.9
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
