Baywa AG (BYW) , a German farm products and
building-materials company, bought a 90 percent stake in Ecowind
GmbH to expand in the growing East European wind energy market.  Baywa, based in Munich, bought the stake from Austria’s AAG
Holding GmbH for 4.6 million euros ($6.6 million) because of
“the huge potential of onshore wind in Eastern  Europe ,” the
company said in a statement today.  The German company said Aug. 4 it would invest 250 million
euros in its renewable unit to develop and sell solar, wind and
biogas plants to investors in Europe, the U.S. and North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
