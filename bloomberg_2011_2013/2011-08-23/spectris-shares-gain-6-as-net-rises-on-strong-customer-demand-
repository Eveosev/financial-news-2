Spectris Plc (SXS) , the U.K.’s biggest
maker of production-testing gear, surged 7.3 percent in London
trading after first-half profit rose on “strong customer
demand” and acquisitions.  Spectris shares advanced to 1,373 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, its biggest gain since February. Net income for
the six months to June 30 jumped 62 percent to 53.6 million
pounds ($88 million), the Egham, England-based company said
today in a statement. Revenue climbed 25 percent to 507.2
million pounds.  “Five percent of sales came from six acquisitions that all
performed well,” Chief Executive Officer John O’Higgins said
today in a telephone interview. “We expect that our sales
growth will revert to more normal levels from here on out, which
is historically about 6 percent for us.”  This month, Spectris bought Omega Engineering for $475
million and IRM Group for about $11 million.  O’Higgins said there “may well be” further acquisitions
later in the year, but probably “nothing the size of Omega.”  The company raised its half-year dividend 15 percent to 8.2
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
