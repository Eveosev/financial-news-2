Chilean economic growth may exceed 5
percent next year, helped by rising consumer demand, Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain said.  Speaking at the Bloomberg Chile Economic Summit in Santiago
today, Larrain reiterated the government’s projection for gross
domestic product expansion this year, which is 6.6 percent. The
government aims to average 6 percent annual growth over its
four-year term.  “Economic growth undoubtedly will decelerate in the second
half of the year,” Larrain said. “But we are confident about
achieving 6 percent average growth during this government.”  Growth slowed to 6.8 percent in the second quarter of this
year from a year earlier compared with 10 percent in the first
quarter. The economy will expand 5.3 percent in the three months
through September, according to the median estimate of 65
economists in the central bank poll.  To contact the reporters on this story:
