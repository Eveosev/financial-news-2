North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il  ate
local Siberian delicacies including omul fish as he toured the
world’s largest freshwater lake, Baikal, today before a meeting
with Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev .  Kim, who made a 24-day railway trip across  Russia  to meet
then-President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in 2001 and returned a
year later to Vladivostok, is traveling on a 21-carriage train
with his personal Mercedes. He arrived today in Ulan Ude, where
regional officials and young people dressed in national costumes
welcomed him, the state-run Itar-Tass news agency said.  The North Korean and Russian leaders will hold talks
tomorrow in Ulan-Ude near the border with Mongolia, according to
Russian state television.  Russia is offering  North Korea  to build a natural-gas
pipeline that would earn it transit fees from Russian gas
shipped to  South Korea  to induce the communist regime to restart
nuclear non-proliferation talks. The meeting with Medvedev aims
to help end a three-year hiatus in six-party negotiations that
include China and the U.S. on dismantling North Korea’s nuclear
weapons program,  Kim bathed in a swimming pool with water from Baikal before
getting onto a boat for his lake tour, Itar-Tass said. He was
later offered Siberian dishes including dumplings, boiled
sausage and omul, a fish unique to Baikal.  Baikal, a United Nations World Heritage site, is the
world’s deepest lake. It covers about 12,200 square miles,
roughly the size of Belgium, and is home to 57 species of fish,
including the omul, a member of the salmon family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
