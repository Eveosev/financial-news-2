Iran ’s Foreign Ministry
congratulated Libyans while it urged them to prevent
interference from foreign “oppressors” after rebels said they
gained control of most of the nation’s capital and western
leaders declared an end to Muammar Qaddafi’s 42-year rule.  “Iran congratulates the Muslim people of  Libya  for the
latest developments that arose from their months-long resistance
and stand as another symbol of the popular movements in the
region,” the ministry said in a statement published by the
official  Islamic Republic News Agency . “The popular uprising in
Libya shows once more that meeting people’s rightful demands and
respect for their opinions are undeniable necessities.”  Iranian authorities have applauded the ouster of Egypt’s
 Hosni Mubarak  and  Tunisia ’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, whom they
portrayed as U.S. “puppets,” and expressed support for
Bahrain’s mostly Muslim Shiite protesters, a faith Iran shares.  Iranian officials have cracked down on domestic opposition
movements formed after the 2009 disputed presidential election
that led to a second term for President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Mass protests in June 2009 and a string of demonstrations in the
following months left dozens dead and thousands initially
jailed.  Iran, which is at loggerheads with the U.S. and its western
allies partly over the Persian Gulf nation’s nuclear program,
cautioned Libyans to “prevent foreigners, especially
yesterday’s oppressors and those which have claims today, from
meddling with their fate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
