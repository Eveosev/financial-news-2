University of  Tennessee  women’s
coach Pat Summitt, the winningest coach in college basketball
history, said today she is suffering from early onset dementia.  Summitt will continue to coach the Lady Vols, who she has
led to eight National Collegiate Athletic Association titles in
36 years at Tennessee. She has been chosen NCAA coach of the
year seven times.  “Earlier this year, the doctors at the Mayo Clinic
diagnosed me with an early onset dementia, Alzheimer’s type, at
the age of 59,” Summitt said in a  YouTube video  on the
university’s website. “I love being your coach and the
privilege of being able to go to work every day with our
outstanding Lady Vol student athletes.”  Summitt has a 1,071-199 record at Tennessee, more victories
in men’s or women’s college basketball than any other coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
