Nortel Networks Inc., the bankrupt
former maker of telephone equipment, won court permission to cut
the price of its former Internet phone business by $25 million,
almost 17 months after selling the unit to Genband Inc.  At a joint hearing of courts in the U.S. and  Canada , the
judges overseeing Nortel’s liquidation approved the reduction,
which came after Genband challenged the price formula used last
year when it bought the unit. Genband completed the sale in May
2010, paying $182.5 million into an escrow account, according to
court records  Since filing for bankruptcy in 2009, Nortel has been
selling its business units. Last month, Nortel won court
approval for the last and largest major transaction, the $4.5
billion sale of its patent portfolio to a group that includes
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   After negotiating with Genband, Nortel’s units in Canada
and the U.S. agreed to a final purchase price of $157.7 million,
according to court documents.  “These resolutions move the matter toward the ultimate
resolution of the case,” U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross said
in Wilmington, Delaware. The price adjustment was also approved
by Ontario Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Morawetz in Toronto.  The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-10138,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
