The outlook for the cement industry
in  Saudi Arabia  remains “positive” while that in the United
Arab Emirates remains “negative,” according to the research
unit of  Global Investment House KSCC. (GLOBAL)   “We are positive on the Saudi Arabian cement sector due to
better demand supply situation as compared with other countries
in the GCC,” Global Research said in an e-mailed report today.  The outlook for the industry in the U.A.E. remains
“negative” as revenue of publicly traded companies dropped 56
percent in the first half “because of low demand in the country
along with lesser export opportunities regionally,” Kuwait-
based Global said. The outlook for Oman was cut to “neutral”
from “positive,” while Qatar’s remained “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
