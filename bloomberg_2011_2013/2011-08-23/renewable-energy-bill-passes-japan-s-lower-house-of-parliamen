Japan ’s lower house of parliament
approved legislation to subsidize electricity from renewable
sources as the country reduces its dependence on atomic energy
after the Fukushima nuclear crisis.  Passage of the bill, which now goes to the upper house,
sets the stage for Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  to leave office this
month and the ruling Democratic Party of Japan to choose his
successor. Kan’s popularity has fallen over his handling of the
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster and he pledged to step
down once the Diet approves his legislative agenda.  The legislation requires utilities to buy electricity
generated by geothermal, solar and wind sources at above-market
rates in order to stimulate investment in renewable energy,
which accounts for  9 percent  of Japan’s power supply. Solar
panel manufacturers like  Kyocera Corp. (6971)  and geothermal plant
developers including Fuji Electric Co. may benefit from the
subsidies, known as feed-in tariffs.  Kan last month called for phasing out atomic power after
the March earthquake and tsunami caused the worst nuclear
disaster in 25 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
