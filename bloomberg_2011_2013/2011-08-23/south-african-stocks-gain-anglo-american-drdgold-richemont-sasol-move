The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
fell for the first day in three, declining 173.26, or 0.6
percent, to 29,259.86 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Cie Financiere Richemont SA (CFR)  , a maker of luxury
watches, increased for the first day in four, gaining 58 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to 37.64 rand. Swiss watch exports rose 21
percent in July from the same month a year ago, according to
data supplied by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.
 Asia  accounts for 48 percent of Richemont’s revenue.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest
gold company, climbed to its highest in a week, adding 1.96
rand, or 2.2 percent, to 92.88 rand. Gold advanced to an all-
time high above $1,910 as investors sought to protect their
wealth against financial turmoil amid speculation that the
global economy is slowing.  DRDGold Ltd. (DRD)  ,  South Africa ’s fourth-largest
producer of the metal, closed at its highest in 12 weeks,
gaining 16 cents, or 4.7 percent, to 3.60 rand.  Eqstra Holdings Ltd. (EQS)  , which imports industrial and
construction equipment, rose to its highest in more than a
month, advancing 34 cents, or 4.8 percent, to 7.43 rand.

earlier.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer, fell the most in 18 months, dropping 5.40 rand, or 4.3
percent, to 119.25 rand. The company’s 14-day relative strength
index, which shows how rapidly prices advanced or dropped during
a specified time period, was 72.3 yesterday, its third move
above 70 this month. A reading of 70 or above may be a signal to
some investors who study technical charts that prices may be set
to decline.  Iliad Ltd. (ILA SJ), a producer of building supplies,
retreated for a second day, falling 30 cents, or 5.7 percent, to
5 rand. The company reported a loss of 2.12 rand per share for
the year through June, compared with earnings of 15.1 cents a
year earlier.  Onelogix Group Ltd. (OLG)  , a South African logistics

retailer by market value, declined the most in four months,
slipping 2.79 rand, or 2.7 percent, to 102.40 rand. The company
warned of tougher times ahead and increased competition with the
entry of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to the South African market as it
released results for the year to June 30.  Stefanutti Stocks Holdings Ltd. (SSK)  , a construction
and engineering company, closed at its lowest in more than four
months, easing 5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 10.75 rand. Earnings

percent to 30 percent lower, the company said in a trading
