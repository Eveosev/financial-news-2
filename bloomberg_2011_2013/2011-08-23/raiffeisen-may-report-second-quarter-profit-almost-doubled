Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ,
eastern  Europe ’s third-biggest lender, may say second-quarter
profit almost doubled from a year earlier, when it wrote down
the value of derivatives and government bonds.  Net income probably rose to 265 million euros ($383
million) from 138 million euros a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Vienna-based bank will report results on Aug. 25 at 7:30 a.m.  Net interest income, Raiffeisen’s biggest revenue source,
probably declined 1.7 percent to 905 million euros, while loan-
loss provisions fell 17 percent to 235 million euros, analysts
said. Raiffeisen, with units in 15 former communist countries,
ranks behind  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  in terms of
assets in the region.  The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and
year-earlier figures in millions of euros.  The following banks participated in the survey: Citigroup,
