China Telecom Corp., the country’s
biggest fixed-line carrier, gained the most in eight trading
sessions after it said second-quarter profit rose 12 percent.  The company’s American depositary receipts rose 4.6 percent
to $58.95 at 11:29 a.m. in  New York , the biggest intraday
increase since Aug. 11.  Profit excluding gains from connection fees rose to 5.09
billion yuan ($795 million) in the three months ended June 30,
