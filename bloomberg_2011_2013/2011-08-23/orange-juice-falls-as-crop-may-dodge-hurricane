Orange-juice  futures fell on signs
that groves in Florida, the world’s second-biggest citrus
grower, may escape damage from Hurricane Irene as the storm’s
track shifts east. Cotton also declined.  Hurricane Irene is expected to grow into a major story in
the next day as it rips through the Bahamas before going ashore
in  North Carolina  over the weekend and moving up the East Coast.
It was 55 miles (88 kilometers) south of Grand Turk Island at
about 2 p.m. New York time, according to a U.S.  National
Hurricane Center  advisory shortly before 11 a.m. East Coast
time.  “The level of angst has decreased dramatically in the last
24 hours or so,” Ray Royce, the  executive director  at the
Highlands County Citrus Growers Association in Sebring, Florida,
said today in a telephone interview. “Things can change, but
all of the models seem to be in agreement” that the worst of
the storm will bypass Florida, he said.  Orange juice for November delivery fell 2.45 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $1.632 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S., the
biggest decline since Aug. 10. The commodity climbed 20 percent
in the past year.  The Highlands County group accounts for about 13 percent of
Florida’s production.  Brazil  is the biggest citrus grower.  Cotton futures for December delivery dropped 1.21 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $1.0524 a pound on ICE. Prices have fallen 52
percent since touching a record $2.197 in March as consumption
waned in  China , the top user.  To contact the reporter on this story:
