Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender by assets, has sufficient capital, said  Richard Bove , an analyst at Rochdale Securities.  “There’s no reason for the bank to have to go out and
raise capital whatsoever,” Bove said in an interview today with
Bloomberg Television’s Margaret Brennan.  Bank of America has fallen more than half in New York
trading this year amid speculation that costs from mortgage
disputes will drain capital.  Henry Blodget , the former Internet
analyst turned blogger, wrote on Business Insider today that
writedowns and loan costs may force the  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based firm to raise as much as $200 billion.  “You cannot break the bank by driving the price of the
stock lower, particularly if the bank is as cash-rich as this
one is with deposits pouring in,” Bove said.  Bank of America pared its losses today after Bove’s
remarks. The shares slipped 1.1 percent to $6.35 as of 10:30
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They had
previously fallen as much as 6.4 percent following Blodget’s
post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
