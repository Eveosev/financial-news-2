Hong Kong’s inflation-linked bonds
advanced to a record after data released yesterday showed
inflation in the city surged to the fastest pace since 1995.  Consumer prices rose 7.9 percent in July from a year
earlier, compared with 5.6 percent in June. Banny Lam, an
economist at CCB International Securities in Hong Kong,
forecasts inflation may reach 8 percent in August and will
average 7.8 percent in the second half. The benchmark  Hang Seng
Index (HSI)  of shares has lost more than 14 percent this year.  “Investors expect Hong Kong’s inflation will continue to
rise in the coming months on higher food prices, wages and
rents,” said Lam. “The inflation-linked bonds could be a good
investment alternative, especially given the slump in equities.
However, the room for more returns might be limited now after
recent gains.”  The notes due July 2014, which are traded on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange, reached HK$107.30 ($13.76), the highest level
since they were listed on July 29 at an initial price of HK$100.
They advanced 0.3 percent today to $106.90 as of the 4 p.m.
close in the city.  Interest on the inflation-linked bonds will be paid once
every six months at the higher of either a floating rate
equivalent to the average change in the consumer-price index for
the previous six months, or a 1 percent fixed rate. The first
coupon is due Jan. 30, 2012.  -- With assistance from Sophie Leung in  Hong Kong . Editors:
