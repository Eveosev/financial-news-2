Charter International Plc (CHTR) , a welding
and automation-equipment maker, rose the most in almost eight
weeks in  London  trading, after saying it is in talks with a
potential bidder other than  Melrose Plc. (MRO)   Charter, which has turned down two indicative cash-and-
share offers from Melrose this year, rose 20 percent to close at
747 pence at 4:30 p.m. in London, the biggest gain since June
29.  The Telegraph today reported that Charter had received a
870 pence per share indicative offer from an unnamed bidder.  “The company confirms that it is in discussions with a
potential offer other than Melrose Plc regarding a possible
takeover for the company,” Dublin-registered Charter said in a
Regulatory News Service statement. “These discussions are at an
early stage and there can be no assurance that they will lead to
an offer for the company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
