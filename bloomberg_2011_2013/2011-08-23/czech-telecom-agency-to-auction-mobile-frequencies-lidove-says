The Czech Republic’s
telecommunications regulator plans to auction off unused
transmission frequencies,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing Jana
Artemenkova, an official at the agency.  The auction, which may allow a new mobile services provider
to enter the market, must be preceded by a change of
legislation, the newspaper said. The auction probably won’t be
held earlier than the second half of next year, the newspaper
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
