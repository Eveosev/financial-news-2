Ireland’s trade surplus widened to a
record in June, driven by exports of dairy, medical and
pharmaceutical products, the  Central Statistics Office  said.  The seasonally adjusted surplus increased to 4.08 billion
euros ($5.9 billion) from 3.79 billion euros in May, the Cork-
based CSO said in a  statement  today. Exports rose by 374.6
million euros to 7.9 billion euros, while imports gained 88.5
million euros to 3.8 billion euros.  “The export sector will be the key driver of Ireland’s
economic recovery,” said  Alan McQuaid , chief economist at
Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin, who forecasts a 45 billion-euro
surplus for 2011. “However, with clear signs that the global
economy is slowing down, Ireland’s exports are likely to weaken
in coming months.”  Ireland’s central bank  forecasts  economic growth of 0.8
percent this year, the first expansion since 2007, on the
assumption that rising exports will outweigh declining  consumer
spending . The bank last month raised its forecast for export
growth to 6.4 percent from 6.1 percent.  Exports increased 6 percent to 38.6 billion euros in the
first five months from the year-earlier period, the CSO said.
Imports rose 12 percent to 21.1 billion euros fuelled by
transportation equipment, including aircraft, medical and
pharmaceutical products and petroleum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
