Canary Wharf Group Plc, saying it
won’t vote against  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s amended
liquidation plan, agreed to reduce its claims against the
collapsed bank to $780 million from $4.5 billion.  Under an agreement with the London real estate developer,
Lehman will reserve against payment an amount equal to what
would have been provided had the debt been classified as senior
unsecured claims in the amended plan, according to a filing
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  Lehman had earlier disputed Canary Wharf’s $4.5 billion in
claims, filed in September 2009, according to the filing. The
agreement is subject to bankruptcy court approval.  Lehman, Canary Wharf Group’s largest tenant, occupied more
than 1 million square feet (93,000 square meters) of office
space at  London ’s 20-25 Bank Street in 2003 on a 30-year lease.
Canary Wharf filed three claims in 2009, including a
$4.3 billion claim in rent and charges for units on Heron Quays.
The Heron Quays claim was reduced to $770 million, according to
the filing.  Lehman filed an amended payout plan on July 1 that allots
more money to a group including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
less to bondholders including Paulson & Co. Creditors holding
more than $100 billion in claims support the plan, Lehman said.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
