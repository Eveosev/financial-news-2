Hungarian Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  has written to Andrea Enria, chairman of the European
Banking Authority, about the “serious problems” caused for
households by loans denominated in Swiss francs.  The risks of foreign-currency lending should be curbed
through consumer and “macroprudential” regulation in  Hungary 
and on a European Union level, Matolcsy told the authority,
asking for examples of countries which managed the problem more
successfully, according to an e-mailed statement from the
ministry.  Sixty-four percent of Hungarian household mortgages were
denominated in foreign currencies, most of them in the franc,
according to central bank data as of June 30. The forint has
weakened 6.8 percent against the Swiss franc this year, swelling
households’ mortgage repayment obligations.  The ministry will use the information received from the EBA
in its work examining the roots of the lending problem,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
