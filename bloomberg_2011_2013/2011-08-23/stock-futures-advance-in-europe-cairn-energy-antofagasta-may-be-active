European stocks rose for a second
day amid continuing speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take
action to bolster the economy and as Chinese manufacturing data
exceeded forecasts.  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank, advanced 2.1 percent
after saying it plans to cut 3,500 jobs to trim costs.  Charter
International Plc (CHTR)  soared 20 percent as the welding and
automation-equipment maker said it’s in takeover talks with a
potential rival bidder to Melrose Plc.  National Bank of Greece
SA (ETE)  sank to a 14-year low as the nation’s bonds fell.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.8 percent to
226.63 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , after earlier surging
as much as 2.2 percent. The gauge has still fallen 22 percent
from this year’s peak on Feb. 17 as European and U.S. economic
data that trailed forecasts added to concern the global recovery
is at risk. The retreat has left the Stoxx 600 trading at about
9.4 times its companies’ estimated earnings, near the lowest
since March 2009, Bloomberg data show.  “Chinese PMI is today’s good news as it shows the world is
not falling apart as everybody seemed to believe,” said Morten Kongshaug, a chief equity analyst at Danske Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “European PMI is also a positive as the economy is
not contracting.”  Chinese Manufacturing  Chinese manufacturing may contract at a slower pace in
August as the world’s second-biggest economy weathers slumping
global confidence, according to a preliminary purchasing-
managers index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. The reading of 49.8 for August compared with 49.3
last month. A result below 50 indicates a contraction.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both services and manufacturing remained at 51.1 in
August, Markit said. Economists had forecast a drop to 50, the
median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The Fed is holding its annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, this weekend. This time last year Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  hinted that the central bank might embark on a second
round of asset purchases, kicking off a 28 percent rally in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that ended in a three-year high on
April 29.  “Much of the gains being seen here seem to be coming off
the expectation that the Fed will serve up further stimulus
measures, possibly as soon as the end of this week,” said
Cameron Peacock, a market analyst at IG Markets in Melbourne.
“Clearly with this being priced in, failure to deliver here
will see traders heading for the exits once again.”  Investor Confidence  Stocks pared their advance as a gauge of German investor
confidence fell more than economists forecast to the lowest in
more than 2 1/2 years in August on concern  Europe ’s debt crises
will curb growth.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months in advance, dropped to minus
37.6 from minus 15.1 in July. That’s the lowest since December
2008. Economists expected a decline to minus 26, according to
the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  National benchmark indexes rose in half of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.7 percent, while
 Germany ’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 advanced 1.1 percent.  Greece ’s
ASE lost 3.2 percent to the lowest level since 1996.  UBS Job Cuts  UBS gained 2.1 percent to 10.75 Swiss francs after saying
it will eliminate about 3,500 jobs, or 5.3 percent of the
workforce, as stricter  capital requirements  and a slowdown in
client trading reduce earnings.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the
second-largest Swiss bank, rose 2.3 percent to 21.12 francs.  Charter rallied 20 percent to 747 pence, the biggest gain
since June. The company has turned down two indicative cash-and-
share offers from Melrose this year.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) , the designer of chips for Apple Inc.’s
iPhone, added 4.5 percent to 514 pence as technology shares led
gains in the Stoxx 600. The Guardian, the London-based Times and
the  Daily Mail  all reported that the company may be a takeover
target after Hewlett-Packard Co.’s acquisition of Autonomy Corp.
last week.  Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the world’s biggest maker of
computer mice, advanced 6.7 percent to 7.71 Swiss francs.  G4S Plc (GFS) , the largest publicly traded provider of security
services, gained 8.5 percent to 264.4 pence. The company
reported first-half net income rose to 108 million pounds ($179
million) from 94 million pounds and said it’s optimistic about
business in the second half and into 2012.  Solar Companies  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the second-biggest producer of solar-
grade silicon, rose 3.4 percent to 95.53 euros as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. upgraded the shares. Renewable Energy Corp. ASA, a
Norwegian maker of solar energy components, climbed 5.1 percent
to 8.89 kroner.  National Bank of Greece, the nation’s largest lender, slid
9 percent to 3.23 euros, the lowest since 1997.  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB)  retreated 5.6 percent to 2.03 euros.  Greek government bonds slumped, with 10-year yields
climbing to the highest level in a month, amid uncertainty over
the details of a new loan package for the Mediterranean nation.
Europe is in the midst of agreeing 159 billion euros in new
public aid for Greece and some nations including Finland have
demanded collateral in return for loans.  NKT A/S slumped 18 percent to 182.90 kroner, the largest
decline in 10 years, as the world’s biggest maker of industrial
vacuum cleaners cut its full-year outlook and reported second-
quarter net income that fell short of analyst estimates.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver producer,
slid 7.2 percent to 1,892 pence as the precious metal fell as
much as 2.7 percent in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
