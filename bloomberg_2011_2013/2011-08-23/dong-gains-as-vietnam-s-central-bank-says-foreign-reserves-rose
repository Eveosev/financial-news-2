The Vietnamese dong climbed from a
four-month low as the central bank said the nation’s foreign-
exchange reserves have been bolstered by export earnings and
remittances.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency stockpile has “increased significantly, quite
sufficient to intervene and stabilize the foreign-currency
market in any event,” the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in a
statement on its website today.  Higher reserves “will definitely help boost confidence in
the dong,” said Lai Tat Ha, head of  currency trading  at Hanoi-
based Vietnam Technological & Commercial Joint-Stock Bank. “It
confirms the State Bank will continue to pro-actively intervene
by anticipating the market’s real dollar demand.”  The dong gained 0.05 percent to 20,810 per dollar as of
3:47 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
fell to 20,820 yesterday, the lowest level since April 25.  The central bank set the dong-dollar  reference rate  at
20,618 today, unchanged since Aug. 10, according to its website.
The local currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  The yield on Vietnam’s five-year bonds was little changed
at 12.57 percent, according to a daily fixing price from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
