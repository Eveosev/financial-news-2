Egypt ’s central bank accepted 8.825
billion Egyptian pounds ($1.5 billion) in bids for its seven-day
 repurchase agreements  at an auction today from the 9 billion
pounds it had offered.  The contracts, or repos, allow holders of  government
securities  to sell them back to the central bank to access funds
for one week at 9.25 percent, according to Central Bank of Egypt
data on Bloomberg. The regulator started the facility in March
to allow banks to get funds following the uprising that ended
President Hosni Mubarak’s rule the previous month.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 was little changed at 5.47 percent at 5:08 p.m. in
Cairo.  The pound weakened less than 0.1 percent to 5.9798 against
the dollar. The currency earlier dropped to 5.9803, the lowest
level since January 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
