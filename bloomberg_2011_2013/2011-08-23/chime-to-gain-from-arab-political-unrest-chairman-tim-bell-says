Chime Communications Plc (CHW) , a U.K.-
based public-relations company chaired by Margaret Thatcher’s
former media adviser Tim Bell, expects to benefit from the
political unrest in the  Middle East  and North Africa.  Chime, based in London, is doing work for the National
Transitional Council in  Libya , Bell said in an interview today.
The company also retained its contract with the Bahrain
government and did three months work for the Yemen government in
the first half of the year.  “I see this as a significant area of growth,” Bell said.
“But I don’t know when, it will take time. As countries
rebuild, people will start to invest money.”  As well as increasing its work in the Arab world, Chime is
expanding sports marketing. Sport should account for about 60
percent of the company’s business in two years, up from almost a
quarter now, Bell said  “People are spending more and more on sport because they
are having such a rotten time generally,” Bell said. “It is
becoming the thing you do when you are gloomy.”  Chime will do well from the  London  Olympics next year, Bell
said. The company bought 60 percent of Golden Goal Sports Venues
in  Brazil  in May. Brazil is hosting the 2014 soccer  World Cup 
and the 2016 Olympics.  First-half profit rose 28 percent to 8.3 million pounds
($13.7 million), or 12.7 pence a share, from 6.5 million pounds,
or 11.6 pence, a year earlier, the company said in a statement
today. Revenue increased 13 percent to 153.4 million pounds from
135.8 million pounds.  The shares rose as much as 4.3 percent in London trading
and were up 2.25 pence, or 1.1 percent, to 214.25 pence at 10:36
a.m., paring this year’s decline to 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
