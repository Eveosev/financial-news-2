Hungarian bonds fell, lifting the
2014 yield from the lowest this year after the central bank left
 interest rates  unchanged for a seventh month and said it may
refrain from cutting borrowing costs for an “extended period.”  The bond slump pushed the yield on the benchmark government
note due August 2014 to 6.344 percent by the 5 p.m. close in
Budapest from 6.251 percent yesterday, its lowest close since
first being sold in January.  “The statement of the rate-setting meeting was slightly
hawkish,” David Nemeth, a Budapest-based economist at ING Groep
NV, wrote in an e-mail to clients, adding that the comments may
lift yields on shorter maturities.  The  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  kept the two-week deposit rate at 6
percent today, matching the forecast of all 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy makers may have to keep borrowing
costs steady for an “extended” period to bring inflation to
the 3 percent target by the end of next year, central bank
President Andras Simor told reporters.  The inflation rate fell to 3.1 percent in July, the lowest
since March 2009, from 3.5 percent in June. The central bank
expects 2011 inflation to average 3.9 percent.  The benchmark BUX index of shares rose 0.2 percent to
18,133.58, paring gains of as much as 3 percent. The forint
appreciated 0.2 percent to 272.4 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
