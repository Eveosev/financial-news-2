Carsten Schneider, budget spokesman
for  Germany ’s main opposition  Social Democratic Party ,
criticized the labor minister for demanding collateral from
euro-area members needing financial aid,  Welt newspaper  said.  Comments from German Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen
that nations in need of a bailout need to put up collateral is a
sign of “the chaos in the federal government” and shows that
it has “no negotiation strategy,” Welt cited Schneider as
saying in a preview of a story that will run tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
