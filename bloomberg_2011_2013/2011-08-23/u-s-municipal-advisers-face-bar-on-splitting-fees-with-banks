Financial advisers to U.S. state and
local governments would be banned from splitting fees with banks
under rules proposed by the regulator of the municipal bond
industry.  The rules put forth today by the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board for the first time spell out the codes of
conduct that will apply to financial advisers under the Dodd-
Frank law passed by Congress a year ago. The act gave the board
power over advisers, which previously operated without such
oversight.  The boardâ€™s proposed rules are subject to approval by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
