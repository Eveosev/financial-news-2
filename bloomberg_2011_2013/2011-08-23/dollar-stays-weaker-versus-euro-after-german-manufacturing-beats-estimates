The dollar maintained losses against
the euro after a gauge of German manufacturing growth for August
exceeded economist estimates.  The greenback traded 0.5 percent weaker against the shared
European currency at $1.4436 as of 8:36 a.m. in  London .  A manufacturing purchasing managersâ€™ index for  Germany 
stayed at 52 in August, equaling the reading of the previous
month, data from Markit Economics showed today. That was above
the 50.6 median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News before the release of the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
