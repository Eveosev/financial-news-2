Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU) , a Nigerian
producer, fell to an 11-month low after Vetiva Capital
Management Ltd. reduced its rating on the shares.  The stock lost 65 kobo, or 5 percent, to 12.39 naira by the
2:30 p.m. in Lagos, the weakest since Sept. 29.  Dangote Flour was cut to “neutral” from “buy,” Adedoyin
Adelakun, a Lagos-based analyst with Vetiva, wrote in note to
clients today. The price estimate was reduced to to 14.98 naira
from 24.62 naira, she said.  The downgrade is “due to the lower-than-expected full-year
2010 earnings performance” of the company, according to Vetiva.  Profit fell 51 percent to 2.72 billion naira ($17 million)
in the year through December, the company said on Aug. 12.  Dangote Flour’s shares have fallen 26 percent this year
compared with 9.9 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
