Volkswagen AG (VOW)  took another step
toward its goal of securing a majority in  MAN SE (MAN)  by requesting
approval from European Union authorities of its takeover offer
for the German truckmaker.  Europe ’s largest carmaker submitted a so-called merger
control filing yesterday to the European Commission, the EU’s
executive arm, it said today in an e-mailed statement. The
European Commission will make a decision by Sept. 26, it said on
its website.  Volkswagen will own 55.9 percent of MAN’s voting rights
after the deal closes. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker
said today that “numerous” national authorities have already
approved the planned combination. VW sought 40 percent of MAN’s
voting rights in May when it started the bid.  The maker of the Golf hatchback triggered a mandatory bid
for MAN by raising its stake to 30.5 percent from 29.9 percent
on May 9 to pave the way for closer cooperation between Munich-
based MAN and  Sweden ’s  Scania AB (SCVB) , which VW already controls. A
three-way truck alliance may save as much as 1 billion euros
($1.45 billion) in annual costs, according to VW.  The combination of MAN and Scania would leapfrog
Gothenburg, Sweden-based  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and Daimler AG to create
Europe’s largest maker of heavy trucks. MAN and Scania together
had 30 percent of the European heavy-truck market last year,
according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.
Volvo and Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler each had 21 percent.  VW’s preferred shares rose as much as 4.5 percent to 106.35
euros, the most since Aug. 12, and were trading at 103.70 euros
in  Frankfurt  as of 11:11 a.m. MAN rose as much as 4.6 percent to
60.55 euros, valuing the truckmaker at 8.72 billion euros, and
was trading up 2.3 percent at 59.22 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
