Zimbabwe  will meet its economic
growth forecast of 9.3 percent this year even as prices
increase, Finance Minister  Tendai Biti  said.  An increase in the inflation rate to 3.3 percent in July
from 2.9 percent a month earlier is a “worrisome development”
and needs to be tackled, Biti told reporters today in Harare,
the capital.  The government may consider removing duties on some food
products, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
