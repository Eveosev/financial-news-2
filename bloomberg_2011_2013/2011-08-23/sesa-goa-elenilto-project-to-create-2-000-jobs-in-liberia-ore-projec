Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) ,  India ’s largest iron-
ore exporter, and Elenilto Minerals & Mining LLC will create
more than 2,000 jobs over 25 years through their investment in
Liberia’s Western Cluster Ltd., the country’s National
Investment Commission said.  Western Cluster, which owns iron-ore deposits, will have an
initial workforce of 200, Ciatta Bishop, an official from the
commission, said in a statement in Monrovia, the capital.
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf today signed into law an
agreement that will allow mining operations to proceed.  Sesa Goa and Elenilto will jointly invest more than $2.6
billion in Western Cluster and pay the government $41 million
once the agreement is ratified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
