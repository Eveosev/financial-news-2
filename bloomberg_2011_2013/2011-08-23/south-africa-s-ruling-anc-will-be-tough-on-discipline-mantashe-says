South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  has instructed its structures to be “tough on
discipline,”  Gwede Mantashe , secretary-general of the ruling
party, said.  “We can’t take our foot off the pedal of discipline,”
Mantashe told reporters in Johannesburg today. The party’s
National Executive Committee, which met over the past four days,
didn’t discuss disciplinary action that has been instituted
against ANC Youth League leader  Julius Malema , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
