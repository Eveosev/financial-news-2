Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , subject of a
A$4.7 billion ($4.9 billion) takeover bid, said full-year profit
rose 93 percent after selling stakes in two mines and prices
gained.  Net income was A$241.4 million, or 82.8 cents a share, in
the 12 months to June 30, compared with A$125.1 million, or 49.3
cents, a year earlier, the Brisbane-based company said today in
statement. This compares with a forecast of $253 million from
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “In spite of the reduced production Macarthur’s underlying
net profit after tax was marginally better than last year due to
the record prices achieved for metallurgical coal in the final
quarter of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Nicole Hollows
said. “Looking forward, the impact of the wet weather will
continue to be felt in the upcoming year.”  Macarthur, which on May 16 said it would earn A$240 million
to A$260 million for the year, remains in talks with potential
rival bidders to challenge  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) ’s and
ArcelorMittal’s A$15.50 a share offer, the company said.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , part owner of the world’s biggest
platinum and diamond mines, is studying Macarthur’s finances for
a potential bid, two people with knowledge of the matter said
Aug. 20.  Macarthur, the world’s biggest producer of pulverized coal
for steelmaking, fell 0.8 percent to A$15.62 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of Sydney trading yesterday. The stock has gained 26
percent over the past 12 months.  Macarthur sold stakes in the Middlemount and Codrilla
projects for a total of A$113 million before tax, the company
said..  To contact the reporter on this story: Elisabeth Behrmann at
