Zimbabwe Finance Minister  Tendai
Biti  said he is in talks with Youth Development,  Indigenization
and Empowerment Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere  to develop separate
ownership rules for banks operating in the country to those of
mines.  His ministry is trying to agree a minimum ownership
threshold for banks, where for mining companies it is 51
percent, Biti told reporters in the capital, Harare, today. The
ministry is also consulting banks regarding the ownership law,
Biti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
