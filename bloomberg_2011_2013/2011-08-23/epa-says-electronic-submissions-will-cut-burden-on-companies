The Environmental Protection Agency
said it will let companies file reports electronically and
provide more pollution information as part of the Obama
administration’s bid to ease regulatory burdens.  Increasing public disclosure of pollution information will
“level the playing field by helping facilities, governments and
the public know what is being accomplished,” the EPA said in a
report published today by the White House.  The EPA also pledged to improve estimates for the cost of
proposed rules, as a way to determine if the work is biased. The
proposed changes and actions already completed will save as much
as $1.5 billion in the next five years, the agency said in its
report.  A lobbying group for the oil and gas industry contrasted
the steps EPA is taking with a proposal to tighten ozone
standards, which the agency estimates may cost industry as much
as $90 billion.  The ozone rule “makes a mockery of the administration’s
program to eliminate or modify rules that are unnecessarily
costly or burdensome,” Howard Feldman, director of regulatory
and scientific policy at the  American Petroleum Institute  in
 Washington , said on a conference call today with reporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
