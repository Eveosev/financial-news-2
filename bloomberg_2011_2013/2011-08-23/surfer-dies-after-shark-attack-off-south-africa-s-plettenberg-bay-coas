A 49-year-old surfer died today
after being attacked by a shark in Plettenberg Bay, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) east of  Cape Town .  “The victim has been confirmed as local Plettenberg Bay
resident and surfer, Tim van Heerden,” Patty Butterworth, the
administrator of the  Plettenberg Bay Guest Accommodation &
Activities Association , said in a e-mailed statement today,
adding that surfers who witnessed the attack said it may have
been a great white shark about 2 meters (6.56 feet) in length.
“There have been several sightings by surfers of sharks in the
same area.”  This is Plettenberg Bay’s first fatal shark attack in 15
years and the second shark attack recorded off  South Africa ’s
coastline in the past three months. A scuba diver was injured
off Aliwal Shoal, south of Durban, in June during the annual
sardine run when sharks and dolphins feed on the large schools
of fish. This month there have been two reported shark attacks
in  Russia  and one in the Seychelles, which was fatal.  Van Heerden was surfing off Lookout Beach near the
Keurbooms river mouth and was with a large group of surfers,
Craig Lambinon, a spokesman for the  National Sea Rescue
Institute , said in an interview on his mobile phone. Van Heerden
appears to have been bitten in the groin area and the femoral
artery may have been severed, Lambinon said, adding that an
autopsy will be performed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
