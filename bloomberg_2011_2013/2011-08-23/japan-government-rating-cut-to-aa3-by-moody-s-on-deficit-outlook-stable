Japan  had its rating cut to Aa3 from
Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, which concluded a review
started on May 31. The outlook on the rating is stable.  The downgrade was prompted by large budget deficits and the
build-up in Japanese government debt since the 2009 global
recession, Moody’s said. It is also difficult for Japan to slow
the growth of debt in relation to gross domestic product, the
ratings agency said.  The outlook remains stable because of the “undiminished
home bias” of Japanese investors and their preference of
 government bonds , which allows the government’s fiscal deficits
to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally, Moody’s said
in the statement.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
