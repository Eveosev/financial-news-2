Arsenal and Newcastle were both
fined 30,000 pounds ($50,000) by the Football Association for
failing to control their players in their Premier League season
opener Aug. 13.  Players from both teams were involved in a melee during the
0-0 draw at St. James’ Park after a clash between Newcastle’s
 Joey Barton  and Arsenal’s Gervinho.  Gervinho received a red card for striking Barton in the
face and was suspended three games. Arsenal’s Alex Song also
received a three-game ban for stamping on Barton’s leg earlier
in the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
