Indian stocks climbed for a second
day amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce
further measures to stimulate the world’s biggest economy.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the nation’s largest
software services exporter that gets 90 percent of its sales
from overseas, surged the most in more than two years. Bajaj 
Auto Ltd., the second-largest motorcycle maker, reached its 
highest level this year.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the 
world’s largest refinery complex, advanced 1.1 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
156.77 points, or 1 percent, to 16,498.47 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index rose 1 percent to 4,948.90.
Its August futures settled at 4,947.40. The BSE 200 Index added
0.9 percent to 2,045.77.  “You have a very clear message from the  Federal Reserve ,
namely they are going to keep the Fed funds rate at zero to 25
basis points for a long period of time,” Robert  John Parker , a
senior adviser at Credit Suisse Asset Management, said in an
interview with Bloomberg UTV today. “I think the message from
Bernanke on Friday is that they will continue to provide very
high volumes of liquidity to support the money markets.”  The MSCI World Index of global equities rebounded from the
lowest level since September before U.S. central bankers meet
this week in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . Last year, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s hint of a second round of asset purchases spurred
a 28 percent jump in the  S&P 500 .  The Sensex last week had its longest weekly losing run
since 2008 on concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing and  Europe ’s
debt crisis may spread, hurting corporate profits already
threatened by rising interest rates.  ‘Buying Opportunity’  Tata Consultancy surged 6.9 percent to 981.6 rupees, its
biggest rally since July 2009. Nearest rival Infosys Ltd. added
3.8 percent to 2,276.95 rupees. The Bombay Stock Exchange IT
Index has declined 16 percent this month compared with the 9
percent fall in the Sensex.  “We’re long on information technology worldwide; it’s an
interesting buying opportunity,” Credit Suisse’s Parker said.
“The sell-off in IT is probably discounting lower levels of
growth which we are going to get.”  Bajaj Auto rallied 4.3 percent to 1,544.85 rupees, its best
close since December 2010.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the
biggest power-equipment maker, increased 2.6 percent to 1,761.15
rupees. Reliance rose 1.1 percent to  765.25 rupees. Its August
futures settled at 765.2 rupees.  India ’s  central bank  has increased its repurchase rate 11
times since the start of last year to damp living costs that are
rising the fastest among the so-called BRICS nations. The
benchmark wholesale-price inflation in July rose 9.22 percent
from a year earlier after a 9.44 percent jump in June.  Bear Market   The Sensex has fallen 22 percent from a Nov. 5 peak,
exceeding the 20 percent level that marks a so-called bear
market for some investors. Companies on the measure trade at
13.7 times estimated earnings, down from 21.5 times last March.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index trades at 9.8 times.  “The right strategy is to adopt a policy of buying on dips
averaging back into markets, including the Indian market where
valuations on a relative basis are now looking more interesting
than they have been any time this year,” Credit Suisse’s Parker
said. “At least for the next three to six months macroeconomic
factors will determine investor mood. As we go into September
and early October we will start to see better economic data.”  Earnings for 46 percent of Sensex companies missed analyst
estimates in the three months ended June 30, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That compares with 33 percent that trailed
forecasts in the previous quarter.  Foreign investors have sold $1.7 billion of equities this
month, set for the worst monthly flow since May 2010, as higher
borrowing costs weighed on company earnings and the government
curbed its decision making amid corruption scandals.  Overseas funds sold a net 12.8 billion rupees ($281
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 18 and Aug. 19, reducing
their investment in stocks this year to 25.7 billion rupees,
according to data on the  website  of the market regulator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
