The  Philippine peso  advanced for a
second day before the government issues a report this week on
its finances for July.  The administration had a deficit of 17.23 billion pesos
($407 million) in the six months through June, compared with a
ceiling of 152.13 billion pesos that policy makers had set,
official data showed on Aug. 3. The data for July are due on Aug.
25. Philippine bonds snapped a three-day rally and the MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index of stocks rose on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will announce additional measures to boost the  U.S.
economy  this week.  “Risk taking is back a little and that’s supporting the
peso,” said Marcelo Ayes, senior vice-president at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila . “On the bonds side, we’re
seeing some profit-taking.”  The peso finished 0.4 percent stronger at 42.333 per dollar,
its highest close since Aug. 4, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The yield on the 5.875 percent government bonds due January
2018 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.99
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate has
dropped 34 basis points this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
