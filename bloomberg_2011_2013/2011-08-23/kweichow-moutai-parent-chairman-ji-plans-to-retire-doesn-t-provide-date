China Kweichow Moutai Distillery Co.
Chairman Ji Keliang said he plans to retire and will be replaced
by the chairman of its Shanghai-listed company.  Yuan Renguo, chairman of Kweichow Moutai Co., the world’s
second-largest distiller by market value, will be made chairman
of the parent, Ji said in a phone interview today.  Ji didn’t say when the changes will take place. An internal
notice has been posted, asking employees for their opinion on
the planned succession, he said.  Kweichow Moutai gained 0.3 percent to 204.93 yuan at the
3 p.m. close of trading in  Shanghai , boosting its gain this year
to 23 percent.  Diageo Plc (DGE) , maker of Johnnie Walker scotch, is the world’s
biggest distiller by market value, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
