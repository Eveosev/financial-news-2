U.K. stocks climbed for a second
day, led by a rally in mining companies, after a report showed
an increase in Chinese demand for copper and as Antofagasta
reported a jump in first-half earnings.  Antofagasta, the copper producer controlled by Chile’s
Luksic family, advanced more than 3 percent.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and Rio
Tinto Group gained at least 3 percent as base metals advanced.
 ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  surged 4.1 percent amid takeover speculation.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 1.6 percent to 5,176.19 at 10:50
a.m. in  London  as all but four stocks advanced. The gauge lost
5.3 percent last week after European and U.S. data trailed
forecasts, adding to concern the global economy is at risk. The
 FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  climbed 1.4 percent today and Ireland’s
ISEQ Index rose 0.7 percent.  Copper climbed on the London Metal Exchange after data
showed Chinese imports rebounded to their highest level since
January amid speculation the U.S. will announce additional
stimulus measures to help boost the world’s largest economy.  Both scrap and refined copper imports in July rose from
June and were above the year-to-date average, Chinese customs
data showed yesterday.  Antofagasta climbed 3.2 percent to 1,251 pence after the
copper producer reported a 54 percent jump in first-half net
income to $696.2 million as production and metal prices
advanced.  Sales increased 73 percent and the company also declared an
interim dividend of 8 cents, double what it paid the same time
last year.  Xstrata, ARM Holding  Xstrata rallied 3.4 percent to 965.2 pence,  Rio Tinto 
increased 3 percent to 3,522.5 pence and Kazakhmys Plc advanced
2.7 percent to 950.5 pence.  ARM jumped 4.1 percent to 512 pence after the  Guardian
newspaper , the London-based Times and the  Daily Mail  all
reported that the company may be a takeover target after
Hewlett-Packard Co.’s acquisition of Autonomy Corp. last week.  Elsewhere,  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  increased 2.5 percent to 392.8
pence after the U.K.’s third largest homebuilder by volume
confirmed its full-year completions target and said its current
order book was 10 percent ahead of the year-earlier period.  The company reported first-half profit of 47 million pounds
($77.9 million), beating the average analyst estimate of 41
million pounds according to Bloomberg data.  G4S Plc (GFS)  jumped 6.2 percent to 258.6 pence after reporting a
15 percent increase in first-half net income to 108 million
pounds, in line with analyst estimates. The world’s largest
publicly traded provider of security services also said it’s
optimistic about business in the second half and into 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
