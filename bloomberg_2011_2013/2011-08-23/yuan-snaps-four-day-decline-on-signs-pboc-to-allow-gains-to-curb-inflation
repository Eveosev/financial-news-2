China ’s yuan advanced for the first
time in five days after the central bank set a stronger daily
 reference rate  for the currency and data signaled the economy is
still strong enough to fuel inflation.  The fixing was set at 6.3987 per dollar, the second
consecutive day it has been increased. The HSBC Flash China
Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 49.8 for August,
compared with 49.3 in July, according to HSBC Holdings Plc,
which releases the estimate based on 85 to 90 percent of total
responses.  “The trend is pretty much intact,” said  Nizam Idris , a
foreign-exchange strategist at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore
“The argument is that China needs a stronger currency to curb
money growth and inflation. The appreciation trend will have to
continue.”  The yuan strengthened 0.07 percent to 6.3970 per dollar as
of the close at 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The yuan may rise to 6.2 per
dollar by the end of the year, Idris forecast.  Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier in
July, the most since June 2008, government data show. The U.S.
Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s strength against the
currencies of six major trading partners, dropped 0.15 percent,
after rising 0.19 percent yesterday.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.03
percent to 6.3715 per dollar. The offshore rate has gone from
weaker than the onshore rate to 0.4 percent stronger in the past
two weeks. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.03
percent to 6.2809, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
premium to the onshore spot rate was 1.8 percent.  -- Judy Chen , Fion Li. Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
