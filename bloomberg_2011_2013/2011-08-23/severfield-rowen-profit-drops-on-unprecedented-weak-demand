Severfield-Rowen Plc (SFR) , a supplier of
structural steelwork, said first-half after-tax profit fell 76
percent amid “weak demand” in the U.K.  Net income dropped to 1.1 million pounds ($1.8 million), or
1.18 pence per share, from 4.3 million pounds, or 4.87 pence per
share, a year earlier, the Dalton Thirsk, England-based company
said today in a statement on the Regulatory News Service. Sales
decreased 3.6 percent to 122 million pounds.  “The company has been consistently cautious about the
timing and extent of recovery in the U.K. market,” Chief
Executive Officer Tom Haughey said in the statement. “The
company is pleased with its performance in the U.K. against the
backdrop of a prolonged and unprecedented period of weak
demand.”  Net borrowings for Severfield-Rowen more than doubled to
22.8 million pounds from 8.2 million pounds a year earlier,
while the U.K. order book rose to 249 million pounds from 244
million pounds, the company said.  Severfield-Rowen shares fell 8.7 percent to 155.25 pence at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
