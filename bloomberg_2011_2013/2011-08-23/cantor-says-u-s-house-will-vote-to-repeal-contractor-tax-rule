Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  said the
 House of Representatives  will vote to repeal a law that imposes
3 percent tax withholding on U.S. government contracts.  In a statement, Cantor called the law an “unnecessary tax
increase on those who do business with the government.”  The law, written to prevent tax cheating by government
contractors, is scheduled to take effect in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
