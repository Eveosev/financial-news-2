The economy of Comoros, the Indian
Ocean archipelago, will probably expand by “slightly” more
than 2 percent this year as agricultural production improves,
the International Monetary Fund said.  Annual inflation is expected to be slower than 5 percent by
the end of the year and the fiscal deficit for 2011 should be
contained at about 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, the
Washington-based institution said in a statement on its website
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
