U.K. stocks resumed their advance,
sending the FTSE 100 Index up 0.3 percent to 5,111.86 at 3:06
p.m. in  London . The gauge briefly erased gains before the
release of U.S. housing data.  Stocks climbed even as sales of new U.S. homes declined in
July to the lowest level in five months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
