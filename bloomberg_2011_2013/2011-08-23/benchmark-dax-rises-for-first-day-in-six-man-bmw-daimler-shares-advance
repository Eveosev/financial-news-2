Germany ’s DAX Index pared earlier
gains after a reading of investor confidence in the country
disappointed.  The DAX rose 1.4 percent to 5,548.9 at 11:03 a.m. in
 Frankfurt , after earlier rising as much as 3 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations dropped to
minus 37.6 this month from minus 15.1 in July. That’s the lowest
since December 2008. Economists expected a decline to minus 26,
according to the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
