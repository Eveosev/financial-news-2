For the past few months, Anna Hazare, the septuagenarian Indian social activist, has led his country's most prominent anti-corruption movement. Last weekend, it reached a crescendo when Hazare began an indefinite fast. Hazare was protesting the Indian  government's decision  to introduce a watered-down version of a bill in Parliament that would give an independent body, called the Lokpol, the power to investigate political corruption at the highest levels of government. The  Lokpal Bill  would assign this power to a three-member group made up of current or former senior judges.   For several months, Hazare has led a committee of  activists and intellectuals  trying to stop  the government from weakening the bill.  Team Anna, as it is popularly called, has proposed its own version of the bill that would give the Lokpal radical powers, extending to both the office of the prime minister and the judiciary.  (A summary of the opposing positions can be found  here .) Hazare's version has stimulated robust debate. Some commentators think it is a much-needed antidote to corruption; others think it gives the Lokpal  draconian  powers. Representatives from Team Anna and the government met in June with the intention of thrashing out their differences and preparing a single version of the bill to present to Parliament in August. But they could not reach a compromise. Earlier, in March, Hazare had called off a planned hunger strike to protest corruption.  He said he'd take up the plan again if the government tabled its version of the bill, and so he has. On Aug. 16, the day after India's 64th anniversary of independence, Hazare addressed demonstrators in two locations in New Delhi:  Tihar Jail , where he was detained by the government for three days, and the grounds of  Ramlila Maidan , the scene of many memorable political demonstrations over the decades. The capital's citizens and visitors from far and wide -- many of whom had never attended a political protest before --  flocked to Ramlila Maidan  to voice their agitation. They seemed moved by various factors: political disenchantment, a need for empowerment, nationalistic fervor, hero worship or just plain curiosity. With the month of Ramzan (the Muslim fasting season known elsewhere as Ramadan) coming to an end and the Hindu festival of  Janmashtami  soon arriving, the demonstrators were at times  united in both protest and prayer . In both  New Delhi  locations, Hazare said that if his team's version of the bill did not pass by Aug. 30, he would lead protestors directly to the  homes of Members of Parliament (MPs). On Aug. 23, the Indian Express  reported  Hazare as saying: In an essay in the publication Tehelka, Shoma Chaudhury scathingly criticized the government's pusillanimity and disconnection from the Indian public. Chaudhury acknowledged that there were many flaws in Hazare's movement, but she  argued  that the government sparked the crisis: Arundhati Roy, perhaps India's best-known dissident and public intellectual, questioned the assumptions and omissions of the Hazare movement in a widely-read essay in The Hindu. Cutting and incendiary as always, Roy argued that political corruption was not a simple problem; it would require much more than a version of the Lokpal Bill to resolve it. Further, she said that the Hazare crusade deflected attention from the country's underlying crises: In the Indian Express, political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta took a measured approach. He  wrote : An attempt to supply this sort of "fine balance" came from the respected social activist Aruna Roy, who helped to create the recent piece of legislation, " The Right to Information Act of  2005 ," which was designed to make the Indian government  more transparent .  On behalf of her organization, the National Campaign for People's Right to Information (NCPRI), Roy released a public letter that countered Hazare and recommended that more time be allowed to debate the bill. The letter  said : Roy revealed that the NCPRI was working on its  own version  of a Lokpal bill, one that sought a more restricted -- and therefore refined -- role for the proposed Lokpal that would make it the people's worker, not its savior. One of the ironies of the crisis is that it has pitted two men of similar age, character and reputation against each other: Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  and Anna Hazare. One stands for the establishment and the other stands against it, but as one commentator  said , they are both "Spartans." On Aug. 23, the Prime Minister finally wrote to Hazare  asking him  to end his fast. He also appointed Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee to mediate with the Hazare team and called for an all-party meeting to discuss the Lokpal bill. One could optimistically argue that the long-term effects of this face-off are probably for the greater good. It has not only helped millions of people who ordinarily feel divorced from politics understand just how complex democratic law-making is, but it has also stoked their appetite for political debate and involvement.
