The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is
approaching its first sell signal since 2008 based on a Japanese
charting technique, suggesting the market’s losses since July
may deepen, according to Dahlman Rose & Co.  The benchmark index of U.S. equities dipped below the so-
called lower cloud support on the weekly ichimoku chart for the
first time since January 2008 on Aug. 12 and was still below the
threshold on Aug. 19, according to Bloomberg data. An Aug. 26
close below 1,090 would indicate a loss of “all possible
bullish structure,” said Rick Bensignor, chief market
strategist at Dahlman Rose.  After the  S&P 500 ’s decline below the cloud on Jan. 11,
2008, the index plunged 52 percent to a 12-year low in March
2009. It is down 13 percent in August, heading for the worst
month since October 2008. Ichimoku charts use the midpoints of
historic highs and lows to analyze a security or index. Clouds,
or areas between two of the lines on the chart, are used to show
levels where buy orders may be clustered.  “It’s certainly a caution flag that things are rapidly
changing and that you’ve lost a lot of the bullish structure,”
Bensignor said in a telephone interview yesterday. “But it’s
not a full-scale sell signal yet.”  The S&P 500 tumbled 16 percent in the past four weeks amid
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading and the  U.S. economy 
may be headed for a recession. Almost $3 trillion was erased
from the value of U.S. equities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
