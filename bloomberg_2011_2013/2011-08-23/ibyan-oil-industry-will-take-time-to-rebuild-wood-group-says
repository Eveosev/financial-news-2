John Wood Group Plc (WG/) , a U.K. oil-
services provider active in Africa and the  Middle East , said it
will take time to rebuild  Libya ’s oil and gas industry after
rebels declared the regime of Muammar Qaddafi over.  “Libya is an economy where oil and gas is important, so
I’m sure whatever government is formed will make it a priority
to get the industry up and running again,” said Allister Langlands, chief executive officer of Wood Group, on a call with
journalists today. “My experience in Libya is that things
always take much longer than you think. It’s too early to make a
judgment on when we’ll be back there.”  Wood Group abandoned a project with  Eni SpA (ENI)  in Libya when
civil war broke out this year, for which it took a $22.9 million
charge in the first half. Eni was the biggest producer in the
north African country.  “It’s a very fluid position in Libya,” Langlands said.
“We hope that in due course we’ll be able to reengage with our
client and finish the job.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
