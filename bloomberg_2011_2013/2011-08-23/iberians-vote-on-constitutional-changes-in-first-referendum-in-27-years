Liberians voted today to change four
constitutional provisions in the country’s first referendum in
27 years, James Fromoyen, chairman of the National Elections
Commission, said.  The vote, which covered the number of years a Liberian
should be resident in the West African nation to contest a
presidential election and the majority needed for a poll
victory, was boycotted by the biggest opposition party, led by
George Weah, Fromoyen said in a speech on broadcaster Truth FM
today.  Liberians were also asked to decide on a proposal to change
the date of the nation’s presidential election to the second
Tuesday in November this year from the second Tuesday in
October, and on the retirement age of the Chief Justice of the
 Supreme Court .  To contact the reporter on this story:
