Greek  government bonds  slumped, with
10-year yields climbing to the highest level in a month, amid
concern tensions between countries are putting a new loan
package for the Mediterranean nation at risk.  The spread between Greek and German two-year yields widened
to a record 39 percentage points. Europe is in the midst of
agreeing on 159 billion euros ($229 billion) in new public aid
for  Greece . Some nations, including Finland, have demanded
collateral in return for loans. Spain’s two-year notes dropped
as the country sold 2.94 billion euros of bills.  “The aid package is not sorted out yet, and so the market
thinks that things might not be as stable as they were perceived
earlier, which is weighing on Greek government bonds,” said
 David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in
London.  Greek 10-year yields climbed for a sixth day, rising 56
basis points to 17.37 percent as of 3:51 p.m. in London. They
earlier increased to 17.40 percent, the highest level since July
21. The 6.25 percent security maturing June 2020 fell 1.555, or
15.55 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 51.510.  The nation’s two-year notes tumbled, widening the yield
difference over similar-maturity German debt to 3,903 basis
points, or 39.03 percentage points. That’s the most since at
least 1998, when Bloomberg began collecting data on the
securities.  Finland is open to adjusting its collateral arrangement
with Greece after several euro members criticized the Nordic
country for securing a bilateral deal to protect its commitment,
Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said. German Labor Minister Ursula
von der Leyen called for countries that require a euro-region
bailout to put up gold reserves as collateral.  Spanish Auction  Spain’s two-year yields rose eight basis points to 3.30
percent. Ten-year rates rose two basis points to 4.98 percent.  The nation sold 805 million euros of three-month bills at
an average yield of 1.357 percent. Investors bid for 7.62 times
the amount on offer. That compared with a so-called bid-to-offer
ratio of 6.27 at the previous auction of similar-maturity bills
on July 26, which were sold at an average yield of 1.899
percent. Spain also sold 2.1 billion euros of six-month bills at
2.187 percent.  The 10-year bund yield added one basis point to 2.11
percent after rising as high as 2.17 percent. It reached a
record low 2.03 percent on Aug. 18. Two-year yields rose three
basis points to 0.66 percent. They dropped to 0.54 percent on
Aug. 18, the least since June 2010.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.8 percent,
paring a gain of as much as 2.2 percent.  Negativity ‘Priced In’  German government bonds fell earlier as manufacturing and
services reports from Europe and China beat economists’
forecasts, while speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take
additional measures to bolster the  U.S. economy  damped demand
for the safest assets.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in manufacturing and services remained at 51.1 in
August, London-based Markit Economics said today. Economists
forecast a drop to 50, the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  The preliminary gauge of manufacturing in China in August
was 49.8, according to a reading of the Purchasing Managers’
Index reported by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today.
The final figure for July was 49.3. A number below 50 indicates
a contraction.  “The PMI releases showed a better print than expected,”
said  Michael Markovic , a senior fixed-income strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “We’ve also had the data from
 China , which was also a little bit better than expected. Those
are the positive drivers for the moment. We have so much
negative news priced in that anything that is better than
expected can have an impact.”  Jackson Hole   The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
index of German investor and analyst expectations dropped to
minus 37.6 from minus 15.1 in July. That’s the lowest since
December 2008. Economists expected a decline to minus 26,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Bonds from  Germany  and the U.S. surged in August as a
global rout in equities spurred demand for safer assets. Ten-
year Treasuries fell for a second day today.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to speak Aug. 26
in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , at an annual conference sponsored by
the Fed Bank of  Kansas City  and may signal additional measures
to stimulate the economy.  Germany is scheduled to sell 6 billion euros of 2.25
percent securities maturing in September 2021 tomorrow.  German government bonds have returned 6 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
have gained 7.7 percent. Greek government bonds have fallen 17
percent, while Spanish securities gained 5.6 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
