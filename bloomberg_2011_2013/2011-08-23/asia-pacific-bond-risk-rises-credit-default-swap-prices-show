The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 6 basis points
to 169 basis points as of 10:01 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole
CIB prices show. That’s on course for its highest since July 22,
2009, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 5 basis points to 159 basis
points as of 8:01 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Credit
Agricole prices. The risk benchmark is headed for its highest
close since May 25, 2010, according to CMA prices in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 3 basis points to 143
basis points as of 8:59 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. Five-year swaps on Japan’s sovereign debt climbed 2 basis
points to 108, Deutsche Bank prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
