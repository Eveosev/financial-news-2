Hays Plc (HAS) , the U.K.’s biggest
recruitment company, said it inadvertently sent out an e-mail
yesterday containing pay details of contractors working for
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  The data included the roles and pay rates of contractors,
but didn’t contain any bank account details or national
insurance numbers, Hays spokesman Neil Bennett said today in an
e-mailed statement.  “Hays recognizes that the correct treatment of data is of
the utmost importance and we are taking the unauthorized release
of this data extremely seriously,” Bennett said in the
statement. “We are working with RBS to recover the data from
recipients where possible.”  The company has begun an internal investigation into the
incident and will conduct a review of its procedures, he said.  “We can confirm that confidential personnel data has
inadvertently been shared by a contractor working with the
group,” Michael Strachan, deputy head of group media relations
at RBS, said in an e-mailed statement. “No customer information
has been compromised.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
