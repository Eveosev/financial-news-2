H.J. Heinz Co., the world’s biggest
ketchup maker, repeated its forecast for full-year profit that
trailed analysts’ projections as U.S. consumers tighten spending
and costs for commodities increase.  Profit excluding certain items will be as much as $3.32 a
share, Pittsburgh-based Heinz said today in a statement,
reiterating its forecast from an investor meeting in May.
Analysts predicted $3.35, the average of 17 estimates.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Johnson is
seeking to boost sales abroad to counter slowing growth in the
U.S. as Heinz faces higher commodity costs. The company said
today it will raise prices in the coming months to help offset
food inflation, which was about 8 percent in the first quarter.  Net income in the quarter ended July 27 dropped 6 percent
to $226.1 million, or 70 cents a share, from $240.4 million, or
75 cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding costs related to
factories and other productivity expenses totaled 78 cents,
beating the 76 cents projected by analysts. Sales rose 15
percent to $2.85 billion.  Heinz fell $1.36, or 2.6 percent, to $50.68 at 11:59 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had
gained 5.2 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
