A Turkish court ordered the jailing
of Mehmet Perincek, son of Labor Party leader Dogu Perincek, two
other party members and a journalist as part of an investigation
into the so-called “Ergenekon” coup plot,  Hurriyet  reported.  The arrests were made following raids on the  Aydinlik
newspaper  and  Ulusal Kanal  television station offices in
Istanbul, Hurriyet said.  The men join dozens of military officers, journalists and
academics who have been jailed on allegations of being involved
in a network planning to overthrow the government of Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
