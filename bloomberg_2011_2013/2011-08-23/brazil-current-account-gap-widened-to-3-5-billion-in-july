Brazil ’s current account gap widened
in July, exactly in line with market expectations.  The deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of
trade and services, increased to $3.5 billion in July from $3.3
billion in June, the central bank said in a report today in
Brasilia. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a $3.5
billion gap, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts.  Brazil’s foreign direct investment increased to $6 billion
in July from $5.5 billion in June, the central bank said. The
figure was greater than the $4 billion median forecast of 10
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Higher prices for the country’s iron ore, soy and sugar
have helped offset a surge in imports caused by retail sales
growth and a currency rally. Brazil’s current account deficit
has stayed in a range of 2.10 percent and 2.38 percent of gross
domestic product over the past year, even as the real
strengthened to a 12-year high in July.  Commodities prices have risen 26 percent over the last
year, according to an index published by the central bank.  The real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.6048 per dollar at
9:57 a.m. New York time. The currency has appreciated 44 percent
since the start of 2009, the most of 25 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, was unchanged
at 12.110 percent at 09:57 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
