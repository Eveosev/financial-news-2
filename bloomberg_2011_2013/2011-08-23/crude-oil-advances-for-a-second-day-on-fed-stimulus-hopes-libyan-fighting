Oil rose for a second day in New
York amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will bolster efforts
to stimulate the economy.  West Texas Intermediate futures increased 1.2 percent as
equities climbed and the dollar fell before this week’s meeting
of central bankers in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hinted at a second round of asset purchases at last
year’s gathering. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 3.4
percent.  “We’re seeing a rally in both WTI and Brent on the fumes
of hope for stimulus from the Federal Reserve,” said Matt
Smith, a commodities analyst for Summit Energy Services Inc. in
Louisville,  Kentucky . “We’re following equities and the weak
dollar.”  Crude for October delivery rose $1.02 to settle at $85.44 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures have fallen
6.5 percent this year.  Prices increased from the settlement, then slipped after
the  American Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles decreased 3.34 million barrels to 347
million and gasoline stockpiles rose 6.37 million barrels to
213.9 million. October oil rose $1.50, or 1.8 percent, to $85.92
a barrel in electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  Brent oil for October settlement gained 95 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $109.31 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $23.87 to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures,
down from a record settlement of $26.21 on Aug. 19.  Oil also increased as fighting continued in Libya. Rebels
said they entered Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s compound of
Bab Al Aziziya in the capital, Tripoli, and raised their flag,
Al Arabiya reported.  Libyan Output  Libyan oil production will resume “soon,” though it may
take a year to return to pre-conflict levels of 1.5 million
barrels a day, Ahmed Jehani, chairman of the rebels’
stabilization team, told reporters today in Dubai. The country’s
output fell to 100,000 barrels a day last month, a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  The  S&P 500  gained 38.53 points to 1,162.35, and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  increased 322.11 points, or 3 percent,
to 11,176.76 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York .  The dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.4433 per euro at 4:26
p.m. in New York. It touched $1.45 before former Fed Chairman
 Alan Greenspan  said earlier today that the euro “is breaking
down.” Crude touched an intraday low of $83.40 a barrel on his
remarks.  “Greenspan is talking up the dollar,” said Carl Larry,
director of energy derivatives and research with Blue Ocean LLC
in New York. “The markets are jittery right now. Libya is still
in flux and everybody is unsure about what’s going to happen
Friday.”  Bernanke is scheduled to speak Aug. 26 at the annual
conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of  Kansas City 
in Jackson Hole.  Hope for Easing  Fed policy makers said two weeks ago that risks to the
economy have increased and they are “prepared to employ” more
tools “as appropriate.” The central bank has completed two
rounds of asset purchases known as quantitative easing.  “What’s really behind prices is the hope of a third round
of quantitative easing,” said  Eugen Weinberg , Frankfurt-based
head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG, who forecasts
 Brent crude  will average $100 a barrel in the fourth quarter.
“But at some point the market will need to adjust to reality.”  Brent advanced even as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said
Libya’s oil production will recover more quickly than forecast
after the “sudden takeover” of fields and export facilities by
rebels.  Hunt for Qaddafi  Rebel fighters hunted for Qaddafi and declared his regime
over, as government forces kept up their fight in parts of
Tripoli.  The Libyan revolt, which began in February, has reduced the
availability of light, sweet crude, or oil with low density and
sulfur content.  Libya will probably boost supply to 585,000 barrels a day
in the next 12 to 18 months, Goldman Sachs said in a report
yesterday. The increase may allow the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to delay using spare production capacity by
three months, it said. Goldman had previously forecast the
nation would be able to pump 250,000 barrels.  A Persian Gulf oil official said OPEC has no immediate
plans to cut crude production as  Libya ’s output will most likely
come back gradually and the market will easily absorb its
exports. The group may adjust output if Libya’s production were
to affect global supply and demand, the official said, declining
to be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly
on the matter.  U.S. Supplies  A U.S. government report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
inventories probably increased by 1.75 million barrels in the
seven days ended Aug. 19, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of 14 analysts. The Energy Department report is scheduled for
release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 536,259
contracts as of 4:28 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 628,139
contracts yesterday, 8 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.46 million contracts, the
lowest level since Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
