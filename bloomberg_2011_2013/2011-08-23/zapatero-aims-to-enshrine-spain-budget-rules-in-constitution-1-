Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said that he supports amending the country’s
constitution “immediately” to include language forcing budget
discipline on governments.  “It should be possible as this is a structural strategic
decision that is widely supported by Spanish society and its
representatives,” Zapatero said in parliament in  Madrid  today.  The premier, who said he has spoken to both opposition
leader Mariano Rajoy and Socialist leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba about the possibility, called on parliamentary groups
to prepare a law so it can be implemented “immediately.”  Rajoy, speaking at the same debate after Zapatero, said his
party would back the constitutional change.  “My parliamentary group is ready to support the initiative
and facilitate its implementation,” said Rajoy.  Opinion polls suggest that Rajoy and the PP will defeat the
Socialists in elections set for Nov. 20.  Zapatero said the law must ensure Spain’s medium- and long-
term fiscal stability, both in terms of deficit and debt levels,
and that it must be adhered to by all parts of  Spain ’s
administration, which includes the central government and 17
semi-autonomous regions.  “The best would be to adopt this constitutional reform with
as large a consensus as possible,” Zapatero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
