OAO Rosneft issued a tender to sell
Russian Urals crude for loading from October to March from two
ports, according to three traders who participate in the market.  Russia’s largest oil producer offered to sell as much as
7.2 million metric tons for loading from the  Baltic Sea  port of
Primorsk, said the people, who declined to be identified because
they aren’t authorized to speak on the matter.  Rosneft also offered as much as 2.54 million tons and 2.88
million tons of Urals crude for shipment in 140,000-ton and
80,000-ton lots respectively from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea ,
the people said.  The company sought to sell 255,000 tons to 450,000 tons of
CPC Blend for October to Jan. 5 from the Black Sea in a separate
tender, they said.  The tenders will close on Aug. 30, with bids valid until
Sept. 6. Details of the sale are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
