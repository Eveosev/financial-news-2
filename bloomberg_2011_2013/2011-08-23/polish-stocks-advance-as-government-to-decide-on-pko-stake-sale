Polish stocks gained for a third day
as PKO Bank Polski SA climbed on speculation the government will
suspend a stake sale and rising crude prices boosted refiners.  PKO, the largest Polish bank, headed for the largest gain
in a week, while oil refiner PKN Orlen SA extended its biggest
advance since April. The benchmark WIG20 Index rose 1.2 percent
to 2,332.72 at 10:10 a.m. in Warsaw, trimming this month’s
decline to 15 percent.  Poland , which planned to sell 15 percent of PKO as part of
a plan to reduce government borrowing, is to decide today on
whether to proceed with the deal after the stock slumped more
than 20 percent since a 2011 high in April, Treasury Minister
Aleksander Grad said on Aug. 19.  “Reducing the size of the transaction or suspending it are
possible outcomes,” Marek Juras and Pawel Kozub, Warsaw-based
analysts at UniCredit SpA wrote in a note today.  PKO increased for a third day, rising 1.5 percent to 36.21
zloty, valuing the lender at 45.3 billion zloty ($15.8 billion).  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB) , which  Belgium ’s KBC Groep NV plans to sell,
climbed 2.8 percent to 13.52 zloty, the biggest gain in more
than a week.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , controlled by Banco Comercial
Portugues SA, advanced 3.3 percent to 4.38 zloty, its second day
of gains. OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, is considering
buying Millennium and Kredyt Bank, Kommersant said, citing
several unidentified investment bankers.  Fuel Demand  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s biggest oil company, gained 2.4
percent to 37.77 zloty, extending its 6 percent gain yesterday.
 Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the second-largest refiner, climbed 2.3 percent
to 34.28 zloty. Oil advanced as investors bet U.S. fuel demand
may rebound and a recovery in Libyan crude output will take
longer than expected.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper producer with the biggest
European mine output, rose 1.1 percent to 159.5 zloty, extending
yesterday’s 3.2 percent advance. Copper gained after data showed
Chinese imports rebounded to the highest level since January and
on speculation that the U.S. will announce additional measures
to shore up the recovery.  Kernel Holding SA (KER)  increased for a second day, adding 2.3
percent to 65.5 zloty. Citigroup Inc. recommended buying shares
of Ukraine’s largest sunflower-oil producer in new coverage,
setting its price estimate for the stock at 77 zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
