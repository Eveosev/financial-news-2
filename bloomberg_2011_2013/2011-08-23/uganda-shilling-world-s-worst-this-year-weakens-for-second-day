Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency this year, headed for a sixth weekly
slump as it extended its 18-year low driven by dollar demand by
construction companies for importing materials.  The currency of East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy
declined as much as 0.5 percent to 2,830, the weakest intraday
level since June 1993, and traded 0.3 percent down at 2,824 by
12.57 p.m. in the capital, Kampala, taking its drop this week to
2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The demand of the dollar was coming in from the
construction sector,” Timothy Muzoora, a currency trader at
Cairo Bank International Bank Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer was
under pressure because of subdued inflows of the greenback
against “overwhelming” demand for the U.S. currency in the
market, Lucas Ochieng, the head of  currency trading  at Orient
Bank Ltd. said, by phone from Kampala.  The shilling has slumped 11 percent in the last two months
and 18 percent this year against the dollar, making it the
world’s worst-performing currency during both periods. A surge
in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more than 18-year
high of 18.7 percent in July from 15.7 percent in June.  Uganda is on the cusp of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc, a
U.K.-based energy company, expected to start pumping crude and
gas from the Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an
estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion
barrels in proven reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
