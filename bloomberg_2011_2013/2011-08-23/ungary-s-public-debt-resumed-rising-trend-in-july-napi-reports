Hungary’s state debt resumed a
rising trend in July as a result of the widening budget deficit
and may climb above 20 trillion forints ($105 billion) by
autumn,  Napi Gazdasag  reported, citing Economy Ministry data.  The debt fell significantly in June as a result of the
government’s cancelation of treasury bonds after the takeover of
private pension funds, the newspaper said.  Debt denominated in foreign currencies accounted for 47.4
percent of the total at the end of July, Napi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
