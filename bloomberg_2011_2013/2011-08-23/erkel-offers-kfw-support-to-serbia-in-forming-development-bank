Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau,
Germany’s  development bank , will help Serbia establish its own
similar institution, the government said.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  offered the support in
talks with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic in Belgrade
today, the premier’s office said in an e-mailed statement.  Serbia plans to set up the bank by the end of the year as a
government body that won’t be subject to regulations that apply
to commercial banks. It will replace Serbia’s  Development Fund 
and  Export Credit and Insurance Agency .  “Germany is Serbia’s biggest trading partner and one of
the most important investors,” Cvetkovic said. The trade
exchange was 1.19 billion euros ($2.73 billion) in the first six
months.  Frankfurt-based KfW co-finances Elektroprivreda Srbije,
Serbia’s state-run power producer, in a 70 million-euro upgrade
of the  Zvornik  hydro plant. It is also expected to lend
Elektroprivreda 74 million euros for an expansion of coal mines
that feed Serbia’s biggest thermal plants, a joint project with
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
