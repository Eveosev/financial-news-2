An Abbott Laboratories unit was sued
by MedImmune LLC in a dispute over the distribution of drugs
created to combat respiratory tract infections.  MedImmune, a unit  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , accused Abbott
International LLC of reneging on an agreement to seek European
market approval for distribution of MedImmune’s developmental
drug, Numax, and of trying to parlay a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration request for additional testing of that medicine
into grounds for reducing the price Abbott paid for exclusive
rights to distribute an FDA-approved forerunner, Synagis,
outside the U.S.  MedImmune, in a complaint filed in federal court in
Greenbelt, Maryland, on Aug. 21, asked for findings that it’s
under no obligation to discontinue development of Numax, and
that the event that would have triggered a reduction in the
price Abbott must pay for distributing Synagis hasn’t happened.  “We disagree with MedImmune’s interpretation of the
contract and are working to resolve the matter, Adelle Infante,
a spokeswoman for  Abbott Park , Illinois-based  Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) , said in an e-mailed statement.  AstraZeneca is based in  London . Its MedImmune unit is based
in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The case is MedImmune LLC v. Abbott International LLC
11cv2329, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland (Greenbelt).  To contact the reporter on this story:
