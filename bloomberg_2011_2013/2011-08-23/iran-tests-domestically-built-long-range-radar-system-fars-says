Iran  has tested the most advanced
model of a domestically manufactured long-range radar system,
the state-run  Fars  news agency reported, citing a military
official.  “We are designing a radar system that has the ability to
detect objects at a range of several thousand kilometers,”
Ebrahim Mohammadzadeh, managing director of Sa-Iran, a company
that develops industrial, telecommunication and military
equipments, was cited by Fars as saying. “One unit was
successfully tested and we hope the model will be operational in
coming years.”  The production of Iran’s new generation of air-defense
radar systems with a range of 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) is
in “its final stages,” Amir-Hamid Arjangi, deputy commander of
the Khatam al-Anbia air base, said last year, according to a
report published today on the website of the state-run news
channel  Press TV .  Iran regularly announces its domestic technological and
military developments, which authorities portray as a symbol of
independence from western powers. Iran is under international
sanctions over its nuclear program, which the U.S. and its
European allies say is a cover for the development of atomic
weapons, a charge Iran rejects.  Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi said on Aug. 21 that
his country plans to start several air and naval defense
projects this month, according to a separate Press TV  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
