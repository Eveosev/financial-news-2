IRC Ltd. (1029) , a Hong Kong-listed iron
ore company mining in Russia, posted its first profit after
starting sales from its Kuranakh mine and prices for the
steelmaking raw material advanced.  Net income for the six months ended June 30 was $3.6
million, compared with a loss of $51.9 million a year earlier,
the company said today in a statement. Revenue gained to $60.4
million from $5.2 million a year earlier.  IRC began sales from the Kuranakh project, which ships iron
ore from the  Far East  of Russia to China, in the second half of
last year. IRC plans to produce 750,000 metric tons of iron ore
concentrate this year, with 400,000 tons of that to be mined in
the second half of the year, the company said.  IRCâ€™s average realized  iron ore  concentrate price rose 12
percent in the first six months, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
