Statoil ASA (STL)  and Statkraft AS’s U.K.
Sheringham Shoal wind project is facing delays and higher costs
than estimated, Dagens Naeringsliv reported, citing Statkraft’s
Chief Executive Officer Christian Rynning-Toennesen.  The offshore wind farm project encountered problems with
the ships employed to establish the 500-ton foundations, the
Oslo-based newspaper said. Rynning-Toennesen said he expected
the delay to be reduced to two months from four months and that
the project was still profitable, Dagens Naeringsliv reported.  The newspaper said “internal sources” estimated the cost
of the delays at 600 million kroner ($110 million). Rynning-
Toennesen declined to specify by how much costs had gained.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
