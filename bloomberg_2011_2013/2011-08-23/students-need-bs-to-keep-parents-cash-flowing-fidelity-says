Two-thirds of U.S. parents said
they’ll only pay for their children’s college education if they
maintain minimum grades of B, on average, according to a survey
by  Fidelity Investments .  The average grade point parents will require to pay
tuitions is 3.1 out of 4.0, or about a B, once their kids are in
college, based on the survey of almost 2,400 families released
today by the Boston-based mutual-fund company. Seventy-five
percent of respondents said they don’t want to burden their
children with college loans compared with 65 percent in 2007,
when Fidelity started the annual study.  “You see folks significantly changing their overall
lifestyle and part of that is shared accountability,” said
Joseph Ciccariello, vice president of college planning at
Fidelity, the third-largest administrator of 529 college savings
plans. “It’s between the parents and their child in the cost of
college, and both parties are making sure they pay for it.”  Tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year
institutions averaged $7,605 for the 2010-2011 school year,
according to the New York-based  College Board . At private
nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, costs averaged
$27,293.  To manage college expenses and generate additional income,
more parents said they’re encouraging their children to attend
public colleges or universities, work part-time and help pay for
college, the report said. Almost half are considering having
their kids live at home and commute compared with 38 percent in
2007, and 28 percent are asking their children to graduate in
fewer semesters compared with 13 percent in 2007.  Saving Earlier  More parents are also beginning to save earlier, with 40
percent of those with children under 5 years old saving for
college costs in a dedicated savings account, such as a 529
plan, compared with 27 percent in 2007.  “More parents are starting to save in the preschool years,
despite financial pressures,” Ciccariello said. “They don’t
want to carry the debt burden when their children get out of
college.”  A separate survey from  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  earlier this
month said that about half of respondents with assets of more
than $250,000 won’t pay the entire tab for their children’s
college education. Having kids foot at least part of the bill
will help teach them financial responsibility, 29 percent of
parents said.  Research Data Technology, an independent research firm,
conducted the online study on behalf of Fidelity among 2,383
families with children 18 and younger. The families had annual
household incomes of at least $30,000 and were contacted from
June 21 to July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
