Three policemen in  Burkina Faso  were
jailed today for the killing of Justin Zongo on Feb. 20 that
sparked protests across the country.  Nebie Belibi and Fayama Bema were sentenced to 10 years in
jail, while Roger Narcisse Kabore was given eight years, Judge
Dofini Ouarayo said after giving his ruling in the capital,
Ouagadougou today.  Burkina Faso closed schools and universities for weeks in
March as violent protests between students and police killed
five and injured about 200. Police said Zongo died in custody
from meningitis, while students said he was beaten to death.  To contact the reporter on this story:
