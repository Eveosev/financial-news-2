The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars declined versus their U.S. counterpart as a drop in
Asian stocks discouraged demand for the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie and kiwi “will be still vulnerable to the
downside,” said Lee Wai Tuck, a currency strategist at Forecast
Pte in Singapore.  Australia’s dollar fell for the first time in four days,
dropping 0.6 percent to $1.0464 at 3 p.m. in  New York , from
$1.0526 yesterday. New Zealand’s currency slid 1.1 percent to
82.71 U.S. cents, from 83.60 cents.  The U.S. currency rallied versus all of its most-traded
counterparts as traders speculated on whether Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will indicate in an Aug. 26 address in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming, a willingness to provide more stimulus.  The kiwi has fallen 4.2 percent in the past month in the
worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The
Aussie has lost 3.4 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index decreased 1.3 percent, erasing
gains of as much as 0.7 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
increased 0.6 percent after rallying 3.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
