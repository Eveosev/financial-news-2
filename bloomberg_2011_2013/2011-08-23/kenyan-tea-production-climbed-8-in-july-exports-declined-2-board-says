Tea production in  Kenya , the world’s
biggest exporter of the black variety of the leaves, rose 8
percent in July to 26.3 million kilograms (58 million pounds) on
improved weather conditions, the industry regulator said.  Shipments last month fell 2 percent to 37.4 million
kilograms, with Egypt accounting for 19 percent of exports,
followed by Pakistan and the U.K., the Nairobi-based  Tea Board
of Kenya  said in an e-mailed statement today. The volume of tea
sold through the world’s biggest auction in Mombasa in July
declined 8 percent to 20.7 million kilograms, the board said.  Production of the leaves in the seven months through July
dropped 14 percent to 204.8 million kilograms compared with a
year earlier, largely due to lower rainfall, it said.  Unseasonably dry weather in  East Africa  has caused one of
the worst droughts in the region in six decades, according to
the  United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Kenyan
President Mwai Kibaki declared a national disaster in the
drought-stricken country in May. Tea was Kenya’s biggest
foreign-currency earner last year.  Production may fall 30 percent this year, from a record 399
million kilograms in 2010, because of drier weather, Peter
Kimanga, chairman of the  East African Tea Trade Association , an
industry group, said on Aug. 19.  Kenya’s is the world’s  third-largest  producer of tea, after
China and  India , according to the Rome-based FAO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
