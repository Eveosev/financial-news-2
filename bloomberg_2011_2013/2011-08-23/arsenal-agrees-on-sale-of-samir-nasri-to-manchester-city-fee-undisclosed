Midfielder Samir Nasri signed a
four-year contract at  Manchester City , completing his move from
Premier League rival Arsenal.  Arsenal yesterday agreed to sell Nasri to City in a deal
U.K. media said was worth 23 million pounds ($38 million). The
Frenchman had turned down an extension to his Arsenal contract,
which had 12 months remaining, and could have left the club as a
free agent at the end of this season.  Nasri could make his debut in this weekend’s Premier League
match at Tottenham, City said on its  website .  The 24-year-old joined Arsenal in 2008 from Marseille and
scored 27 goals in three years, including 15 in 46 appearances
last season. He follows Cesc Fabregas and Emmanuel Eboue in
leaving the London club -- which last won a trophy in 2005 --
over the past two weeks.  “Nasri is a situation where they player didn’t want to
extend his contract with the proposals he had somewhere else,”
Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  said on the club’s  website . “What
kind of commitment can you have when the player is not there
long-term? That is the question you have to answer.”  Nasri becomes City’s fourth major addition since last
season, following  Gael Clichy , Stefan Savic and  Sergio Aguero ,
who’s scored two goals as City has opened the season with two
wins to lead the Premier League standings.  The soccer transfer period ends Aug. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
