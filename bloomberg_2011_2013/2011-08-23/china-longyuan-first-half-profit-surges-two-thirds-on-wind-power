China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the countryâ€™s biggest wind-project developer, said profit surged
by two-thirds in the first half after it sold more electricity.  Net income rose to 1.4 billion yuan ($219 million) from
848 million yuan a year earlier, Longyuan said today in a
filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Sales increased 22
percent to 7.6 billion yuan.  China , the world's largest energy consumer, aims to install 
110 gigawatts of wind-power capacity by 2015. The country added
17 gigawatts of wind capacity last year, about two-thirds
more than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  Longyuan said the electricity generated from wind resources
rose 44 percent to 7,069 million kilowatt-hours in the six
months ended June 30.  Longyuan, whose shares have lost 16 percent this year, 
agreed in the first half to develop 6 gigawatts of wind projects
in provinces including Heilongjiang, Jilin,  Inner Mongolia  and 
Hebei. The average preferential wind-power price for the first 
half increased by 7 yuan from a year earlier to 572 yuan a 
megawatt-hour, Longyuan said.  Net income from sales of carbon-emission credits more than 
doubled to 381 million yuan, according to the filing. The stock 
rose 5.5 percent to close at HK$6 before the earnings statement.  As of the end of June, the company operated 30 megawatts of
solar plants.  The Beijing-based company plans to build 1 gigawatt of
offshore wind farms by 2015 as part of a government push for
clean-energy generators, President Xie Changjun said in June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
