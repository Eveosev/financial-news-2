Lleyton Hewitt  pulled out of this
month’s  U.S. Open , which he won 10 years ago, the  United States
Tennis Association  said.  The reason for Hewitt’s withdrawal six days after he
received a wild-card entry wasn’t immediately known, Tim Curry,
a spokesman for the USTA, said in a telephone interview today.
The 30-year-old Hewitt is suffering from a persistent foot
injury, Australia’s  Herald Sun  reported.  Hewitt’s two career Grand Slam tennis titles came at the
U.S. Open in 2001 and Wimbledon the following year. The
Australian will be replaced at the last major tournament of the
tennis season by 26-year-old Marinko Matosevic as part of a
reciprocal wild-card arrangement with Australia that gives the
U.S. an entry in the Australian Open, Curry said.  Hewitt was ranked No. 1 on the ATP Tour from October 2001
to April 2003, according to the tour’s website. He lost to  David Nalbandian  of Argentina in the opening round of the Australian
Open this year and fell in the second round of Wimbledon to
 Robin Soderling  of Sweden. He withdrew from the French Open on
May 22 with an ankle injury.  The U.S. Open runs Aug. 29-Sept. 11 at the National Tennis
Center in New York. The men’s and women’s singles champions will
receive $1.8 million each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
