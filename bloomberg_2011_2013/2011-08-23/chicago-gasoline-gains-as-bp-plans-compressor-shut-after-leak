Chicago gasoline strengthened as  BP
Plc (BP)  planned to shut a compressor associated with a coker and
repair a seal leak at its Whiting, Indiana, refinery.  It isnâ€™t known whether the coker will need to be shut for
the work at the 420,000-barrel-a-day refinery, said a person
familiar with the repairs.  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  restarted a fluid
catalytic cracker today at its Lima, Ohio, refinery after a
malfunction in a wet gas compressor late yesterday, Colleen
McConnell, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
rose 5 cents to 12 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:38 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 9.29 cents to
$2.998 a gallon.  Earlier today, BP evacuated non-essential workers from an
area of the Whiting refinery after a monitor signaled a possible
hydrogen sulfide leak,  Scott Dean , a company spokesman, said in
a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
