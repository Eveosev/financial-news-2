Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.’s largest owner
of business parks, gained the most in 15 months in  London 
trading after reporting first-half profit that beat analysts’
expectations.  Segro rose as much as 5.6 percent. Pretax profit fell to
64.6 million pounds ($107 million) from 148.9 million pounds a
year earlier, the company said in a statement today. Analysts
forecast 64.2 million pounds, the average of three estimates in
a Bloomberg survey.  “Overall, the operational results were good in a tough
market,” Osmaan Malik, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
London, said in a note to investors today.  More customers renewed leases and fewer returned unwanted
space than a year earlier, causing the vacancy rate for Segro’s
properties to fall to 11.4 percent at the end of June from 14
percent a year earlier. That contributed to a gain in like-for-
like net rental income of 5.1 percent. The company raised its
dividend to 4.9 percent a share from 4.7 pence.  “We went into the summer break with a good level of
inquiries” for space, Chief Executive Officer David Sleath said
on a conference call. “We haven’t seen any signs of customers
deferring decisions.”  Segro, which advanced the most since May 2010, closed up
2.7 percent at 244.9 pence raising the real estate investment
trust’s market value to 1.82 billion pounds. The stock has
dropped 24 percent in the past six months, compared with a 14
percent decline in the FTSE 250 index.  Underlying pretax profit, which excludes the effect of
valuation movements, rose 11 percent to 71.1 million pounds.
Real estate values overall declined 0.2 percent, with office
values dropping 1.1 percent in the U.K. and 5.8 percent
elsewhere in  Europe .  Segro will manage the business “prudently” because of the
unsettled economic environment, the company said in the
statement. That means avoiding developments without any tenants
lined up except in areas of known high demand, Sleath said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
