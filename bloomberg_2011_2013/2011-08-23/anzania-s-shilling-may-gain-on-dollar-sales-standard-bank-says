Tanzania’s shilling is set to climb
against the dollar by the end of the week as companies buy the
local currency to make monthly payments, said Zainul Chandoo,
Head of Treasury at  Standard Bank  Group Ltd.’s local unit.  “Because of the Eid holiday next week, we expect companies
to start buying shillings to meet their end of month obligations
like paying taxes and salaries,” Chandoo said by phone from  Dar
es Salaam , the commercial capital.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy is
poised to appreciate to 1,620 per dollar by Aug. 26, he said.
The shilling depreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 1,629 and
gained as much as 0.8 percent before trading unchanged at
1,624.45 by 2:07 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The shilling has weakened 8.6 percent against the dollar
this year, making it the worst-performing African currency after
 Uganda  and  Kenya ’s. The shilling reached 1,633.2 on Aug. 19, the
weakest intraday level since at least 1994. Tanzania’s inflation
rate climbed to 13 percent in July, the fastest pace in 15
months, on higher energy and food costs, the National Bureau of
Statistics said on Aug. 15.  The country vies with Mali to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of gold, and has the world’s only known deposits of
tanzanite, a rare gem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
