Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
to a nine-month low, as investors bet slower global growth will
help damp inflation in the Andean country.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.78 percent at 1:11 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest
since Nov. 12. The security’s price climbed 0.47 centimo to
114.23 centimos per sol.  Slower growth in  Europe  and the U.S. will cause Latin
American economies to expand less than expected this year and
next and lead the region’s central banks to maintain or reduce
borrowing costs, Morgan Stanley said in a report yesterday.  “If the European crisis worsens, the effects will be felt
here,” said  Roberto Flores , an economist at Inteligo SAB, a
Lima-based brokerage. “Expectations of reduced inflation
pressures translate into less pressure on  interest rates .”  The country’s central bank kept interest rates unchanged at
4.25 percent for a third month Aug. 11, citing a deceleration in
the world economy and domestic activity.  The sol was unchanged at 2.7325 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
