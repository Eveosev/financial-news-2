VTB Capital, the investment banking
unit of  Russia ’s second-biggest lender, hired Makram Abboud from
Nomura International Plc for a senior role as it expands,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Abboud, a managing director for Nomura’s emerging-markets
team, will soon join VTB Capital in a “senior role” to help
the bank expand in the Middle East, said the people, who
declined to be named because the information hasn’t yet been
made public.  VTB Capital recruited Atanas Bostandjiev from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in May as its U.K. and international head. The
company said last year it wants to add to its presence in
Moscow,  London , Dubai and Singapore by opening a branch in  Hong
Kong  and expanding in the U.S. this year.  Abboud declined to comment when reached on his mobile. VTB
and Nomura spokespeople, who declined to be named citing company
policy, refused to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
