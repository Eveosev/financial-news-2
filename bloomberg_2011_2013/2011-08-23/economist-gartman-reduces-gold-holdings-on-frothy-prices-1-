Dennis Gartman , the economist and
editor of the Gartman Letter, is reducing his gold holdings
because prices became “too frothy” after the metal surged to a
record above $1,910 an ounce.  Gartman is selling one unit each of bullion priced in euros
and British pounds after adding to his position early last week,
he said today in his Suffolk, Virginia-based daily report.
Gartman, who yesterday said the metal is entering the stage when
prices go “parabolic,” said he’s still keeping a total of four
units of gold priced in the two currencies. He owns no gold
denominated in dollars.  The metal climbed to a record $1,913.50 an ounce today in
London and is heading for the biggest monthly gain since
September 1999 as concern about slowing economic growth and debt
crises spurs demand for a protection of wealth. Bullion is up a
similar amount in August priced in euros and pounds and today
touched all-time highs in those currencies and Swiss francs.  “Perhaps things have become a bit too frothy and reduced
rather than increased exposure seems reasonable and wise,”
Gartman said. “We’ll hold a core position in gold and we remain
long term bullish of gold.”  33% Climb  Immediate-delivery bullion gold fell 0.8 percent to
$1,882.88 an ounce by 11:01 a.m. in  London , erasing a gain of as
much as 0.8 percent. Prices are up 33 percent this year and set
for an 11th straight annual gain, the longest winning streak
since at least 1920. This year the metal has outperformed global
equities, commodities and Treasuries.  Demand for gold’s perceived safety pushed holdings in
exchange-traded products to a record 2,216.8 metric tons on Aug.
8, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors’ assets in the
products were 2,206.4 tons yesterday, more than all but four
central banks.  UBS AG today raised its one-month gold forecast to $1,950
an ounce and increased its three-month outlook to $2,100. A
decline of as much as $150 would be “a good buying
opportunity,”  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at the bank,
said in a report today.  “Gold has reached that point where it moves $40-$50 an
ounce in a moment’s notice,” Gartman said. “It is violent; it
is mass psychology incarnate and it is scary.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
