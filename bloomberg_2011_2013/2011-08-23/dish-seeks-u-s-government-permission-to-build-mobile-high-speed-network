Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the second-
largest U.S. satellite-television provider, filed for U.S.
government permission to offer mobile high-speed  Internet
service  to millions of consumers.  The company asked for clearance of its acquisitions of
assets of DBSD North America Inc. and TerreStar Networks Inc.
and for license waivers, according to a filing dated yesterday
with the Federal Communications Commission. Those actions by the
government would allow Dish to build the network, it said.  Dish Chairman  Charlie Ergen  is seeking to expand the
company beyond pay-TV service through acquisitions. Ergen said
in May that Englewood, Colorado-based Dish’s strategy was like
an episode of the television show “Seinfeld,” with all the
parts coming together at the end.  Building a mobile-broadband network could be “costly,”
said  Jonathan Chaplin , an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in
New York, in a research note today. Marc Lumpkin, a spokesman
for Dish, said the company had no comment beyond the contents of
the filing.  Dish gained 62 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $21.99 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
