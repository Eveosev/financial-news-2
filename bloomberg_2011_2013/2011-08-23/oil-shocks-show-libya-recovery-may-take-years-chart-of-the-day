Libyan oil production may take years
to recover if the history of supply shocks in  Iran , Iraq and the
 Soviet Union  is anything to go by.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the restoration of full
production in the former Soviet Union after the end of communism
took a decade. Iraq needed four years to equal the output that
preceded the 2003 U.S. invasion, and it remains below the level
before the war with Iran in 1980. Three decades after the 1979
revolution, production in Iran has yet to be completely
restored.  “Often the most difficult time of a regime change is after
the change,” said  Peter Hutton , an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets  in  London . “ Libya ’s not as extreme a case as Iran,
Russia or  Iraq , but it’s not going to be easy.”  Libyan production will reach 450,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day by the end of the year and 900,000 barrels a
day next year, according to Citigroup estimates published in a
research note today. Before the civil war, production was at 1.3
million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
