South Africa named 18 members of its
2007 Rugby  World Cup  championship squad to its 30-man roster for
this year’s tournament in  New Zealand .  Captain John Smit will be joined by 11 other starters from
the 15-6 victory over England in the 2007 final in Paris. Smit
is one of six players who will be making their third World Cup
appearances.  “This squad has the experience and ability to make a
strong challenge for the title, but we know it will be very
difficult,” Springboks coach Peter de Villiers said in a
statement. “It’s has been a tough season to date and we have
had some challenges with the amount of rugby the players had
have to play, but I’m very happy with the squad.”  South Africa  opens its title defense Sept. 11 against
Wales, before playing Fiji, Namibia and Samoa. The Springboks
will be seeking a record third World Cup title and have lost
just two of their past 24 matches at rugby’s four-yearly
championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
