Ethanol futures rose to a three-week
high in Chicago as  crude oil  and corn advanced.  Futures surged after a report showed crop conditions for
corn, the primary input for the fuel in the U.S., slipped from
last week, threatening to raise production costs at
distilleries. Separately, crude oil gained on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will bolster efforts to boost the economy.  “The rally in outside markets, corn and crude oil, just
brought ethanol up with it,” said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 3.7 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.893 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures are up 22 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  Chicago  increased 3
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.905 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
biofuel climbed 2.5 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.985, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in New York added 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.995 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive increased 1
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.02.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, rose to 24 cents from
23 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 9.25 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $7.345 a bushel in Chicago.  Crude for October delivery rose $1.02 to settle at $85.44 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures have fallen
6.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
