Ukraine  will auction permits for
shale-gas extraction, Coal and Energy Minister Yuriy Boyko said.  “A series of auctions is to be held in the near future,”
Boyko said in a statement on the government website today.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Eni SpA have expressed interest
in extracting shale gas in Ukraine, the minister said. Energy
adviser IHS CERA will hold conferences on non-conventional gas
exploration in Ukraine in September and November, Boyko said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
