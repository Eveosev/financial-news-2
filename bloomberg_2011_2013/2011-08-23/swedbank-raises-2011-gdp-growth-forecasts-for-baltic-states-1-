Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  raised its 2011
economic-growth forecasts for  Latvia , Estonia and  Lithuania 
after first-half output “exceeded expectations.”  Latvia’s economy may expand 4.2 percent this year, compared
with an earlier estimate of 4 percent, Swedbank said in its
 Economic Outlook  today. The Stockholm-based bank increased
Estonia’s forecast to 6.7 percent from 4.5 percent and
Lithuania’s to 6.3 percent from 4.2 percent.  Estonia and Lithuania grew at the fastest pace in the
European Union in the second quarter, with gross domestic
product expanding 8.4 percent and 6.1 percent, driven by record
exports and stronger domestic demand. Latvia grew 5.3 percent
during the period after suffering the EU’s worst recession in
2009.  “Economic developments during the first half of this year
were very strong, overshooting our expectations in most areas,”
the report said. “Estonia’s recovery surprised on the upside.
Lithuania’s growth also exceeded our expectations.”  Still, the three Baltic economies will probably slow in
2012 as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsens and the global economy
weakens, damping export orders. Estonia may grow 4.2 percent
next year, while Latvia may expand 3.5 percent and Lithuania 4.7
percent, the bank said.  “Export growth is set to slow after the bounce back, in
line with weaker global demand,” Swedbank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
