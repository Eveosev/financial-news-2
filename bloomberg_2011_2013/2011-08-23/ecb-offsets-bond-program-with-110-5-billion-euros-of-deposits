The  European Central Bank  said it
will take 110.5 billion euros ($160 billion) in term deposits
from euro-area banks tomorrow to neutralize the extra money
created by its bond purchases.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it received 91 bids for the
seven-day deposits totaling 132.9 billion euros. The marginal
rate was 1.15 percent. The 110.5 billion euros the ECB will
absorb corresponds to the total amount of extra liquidity its
bond-purchase program has created since it began in May last
year.  The ECB, which sterilizes its bond purchases to ensure they
don’t fuel inflation, was forced to start buying Italian and
Spanish securities on Aug. 8 to contain  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis. The central bank settled purchases worth 14.3 billion
billion euros last week, down from a record 22 billion euros the
previous week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
