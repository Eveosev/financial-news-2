The Federal Network Agency of
 Germany  has told the regional government of the German state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg that it may have to make the Philippsburg 1
nuclear reactor a reserve power plant,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported in a preview of an article that will be
published tomorrow.  Philippsburg 1 might have to become a reserve energy plant
if the regional government cannot guarantee that a coal plant in
Mannheim, Germany, will act as an alternative solution, the
German newspaper reported, citing a letter from the network
agency to the government of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
There are still no permits to make the coal power plant in
Mannheim a reserve plant,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
