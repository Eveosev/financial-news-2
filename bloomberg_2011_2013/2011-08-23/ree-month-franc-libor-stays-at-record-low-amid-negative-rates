The rate banks charge to lend to
each other in Swiss francs for three months, or Libor, remained
at a record low 0.00750 percent today, the British Bankers’
Association said.  Credit Suisse AG, the Zurich-based bank, submitted a
negative three-month Libor for the fourth straight day,
unchanged at minus 0.15 percent, BBA data show. Citigroup Inc.
submitted a rate below zero for the second consecutive day, at
negative 0.05 percent from minus 0.01 percent yesterday.  Societe Generale SA became the third lender to submit a
negative rate, at negative 0.01 percent, compared with zero
yesterday.  The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3 as it
attempts to restrain the currency’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
