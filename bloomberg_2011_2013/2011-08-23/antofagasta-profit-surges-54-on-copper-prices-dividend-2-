Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, said first-half profit
climbed 54 percent as production and metal prices advanced.  Net income gained to $696.2 million from $451.2 million a
year earlier, the London-based miner said today in a statement.
Sales increased 73 percent to $3.05 billion. The dividend
doubled to 8 cents from a year ago.  The shares rose the most since Aug. 12 after Antofagasta
raised first-half copper output 14 percent to 288,500 metric
tons. The company, which expanded its largest mine at Los
Pelambres and began shipping from its Esperanza site in January,
is seeking to boost output to as much as 640,000 tons this year
from 521,100 tons. The average price of copper advanced 31
percent from a year earlier, it said.  “The company is bullish on its outlook for copper despite
recent weakness due to recession worries,” Collins Stewart Plc
said today in an e-mailed note. The dividend was “well ahead of
expectations,” it said.  The stock advanced 3.1 percent to 1,250 pence at 9:16 a.m.
 London  time after earlier rising as much as 4.2 percent. It’s
declined 22 percent this year.  “Recent events have shown the volatility of commodity
prices, and the industry is also continuing to see relatively
strong cost pressures,” Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Awad
said in the statement. “While markets are likely to remain
volatile, especially in the near-term, we remain confident that
copper fundamentals will remain supportive of a strong pricing
environment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
