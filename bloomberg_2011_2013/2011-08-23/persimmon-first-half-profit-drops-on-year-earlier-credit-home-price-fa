Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s third-
largest homebuilder by volume, said first-half profit fell after
it sold fewer homes at lower prices and a year-earlier credit
wasn’t repeated.  Pretax profit declined to 60.3 million pounds ($99.4
million) from 101.4 million pounds a year earlier, the York,
England-based company said in a statement today. The year-
earlier results included a net credit of 63.6 million pounds
after the company reassessed the value of its assets. Analysts
expected earnings of 56.2 million pounds, the average of six
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  U.K. home prices are falling as banks’ demands for larger
deposits are deterring first-time buyers. Sellers in London
lowered asking prices by the most in a year in August as demand
in Britain’s most expensive city for real estate was hit by
turmoil in financial markets.  “Mortgages have improved marginally,” Chief Executive
Officer Mike Farley said in an interview. “The average loan-to-
value is up now 80 percent from 75 percent. What we need to see
is the 95 percent mortgage come back because first-time buyers
are affected by that.”  Persimmon rose as much as 4.8 percent in  London  trading and
was up 2.9 percent at 394 pence as of 9:38 a.m. The stock has
declined 11 percent in the last six months, giving the
homebuilder a market value of 1.19 billion pounds.  Revenue fell 8.2 percent to 712.8 million pounds as the
number of houses sold declined to 4,439 from 4,657 a year
earlier. The company said it expects full-year home completions
to equal the total for 2010. The average selling price declined
3.7 percent to 162,647 pounds.  Nationwide Price Drop  U.K. house prices fell to the lowest level in more than 1
1/2 years last month, Acadametrics Ltd. and LSL Property
Services Plc said Aug. 12. With the exception of London, all of
the 10 regions in England and  Wales  tracked in the survey
reported declines in the past three months.  “We are running our business on a cautious basis,” Farley
said by phone. The company has made provisions against further
price declines of at least six percent and “we could probably
sustain up to 10 percent without having to make any further
writedowns on our  land bank .”  British homebuilders, including Persimmon, announced the
first of their writedowns in 2008 as land values declined during
the country’s worst property slump since World War II.  Net income dropped to 46.8 million pounds from 80.1 million
pounds a year earlier. The company will pay an interim dividend
of four pence a share, up from three pence a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
