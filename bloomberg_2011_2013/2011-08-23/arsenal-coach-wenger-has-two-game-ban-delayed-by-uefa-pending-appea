Arsene Wenger  will be able to coach
Arsenal in tomorrow’s Champions League playoff match at Udinese
after having a two-game suspension delayed.  European soccer’s governing body UEFA yesterday banned
Wenger two games for flouting its rules by communicating with
his team while serving a suspension during last week’s 1-0 win
over Udinese in the Champions League playoff. He was only
granted permission to watch the game from the stands, UEFA said.  Both Arsenal and Wenger appealed the ban, which was to
begin with tomorrow’s return match in Italy.  “The UEFA appeals body has granted a stay of execution to
the appeal lodged earlier today by Arsenal FC and their manager
Arsene Wenger,”  UEFA said  on its website. “The appeals body
will take a decision in due time, but not before Arsenal’s
 Champions League  game against Udinese Calcio in Italy on
Wednesday.”  Wenger was originally suspended by UEFA for comments he
made about a referee after his team was knocked out of last
season’s Champions League by eventual winner Barcelona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
