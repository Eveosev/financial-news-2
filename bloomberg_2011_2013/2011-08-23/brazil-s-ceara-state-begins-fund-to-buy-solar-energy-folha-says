The Brazilian northeastern state of
Ceara created a fund to buy solar power in a bid to lower the
cost and attract solar equipment makers to the region, Folha de
S.Paulo reported, without saying where it got the information.  Ceara’s government will guarantee the purchase of solar
energy for one to two years, Folha said. Buyers of the energy
may get incentives such as lower taxes, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
