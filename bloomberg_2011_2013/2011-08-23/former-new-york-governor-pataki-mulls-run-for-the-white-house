Former New York Governor George
Pataki, a Republican who considered running for the White House
four years ago, is again mulling a presidential campaign.  “Governor Pataki is seriously considering getting into the
2012 race,” said his former communications director, David
Catalfamo. “He is deeply disappointed by President Obama’s
utter failure of leadership on the debt issue and in the lack of
real solutions being offered by the current Republican field of
candidates.”  Catalfamo said there was an “urgency to the decision-
making process.” The governor will be in Iowa, site of the
first-in-the-nation presidential nominating caucuses, this
weekend,  Pataki, 65, was chairman of a nonprofit political group in
the last election, Revere America, which spent $3 million to
help elect Republican congressional candidates. The group did
not disclose its donors. He declined entreaties to run against
Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
