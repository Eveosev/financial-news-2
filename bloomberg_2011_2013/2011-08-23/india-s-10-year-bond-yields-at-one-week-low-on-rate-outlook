India ’s 10-year bond yields were
near the lowest level in a week on speculation the central bank
will only increase  interest rates  once more this year due to the
global economic slowdown.  Concern Europe’s debt crisis is spreading and disappointing
U.S. economic data has resulted in global stock markets falling
and investors favoring the perceived safety of government debt
in recent weeks.  Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said on Aug. 18 that international economic prospects
appeared more pessimistic than a month earlier. India’s central
bank has boosted borrowing costs five times this year and next
meets to review rates on Sept. 16.  “The global economic scenario is broadly positive for
bonds,” said  Roy Paul , a Mumbai-based deputy general manager of
fixed income and currencies at Federal Bank Ltd. “The central
bank may pause monetary tightening after one more hike.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 was
little changed 8.27 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate touched
8.26 percent on Aug. 18, the lowest level since Aug. 11.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose nine basis points to 7.75 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
