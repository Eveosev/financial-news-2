Canadian natural gas rose as warmer-
than-normal weather in the U.S. North boosted air conditioner
use and demand for power plant fuels.  Cooling demand in the Northeast will exceed normal by an
average 27 percent for the next week, according to Belton,
Missouri-based Weather Derivatives. Temperatures in  New York 
will reach 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) Aug. 25, 4 degrees
more than normal, according to AccuWeather Inc.  “The weather is still pretty hot,” said Kyle Cooper,
director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston. “Injections
have been running a little above average; if the heat continues,
that may not persist.”  Alberta  gas for September rose 9 cents, or 2.7 percent, to
C$3.47 per gigajoule ($3.33 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:50 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian
Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users
in  Canada  and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s
Alberta system.  Gas for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 10.4 cents, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $3.993
per million Btu.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 2.54 cents to $4.0892 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was up 0.5 cent to $3.8157, according to ICE. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California

output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet as of 2:30 p.m. in New York, 91 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.92 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.51 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.23 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.53 billion cubic feet today, about 59
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.79
billion cubic feet at 2:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
