(Corrects percent gain of Brazil real in third paragraph.)  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) 
said net income fell 65 percent in the second quarter as a
stronger real eroded profit from its biggest hydroelectric dam.  Net income dropped to 326.6 million reais ($204.1 million),
from 943.8 million reais a year earlier, the company known as
Eletrobras said today in a regulatory filing.  Earnings were hurt as a stronger Brazilian currency pared
the value of dollar-denominated receivables from Itaipu, the
world’s second-largest hydroelectric complex. Brazil’s real
climbed 4.4 percent in the second quarter, the second-best
performer of Latin American currencies behind Colombia’s peso,
according to Bloomberg data.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a measure of  cash flow  known as ebitda, fell 31
percent to 957 million reais, while sales declined 12 percent to
5.7 billion reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
