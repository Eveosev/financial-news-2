The U.S. Treasury Department sold
$35 billion of two-year notes at a yield of 0.222 percent, the
lowest on record.  The bid/cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
the number of bids to the amount of securities sold, rose to
3.44 from 3.14 at the last two-year note sale, indicating stronger
demand. The bid/cover ratio was the highest since 3.46 at the
May 24 auction.  At the past six auctions of two-year notes, bids were
received for 3.22 times the amount of notes being sold, on
average.  The yield was higher than the 0.221 percent yield traders
anticipated in a Bloomberg News survey. In when-issued trading

10-year note yielded 2.11 percent. In market trading, the two-year
note yielded 0.21 percent.  Auction Details  At the monthly auction, 73.87 percent of the bids were allotted
