The U.K.â€™s refugee and asylum system
cost almost 10 billion pounds ($16.5 billion) between 1997 and
2010, the pressure group  Migration Watch  said in a report
published today.  The group, which campaigns on immigration issues, said
people who entered the U.K. and  claimed asylum  during the period
had a 77 percent chance of staying, even though only 40 percent
were granted protection. The money was accounted for by court
costs and legal fees, Migration Watch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
