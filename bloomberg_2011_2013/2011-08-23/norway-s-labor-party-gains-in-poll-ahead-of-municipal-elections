Backing for  Norway ’s ruling  Labor
Party , led by Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, has risen 4.4
percentage points to 34 percent since municipal elections were
last held four years ago, a  poll  by Synovate showed.  The poll, based on 974 interviews, showed support for the
opposition Conservatives rose to 26 percent, 6.7 percentage
points higher versus results in the 2007 municipal elections.
Backing for the anti-immigration Progress Party dropped 1.5
percentage points to 16 percent. The poll, published on the
website of newspaper Dagbladet today, didn’t give a margin of
error.  Norway holds municipal elections on Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
