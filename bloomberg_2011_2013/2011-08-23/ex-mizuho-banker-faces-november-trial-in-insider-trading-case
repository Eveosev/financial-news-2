Thomas Ammann, a former Mizuho
International Plc banker charged with  insider trading , faces a
November trial along with two associates.  Ammann, 38, was committed for trial at a court hearing in
London today. The U.K. Financial Services Authority charged him
with three counts of insider dealing in connection with sales of
 OCE NV (OCE)  shares in 2009 before  Japan ’s Canon Inc. bought the
company.  Canon, known for cameras and photocopiers, agreed to buy
OCE in a 730 million-euro ($1.1 billion) deal in November 2009.
The charges relate to trades made as long as nine months before
the sale, the FSA said earlier this month.  Also charged were Jessica Mang, a 28-year-old London
chiropractor, and Christina Weckwerth, a 42-year-old student in
Germany.  Ammann encouraged Mang and Weckwerth to trade using non-
public information, according to the charges filed by the FSA.
They used accounts at Morgan Stanley and Halifax Share Dealing
Ltd. to make the trades.  Ammann’s lawyer, Shaul Brazil, declined to comment. Mang’s
lawyer, Romana Khan, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call
seeking comment. A lawyer representing Weckwerth at  Addleshaw
Goddard LLP  couldn’t be immediately reached to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
