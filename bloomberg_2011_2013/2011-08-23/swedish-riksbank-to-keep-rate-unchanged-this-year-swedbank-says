Sweden ’s central bank will keep its
benchmark lending rate unchanged at 2 percent through the rest
of the year, Swedbank AB forecast, as it cut its estimate for
growth in the largest Nordic economy.  The economy will grow 4.3 percent this year before slowing
to 1.8 percent in 2012, compared with an earlier forecast of 2.2
percent next year, the bank said in a report published today in
 Stockholm . Swedbank estimates the Riksbank will raise its main
rate to 2.25 percent by the middle of next year, before
gradually increasing it to 3 percent by the end of 2013.  “Sweden’s economy is mutating from a tiger to a reliable
farm cat,” Cecilia Hermansson, chief economist at  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) ,
said in a statement. “The Riksbank will probably lower its repo
rate path.”  Sweden’s economy, which relies on exports for about half of
its output, will grow “significantly” less than previously
estimated, after expanding 5.7 percent last year, Finance
Minister Anders Borg said this month. The government will
present new forecasts on Aug. 26.  Swedish inflation will average 1.6 percent this year and
1.7 percent in 2012, Swedbank said today. The Riksbank targets 2
percent price growth. Unemployment will average 7.5 percent in
2011 and 7.2 percent in 2012, the bank forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
