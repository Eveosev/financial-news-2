Chancellor Angela Merkel  is
considering backing a greater role for the European Union
justice system in ruling on treaty violations as a way to better
police fiscal policy among EU member states.  The Court of Justice of the European Union could be given
more jurisdiction over violations of the treaty that sets limits
on debt and deficits, Merkel told lawmakers in her Christian
Democratic-led bloc today in Berlin, according to caucus
spokesman Ulrich Scharlack. Merkelâ€™s party caucus met to discuss
EU crisis measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
