Syncrude’s premium to benchmark West
Texas Intermediate crude oil narrowed after  Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said that the Horizon upgrader in  Alberta  resumed
production.  The 110,000-barrel-a-day upgrader, shut following a Jan. 6
fire, returned to service Aug. 16, the company said in a
statement late yesterday.  The premium for Syncrude narrowed 35 cents to $14 a barrel
at 2:14 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at $14
a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 55 cents to a premium of $24.65
a barrel over WTI. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased 5
cents to $21.70 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed 60 cents to $20.75 while Poseidon weakened 60
cents to $20.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 25 cents to $19.25 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 70 cents.
