South Korea ’s rice acreage declined
4.3 percent this year as the government encouraged farmers to
switch to other crops including corn and soybeans and
construction encroached into farmland.  The planted area for rice cultivation dropped to 853,823
hectares (2.1 million acres) this year from 892,074 hectares
last year, Statistics Korea said in an e-mailed statement today,
citing a survey of farmers conducted over 16 days last month.
Domestic rice output was 4.3 million metric tons last year, the
state agency said, without giving a forecast for this year.  South Korea, which is self-sufficient in rice, is seeking
to boost domestic production of other grains including corn and
wheat as global prices increase.  Asia ’s second-biggest grain
buyer relies on imports for almost all of its corn and wheat
requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
