Gasoline futures gained the most
since Aug. 3 as equities advanced on speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will act to spur economic growth.  Futures and stocks rose as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
prepares to speak on Aug. 26 at the Central Bank’s annual
symposium in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. Bernanke used that forum a
year ago to hint at a second round of asset purchases, or
quantitative easing, spurring a 28 percent jump in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 stock index.  “We’re paralleling equities and the whole market is
gearing up for what Bernanke is going to say,” said  Tom Knight ,
vice president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana, Texas. “The feeling is that Bernanke will feel
compelled to take some sort of action.”  Gasoline for September delivery gained 4.15 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $2.8766 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after earlier falling as low as $2.8028.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 3.18 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2.9425 a gallon on the exchange.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.2 percent as of 2:39
p.m. in New York.  A four-week global equity rout wiped about $8 trillion from
companies’ market value as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis went
unresolved and economic reports in the U.S. indicated the
economic recovery was stalled. Gasoline’s front-month contract
is down 17 percent since April 29 when it settled at a 33-month
high of $3.4648.  Hurricane Irene  Futures also gained as  Hurricane Irene , a Category 2 storm,
could strengthen into a major hurricane by tomorrow on a path to
reach North Carolina Saturday and then up the East Coast,
threatening product deliveries from regional refineries and
disrupting tanker traffic. As of 2 p.m.  New York  time, the storm
was 55 miles south of Grand Turk Island, according to the
 National Hurricane Center .  “It could affect operations in the Philadelphia area and
tanker and barge traffic will be impacted as the storm passes
through,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  The U.S. East Coast, or  Padd 1 region , has 10 operating
refineries with a capacity of 1.21 million barrels a day,
according to Energy Department data. The area accounts for 7.1
percent of total U.S. operating capacity.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.3
percent to $3.572 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
