Mauritius’s rupee climbed against
the dollar and euro as investors expects stronger growth for the
island nation when compared with the U.S. and  Europe  and on bets
companies were selling the international currencies.  The currency climbed for the first day in three against the
dollar, adding 0.7 percent to 27.90 by 1:05 p.m. in Port Louis,
the capital. Versus the euro, currency of its main trading
partner, the rupee strengthened for a second day, adding 0.3
percent to 30.3193.  “Our economic fundamentals are sound, with growth expected
to exceed 4 percent, compared to much lower forecasts in the
U.S. and Europe,” Nitish Benimadhu, a currency and fund manager
at Anglo Mauritius Financial Services Ltd., said by phone.
“Companies are probably converting their dollar and euro
holdings into rupees as they see the latter remaining strong in
the short to medium term.”  The  International Monetary Fund  expects the economy of
Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million people, to expand by
4.1 percent this year compared with 4 percent in 2010. That
compares with 2 percent for the euro region in 2011, down from
2.1 percent last year, and 2.8 percent for the U.S. this year.  Bank of Mauritius Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said the
country’s economy may grow 4.6 percent this year.  Mauritian stocks gained most since Aug. 12, with the 38-
member SEMDEX index rising 0.9 percent to 1,931.67, led by
Mauritius Commercial Bank and  State Bank  of Mauritius Ltd., the
country’s largest lenders by market value.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.232 to 27.4007
rupees, while the selling price was 28.697 per dollar, compared
with 28.7064 on Aug. 22, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the Bank of Mauritius’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
