years in August, adding to signs the euro-region recovery is
losing momentum.  “Investors are worried that during times of quickly
deteriorating asset prices, high volatility, and rising risks to
the economic recovery, banks could be left with too little
capital and a potential lack of support since governments are
constrained by high indebtedness,”  Christian Weber , a
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich, wrote in a note.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim

investment-grade ratings increased 5.5 basis points to 172 basis
