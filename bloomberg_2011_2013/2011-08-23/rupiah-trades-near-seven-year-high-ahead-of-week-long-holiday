Indonesia ’s rupiah was little
changed near a seven-year high as the market winds down ahead of
the Id-ul-Fitr holidays next week. Bonds advanced.  Currency trading volumes have dropped to around $300
million a day from as much as $700 million normally, said Iwan Ridwan Gunandar, a foreign-exchange trader at PT CIMB Bank Niaga.
There is speculation the  Federal Reserve  will announce another
round of bond buying that boosts the supply of dollars at its
annual symposium at  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming  this week. That would
increase the amount of funds available to be invested in higher-
yielding emerging markets like Indonesia.  “The market is already in a holiday mood,” said Jakarta-
based Gunandar. If the U.S. keeps its monetary policy loose,
more money will flow into Indonesia, he said.  The rupiah traded at 8,541 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Jakarta, compared with 8,544 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 8,453 on Aug. 2, the
strongest level since March 2004. It may trade between 8,525 and
8,575 for the rest of the week, Gunandar forecast.  Indonesian markets will shut from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2 for
the Id-ul-Fitr celebrations, which mark the end of the holy
month of Ramadan.  The Fed said on Aug. 9 that officials “discussed the range
of policy tools” to strengthen growth and are “prepared to
employ these tools as appropriate,” while pledging to keep the
benchmark  interest rate  near zero until at least mid-2013.
Indonesia’s policy rate is at 6.75 percent.  The yield on Indonesia’s 8.25 percent notes due July 2021
declined 6.5 basis points, or 0.065 percentage point, to 6.83
percent, the lowest since the debt was issued, according to
closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
