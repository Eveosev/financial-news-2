Teranga Gold Corp. (TGZ) , which mines in
West Africa, may be a takeover target for other companies in the
region, Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty said.  Toronto-based Teranga “appears undervalued and could be
considered attractive by other companies operating in the West
Africa region,” Goldman analysts led by Ian Preston said
yesterday in a report. Perth-based  Perseus Mining Ltd. (PRU) , which
also has assets in West Africa, is “well-placed to acquire
additional production using” shares, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
