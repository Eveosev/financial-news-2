The ruble strengthened against the
dollar as oil,  Russia ’s chief export revenue earner, climbed
above $86 a barrel.  Russia’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 29.03 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, paring an earlier gain of
as much as 1 percent. It added 0.2 percent to 41.7850 per euro.  Oil advanced for a second day as investors bet the  Federal
Reserve  will bolster efforts to stimulate the economy and a
recovery in Libyan crude output will take longer than expected
as fighting in the North African country continues. Crude for
October delivery climbed as much as $1.91 to $86.33 a barrel in
 New York , adding to yesterday’s 2.4 percent gain.  “The global  market sentiment  is positive today, pushing
oil higher, which is good for the Russian economy and the
ruble,” Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in Moscow, said by phone.  Investors pared bets that the ruble will decline further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 29.3064
per dollar in three months compared with 29.4234 on Aug. 22. The
contracts provide a guide to expectations of currency movements
and interest-rate differentials and allow companies to hedge
against currency swings.  The movements against the dollar and the euro left the
ruble 0.2 percent stronger at 34.7697 against the central bank’s
target currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together.  To contact the reporter on this story:
