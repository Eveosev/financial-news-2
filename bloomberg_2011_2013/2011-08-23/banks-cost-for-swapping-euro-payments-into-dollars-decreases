The premium European banks pay to
borrow in dollars through the swaps market fell for the first
time in six days after earlier climbing to the highest level
since December.  The cost of converting euro-based payments into the U.S.
currency, as measured by the one-year cross-currency basis swap,
rose 0.75 basis point to 48.75 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate, or Euribor, at 11:01 a.m. in  London . The
spread widened earlier to as much as 52.00 basis points, the
most since Dec. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Basis swaps allow investors to borrow in one currency and
simultaneously lend in another. The wider spread signals that
lenders may be facing increasing pressure to raise funds in the
U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
