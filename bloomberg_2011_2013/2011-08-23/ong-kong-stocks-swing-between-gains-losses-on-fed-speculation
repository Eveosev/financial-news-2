Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose the
most in a week after a report on  China ’s manufacturing eased
concern the mainland’s economy is slowing, and amid speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will announce more measures to support the
U.S. recovery.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal by
market value, jumped 4.3 percent after data showed Chinese
factory output may be moderating rather than collapsing.  Li &
Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., gained 3.3 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore
oil producer by market value, rose 2.7 percent after the price
of crude increased.  “The manufacturing data were good and they also reduced
the chance of an interest rate hike,” said Linus Yip, chief
strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong.
“Systematic macro risks remain. Investors have to control risks
and cash in, as no one knows what will happen.”  The Hang Seng Index advanced 2 percent to 19,875.53 at the
close, its steepest gain since Aug. 15. All but five stocks rose
in the 46-member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies listed in  Hong Kong  rose 3.3 percent to
10,578.96.  Jiangxi Copper rose 4.3 percent to HK$20.40. China Railway
Construction Corp., a builder of most of the nation’s rail links
since 1949, rose 3.3 percent to HK$3.77. Anhui Conch Cement Co.,
the nation’s largest cement producer by market value, jumped 5.2
percent to HK$31.20.  Output ‘Blip’  China’s factory output may contract at a slower pace in
August, according to a report today by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. A preliminary reading of a manufacturing index
by the companies rose to 49.8 this month from a final reading of
49.3 for July. While a number below 50 indicates a contraction,
HSBC said that today’s figure suggests last month’s slide may
have been a one-off “blip.”  Li & Fung rose 3.3 percent to HK$13.24, while  Techtronic
Industries Co. (669) , maker of Ryobi power tools and Hoover vacuum
cleaners, jumped 5.3 percent to HK$7.30.  Central bankers from around the world will meet on Aug. 26
at an annual conference in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. That’s the
same place where Chairman Ben Bernanke triggered a rally in
equities last year when he said the Fed was prepared to “do all
that it can” to ensure an economic recovery.  ‘Risk Of Disappointment’  “Investors are hoping the Fed will show its commitment to
supporting growth,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based
strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages almost
$100 billion. “There’s a real risk of disappointment if some
sort of strong commitment doesn’t appear.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  entered a so-called  bear market  this
month, tumbling more than 20 percent from a Nov. 8 high on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis and a weakening U.S. economy will
sap demand for  Asia ’s exports. Shares on the index traded at
10.6 times forecast earnings, compared with 11.3 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Cnooc rose 2.7 percent to HK$14.52. China Oilfield Services
Ltd., which provides drilling services to energy explorers,
surged 7 percent to HK$11 after crude for October delivery
climbed as much as 1.9 percent today.  Among stocks that fell, BYD Co. retreated 14 percent to
HK$16.18. The Chinese automaker part-owned by  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said profit tumbled 89 percent in the
first-half.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index gained 1.9 percent to
19,851. The HSI Volatility Index rose 4.4 percent to 38.63,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 11 percent in the
Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
