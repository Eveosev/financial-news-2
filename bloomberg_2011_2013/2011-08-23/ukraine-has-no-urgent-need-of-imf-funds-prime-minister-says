Ukraine has no urgent need for
financing from the  International Monetary Fund , Prime Minister
 Mykola Azarov  said.  Finance Minister Fedir Yaroshenko and Coal and Energy
Minister Yuriy Boyko are in Washington for talks with IMF
management, Azarov said in a  statement  on the government’s
website today.  “It is necessary to take loans in case there is urgent
need, when one needs to boost economy and pay debts,” Azarov
said. “We take just as much as we need.”  Ukraine is expecting an IMF mission, which is visiting
between Aug. 29 to Sept. 6, to hold a program review after the
third disbursement of its $15.6 billion program, which was
initially planned for March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
