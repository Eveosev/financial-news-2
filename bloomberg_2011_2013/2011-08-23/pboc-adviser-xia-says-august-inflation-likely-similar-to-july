Chinese central bank adviser Xia Bin
said he expects inflation this month won’t be very different
from levels seen in July, when consumer prices gained at the
fastest pace in three years.  Inflation in the final quarter of this year will likely be
lower than levels in the second and third quarters, Xia said at
an event in Beijing today. For the year, consumer prices may
climb 4 percent to 5 percent, he said. Xia is one of three
academic members of the People’s Bank of  China ’s monetary policy
committee.  A preliminary reading for data released by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics today showed that China’s manufacturing
may contract at a slower pace in August than in July. The data
suggests that growth in China is moderating rather than
collapsing and the slide in the index in July may have been
a one-off “blip,” HSBC said.  Inflation in July accelerated to 6.5 percent from 6.4
percent in June. China’s central bank has raised  interest rates 
five times since the third quarter to rein in price gains, which
have exceeded the government’s 4 percent annual target for 2011
every month this year.  --Victoria Ruan. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
