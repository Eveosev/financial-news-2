Malaysia ’s ringgit erased losses
after reports showed manufacturing in  China  and Europe fared
better than forecast, easing concerns about a deeper global
economic slowdown.  The currency was little changed after a preliminary report
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed the
purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.8 in August from 49.3 in
July. German PMI manufacturing index held at 52, the same as in
July, compared with a forecast for a drop to 50.6 in a Bloomberg
News survey. Government bonds declined.  “The data indicates a minor cooling off in China’s
economy,” said Farah Syahirah Zakaria, an economist in Kuala
Lumpur at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. “Economic fundamentals
are getting the better of fragile sentiment.”  The ringgit traded at 2.9655 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur , following an 0.8 percent gain over the last two
trading days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has risen 1.8 percent this quarter and reached a 14-
year year of 2.9335 on July 27.  Chin is Malaysia’s second-largest overseas market after
Singapore, and accounted for 12.7 percent of shipments in the
first half of this year, official data show. China, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand,  Hong Kong , Malaysia and Singapore all reported
slower economic growth for the second quarter.  Ten-year notes snapped two days of gain. The yield on
Malaysia’s 4.16 percent note due July 2021 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.64 percent, according to
Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped 0.17, or 1.7 ringgit per 1,000
ringgit face amount, to 104.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
