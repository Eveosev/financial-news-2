Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest
U.S. discount retailer, recalled storage step stools for the
second time this month after reports of collapsing, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission said.  Target recalled an additional 341,000 stools after seeking
to remove 206,000 units from the market Aug. 4, the CPSC said
today. There have been 27 reports of the stools breaking or
collapsing, resulting in injuries to 14 children and eight
adults, the agency said.  The most serious injuries were to the adults, including a
fractured pelvis and two broken arms. The wooden stools were
sold for between $25 and $30 under the Circo and Do Your Room
brand names from January 2007 through October 2010. They were
made in China, Vietnam,  Taiwan  and Thailand.  Consumers should stop using the stools immediately and
return them to any Target store, or call 1-800-440-0680 for a
full refund, the CPSC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
