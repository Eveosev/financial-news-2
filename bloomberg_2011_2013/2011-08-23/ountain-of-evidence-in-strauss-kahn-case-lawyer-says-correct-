(Corrects location in second paragraph.)  There is a “mountain of evidence”
to back up the claims of the maid who accused   Dominique Strauss-Kahn  of sexually assaulting her, her lawyer said today.  There is “no other plausible explanation for what happened
in a nine-minute sexual encounter” than assault, Douglas Wigdor, Nafissatou Diallo’s lawyer, said at a press conference
in Paris today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
