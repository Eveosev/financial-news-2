The  Boston Red Sox  failed to topple
the  New York Yankees  from first place in the American League
East, while  Justin Verlander  got his league-leading 19th win of
the year and the Philadelphia Phillies trounced the Mets 10-0.  The Texas Rangers beat the Red Sox 4-0 to drop Boston to
77-50, one game behind the Yankees, who didn’t play last night.  Elvis Andrus  got a run-scoring single in the third inning
for Texas and Mike Napoli added a three-run homer in the sixth
at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas. It was Napoli’s 21st
home run of the year.  At Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Dillon Gee gave up
eight runs in 3 2/3 innings as the Phillies earned their Major
League Baseball-best 82nd win of the season.  Cliff Lee  got his 14th win after striking out seven and
giving up three hits in seven innings for the Phillies, who
improve to 82-44. Philadelphia leads the National League East by
6 1/2 games over Atlanta, which beat the Chicago Cubs 3-0.  The Mets drop to 60-67 with their fourth defeat in a row
and 16th loss in 21 games.  Verlander won his seventh consecutive start to become the
first pitcher to reach 19 wins as the Detroit Tigers beat the
Tampa Bay Rays 5-2. Verlander gave up one run and struck out
eight in seven innings at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg,
Florida, as Detroit improved to 69-58.  Detroit ’s fourth straight victory snapped a five-game
winning run for the Rays. Detroit leads the AL Central by 5 1/2
games over the Chicago White Sox, while Tampa Bay trails the
Yankees by 8 1/2 games.  Verlander came within four outs of his second no-hitter of
the season. On May 7, he became the 28th pitcher in major league
history to register two no-hit games in a career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
