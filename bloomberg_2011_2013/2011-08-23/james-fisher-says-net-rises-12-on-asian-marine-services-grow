James Fisher & Sons Plc (FSJ) , a British
shipping and services company, said first-half profit rose 12
percent as it built its marine services business in  Asia .  Net income for the six months to June 30 rose to 11.3
million pounds ($19 million) from 10.1 million pounds a year
earlier, the Barrow-in-Furness, England-based company said in a
statement. Revenue climbed 12 percent to 148 million pounds.  “We’re focused on the markets in Asia Pacific and parts of
Africa and  South America ,” Chairman Tim Harris said today in a
telephone interview. “If you go round the world and say where
are the regions that are growing fastest, those are the ones.
The reason for our growth is because we are focused on those
areas.”  The company said revenue from its defense unit rose 29
percent to 13 million pounds. In May, James Fisher won an 11
million-pound contract to modernize the Swedish Navy’s submarine
rescue vehicle.  James Fisher shares advanced 4 percent to 510 pence at the
