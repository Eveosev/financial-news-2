Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the
second-largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas company,
said its appraisal well in the West Cape Three Points Block
offshore  Ghana  has encountered crude in underground rock similar
to that in the country’s largest oil field.  The well had 108 net feet of pay and was drilled in water
3,800 feet deep, The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko said today
in a statement. Anadarko and Dallas-based Kosmos Energy Ltd.,
the operator, each have a 30.88 percent working interest in the
block. Other partners include  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  at 26.4 percent,
Sabre Oil & Gas Holdings Ltd. at 1.85 percent and Ghana National
Petroleum Corp. with a 10 percent carried interest.  “After successful appraisal, we expect the Akasa discovery
along with previous discoveries at Teak to potentially anchor an
additional development on the block,” Bob Daniels, senior vice
president for worldwide exploration at Anadarko, said today in
the statement.  The statement was released after the close of regular
trading in U.S. markets. Anadarko rose 98 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $69.80 at 4:53 p.m. in after-market trading.  The offshore Jubilee field, Ghana’s largest, will reach its
output plateau by the end of the year, Kosmos said earlier this
month.  Apache Corp. (APA)  is the largest U.S. independent oil and gas
producer by market value. Independent companies don’t own
refining, chemical or retail fuel businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
