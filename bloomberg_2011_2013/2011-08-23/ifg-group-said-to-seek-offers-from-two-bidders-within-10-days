IFG Group Plc (IFP) , which specializes in
pension advice and administration, asked two potential bidders
to make non-binding offers before its earnings release next
week, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  London-based private-equity firm Bregal Capital LLP and
Fiordland Investment Ltd., which owns 19 percent of IFG, began
due diligence on the Dublin-based company in the middle of July,
said the people, who declined to be identified as the process is
private. IFG may tell investors on Aug. 31, as it reports first-
half results, whether one, both or neither company has been
invited to table a final offer, the people said.  IFG has risen 26 percent in Dublin trading this year, making
it the fourth-best performing stock on the 51-member ISEQ Index
after the company said May 4 it received a takeover approach.
IFG Chairman Joe Moran said in June that two parties had made
“highly conditional” offers for the company, without
identifying the bidders.  Fiordland’s main shareholder, Edmund Truell, founder of
London-based Pension Corp., LLP, the British insurer of pension
fund payouts, said in an interview on June 14 that
the investment firm was also in talks to take over IFG.  Calls to Truell’s office and Bregal were not immediately
returned. A spokeswoman for IFG declined to comment on the
timetable for bids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
