Ukraine will reduce annual natural-
gas purchases from  Russia  to 12 billion cubic meters within five
years by cutting use through energy efficiency measures and
replacement with coal, Energy Minister Yuriy Boyko said.  The eastern European country also aims to boost domestic
gas production by about 35 percent to 27 billion cubic meters a
year by 2017, Boyko said in a  statement  posted on the government
website today.  Ukraine depends on Russia for more than half of its energy
needs. The nation seeks to revise a 10-year gas supply and
transit contract signed with its eastern neighbor in January
2009, after a dispute that left European customers without
deliveries for about two weeks, and reduce the price it pays for
Russian deliveries.  Ukraine plans to use about 54 billion cubic meters of gas
this year and reduce annual consumption by 8 billion to 10
billion cubic meters in 2012, the minister said. The country
imported 33 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia last year,
according to BP Plcâ€™s Statistical Review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
