BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL)  gained the most
in more than two years in Sydney trading after a large trade in
the stock attracted some investors, said  Chris Weston , an
institutional dealer at IG Markets in Melbourne.  BlueScope climbed 13 percent, the most since May 7, 2009,
to 84 Australian cents at the 4:10 p.m. close on the Australian
stock exchange. The company plunged 5.7 percent yesterday after
saying it will stop exports, shut a mill and a blast furnace and
cut about 1,000 jobs as it reported a second-half loss of A$999
million ($1 billion).  The company dropped to a low of 68.5 cents before a single
parcel of 15 million shares changed hands at 75 cents at 1:23
p.m. local time in Sydney, about 15 percent of the total number
of shares transacted today and 76 percent of the daily average.  “You won’t buy the stock when you know large funds are
still selling down their position,” even after a large drop in
the share price, Weston said by phone today. “You would only go
in when it’s over and that’s what they did when they saw that
transaction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
