British two-year  government bonds 
fell as stocks advanced and data showed U.K. mortgage approvals
and factory orders rose more than economists forecast, paring
demand for the safest assets.  Thirty-year gilts declined for the second day out of three.
The number of July mortgages granted to homebuyers to purchase
property climbed to 33,417 from a revised 32,123 in June, the
British Bankers’ Association said today, beating the forecast
for 31,750 in a Bloomberg News survey. An index of factory
orders rose from a three-month low in August and consumer-goods
manufacturers predicted a “strong rise” in output in the next
quarter, the  Confederation of British Industry  said.  “The move ties in with the general risk-appetite
scenario,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “The
data was better than expected, and that’s also in line with the
move we’ve seen in gilt yields.”  The yield on the two-year gilt rose two basis points to
0.59 percent at 4:44 p.m. in London. The 4.25 percent note
maturing in March 2013 lost 0.040, or 40 pence per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 105.975. The 10-year yield rose one basis point
to 2.40 percent, after slipping to 2.24 percent on Aug. 18, the
least since Bloomberg started collecting data on the securities
in 1989.  Britain’s benchmark stock index, the FTSE 100, gained 0.7
percent, extending yesterday’s 1.1 percent advance.  Germany ’s
benchmark DAX Index rose 1.1 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained 1.9 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.6509. It also
appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.3044 Swiss francs and depreciated
0.1 percent to 87.38 pence per euro.  The U.K. debt agency sold 1 billion pounds of inflation-
protected bonds maturing in 2022, with investors bidding 2.05
times the amount of securities on offer. The 10-year breakeven
rate, a gauge of market inflation expectation derived from the
yield difference between regular and index-linked bonds, fell
four basis points to 2.76 percentage points.  Gilts gained earlier as former Federal Reserve Chairman
 Alan Greenspan  said the 17-nation currency “is breaking down.”
U.S. central bankers, led by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , meet
this week in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  “There’s just quite a lot of uncertainty over the next few
weeks,” said Anthony O’Brien, a fixed-income strategist at
Morgan Stanley in London. “It looks like Bernanke has to pull a
surprising rabbit out of the hat to satisfy the bond markets and
equity markets alike. The economic data has been poor and we’re
just waiting to see what the policy response is.”  Gilts beat their German and U.S. counterparts this year,
handing investors a 9.1 percent return, compared with 6 percent
from German debt and 7.7 percent from Treasuries, according to
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
