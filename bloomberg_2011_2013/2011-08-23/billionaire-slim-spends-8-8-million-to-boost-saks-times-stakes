Billionaire  Carlos Slim  spent $8.8
million to boost his stakes in  Saks Inc. (SKS)  and  New York Times Co. (NYT) ,
adding to his biggest U.S. holdings as the stock market slumped
last week. Saks gained the most in almost a year.  Slim’s Inmobiliaria Carso SA investment fund bought 621,000
Saks shares on Aug. 18 for prices ranging from $7.72 to $8.01,
according to regulatory filings yesterday. The Mexican
billionaire paid $6.83 to $7.09 for 553,000 Times Co. shares the
same day.  Named the world’s richest man for a second year in a row in
March by Forbes magazine, Slim is following his long-held
strategy of adding to his investments when markets slump. Slim’s
publicly disclosed holdings are worth about $63 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those holdings have
declined by about $8.3 billion, or 12 percent, from July 29
through today, compared with a 10 percent drop in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Saks rose 66 cents, or 8.2 percent, to $8.74 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain
since September 2010. Times Co. gained 45 cents, or 6.9 percent,
to $7, also outpacing the 3.4 percent gain in the  S&P 500 .  Arturo Elias , Slim’s spokesman, didn’t return phone and e-
mail messages seeking comment.  Mexico Holdings  About 63 percent of Slim’s holdings are in America Movil
SAB, the largest mobile-phone carrier in the Americas. Most of
his publicly disclosed wealth comes from Mexican companies he
controls, including a bank, a retail chain and a construction
firm.  Slim, who had been Saks’s largest shareholder before the
purchases and last acquired the New York-based retailer’s shares
in April 2009, raised his stake to 16 percent from 15.7 percent.
The Times Co. acquisition boosted his stake in the New York
company’s Class A shares to 7.2 percent from 6.9 percent. Times
Co.’s controlling family owns most of the Class B shares, which
carry the right to elect 70 percent of the board of directors.  Saks, Slim’s biggest disclosed investment outside  Mexico ,
has fallen 18 percent this year as investors anticipate a
reduction in demand as U.S. economic growth sputters. Times Co.
has dropped 29 percent over the same span.  Slim’s Grupo Carso SAB operates two Saks stores in Mexico
City through a licensing agreement with the retailer, according
to the Mexican company’s 2010 annual report.  Slim has no similar partnership with Times Co. and has said
he is a financial investor with no desire to control the
publisher. Last month, Times Co. said it is repaying a $250
million loan granted by Slim earlier than planned.  Slim’s only other U.S. holding disclosed to regulators is a
stake of less than 1 percent in Philip Morris International
Inc., the cigarette seller on whose board he sits.  Last week, Saks posted a second-quarter loss of $8.4
million after restructuring costs, narrowing from $32.2 million
in the year-ago quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
