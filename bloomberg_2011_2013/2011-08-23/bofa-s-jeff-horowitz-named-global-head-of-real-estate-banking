Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender, named Jeffrey Horowitz global leader of the real-
estate and gaming investment-banking unit.  Horowitz has led the Americas real-estate group since 2009
and was global head of Merrill Lynch Real Estate prior to its
acquisition by Bank of America, according to a memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based company, confirmed the contents
of the memo.  Horowitz replaces Ron Sturzenegger, who was named head of
the unit managing foreclosures and soured loans last week after
Terry Laughlin was promoted to chief risk officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
