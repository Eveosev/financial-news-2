Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  is in
Tripoli and vowed to fight to the end, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, head
of the World Chess Federation and a former Russian regional
leader said in a telephone interview in Moscow today.  Ilyumzhinov, who played chess with Qaddafi during a June
visit to the Libyan capital, said he spoke with Qaddafi and his
son Mohammed by phone today at about 6 p.m. Moscow time.  “I have no plans to leave my country and I’ll fight to the
end,” Ilyumzhinov quoted Qaddafi as saying in a 90-second
conversation. Qaddafi’s son, Mohammed, called Ilyumzhinov from a
satellite phone and then handed the receiver to his father.  To contact the reporter on this story:
