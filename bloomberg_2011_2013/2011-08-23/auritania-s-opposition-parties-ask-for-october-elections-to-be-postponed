Opposition parties in Mauritania
asked for legislative and local elections set for Oct. 16 to be
postponed.  Eleven parties, including the Rassemblement des Forces
Democratiques and the Union des forces du Progres, the African
nation’s biggest opposition groups, warned that holding the vote
then may add to instability in the country, the parties said in
an e-mailed statement from Nouakchott, the capital, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
