Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS) , the
national carrier, posted a second consecutive quarterly loss in
three months ended in June as higher fuel costs eroded gains
from carrying more passengers.  The airline, based in Subang, Selagor, narrowed its loss to
527 million ringgit ($178 million) from 535 million ringgit a
year earlier, the company said in a statement to the the Kuala
Lumpur stock exchange today. Revenue rose 8.5 percent to 3.49
billion ringgit.  “Fuel costs continued to have the greatest impact to the
group’s operations,” Malaysian Air said in the statement. The
company doesn’t expect to report a profit in the second half of
the year, it said.  Malaysian Air fell 1.8 percent to 1.64 ringgit at the 5
p.m. close of trading in  Kuala Lumpur . The stock has fallen 22
percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent drop in the
benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
