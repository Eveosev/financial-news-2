U.S. stocks rallied, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up from the cheapest valuations
since 2009, as weaker-than-estimated economic data reinforced
optimism the  Federal Reserve  will act to spur growth.  Monsanto Co. (MON) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  added at
least 3 percent, pacing gains in companies most-tied to the
economy. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index rose 2.9 percent,
breaking a five-day losing streak.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  jumped 10
percent, the most since May 2010, after the Wall Street Journal
said it will start selling Apple Inc.’s iPhone. Financial shares
reversed losses after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s list
of “problem” banks shrank for the first time since 2006.  The S&P 500 rose 3.4 percent to 1,162.35 at 4 p.m. in New
York, for the biggest rally since Aug. 11. All 10 industries in
the benchmark gauge rose, with gains ranging between 1.8 percent
and 4.6 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 322.11
points, or 3 percent, to 11,176.76.  “There’s plenty of evidence that the economy has slowed,”
Kevin Caron, market strategist in Florham Park,  New Jersey , at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said in a telephone interview. His firm
has more than $115 billion in client assets. “The speculation
would be that it’s possible that the Fed will say something
designed to calm markets and provide a bit of encouragement.”  Equities advanced after the Fed Bank of Richmond’s business
activity index dropped to minus 10 in August, the weakest since
June 2009. The monthly survey of producers in the region
covering the Carolinas, Maryland, Virginia and  West Virginia 
corroborated factory reports from Philadelphia and  New York  that
pointed to weakness in the industry. Also, the Commerce
Department said sales of new U.S. homes declined more than
projected in July to the lowest level in five months.  Trillions Lost  The S&P 500 fell 16 percent from July 22 through Aug. 19 in
its biggest four-week loss since March 2009. Companies trade at
an average 11.3 times estimated earnings, near the lowest level
in 2 1/2 years. The four-week global equity rout has erased $8
trillion from share values as Europe’s debt crisis and worsening
economic reports raised concern the global economic recovery is
faltering.  Stocks briefly pared gains today after a 5.8-magnitude
earthquake in Virginia shook  Washington  and New York. More than
66 million shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges at 1:55 p.m.
New York time following the earthquake in Virginia, more than
any minute since just after the market opened at 9:30 a.m.  Central bankers from around the world meet this week in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming. During last year’s conference, Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled a second round of asset
purchases, known as QE2, that buoyed asset markets. The  S&P 500 
rose 28 percent between Aug. 26, 2010, and Feb. 18 after he
foreshadowed the $600 billion Treasury program.  ‘Some Pressure’  Bernanke “probably feels some pressure from the stock
market to respond,” Howard F. Ward, a  money manager  at Mario
Gabelli’s Gamco Investors Inc., said on Bloomberg Television’s
“InsideTrack” with Deirdre Bolton and Erik Schatzker. “He
should lay out a game plan of what he can do should the economic
outlook warrant that.”  Companies whose earnings depend on economic growth,
including energy, technology, consumer and industrial shares,
had the biggest gains in the S&P 500 among 10 industries, rising
at least 3.5 percent. Monsanto rallied 5.9 percent to $69.12.
Chevron gained 4.3 percent to $97.33. Microsoft added 3.1
percent to $24.72.  Sprint surged 10 percent, the most since May 2010, to
$3.59. The Wall Street Journal said the third-largest U.S.
mobile-phone carrier will start selling the iPhone 5 in October.  Financial Shares Rebound  Financial shares in the S&P 500 reversed a 1.3 percent
loss, rising 3.2 percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  fell 1.9 percent
to $6.30. The lender that lost half its market value this year
has sufficient capital to weather mounting costs tied to souring
loans, said  Richard Bove , an analyst at Rochdale Securities.  “Bank of America has so much cash on its balance sheet
that it could pay back all of its short-term debt and a big
chunk of its long-term debt,” Bove said in an interview today
on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.”
“There’s no reason for the bank to have to go out and raise
capital whatsoever.”  Financial institutions in the S&P 500 tumbled 25 percent in
2011 through yesterday, the most among 10 groups, amid
speculation the government debt crisis in  Europe  will spur
banking losses. The industry has the second-biggest weighting in
the benchmark measure of U.S. shares at 14 percent.  Bear Market  The S&P 500 fell 18 percent from an almost three-year high
on April 29 through Aug. 8 amid concern Europe’s debt crisis and
a downgrade of the nation’s credit rating by S&P would hurt the
economy. The benchmark gauge closed as low as 1,119.46 on Aug.
8, within 29 points of a bear market, or 20 percent drop.  U.S. stocks are cheap after suffering the biggest losses
since March 2009, said  Byron Wien , a senior managing director at
Blackstone Group LP, the world’s biggest private equity firm.  “You got the market down to 11 times earnings,” Wien said
in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with
 Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “Usually it sells at around 15. That
makes a number of stocks attractive here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
