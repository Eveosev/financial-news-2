Icelandic voters will vote on
whether the north Atlantic island should join the European Union
in early 2013 as the country seeks to speed up accession talks,
Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said in an interview with
broadcaster  Channel 2 .  Iceland has told the bloc’s Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule it “wants to speed up the accession talks and begin”
negotiations on agriculture and fisheries, Skarphedinsson told
the broadcaster. “We would prefer that the negotiations would
be concluded with a powerful presentation and a national
referendum prior to the next parliamentary elections.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
