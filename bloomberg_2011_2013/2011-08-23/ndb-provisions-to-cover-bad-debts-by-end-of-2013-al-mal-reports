National Development Bank, the
Cairo-based unit of  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB) , plans to make
sufficient provisions to cover non-performing loans by the end
of 2013,  Al Mal  reported.  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, which inherited 5 billion Egyptian
pounds of bad loans when it bought NDB in 2007, has made
provisions covering 75 percent of the amount so far, the
newspaper said, citing Niveen Lotfi, NDBâ€™s interim chairwoman
and chief executive officer. The lender also plans to spend 250
million pounds to remodel its branches in Egypt next year,  Al
Mal  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
