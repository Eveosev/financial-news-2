Croatia  and  Slovenia  completed a
panel of legal experts to work out a resolution to a border
dispute between the two former Yugoslav republics and help
Slovenia to ratify Croatia’s European Union membership.  The authorities in international law will study the issue
over the next 12 months and make recommendations to settle land
and maritime counter-claims at the Istrian peninsula, Croatian
Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  told reporters in Zagreb today.
The panel, which already included Budislav Vukas of Croatia and
Jernej Sekolec of Slovenia, will also have Bruno Simma of
 Germany , Vaughan Lowe of Britain and France’s Gilbert Guillaume,
who will lead the panel.  Slovenia, an EU member since 2004, stalled Croatia’s bid to
join the bloc for 10 months in 2009 before leaders agreed to
solve the disagreement that has lasted since the breakup of
 Yugoslavia  about two decades ago. Croatia finished EU talks in
June and will hold a Jan. 22 vote on its planned July 2013
entry. It also needs the approval of all 27 member nations.  “We succeeded in quickly agreeing with the Slovenian side,
and now we can be reasonably optimistic,” Milanovic said.
Slovenia’s ratification “was never in question, and we have
reasons to believe in our neighborly relations.”  Outgoing Slovenian Premier Borut Pahor said in Ljubljana
today that the conditions are met for the EU-sponsored tribunal,
whose decision will be binding, to begin deliberations.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
