Cyprus needs laws that will give
legal protection to unmarried gay and heterosexual couples
living together,  Phileleftheros  reported today, citing
ombudswoman Eliza Savvidou.  The need to modernize legislation arises from rulings of
the  European Court of Human Rights  and the European Union, the
Nicosia-based newspaper said, citing Savvidou.  To contact the reporter on this story:
