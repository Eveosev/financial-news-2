Spanish  home prices  fell for the
13th quarter as the economy probably contracted and an increase
in bad loans discouraged lenders from granting mortgages.  The average price of houses and apartments declined 6.8
percent in the three months through December from a year
earlier, the Ministry of Public Works said today on its website.
Prices dropped 1.5 percent from the previous quarter, the 15th
quarterly decline.  Residential mortgage lending in  Spain , which has the
highest  unemployment  rate in the European Union, fell by 43.6
percent in October as banks reined in lending amid a surge in
borrowing costs and bad loans, the National Statistics Institute
said on Dec. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
