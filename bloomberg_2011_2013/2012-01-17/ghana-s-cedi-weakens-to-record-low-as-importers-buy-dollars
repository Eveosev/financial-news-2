Ghana ’s cedi, the world’s third-
worst performing currency against the dollar this year, weakened
to the lowest on record as companies bought the U.S. currency
to pay for imports.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 1 percent to 1.7335 per dollar as of 11:05 a.m. in
Accra, the capital. A close at this level will be the lowest
since May 1994 when Bloomberg began compiling data. The cedi has
depreciated 5.4 percent this year.  “We are seeing strong dollar demand from the commerce and
manufacturing industry, most I believe are built up from last
year,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the Ghanaian unit of
Barclays Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview. “With time we
hope to see mining companies and non-governmental organizations
sell dollars on the market.”  The cedi may strengthen to 1.69 per dollar this week as
companies receive funds from abroad to finance their operations
in the country, Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at the
Ghanaian unit of Access Bank Plc, said by phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
