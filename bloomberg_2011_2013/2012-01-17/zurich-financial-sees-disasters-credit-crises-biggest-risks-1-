Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN)  Chief
Investment Officer Cecilia Reyes said income from bond
investments will stay “low for years to come” as central banks
keep borrowing costs near zero to help bolster their economies.  “It will be a challenge to meet our investment-income
targets if the low level persists,” constraining insurers’
ability to meet minimum guarantees in some life products, Reyes
said in an interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland today. “At the same time, we have volatility in
markets. Our focus is on keeping the balance sheet very
strong.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve said yesterday that the benchmark
rate would stay at low until at least late 2014, longer than
originally forecast. Insurers are among the world’s biggest
investors, and are hurt when low rates reduce the yield on new
government debt.  Reyes became chief investment officer of  Switzerland ’s
biggest insurer in 2010, when her predecessor Martin Senn took
the helm at the company.  Reyes said the  European Central Bank  should do more to help
stem the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “We need a more overt role for the ECB to also support the
sovereign-debt market and try and eliminate the default risk,”
she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
