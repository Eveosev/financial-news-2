The fee paid to borrow copper for
next-day delivery on the London Metal Exchange rose to the
highest level since Jan. 6 as investors closed out bets on
falling prices before tomorrow.  The so-called tom-next spread climbed as high as a premium
of $1 a metric ton today, compared with discounts of $1
yesterday and $5 on Jan. 12, figures from the exchange show. A
higher fee usually signals tighter supply. LME rules oblige
holders of contracts to advise sellers by each month’s third
Wednesday how they wish to settle the positions.  “This is small, residual technical tightness before the
third Wednesday prompt date,” said Andrew Silver, a London-
based trader at Natixis Commodity Market Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
