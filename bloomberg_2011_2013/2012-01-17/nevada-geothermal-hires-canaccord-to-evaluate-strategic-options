Nevada Geothermal Power Inc. (NGP) , the
clean-energy company that received U.S. backing for a $98.5
million loan, hired Canaccord Genuity Corp. to evaluate its
“strategic alternatives.”  Canaccord will help restructure “mezzanine debt and in the
recapitalization of the company,” Vancouver-based  Nevada 
Geothermal said today in a statement.  A program to slow temperature declines and increase power
production at the company’s 49.5-megawatt Blue Mountain Faulkner
1 plant in Humboldt County, Nevada, began last year and is
nearly complete.  The U.S. Energy Department guaranteed 80 percent of the
$98.5 million loan that Nevada Geothermal received in 2010.
 Solyndra LLC (SOLY) , a solar-panel maker that filed for bankruptcy in
September, got a $535 million guarantee through the same
program.  Nevada Geothermal  rose  14 percent to 8 Canadian cents at
the close in Toronto. It has fallen 89 percent over the last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
