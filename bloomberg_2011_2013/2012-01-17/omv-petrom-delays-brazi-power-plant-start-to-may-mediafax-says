Romania â€™s biggest oil company  OMV
Petrom SA (SNP)  delayed the start of commercial operations at its
Brazi power plant by six months because of malfunctions,
 Mediafax  reported today, citing unidentified energy industry
officials.  The Brazi gas-fired power plant, which was scheduled to
begin electricity production and sales in December after a 500
million-euro ($639 million) investment, will start operations in
May, the Bucharest-based news service said.  Petrom officials were not immediately available for
comment, when contacted by phone by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
