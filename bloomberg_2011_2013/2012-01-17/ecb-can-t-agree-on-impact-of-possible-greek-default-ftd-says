The European Central Bank’s
Governing Council can’t agree how a possible default by  Greece 
would affect the bank’s Greek bond holdings, the Financial Times
Deutschland  reported , without saying how it got the information.  ECB Council members debated the matter at their last
meeting on Jan. 12 and failed to agree on whether the central
bank would be affected if the Greek government forces its
bondholders to take losses, the Germany-based newspaper said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
