Seat Pagine Gialle SpA (PG) ,  Italy ’s
largest phone-book publisher, said it will present a final
proposal for the company’s debt reorganization to all parties by
the end of January.  Seat Pagine’s board will meet by the end of this month to
approve the terms and conditions of the proposal to be submitted
to all lenders, Turin-based Seat Pagine said in a stock-exchange
statement today. It will take into account Seat Pagine’s revised
strategic guidelines and a technical review of the consensus
thresholds required for the various categories of creditors.  The company, who’s including senior bondholders in the
negotiations, said it hasn’t reached sufficient acceptance for
the current debt proposal.  The board will give a deadline for acceptance of the
proposal, it said. In the absence of an accord, the date won’t
be extended further, it said. If an accord isn’t reached, the
company may file for special administration, it said.  “Negotiations will be monitored closely in order to be in
a position to promptly take any measures required to commence
the procedures set forth by the law if the proposal is not
accepted,” Seat Pagine said in the statement. Preliminary
contacts with the Ministry for  Economic Development  were
initiated, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
