Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO) ,
producer of the “Grand Theft Auto” games, will postpone the
introduction of “Max Payne 3” by two months, which may result
in a loss for fiscal 2012, the company said in a filing.  Take-Two, based in New York, said it expects to begin
selling the game in May instead of March. The change may reduce
fiscal 2012 revenue by $210 million to $230 million and net
income by 60 cents to 70 cents a share, according to the filing.
Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had  projected  $1 billion in sales
and profit of 10 cents a share.  “With ‘Max Payne 3’ now slated for May, our robust lineup
of upcoming releases for fiscal 2013 is even stronger,” Chief
Executive Officer Strauss Zelnick said in the filing. “Fiscal
2013 is poised to be one of our best years ever.” He projected
profit of more than $2 a share for the period, which starts in
April.  Investors are more focused on Take-Two’s pipeline for 2013
than any impact the game’s later introduction may have on 2012,
said Atul Bagga, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets, who has a
“neutral”  rating  on the shares.  “A delay of ‘Max Payne 3,’ it’s not that big a surprise,”
Bagga said in a telephone interview. “It’s mostly a shift and
not really a big negative for Take-Two.”  The company said it expects to update its outlook when it
reports third-quarter earnings on Feb. 2.  Take-Two rose 2.2 percent to $14.82 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  gained 10 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
