Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  was accused in a
lawsuit by a customer of its Zappos.com unit of violating
federal consumer credit laws by failing to protect her personal
information after the company said hackers stole account numbers
and other data.  Theresa Stevens, a resident of Beaumont,  Texas , said that
as a result of the breach, she and other Zappos customers are
more likely to receive e-mails from spoof websites and
unknowingly give away personal information to hackers, according
to her complaint filed Jan. 16 in federal court in Louisville,
Kentucky. The customers will also incur expenses for credit
monitoring and suffer emotional distress and loss of privacy,
according to the complaint.  Stevens seeks to represent 24 million Zappos customers
whose personal information was compromised, according to the
complaint. She received an e-mail from the online shoe retailer
Jan. 16 saying her information was stolen as part of a data
breach. Hackers gained access to Zappos.com’s internal network
through unprotected computer servers located in Shepherdsville,
 Kentucky , according to the complaint.  Stevens seeks unspecified damages and a court order
requiring Amazon.com to pay for credit monitoring and identity
theft insurance. Drew Herdener, a spokesman for Seattle-based
Amazon, didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking
comment yesterday about the lawsuit.  The case is Stevens v. Amazon.com, 12-cv-00032, U.S.
District Court, Western District of Kentucky (Louisville).  To contact the reporter on this story:
