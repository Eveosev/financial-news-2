SunEdison, the solar development
unit of  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , said it plans to build
solar  power plants  in  Japan  over a five-year period at an
initial cost of 350 billion yen ($4.6 billion).  The second-largest U.S. maker of polysilicon is in talks
with local governments including Niigata and Fukuoka prefectures
on project sites, Jackie Okawa, a spokeswoman for SunEdison
Japan Corp., said today by phone from Osaka. Capacity will total
1 gigawatt, she said, confirming a report by the Nikkei.  Japan’s parliament passed a bill in August guaranteeing
prices higher than market rates for wind, solar and geothermal
energy to encourage renewable-energy development and rely less
on nuclear energy following the Fukushima Dai-Ichi disaster in
March. Similar legislation in  Germany  and Spain has spurred
solar companies to install panels.  While Japan’s incentive program is due to start in July,
the government hasn’t set the prices. “We can’t start building
plants until rates are set, as we can’t calculate project
costs,” Okawa said.  Local projects would be profitable should prices be set at
32 yen a kilowatt-hour, the Nikkei newspaper reported. Okawa
declined to elaborate on prices.  Japan’s cumulative installed solar power capacity exceeded
3.6 gigawatts in 2010, and households accounted more than 80
percent of its market, according to the  International Energy
Agency.   To contact the reporter on this story:
