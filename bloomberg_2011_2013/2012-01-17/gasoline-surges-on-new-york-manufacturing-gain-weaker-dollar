Gasoline futures rose the most in
four weeks as manufacturing in the  New York  region expanded in
January at the fastest pace in nine months and the euro gained
against the dollar.  Futures advanced as much as 2.7 percent as the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic  index  climbed to
13.5, the highest level since April. The euro gained as an index
measuring German investor confidence rose.  “The dollar is under pressure, the Empire state numbers
came out pretty well and the German index improved,” said  Gene
McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 4.39 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.7781 a gallon at 9:37 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after touching $2.8081.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, surged
to minus 21.6 from minus 53.8 in December. The gain is the
biggest since ZEW started the index two decades ago.  The report, combined with lower borrowing costs at auctions
for Spain and  Greece , sent the euro up 0.5 percent against the
dollar at 9:46 a.m. in New York. A weaker dollar increases the
investment appeal of commodities.  Futures also gained as  China’s economy  expanded at the
slowest pace in 10 quarters after Europe’s debt crisis curbed
export demand and the  property market  weakened, sustaining
pressure on Premier Wen Jiabao to ease monetary policy. Gross
domestic product rose 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Beijing today.  “There’s the idea that China might be slowing and there
might be easing down the road,” McGillian said.  February-delivery heating oil increased 1.42 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.0414 a gallon on the exchange, after touching
$3.0937.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.6
cent to $3.381 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
