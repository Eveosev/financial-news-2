Asian currencies advanced the most
in a week as data showed  China ’s economy expanded faster than
expected in the fourth quarter, easing concern a marked slowdown
would damp the region’s export outlook.  Gross domestic product in Asia’s largest economy rose 8.9
percent, the statistics bureau said today, beating the median
forecast for 8.7 percent in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Growth was the slowest in 10 quarters, which may prompt China to
ease monetary policy. Today’s data could induce further cuts to
banks’ reserve-requirement ratios, according to Henderson Global
Investors Ltd. Currencies opened higher after  France ’s borrowing
costs fell at a debt sale yesterday, tempering concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis is worsening.  “Policy makers now have more room to drive growth by
loosening monetary policy,” said Caroline Maurer, a Singapore-
based  fund manager  at Henderson, which managed $100 billion of
assets as of Sept. 30. “China demand is now very important for
the Asian region.”  India’s rupee led gains, strengthening 0.9 percent to
50.945 per dollar as of 1:34 p.m. in Mumbai. South Korea’s won
climbed 0.8 percent to 1,145.40 and the  Thai baht  added 0.4
percent to 31.79. The yuan gained 0.05 percent to 6.3133, after
being down as much as 0.10 percent before the GDP report.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.3
percent, the most since Jan. 10. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
 stocks  rallied 2 percent, following gains in European shares,
even after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the top ratings of France,
Austria and the European Financial Stability Fund.  No Hard Landing  Other official reports from China today showed industrial
production rose 12.8 percent in December from a year earlier,
beating the median forecast for a 12.3 percent gain in a
Bloomberg survey. Growth in retail sales reached 18.1 percent,
exceeding the consensus for a 17.2 percent increase. China’s
central bank cut lenders’ reserve ratios on Dec. 5 for the first
time since 2008. Inflation last month was 4.1 percent, the
slowest in 15 months.  “The better-than-expected GDP figures have eased the fear
of a potential hard landing in China,” said  Daniel Chan , chief
economist at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “However, a
slowdown in  China’s economy  is inevitably on the way. Investors
will remain cautious over export prospects as Europe’s debt
crisis is yet to be solved.”  Philippine Rate Cut  The Philippine peso strengthened 0.6 percent to 43.625,
touching the strongest level in two weeks, ahead of a review of
borrowing costs on Jan. 19. Thirteen of 17 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will cut its
overnight rate by 25 basis points to  4.25 percent . Four expect
no change.  “Financial markets are supported by expectations of
manageable inflation and a central bank rate cut this week,”
said Raul Tan, head of the balance-sheet segment in the treasury
group at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila .  Singapore ’s dollar advanced 0.7 percent to S$1.2836 versus
its U.S. counterpart after non-oil domestic exports jumped 9
percent in December from a year earlier, compared with the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a 1.2 percent decrease.
A surge in pharmaceutical overseas sales, offset a slump in
electronics shipments.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit gained 0.5 percent to 3.1245
per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Taiwan’s
dollar rose 0.3 percent to NT$29.995, while Indonesia’s rupiah
weakened 0.7 percent to 9,193.  To contact the reporters on this story:
