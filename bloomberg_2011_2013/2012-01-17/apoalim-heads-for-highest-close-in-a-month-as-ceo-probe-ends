Bank Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI)  headed for the
highest close in almost a month after prosecutors ended a
criminal investigation against the chief executive officer of
Israelâ€™s second-largest bank by assets.  The  shares  advanced 2.2 percent to 13.21 shekels at 1:50
p.m. in  Tel Aviv , poised for the highest close since Dec. 20.  Prosecutors ended the probe against CEO Zion Kenan, citing
a lack of evidence, the Justice Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
