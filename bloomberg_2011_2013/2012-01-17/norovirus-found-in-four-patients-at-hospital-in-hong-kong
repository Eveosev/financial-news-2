Four patients have tested positive
for  Norovirus  at a hospital in  Hong Kong , according to a
statement from the regionâ€™s Hospital Authority.  Admission and discharge have been suspended at the ward at
the hospital where the patients were, according to the
statement. The four patients have been transferred to another
hospital for treatment under isolation and are in stable
condition. Test results are pending for an additional patient
who has presented symptoms matching Norovirus infection.  Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause acute
gastroenteritis in humans and spread from person to person,
through contaminated food or water and by touching contaminated
surfaces, according to the Atlanta-based Centers For Disease
