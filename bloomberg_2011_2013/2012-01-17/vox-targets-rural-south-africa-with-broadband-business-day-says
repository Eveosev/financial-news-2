Vox Telecom Ltd. (VIX)  plans to offer low-
cost Internet broadband services to remote areas not covered by
traditional telecommunications infrastructure using a satellite
to be launched by Yahsat next month, Business Day reported,
citing Vox product manager Jacques Visser.  Vox signed an agreement with Yahsat, a subsidiary of Abu
Dhabi government-owned Mubadala Development Co., to sell
capacity and market the satellite in  South Africa , the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said. It aims to start the service
in June and expects 40,000 subscribers within three years,
