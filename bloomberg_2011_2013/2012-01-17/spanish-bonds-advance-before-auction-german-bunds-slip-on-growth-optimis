Spanish (GSPG10YR)  and Italian bonds rose for a
second day as borrowing costs fell at government bill sales from
Belgium to  Greece , easing concern that credit downgrades will
drive up  Europe ’s debt yields.  German 10-year bunds dropped after a report showed investor
confidence in Europe’s largest economy jumped the most on record
this month, damping demand for safer assets. The European
Financial Stability Facility’s 2.75 percent notes due in July
2016 fell as the euro-area bailout fund sold shorter-maturity
debt after losing its top  credit rating  at Standard & Poor’s
yesterday. S&P cut Spain’s rank by two levels on Jan. 13.  “The sound domestic bid in short-dated Spanish and Italian
paper continues, and even starts to move further out the
curve,” said Norbert Aul, a fixed-income strategist at  RBC
Capital Markets  in  London . “Markets have come back from the
risk-averse move during Friday’s trading session in the run up
to the downgrades.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.13 percent at 5 p.m. London time. The 5.5
percent security due April 2021 rose 0.37, or 3.70 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,273) face amount, to 102.62. The two-year yield
dropped three basis points to 2.97 percent.  The country paid an average 2.049 percent to sell 12-month
debt today down from 4.05 percent on Dec. 13. It sold 18-month
paper at 2.399 percent, versus 4.226 percent last month.
Borrowing costs also fell as Greece auctioned 1.625 billion
euros of 91-day bills.  Belgium  sold 2.96 billion euros of three-
month and 12-month bills.  ‘A Relief’  Italian 10-year yields slid 12 basis points to 6.5 percent,
reducing the extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of German bunds by 14 basis points to 471 basis points.  “In the wake of S&P’s downgrade actions across most of the
euro area, the auction results will come as a relief to the
market and add evidence to the view that investors were already
pricing in a wide round of rating cuts to a large degree,”
Sercan Eraslan, a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in
Dusseldorf, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Germany ’s 10-year yield rose two basis points to 1.79
percent, while two-year rates increased three basis points to
0.18 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
index of German investor and analyst  expectations , which aims to
predict economic developments six months in advance, surged to
minus 21.6 from minus 53.8 in December. The gain was the biggest
since ZEW started the index in December 1991.  EFSF Auction  The EFSF, which had its rating cut to AA+ from AAA by S&P,
got bids for 4.66 billion euros of 182-day bills, compared with
a 1.5 billion-euro sales target, the Bundesbank said today in a
statement. The auction drew an average yield of 0.2664 percent.  The yield on the EFSF securities due July 2016 increased
eight basis points to 2.15 percent.  Greek bonds rose for a sixth day as Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  prepared to meet with a group representing private
bondholders tomorrow to resume negotiations to cut the nation’s
debt burden. The country’s official creditors begin talks Jan.
20 on spending and budget cuts that will determine whether to
disburse additional aid.  Yields fell even after  Fitch Ratings  said the country is
insolvent. The euro-area’s most indebted country is unlikely to
be able to honor a March 20 bond payment of 14.5 billion euros,
Managing Director  Edward Parker  said today in  Stockholm . Efforts
to arrange a private-sector deal on how to handle Greece’s
obligations would constitute a default, he said.  Sixth Day  The yield on Greek bonds maturing in October 2022 fell 20
basis points to 33.81 percent, after reaching 33.54 percent, the
lowest level since Dec. 7. The price rose to 20.9 percent of
face value.  Portuguese bonds gained for the first time in three days.
Two-year yields dropped 65 basis points to 15.13 percent, and
10-year yields declined 16 basis points to 14.25 percent. The
price on the 10-year security stayed below 50 percent of face
value for a second day.  Portugal  is due to auction as much as 2.5 billion euros of
three-, six- and 11-month bills tomorrow.  Spain  and  France  will
sell notes and bonds the following day.  German bunds have returned 0.4 percent this year, after
gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. French bonds have returned 0.5 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
