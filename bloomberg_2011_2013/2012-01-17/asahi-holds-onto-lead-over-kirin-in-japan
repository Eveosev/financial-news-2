Asahi Breweries Ltd. (2502)  maintained its
position as Japan’s biggest beermaker last year, widening its
market-share advantage over  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  as demand in the
nation fell for a seventh straight year.  Asahi had a 37.9 percent share of shipments for standard,
low-malt and no-malt beer last year, ahead of Kirin’s 36.2
percent, the Tokyo-based brewers said today in separate
statements. Industrywide sales dropped 3.7 percent to 442
million cases, the lowest level since records began in 1992.  Kirin’s 2011 share dropped from 36.7 percent in 2010, as
Japan’s strongest earthquake on record, ensuing tsunami and
nuclear accident disrupted beer production. Sales of its
“Ichiban-Shibori” brand fell 2.1 percent last year. Asahi said
demand for its “Super Dry” and “Clear Asahi” brands helped
the company maintain its market share.  Asahi and Kirin forecast beer demand in their home market
will drop by 1 percent to 2 percent this year, while  Suntory
Holdings Ltd. (SUNTZ)  predicts a 3 percent decline as the population
ages and shrinks.  Suntory’s share in 2011 was 13.3 percent, the highest on
record for the company. Sapporo’s was 11.6 percent.  Asahi rose 0.6 percent to 1,726 yen as of 10:39 a.m. in
Tokyo trading. Kirin gained 0.6 percent and Sapporo rose 0.7
percent.  A case of beer in  Japan  is equivalent to 12.66 liters (3.3
gallons).  To contact the reporter on this story:
