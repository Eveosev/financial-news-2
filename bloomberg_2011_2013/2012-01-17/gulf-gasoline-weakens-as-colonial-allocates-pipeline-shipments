Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  gasoline weakened for the
first time in six days as Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated
shipments on the largest pipeline link between that region and
U.S. Northeast markets.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf widened 0.75 cent to 1.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded at 12:21 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
1.78 cents to $2.742.  Colonial allocated shipments for cycle 6 on Line 1 and Line
2, mainlines for moving gasoline and distillate fuel,
respectively, according to a notice to shippers yesterday. Both
were allocated for the previous cycle.  Colonial’s system delivers more than 2 million barrels a
day of gasoline, diesel, home heating oil and other refined
products through 5,519 miles (8,882 kilometers) of pipelines
across the southern and eastern U.S., according to the company’s
website.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
