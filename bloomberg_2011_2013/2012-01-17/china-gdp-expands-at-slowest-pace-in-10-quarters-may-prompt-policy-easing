China’s economy  expanded at the
slowest pace in 10 quarters as  Europe ’s debt crisis curbed
export demand and the  property market  weakened, sustaining
pressure on Premier  Wen Jiabao  to ease monetary policy.  Gross domestic product rose 8.9 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in
Beijing today. Growth exceeded the 8.7 percent  median  of 26
estimates in a Bloomberg survey, staying above the 8 percent
that signals a “soft landing” for China, according to SinoPac
Financial Holdings Co., which correctly predicted the GDP number.  Asian stocks rose on speculation policy makers will ease
lending curbs and increase fiscal spending to bolster the
world’s second-biggest economy. Liang Wengen, China’s richest
man and chairman of Sany Heavy Industry Co., told Wen this month
that construction-machinery demand is weak and called for more
infrastructure investment.  “Decelerating GDP growth will provide more room for policy
makers to shift towards a pro-growth bias after an extended
tightening cycle,”  Jing Ulrich , chairman of global markets for
China at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note after the data.
“At this juncture, the challenge for policy makers is to
implement measures that boost domestic demand without setting
back progress made in curbing inflation.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 4.2 percent today, the
most since October 2009, on expectations for more monetary
easing and on speculation the government will support equities.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 2 percent at 5:14 p.m. in
 Tokyo .  Property Meltdown Risk  Full-year economic growth slowed to 9.2 percent from 10.4
percent in 2010, today’s report showed. Industrial production
increased 12.8 percent in December from a year earlier, more
than the median estimate of 12.3 percent in a Bloomberg survey
and a 12.4 percent increase in November. The economy grew 2
percent last quarter from the previous three months, when it
expanded 2.3 percent.  China is prepared for a slowdown in economic growth and a
mild moderation is “desirable,”  Ma Jiantang , head of the
statistics bureau, said at a briefing today. The government has
set a target of 7 percent annual expansion for the current five-
year plan that runs through 2015 and will focus more on the
quality of growth, he said.  “The data confirmed no hard landing is likely, more so
given the loosening stance already adopted by the policy
makers,” said Shen Jianguang, Hong Kong-based chief greater
China economist for Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. Still, there is
“no room for complacency, given the risks of a property sector
meltdown and global crises,” said Shen, who expects further
relaxation in credit, an expansionary fiscal policy and
loosening in the property sector in the second quarter.  Home Sales  China ’s home sales rose at the slowest pace in three years
in 2011, data from the statistics bureau today showed, after the
government extended measures to control property prices.
Mizuho’s property analyst Alan Jin expects the data to worsen in
the next two quarters because developers are short of capital.  The yuan, which was little changed today, dropped the most
in more than two months yesterday after  Standard & Poor’s 
stripped France of its top  credit rating  and downgraded eight
other euro-area nations.  In  New Zealand , reports today showed business confidence
and  consumer spending  weakened in the final months of 2011,
bolstering the case for central bank Governor Alan Bollard to
delay raising  interest rates  until the second half of this year.  Economy Picking Up  Singapore’s exports unexpectedly rose in December as
pharmaceutical shipments countered a drop in sales of
electronics goods and the city state lured fixed-asset
investment of about $S13.7 billion ($10.7 billion) last year,
reports today showed.  Japan ’s government maintained its assessment that the
economy is still picking up from the March earthquake, with
exports weakening recently because of slower global growth.  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s Empire
State manufacturing index rose to an eight-month high of 11 in
January, based on a Bloomberg News survey of economists before
the report today. Inflation in the euro area and the U.K. may
have risen at a slower pace in December from a year earlier,
separate surveys showed.  Banks including BNP Paribas SA, Nomura Holdings Inc. and
UBS AG forecast weaker economic expansion in China this quarter
as overseas sales moderate further and government measures to
rein in property prices hurt demand for goods including steel,
cement and home appliances.  Stimulus Policies  “Amid a slowdown of both domestic and external economies,
the government will continue to roll out stimulus policies,”
said Sylvia Chiu, an economist at SinoPac Financial in Taipei
who was the only analyst in the Bloomberg survey to predict
today’s GDP number. She expects China’s growth to slow to 8.6
percent in 2012.  Chiu says reserve requirement ratios will drop to 19
percent by the end of 2012 and sees the benchmark one-year
lending rate at 6.06 percent. The reserve ratio is currently 21
percent for the biggest banks and borrowing costs are 6.56
percent.  Sany’s Liang, who topped Forbes  Asia ’s 2011 China rich list
with an estimated wealth of $9.3 billion, was among business
leaders who met Wen during his visit to  Hunan province  earlier
this month. Zhan Chunxin, chairman of competitor Zoomlion Heavy
Industry Science & Technology Co., who was also at the meeting,
complained a lack of access to credit was hurting customers and
suppliers.  Encourage Lending  Fixed-asset investment  excluding rural households expanded
23.8 percent last year, compared with the median 24.1 percent
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Retail sales rose 18.1 percent
in December from a year earlier, today’s report showed.  The People’s Bank of China last month allowed banks to set
aside less of their deposits as reserves and December’s new
loans were the highest since April, signs the government is
loosening monetary policy to encourage lending even as it
maintains curbs on the residential real-estate market to bring
down  home prices .  The PBOC halted sales of bills and repurchase contracts at
the end of December to add funds to the financial system before
the Lunar New Year holiday that starts Jan. 23. It will inject
more cash through 14-day reverse repurchase operations today and
Jan. 19, two traders who declined to be identified said
yesterday, after the  seven-day repurchase rate , which measures
interbank funding availability, surged to the highest since July.  “The economic data is almost in line and haven’t gone
beyond the intolerable level of the government,” said Dai Ming,
a  fund manager  at Shanghai Kingsun Investment Management &
Consulting Co. “Further monetary policy easing may be pushed
back a bit until next month as policy makers are still concerned
about a comeback in inflation.”  Consumer-price gains averaged 5.4 percent last year,
exceeding the government’s 4 percent target every month, even as
the pace slowed to 4.1 percent in December from a year earlier.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
