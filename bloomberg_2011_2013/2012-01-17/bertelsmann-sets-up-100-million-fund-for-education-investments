Bertelsmann AG (BTG) ,  Europe ’s largest
media company, set up a fund of more than $100 million with co-
investors to expand in the European and U.S. private-education
markets.  The University Ventures Fund I will develop and offer
higher-education programs, in partnership with “leading
universities,” the Guetersloh, Germany-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. Bertelsmann is contributing $50
million and may also make “targeted direct investments” as
part of the venture.  Bertelsmann Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Rabe (BTG) , who took
over from Hartmut Ostrowski on Jan. 1, is accelerating a drive
into growth markets including digital publishing and e-commerce
as well as emerging economies. The company already invests in
education via two funds, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments
and Bertelsmann Asia Investments.  “Education in general, and services for educational
providers in particular, represent a promising and custom-made
opportunity for a global media and services company like
Bertelsmann,” Rabe said in today’s statement. The company
“deliberately opted for an entrepreneurial concept that relies
on building the business gradually.”  One of the co-investors is University of Texas Investment
Management Co., Bertelsmann said. Initial investments include a
deal with Brandman University in  California  and with the Chapman
University System, which provides education to working adults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
