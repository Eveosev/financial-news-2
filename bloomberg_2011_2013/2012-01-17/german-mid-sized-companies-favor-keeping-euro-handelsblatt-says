The majority of mid-sized companies
in Germany want to keep the euro, Handelsblatt reported, citing
industry association leaders.  A German exit from the common currency would reduce
exports, said Michael Huether, the director of the IW economic
institute in Cologne, according to the newspaper. It would also
put a strain on banks, disrupting the flow of money in the euro
area, Handelsblatt cited him as saying.  About 46 percent of German chemical exports go to euro-
member countries, said Utz Tillmann, the president of the the
German association of the  chemical industry , according to
Handelsblatt.  The criticism followed comments by  Linde AG (LIN)  CEO Wolfgang Reitzle in a Spiegel interview last weekend that the euro
shouldnâ€™t be saved at all costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
