Afren Plc (AFR) , the U.K. oil and gas
explorer focused on  Africa  and  Iraqi Kurdistan , rose to a five-
month high in London trading after saying it found oil and gas
at the Okoro East exploration well off southeast  Nigeria .  Afren rose as much as 15 percent to the highest level since
Aug. 4. It discovered 549 feet (167 meters) of so-called net oil
pay and 41 feet of net gas pay in “excellent quality reservoir
sands,” the London-based company said today in a statement. Its
well was drilled to a total depth of 8,751 feet, it said.  “The well has successfully encountered oil in the Tertiary
reservoir sands equivalent to those that have been developed and
are in production at the Okoro main field,” the company said.
“The discovery of significant pay in the previously unexplored
deeper zones opens up further prospectivity at similar levels on
the main Okoro field and elsewhere on the block.”  The company rose 15.5 pence to 130.5 pence by 8:36 a.m. in
London trading, bringing the year’s gain to 52 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
