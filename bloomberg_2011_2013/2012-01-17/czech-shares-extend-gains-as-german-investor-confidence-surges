Czech shares extended gains, led by
 Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  and  Komercni Banka (KOMB)  AS, after an index of
investor confidence in  Germany , the biggest market for Czech
exports, jumped the most on record.  Austriaâ€™s Erste increased 3.1 percent to 347.7 koruna by
11:32 a.m. in Prague. Komercni Banka, the Czech unit of Societe
Generale SA, rose 2.6 percent to 3,379 koruna. The PX equity
gauge, where the two banks have a combined 35 percent weighting,
added 1.3 percent to 906.9, poised for a two-week high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
