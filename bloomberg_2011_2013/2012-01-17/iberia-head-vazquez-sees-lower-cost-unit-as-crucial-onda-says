Spanish airline  Iberia (IAG)  needs to
continue with its plans to start a lower-cost unit in order to
make short- and medium-haul flights profitable without putting
the company at risk, Chairman Antonio Vazquez told  Onda Cero 
radio in an interview today.  Iberia, now part of  International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA (IAG) , needs to bolster its long-haul flights, Vazquez said,
adding that for that purpose the airline still needs to stop
losing money from its shorter flights.  The lower-cost unit, called Iberia Express, will offer
similar conditions for pilots to those offered by  Vueling
Airlines SA (VLG)  under an agreement with the pilots union Sepla,
Vazquez said in the interview, according to an e-mailed
statement sent by the radio station today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
