First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) ,
 Nigeria ’s seventh-largest lender by market value, forecast a 10
percent fall in first-quarter profit compared to a year earlier.  Net income in the three months through March is expected to
be 2.37 billion naira ($14.6 million), down from 2.66 billion
naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based bank said in a statement
published on the website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  today.
Revenue is forecast to reach 25 billion naira, compared to 16.63
billion naira a year before.  First City Monument Bank’s shareholders in September
approved the takeover of Finbank Plc, which was bailed out by
the central bank two years ago. Nigeria’s central bank injected
the equivalent of $4 billion into eight of the country’s 24
lenders amid a banking crisis in 2009 and the Asset Management
Corp. of Nigeria was set up to buy bad debts from banks.  First City Monument Bank’s  stock  declined 45 percent last
year, compared with an 16 percent fall in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All Share Index. (NGSEINDX)  The lender’s shares were unchanged at
4.1 naira at the close of trading in Lagos, the commercial
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
