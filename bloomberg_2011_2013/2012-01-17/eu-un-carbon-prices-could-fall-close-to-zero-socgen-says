Societe Generale SA (GLE)  said European
carbon permits may fall close to zero should regulators fail to
set tight enough limits in the market after 2020.  The bank cut its forecasts for European Union permit prices
in 2012 by 28 percent to 8.90 euros ($11.32) a metric ton, on
lower emissions because of worsening economic conditions and
faster-than-expected deployment of renewable energy.  Without the confirmation of post-2020 rules, “prices in an
oversupplied market could rapidly fall further from present
levels, to values close to zero,”  Emmanuel Fages , an analyst in
Paris at the bank, said in an e-mailed report.  EU carbon for December dropped 54 percent in the past year
and reached a record low 6.38 euros on Jan. 4, as the region’s
sovereign debt crisis sapped demand and supply of UN offsets
continued to surge. The market’s third phase runs for the eight
years through 2020.  “People may have increased selling as they question the
existence of phase four,” Fages said today by phone. EU
regulators, which include the European Commission, the
Parliament and  member states , are considering changing the
market’s rules. Current regulations do not include an end date
and assume a 1.74 percent reduction in the cap of EU allowances
each year.  December carbon permits rose 4 cents today to 6.77 euros on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London as of 3:53 p.m.  Returning Set Aside  Under one proposal being considered by the parliament,
regulators could temporarily set aside allowances to curb an
oversupply through this year and beyond. Such a scenario would
potentially bring forward a 15 euro-a-ton price to 2015 instead
of in 2020 under the more-probable scenario with no set aside,
Fages estimated today. The chance of a set aside is about 40
percent, he said.  Returning the 1.4 billion tons of set-aside supply during
the three years through 2020 would drive EU prices back down to
10 euros by the end of the decade under that scenario, he
forecast. The set aside would also compensate for energy
efficiency measures, according to the report.  The bank last made a 2020 forecast in October 2010,
proposing scenarios in which EU permit prices would rise to
between 40 to 60 euros by 2020, depending on offset restrictions
and tighter carbon limits.  Under today’s most likely scenario, the emissions market’s
net overall balance will be 879 million tons oversupplied in the
13 years through 2020, the report said. This surplus is based
upon a shortfall of 870 million tons of EU permits, which is
balanced by a maximum use of UN offsets totaling 1.75 billion
tons.  Total emissions during phase three of the trading system
should be about 18.4 billion tons, meaning emissions will be 5
percent below 2012 levels by the end of the period, Fages said
in the report. The bank forecast EU permits will trade at 12.60
euros on average during that time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
