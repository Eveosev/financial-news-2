Iraq’s government risks deepening a
political crisis by barring Sunni Muslim cabinet members from
attending its sessions, a lawmaker and member of the Sunni-
backed al Iraqiya coalition said.  The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite,
doesn’t have the right to dismiss the ministers because they
were appointed by parliament,  Abdul Khider al-Taher said today
in a telephone interview from  Baghdad .  “Such decisions don’t only affect the Iraqiya bloc
ministers but also affect the administrative structure of the
ministries and their work,” he said, adding that Al-Iraqiya
will meet tomorrow to decide what course of action to take.  Iraqi government spokesman Ali al Dabbagh said earlier
today that the ministers are no longer “allowed to manage
ministries, and all decisions that will be signed by them are
invalid.” They will be allowed back if a boycott is ended, he
said.  Some of the ministers started a boycott in December after
an arrest warrant was issued for Vice President Tariq al- Hashimi, a Sunni, on terrorism charges. Al-Hashimi denies the
charges and has sought refuge in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan
region as politicians hold talks on ways to defuse tensions.  Al-Iraqiya has eight ministers in the cabinet. The
government didn’t indicate whether all of them were suspended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
