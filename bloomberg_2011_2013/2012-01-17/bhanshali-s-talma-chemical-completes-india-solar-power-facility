A unit of Talma Chemical Industries
Pvt., owned by the family of Indian investment banker Vallabh Bhanshali, has completed a 25-megawatt solar power plant.  It was built with photovoltaic panels from  Hanwha SolarOne
Co. (HSOL)  and  China Sunergy Co. (CSUND) , and funds from  State Bank of India ,
Visual Percept Solar Projects Pvt. said in a statement e-mailed
today. The plant, in the Surendranagar district of Gujarat, has
signed a 25-year agreement to sell power to the state’s utility.  The project cost, undisclosed by the unit, was expected to
be 3.3 billion rupees ($65 million), ICRA Ltd., owned by Moody’s
Investors Service, said when it assigned a BB+ rating to 2.31
billion rupees of the solar company’s debt in August.  Power-One Inc. (PWER) , based in Camarillo,  California , supplied
the inverters for the project. The engineering and procurement
contractor was Sterling and Wilson Group, Visual Percept said.  Vallabh Bhanshali co-founded Enam Securities Pvt., which
was bought by Axis Bank Ltd. in November 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
