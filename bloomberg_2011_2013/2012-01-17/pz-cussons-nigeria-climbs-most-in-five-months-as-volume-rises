PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc (PZ) , which
manufactures and sells  consumer goods  and home appliances, rose
the most in more than five months amid speculation that pension
fund managers may be buying into the company.  The stock gained 1.39 naira, or 5 percent, to 29.39 naira
by 1:53 p.m. in Lagos. A close at this will be its highest
closing value since Nov. 29.  About 1.42 million shares, or 215 percent of a three-month
average, traded as at 1:13 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “It could be that a pension fund administrator is taking a
position on the stock,” David Adonri, chief executive officer
of Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. Limited, said by phone from
Lagos today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
