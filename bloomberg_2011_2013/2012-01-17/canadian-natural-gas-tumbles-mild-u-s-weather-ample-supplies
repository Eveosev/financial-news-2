Canadian natural gas fell, tracking
a decline in New York futures, as mild U.S. weather tempered
demand and increased production pared the need for imports of
the fuel.  Alberta  gas dropped 8.1 percent. Temperatures in Chicago
will be above normal all next week and peak at 47 degrees
Fahrenheit (8 Celsius) Jan. 26, 15 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .
U.S. producers have increased output with new techniques that
allow them to tap shale formations.  Alberta gas for February delivery fell 19.75 cents to
C$2.255 a gigajoule ($2.11 per million British thermal units) at
2:55 p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for February delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  declined 18.2 cents, or 6.8 percent, to
settle at $2.488 per million Btu. It was the lowest settlement
price since March 2002.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
10 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $2.7047 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can carry
1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  Spot Gas  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 8.16 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.695,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 8.36 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to $2.7597.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet, 548 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.04 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.05 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.1 billion cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.1 billion cubic feet today, or 59 percent of its
capacity of 2.69 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.71
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
