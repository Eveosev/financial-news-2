Rea Vipingo Plantations Ltd. (RVPL) , a
Kenyan sisal producer and spinner, rose for the first time in
four days after saying full-year profit soared.  The stock climbed 0.25 shilling, or 1.7 percent, to 14.95
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the
biggest gain since Jan. 5.  Rea Vipingo reported a profit of 467.2 million shillings
($5.41 million) for the 12 months through September, compared
with 67.4 million shillings a year earlier, the company said in
a statement e-mailed by the Nairobi Securities Exchange
yesterday.  “The performance is off the charts in terms of 553 percent
increase in profit after tax, it is incredible,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based investment
company Rich Management, said in a phone interview today. Rea
Vipingo’s earnings surged as prices of the fiber rose, Satchu
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
