Egypt ’s credit default risk fell the
most in more than seven months after the country officially
asked the  International Monetary Fund  for a loan.  Five-year credit default swaps declined 25 basis points,
the most on a closing basis since June 1, to 600 at 3:02 p.m. in
Cairo, according to data provider CMA.  Egypt yesterday started negotiations with the IMF for a
$3.2 billion loan to support an 18-month economic-reform program
that it will propose in the next few weeks, the country’s
minister of planning and international cooperation Fayza
Aboulnaga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
