Turkey  may meet some of its external
borrowing goal of 9.5 billion liras ($5.2 billion) through the
Japanese market for a second year, said Taskin Temiz, deputy
director for public finance at the Treasury.  About 4.5 billion liras of the international issuance will
be in Eurobonds, Temiz said at a conference in Vienna today. A
sale on Japanese markets is a goal “we are working on, but are
not yet so sure about,” he said.  Such a sale would mark the second year the Treasury has
tapped external lenders in yen. It raised 180 billion yen ($2.2
billion), or about half of last year’s external financing,
through a sale in March 2011 of 10-year Samurai bonds. At the
time it was the biggest sovereign sale of such bonds in a
decade.  Japan  Bank for International Cooperation guaranteed 95
percent of the Samurai notes, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Samurai bonds are yen-denominated notes sold in Japan by
overseas borrowers. Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.,
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho
Securities Co. arranged the sale last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
