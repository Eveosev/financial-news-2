Cocoa prices have fallen because the
industry is “well stocked” and the current crop is off to a
“good start,” according to  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the world’s
largest maker of bulk chocolate.  Prices on NYSE Liffe in  London  slid 25 percent to 1,465
pounds ($2,250) a metric ton in the three months through
November, the company’s first quarter, data on Bloomberg show.
The 2011-12 global cocoa season started in October. Ivory Coast
and Ghana are the two biggest producers.  “This price decrease was due to the recent  bumper crop  in
2010-11 and the good start of the current cocoa campaign, as
well as financial investors taking short positions and a
generally well-stocked industry,” the Zurich-based company said
in a statement today.  Cocoa supplies outpaced demand by 341,000 tons last season,
according to the International Cocoa Organization. The London-
based group has yet to release its forecast for the current
season. The global cocoa market will have a “modest surplus”
in 2011-12, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report Jan. 13.  Sugar prices in the European Union continued at
“historically high levels,” while a better-than-expected crop
in top producer  Brazil  and a “good start” to the harvest in
Russia and India helped world prices to fall, Callebaut said.  Raw-sugar prices on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  retreated
20 percent in the three-month period, data on Bloomberg show.
White-sugar prices in the European Union averaged 645 euros
($823) a ton in November, the highest since at least July 2006,
according to data from the European Commission, the bloc’s
executive arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
