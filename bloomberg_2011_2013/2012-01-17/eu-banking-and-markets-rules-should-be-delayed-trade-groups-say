Financial lawmakers must give newly
created banking and markets regulators more time to draft rules
as part of an overhaul of European Union regulation, seven
industry trade groups said in a joint letter to lawmakers.  The groups, including the European Banking Federation and
the  International Swaps and Derivatives Association , said
current deadlines “jeopardize the goal of drafting high-quality
and credible regulation,” in a letter sent to EU Financial
Services Commissioner  Michel Barnier , European Parliament
Lawmaker  Sharon Bowles  and Bjarne Corydon, the Danish finance
minister. Denmark currently holds the rotating presidency of the
EU.  The London-based  European Banking Authority  said on Jan. 5
that it didn’t have enough staff to be able to plow through the
199 tasks needed to apply global capital rules to  European
banks. (BEBANKS)  European authorities for the banking, securities and
insurance industries were set up at the start of last year in
response to the 2008 financial crisis.  “The parliament has always pressed for there to be more
resources for the European Supervisory Authorities,” Bowles
said in a telephone interview in Brussels today. “This has been
a constant battle.”  Barnier’s press office didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment.  The trade groups said that the European Securities and
Markets Authority, another EU agency, would only have three
months to draft guidelines on short-selling, which falls “far
short” of the commission’s own best-practice standards for new
rules.  To contact the reporters on this story:
