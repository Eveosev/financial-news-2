Russia introduced a new version of
its draft  United Nations  resolution on  Syria  that excluded
Western proposals aimed at military intervention in the country,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said.  “We are disappointed that Western nations during
consultations on the Russian draft resolution tried to introduce
a whole series of amendments which removed all the positive
aspects,” Lukashevich said in a phone interview today.
“Nothing in this resolution should be seen as opening the
possibility of a military solution to the problem.”  The latest Russian draft resolution was circulated
yesterday and there hasn’t been any response yet from the U.S.
and European nations, said Lukashevich.  Russia last week accused the U.S. and its European allies
of seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a
top Russian security official said NATO was preparing to
establish a no-fly zone to protect Syrian rebels. The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and three alliance members denied
any such plans.  Russia  opposes changes to its draft resolution on Syria
proposed by western governments because “their goal is to
engineer the overthrow of Assad’s regime,” Deputy Foreign
Minister Gennady Gatilov said Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
