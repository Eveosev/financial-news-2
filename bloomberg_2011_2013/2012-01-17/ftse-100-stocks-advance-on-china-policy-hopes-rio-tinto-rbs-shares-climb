U.K. stocks  rose for a second day,
led by mining companies, after a slowdown in Chinese economic
growth bolstered expectations for easier monetary policy.  Rio Tinto  Group led a gauge of metal producers higher after
the company reported record iron ore production and copper
prices rose.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  rallied after
finding a buyer for its aviation division. Resolution Plc and
British Land Co. advanced as analysts upgraded the shares.  The  FTSE 100 Index  increased 36.51, or 0.7 percent, to
5,693.95 at the close in London, paring an earlier rally of as
much as 1.2 percent. The FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.7
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.3 percent.  Shares climbed as  gross domestic product  in  China , the
world’s second-biggest economy, increased 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
in Beijing. That beat the  median economist estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of 8.7 percent.  “The figure has confirmed the trend of declining GDP
growth touching levels not seen since 2009,” said Jonathan Sudaria, a trader at  London  Capital Group. “However, given the
drop-off in demand for Chinese imports from  Europe  and the wider
global economic uncertainty, traders are spinning the data as a
positive given that it could have been worse.”  Also today, the People’s Bank of China said it injected 169
billion yuan ($26.8 billion) into the financial market through
14-day reverse-repurchase operations at 5.47 percent, according
to a statement posted on the bank’s website.  The benchmark gauge increased 0.4 percent yesterday amid
speculation that stock prices already reflected concerns raised
by  Standard & Poor’s  when it downgraded the credit ratings of
nine euro-area nations Jan. 13.  Commodity Shares  Mining companies rallied as nickel and tin led base metals
higher on the London Metal Exchange.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  rose 2
percent to 1,088 pence,  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  added 1.5 percent to
2,633.5 pence and Glencore International Plc increased 2.2
percent to 405.45 pence.  Rio Tinto climbed 2.9 percent to 3,694 pence after the
 world’s third-largest mining company  said fourth-quarter iron
ore production rose to a record 51.2 million metric tons, driven
by expansions at its mines and ports in Australia’s Pilbara
region.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  rose 2 percent to 2,120.5 pence.  Australian iron-ore rival, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.,
reported a 45 percent jump in second-quarter shipments and
forecast a rebound in demand from steel mills in China.  RBS’s Aviation Unit  RBS added 1.8 percent to 24.85 pence after a group led by
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. agreed to buy the lender’s
aviation division for about $7.3 billion, RBS’s biggest disposal
since the U.K. government bailout in 2008.  Japan ’s second-biggest bank by market value and partner
Sumitomo Corp. will gain control of a fleet of 206 aircraft,
with commitments to buy another 87 by 2015, according to a
statement from RBS. Sumitomo Mitsui said it will use RBS
Aviation Capital to expand in  emerging markets  and  Asia .  Resolution gained 1.4 percent to 265.6 pence as UBS AG
raised its recommendation for the financial services buyout firm
to “buy” from “neutral.”  British Land (BLND)  rose 2.1 percent to 477 pence as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its recommendation for the real-estate
investment trust to “buy” from “neutral.”  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  advanced 3.1 percent to 42 pence after
the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by volume said it will
reach its target for operating profit of more than 10 percent
before schedule after home sales rose in 2011.  Dixons, DS Smith  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  surged 11 percent to 10.94 pence as the
the  U.K.’s largest consumer-electronics retailer  said
profitability improved in its domestic market after it sold more
products at full price over the holiday. Domestic sales declined
at a more moderate pace over the peak Christmas period as the
company sold more online.  DS Smith Plc (SMDS)  jumped 3.2 percent to 210.2 pence after
agreeing to buy a unit of Swedish tissue maker Svenska Cellulosa
AB for 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion).  DS Smith plans a rights offering to raise 466 million
pounds ($715 million) to help finance the purchase of SCA
Packaging and will also use existing and additional debt.  The company will sell new shares at 95 pence apiece,
according to terms obtained by Bloomberg News. The offer price
implies a 35 percent discount to the so-called theoretical ex-
rights price of the stock, the terms show.  Elsewhere,  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  plunged 26 percent to 127 pence
after  India ’s Supreme Court set aside a judgment on the
company’s sales tax case in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
