Uganda ’s main opposition parties
plan a third round of so-called walk-to-work protests this week
over economic conditions in the East African country, said Forum
for Democratic Change spokesman Wafula Ogutu.  The protests, led by the Action for Change group of
opposition parties, will begin with a rally in the capital,
Kampala, on Jan. 19, Ogutu said in a phone interview today from
the city. The demonstrations are planned to continue until Jan.
28, he said.  “We are protesting over corruption, high inflation rates,
high power costs and government wastefulness of resources,”
Ogutu said.  At least 11 people died and more than 480 were injured
during walk-to-work protests that began in April 2011 over the
rising cost of living, according to the Uganda Red Cross. A
second round of protests was held in October, when inflation
surged to an 18-year high of 30.4 percent, forcing the central
bank to raise  interest rates  by 10 percentage points to a record
23 percent.  Kizza Besigye, the leader of the main opposition Forum for
Democratic Change, led the first two rounds of protests in April
and May last year. He was arrested repeatedly and received
treatment in neighboring  Kenya  for injuries he suffered during
his arrest on April 28 by security forces preventing him from
protesting.  Last week, business owners in Kampala closed their shops
for three days to protest against an increase in lending rates
by commercial banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
