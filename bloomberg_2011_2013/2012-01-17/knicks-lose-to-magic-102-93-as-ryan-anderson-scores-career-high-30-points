Andrew Bynum had 17 points and 15
rebounds and the host  Los Angeles Lakers  won 73-70 against the
 Dallas Mavericks  in the National Basketball Association.  Kobe Bryant added 14 points for the Lakers, who overcome 1-
for-10 shooting on 3-pointers to beat the defending NBA champion
Mavs, who were led by Dirk Nowitzki’s 21 points.  Earlier yesterday, Ryan Anderson scored a career-high 30
points, including seven 3-pointers, as the Orlando Magic rallied
to beat the New York Knicks 102-93 at Madison Square Garden.  The Magic hit 17 3-point shots, tied for the most the
Knicks have ever allowed, and overcame a four-point fourth-
quarter deficit for the victory. New York’s Carmelo Anthony led
all scorers with 33 points as the Knicks lost their third
consecutive game.  “Obviously 17 threes is not going to help you,” Knicks
coach  Mike D’Antoni  said after the game. “Give them credit,
Ryan Anderson made a couple that were tough looks. We’ve just
got to score more points.”  Elsewhere in the NBA on the Martin Luther King holiday, it
was the Memphis Grizzlies winning 102-86 against the Chicago
Bulls, who played without last year’s Most Valuable Player
 Derrick Rose , sidelined with a sprained left toe; Philadelphia
94, Milwaukee 82; and Atlanta 93, Toronto 84.  The  New Jersey Nets  lost 101-91 to the  Los Angeles
Clippers , who got 23 points and 14 rebounds from forward  Blake Griffin . Cleveland beat Charlotte 102-94 behind 25 points from
No. 1 draft pick Kyrie Irving; Houston beat Washington 114-106,
overcoming a career-high 38 points from Wizards guard  John Wall ;
Portland topped New Orleans 84-77; Minnesota won 99-86 against
Sacramento, and Oklahoma City improved to 12-2 with a 97-88 win
at Boston.  Anthony was 9-for-27 from the field and added a team-high
five assists after missing the Knicks’ previous game with a
sprained right ankle. The 27-year-old forward was selected
yesterday as one of 20 finalists for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team.
Knicks rookie guard Iman Shumpert added 12 points.  Anderson’s 3-Pointers  Anderson has made 43 3-point shots this year, most in the
NBA. Magic center Dwight Howard, an All-Star in each of the last
five seasons, scored eight points and added 10 rebounds before
fouling out with a minute remaining.  The Magic (9-3) have won four games in a row, and sit atop
the Eastern Conference Southeast division standings. The Knicks
(6-7) are second in the Atlantic Division, four games behind the
76ers and 3 1/2 games above the last-place Nets.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporters on this story:
