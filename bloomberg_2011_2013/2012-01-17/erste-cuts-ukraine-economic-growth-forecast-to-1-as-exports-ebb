Ukraine’s  economic growth  will
probably slow to 1 percent this year as demand for the country’s
exports dwindles,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  said, lowering an earlier
forecast of 3 percent.  “The slowdown in economic growth in Europe and  Asia  is now
affecting the Ukrainian economy,” Maryan Zablotskyy, head of
economic research at Erste Bank in the capital, Kiev, said today
in an e-mailed note to clients. “Ukraine’s steel production and
machine building are declining. These two industries made up
more than a half of exports in 2010.”  Ukraine’s economy expanded “almost” 5 percent last year,
the fastest pace since 2007, spurred by a good harvest and
increased exports, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said last week.
That compares with 4.2 percent growth in 2010 and the
government’s 3.9 percent forecast for 2012.  Ukraine’s grain harvest may fall 20 percent to 45 million
metric tons next year, Zablotskyy said. Inflation may accelerate
to 9 percent from 4.6 percent last year, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
