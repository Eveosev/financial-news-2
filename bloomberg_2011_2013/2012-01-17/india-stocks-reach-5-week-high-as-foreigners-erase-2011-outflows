Indian stocks reached a five-week
high as foreign funds made purchases for a ninth day, reversing
last year’s withdrawals, on expectations company earnings will
withstand a global slowdown and the central bank will cut rates.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the largest carmaker, jumped the
most in 32 months.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the nation’s biggest
truckmaker, surged to a seven-month high after Jaguar Land Rover
sales jumped 45 percent last month.  HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCLT) 
climbed the most since October after its profit beat estimates.
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, rallied 4.1 percent, ending a three-day decline.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 1.7 percent
to 16,466.05 at the 3:30 p.m. close, its highest since Dec. 8.
Foreign  funds  have bought a net $559 million of stocks this
year, after pulling out $512 million in 2011, data from the
regulator show. The nation’s inflation rate last month fell to a
two-year low and factory output rebounded in November after a
first drop in two years, according to government data.  “The macro-economic indicators are turning positive, and
that’s luring foreign investors,” said Chokkalingam G, chief
investment officer at Mumbai-based Centrum Broking Pvt. “We
expect the  Reserve Bank  of India to either cut rates or the  cash
reserve ratio  to boost growth” next week, he said  Investors concern globally eased after French borrowing
costs declined and India’s rupee rose to a two-month high as
 China’s economy  slowed less than expected, fueling optimism the
region’s economies are relatively resilient to  Europe ’s crisis.
The Sensex sank 25 percent last year on concern a falling rupee
and 13 increases in funding costs since March 2010 will worsen
the effects of the European crisis on company earnings.  Resilient  “The economic numbers from  Asia  are signaling that the
region is not deteriorating as fast as expected,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a Kuala Lumpur-based currency strategist at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “The rupee’s excessive fall last year
is also contributing to this year’s strengthening.”  The rupee advanced 1.3 percent to 50.71 per dollar. The
currency fell 16 percent in 2011, the worst performance among
Asian currencies, before appreciating 4.3 percent this year to
be the region’s biggest gainer. Foreign funds boosted  holdings 
of Indian debt by $2.6 billion this month to a record $28.7
billion as on Jan. 12  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India added 1.9 percent to 4,967.30. The  BSE 200 Index  rose 1.7
percent to 2,001.61.  Car Prices  Maruti rallied 10 percent to 1,108.35 rupees, its biggest
rise since May 18, 2009. The company raised prices of its cars,
Press Trust of India reported citing an official it did not
identify. The stock was added by Kotak Institutional Equities to
its top-10 list yesterday.  Tata Motors rose 1.7 percent to 217.4 rupees, its fourth
day of gains. Rising demand from China and Russia helped Jaguar
Land Rover boost sales, said Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst with
Quant Broking Pvt. Deliveries increased 45 percent to 30,981
units in December, the most since June 2010, according to a
statement yesterday.  HCL surged 4.8 percent to 425.4 rupees, its steepest
advance since Oct. 28.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  fell 0.5
percent to 1,103.95 rupees ahead of its earnings today. Profit
may increase 19 percent to 28.3 billion rupees, according to the
median estimates of 35 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Earnings forecasts for Sensex companies for the year to
March 2012 have fallen 8.7 percent to 1,150 rupees per share,
the most since the year ended March 2009, according to about
1,500 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Asia’s third-largest
economy grew 6.9 percent in the September quarter, the least  in
two years, and factory output fell 5.1 percent in October, the
first contraction since 2009, as higher borrowing costs curbed
consumer demand, government data show.  ‘Attractive Valuation’  One out of two Sensex companies that reported profit so far
for the December quarter have missed analyst estimates. Forty
percent trailed in the September quarter and 47 percent the
previous three months. The Sensex trades at 14.4 times future
profit, down from 19.4 times at end of 2010. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index trades at 9.9 times.  “Valuations are attractive and some stocks were beaten out
of shape,” said Centrum’s Chokkalingam said.  Jet Airways (India) Ltd. , the country’s largest carrier,
surged 10 percent to 234.9 rupees, extending its 10-day rally to
34 percent, amid expectation that the government will allow
foreign carriers to buy stakes.  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR)  rose
4.8 percent to 25.1 rupees.  SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET)  jumped 10 percent.  Reliance increased 4.1 percent to 742.05 rupees.  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. , the largest engineering company, added 5.5 percent
to 1,267.4 rupees.  Metal Stocks  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , an aluminum maker that controls
U.S.-based Novelis Inc., jumped 6 percent to 140.5 rupees.
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper and zinc
producer, added 2.8 percent to 109.35 rupees, extending its
seven-day rally to 16 percent.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the biggest
producer of the alloy, increased 5 percent to 442.75 rupees. The
three companies were the biggest losers on the Sensex in 2011,
having lost half their market values.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 commodities rallied
as much as 1.7 percent today amid speculation that  China , that
the biggest user of raw materials, may ease monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
