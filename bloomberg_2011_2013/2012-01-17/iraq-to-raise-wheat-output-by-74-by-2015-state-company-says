Iraq  will increase local wheat
production by about 74 percent to 3 million metric tons by 2015,
according to Saleh Hussein Jabur, director general of state-
owned Mesopotamia Seed Co.  The government plans to triple the annual quantity of wheat
seed that it buys from local farmers to 180,000 tons in 2015
from 60,000 tons now, he said in an interview in Baghdad today.  Iraq is one of the world’s biggest importers of wheat and
rice, purchased by the government to supply a food rationing
program. Soil salinity, poor irrigation and a drought in the
last three years combined to make the country a buyer on world
markets.  Iraq consumes about 4.5 million tons of wheat a year and
local production for the 2010-11 season was about 1.73 million
tons, Hassan Ismail Ibrahim, director general of Iraq’s Grain
Board, said Nov. 29. The country plans to import 3 million tons
of wheat in 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
