Bayer AG (BAYN)  said its cancer medicine
regorafenib improved survival for people with advanced  colon
cancer  by 29 percent, fleshing out details of a trial halted
last year in order to give all the participants the new drug.  People who took regorafenib lived a median 6.4 months,
compared with 5 months for patients who got a placebo alongside
the best possible treatments for pain and other symptoms, but no
drug to attack the cancer, the Leverkusen, Germany-based said in
a study to be presented on Jan. 21 at the Gastrointestinal
Cancers Symposium of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.  Bayer said it plans to submit regorafenib for approval in
metastatic colorectal cancer in 2012. The product has the
potential to generate more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
in annual sales if it’s approved in several different types of
cancer, the German drugs and chemicals maker said last month.  “It will be very likely that they’ll grant approval
because there’s nothing else like it,” said Axel Grothey, a
professor of oncology at the  Mayo Clinic  in Rochester,
Minnesota. Each of the patients in the trial had already tried
standard treatments without success, Grothey said.  Bayer agreed last year to pay U.S. biotechnology company
 Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX)  a 20 percent royalty for the use of
regorafenib in oncology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
