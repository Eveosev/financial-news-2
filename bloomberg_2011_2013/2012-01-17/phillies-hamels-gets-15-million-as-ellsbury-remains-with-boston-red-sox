Pitcher  Cole Hamels  agreed on a one-
year, $15 million contract with the  Philadelphia Phillies ,
avoiding what would have been his final year of arbitration.  Center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, runner-up in voting for the
American League Most Valuable Player last season, re-signed with
the  Boston Red Sox  on a one-year deal. Right-handers Joba Chamberlain and  David Robertson  both agreed on one-year
contracts to stay with the  New York Yankees .  Today was the day for figures to be exchanged between the
142 Major League Baseball players who filed for arbitration and
their teams. If the sides are unable to reach agreement, an
arbitrator will decide whether to accept the bid of either the
player or his club.  A player with six or more years of major-league service who
is not already under contract for the following season is
eligible to become a free agent.  Hamels, a 28-year-old left-hander, was an All-Star last
season, posting a 14-9 record with a career-best 2.79 earned run
average, three complete games, 194 strikeouts and 44 walks as
the Phillies went a major league-best 102-60 during the regular
season.  The Phillies were unable to reach agreement on a long-term
deal with Hamels, who could test free agency after the season.
He is joined by former Cy Young Award winners  Roy Halladay  and
 Cliff Lee  in a pitching rotation that had a major-league best
3.02 ERA last season. Halladay, 34, is under contract through
2013 and Lee, 33, through 2015.  More Signings  Phillies right-hander Kyle Kendrick, who has been used both
as a starter and reliever, avoided arbitration by agreeing on a
one-year, $3.6 million contract on Jan. 13. Starters Vance Worley and Joe Blanton are also on the major-league roster.  Philadelphia infielder Wilson Valdez signed a one-year
contract worth $930,000, the Phillies said in a statement.
Hunter Pence is the only Phillies’ player still eligible for
arbitration.  The team today separately announced the signing of right-
hander Joel Pineiro to a minor-league contract with an
invitation to spring training. The 33-year-old Pineiro went 7-7
with a 5.13 ERA in 27 games last season for the  Los Angeles
Angels .  Ellsbury, 28, was named AL Comeback Player of the Year last
season after batting .321 with career highs of 46 doubles, 32
home runs, 119 runs and 105 runs batted in.  The  Red Sox  also agreed on a one-year contract with 30-
year-old infielder Mike Aviles, who batted .317 in 38 games last
season.  Chamberlain went 2-0 with a 2.83 ERA in 27 relief
appearances for the Yankees in 2011 before elbow surgery on June
16. Robertson led all AL relievers with a 1.08 ERA in 70
appearances, posting a 4-0 record. Contract terms weren’t
disclosed for either pitcher.  To contact the reporters on this story:
