FLSmidth & Co. A/S , the Danish
supplier of mining equipment, rose to the highest level in five
months in Copenhagen trading after winning South American orders
worth $85 million.  FLSmidth rose as much as 4.5 percent to 419 kroner, its
highest since Aug. 1. The shares advanced 8.5 kroner, or 2.2
percent, to 397.5 kroner at 1:08 p.m. in the Danish capital,
giving the Copenhagen-based company a market value of 21.1
billion kroner ($3.62 billion).  FLSmidth said today’s orders are for equipment, including
 gyratory crushers , to an unidentified copper producer in  South
America . Global copper demand is rising, and the metal’s price
neared a four-month high today in New York trading. European
copper demand will rebound and prices will climb 26 percent in
the next 12 months, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Dec. 20.  “FLSmidth sees opportunities in the upgrading and
expansion of existing plants as well as in being able to provide
for new plants,” Chief Executive Officer Joergen Huno Rasmussen
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
