Venoco Inc. (VQ) , the second-largest
landholder in  California ’s Monterey oil-shale formation, surged
50 percent after it agreed to be purchased by its chief
executive officer.  The shares  rose  to $11.50 at 8:54 a.m., before the start of
regular trading on U.S. markets. The Denver-based oil and
natural-gas producer yesterday agreed to a $12.50-a-share offer
by Chairman and CEO Timothy Marquez, owner of 50.3 percent of
its shares. The cash bid represents a premium of 63 percent to
the Jan. 13 close and values the entire company at $770 million.  The offer is unchanged from Marquez’s August bid, which
prompted a shareholder lawsuit. A special committee formed by
the board investigated alternatives and said yesterday the offer
was “in the best interests” of Venoco’s shareholders.  Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch and Strategic Energy
Advisors LLC are financial advisers to the board’s special
committee and Squire Sanders is the legal adviser. The
transaction is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.  BMO Capital Markets and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
advised Marquez.  Occidental Petroleum Corp. is the largest landholder in the
Monterey Shale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
