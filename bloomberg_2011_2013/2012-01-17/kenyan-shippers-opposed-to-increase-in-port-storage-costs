The  Kenya Shippers Council  and the
Kenya Ship Agents Association called for the East African
country’s ports authority to withdraw plans to raise storage
costs.  The two organizations will meet the Kenya Ports Authority
tomorrow to discuss plans to reduce the free storage period,
which will come into effect from Feb. 1, Agayo Ogambi, the
membership development officer at the council said by phone
today from Nairobi, the capital.  The authority wants to reduce the free-storage period  to
clear a backlog of cargo at Mombasa. It plans to reduce the free
storage period for goods in transit from nine days from 11 days,
and for other cargo to four days from five days, Managing
Director Gichiri Ndua said on Jan. 11.  The shippers bodies say they want more time to discuss the
matter with members. “The way the port is operating is not good
for the economy and the region,” Ogambi said.  Mombasa,  East Africa ’s biggest port, is experiencing
congestion, with offloading of containers taking as many as
eight days compared with the three days it usually takes.  The container yard at the port had 20,789 twenty-foot
equivalent units as of today, up from 18,731 units a month ago,
according to data published on the Kenya Ports Authority’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
