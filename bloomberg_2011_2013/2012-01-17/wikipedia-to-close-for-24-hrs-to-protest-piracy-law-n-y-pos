Wikipedia, the free online
information service, is to shut down for 24 hours from midnight
eastern time tonight in protest against proposed U.S. anti-
piracy legislation, the New York Post reported.  Founder Jimmy Wales believes the planned legislation poses
a threat to the future of the Web, and is backed by Facebook
Inc. and  Google Inc (GOOG) , while Hollywood film studios back the
legislation because they say it protects intellectual property
and jobs, the newspaper said.  Wikipedia, whose content is provided by an army of
volunteers, gets on average 25 million hits a day, according to
ComScore, the Post said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
