German 10-year bunds fell after
 China ’s gross domestic product grew more than economists
estimated, reducing demand for the safety of government debt.  Bunds (GDBR2)  also dropped before a German report forecast to show
investor sentiment improved for a second month. The European
Financial Stability Facility, the euro area’s bailout fund, lost
its top credit rating at  Standard & Poor’s  before it sells six-
month debt today. Spain, Belgium and  Greece  are also scheduled
to auction bills.  Germany’s 10-year yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.78 percent at 8:33 a.m. London time. The
2 percent bund due in January 2022 fell 0.105, or 1.05 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,277) face amount, to 101.98. The two-year yield
was little changed at 0.15 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares rose 2 percent, and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.7 percent.  China’s economy  expanded 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said. Growth exceeded
the 8.7 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  An index of German investor and analyst expectations
improved to minus 49.4 this month from minus 53.8 in December,
according to a Bloomberg survey before the ZEW Center for
European Economic Research report today. Euro-area inflation
slowed for the first time in five months in December, another
survey showed in advance of today’s data.  S&P cut the EFSF’s rating to AA+ from AAA and removed it
from CreditWatch with negative implication, the company said
yesterday. The EFSF plans to sell up to 1.5 billion euros of
bills today. S&P affirmed the  credit rating  of the  European
Investment Bank .  Spain is scheduled to auction 364- and 518-day bills today,
its first sale since its credit rating was cut two levels by S&P
on Jan. 14. Belgium is set to offer 3 billion euros of 91- and
364-day securities, and Greece also plans to sell bills.  Bunds have returned 0.4 percent this year, after gaining
9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
French bonds have returned 0.5 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
