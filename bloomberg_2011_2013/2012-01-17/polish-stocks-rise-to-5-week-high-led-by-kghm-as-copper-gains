Polish stocks gained, sending the
benchmark index to the highest level in five weeks, as rising
commodity prices boosted  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  and  PKN Orlen SA. (PKN)   KGHM, Poland’s sole copper producer, jumped to a six-week
high. The  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  advanced 1.9 percent to 2,223.76 at 4:10
p.m. in Warsaw, the highest since Dec. 9 on a closing basis.  Copper increased to the highest level in almost four months
in New York after Chinese gross domestic product expanded 8.9
percent in the fourth quarter, more than the 8.7 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The country is the
biggest global copper consumer.  KGHM rose 3.9 percent to 128.8 zloty. Orlen, Poland’s
biggest oil refiner, advanced for a second day, jumping 3.3
percent to 35.73 zloty.  Oil increased 1.6 percent to $100.24 a barrel as German
investor confidence jumped the most on record and as  France 
pushed for faster enforcement of the European Union’s proposed
ban on imports from  Iran (OPCRIRAN) .  To contact the reporter on this story:
