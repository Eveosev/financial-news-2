European governments should part-
nationalize the regionâ€™s largest lenders to prevent potential
bank failures, Michael Huether, the director of the Cologne-
based economic institute IW said,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  The measures are needed because there are new risks in the
financial system as well as a new credit crunch, Huether said,
according to the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
