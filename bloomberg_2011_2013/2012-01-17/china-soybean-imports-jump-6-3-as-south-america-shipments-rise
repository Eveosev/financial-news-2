China ’s soybean imports in September
through December rose 6.3 percent from a year earlier as
shipments from  Brazil  and  Argentina  doubled, Oil World said.  China bought 19.3 million metric tons in the three months
through December, Oil World said. Shipments from Brazil climbed
to 4.57 million tons from 1.54 million a year earlier and
Argentina’s exports to the Asian nation climbed to 3.15 million
tons from 1.52 million, Oil World said in a report today. U.S.
soybean shipments to China fell 23 percent, the researcher said.  “This indicates a turnaround in Chinese soybean imports,”
Oil World said. “Considering shipping time, arrivals of
soybeans at Chinese ports will show a similar increase by about
1.1 million to 1.2 million tons from a year earlier in
October/January 2011/12.”  China’s soybeans imports may be about 56 million tons in
the August to July 2012 season, down about 1 million tons from a
previous estimate and higher than 53.1 million tons imported in
the August to July 2011 season, it said.  Increased arrivals into China have resulted in higher
stockpiles, slowing demand from the country, Oil World said.
Demand for soy meal to feed livestock and cooking oil made from
the crop that has been smaller than expected is a “temporary
development,” according to the report.  “We expect Chinese demand for soya meal to continue to
increase sizably this season owing to rising demand in the
expanding pork, poultry and aquaculture industries,” the
researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
