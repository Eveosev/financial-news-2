SunEdison, a unit of  MEMC Electronic
Materials Inc. (WFR) , plans to build solar plants in  Japan  at a cost
of 350 billion yen ($4.6 billion) and will seek domestic
investors to help fund the projects, the Nikkei newspaper said.  The second-largest U.S. maker of polysilicon is already in
talks with local governments including Niigata and Fukuoka on
sites for the plants, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information. The projects will be built over
five years and capacity will total 1 gigawatt, the Nikkei said.  Japanâ€™s parliament passed a bill in August guaranteeing
above-market rates for wind, solar and geothermal energy.
Similar legislation in Germany and Spain has spurred solar
companies to install panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
