Even with valuations close to the
cheapest since 2009, emerging-market stocks are failing to lure
investors amid concern that slowing economic growth will damage
the prospects for earnings.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the price-earnings ratio
for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index relative to that of the MSCI
World Index of developed-market shares is near its lowest since
March 2009, the start of the last global  bull market .  Emerging equities have fallen out of favor, with the
benchmark MSCI index tumbling 20 percent last year amid concern
that economic growth was slowing from China to  South Korea . In
contrast, developed markets fell 7.6 percent in 2011 and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares was almost unchanged.  “It’s a bit too early to issue a buy signal given the
uncertain backdrop about global risk sentiment,”  Benoit Anne ,
the head of global emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale
SA in  London , said in a telephone interview. “A number of
economies across emerging markets are facing severe slowdown
risks. Given the macroeconomic backdrop, that doesn’t really
entice you to go and buy the assets at this stage.”  Mutual funds in the largest emerging-market economies, the
so-called BRICs of Brazil, Russia, India and China, posted the
biggest outflows last year since at least 1996, according to
EPFR Global.  To contact the reporters on this story:
