What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warm,
dry weather this week in  Argentina  may reduce any yield benefits
from rain last week, Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. Stronger economic growth in  China , the biggest hog
producer, may spur purchases of U.S. corn for livestock feed,
Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents higher on the
CBOT on speculation that adverse weather in Argentina and
improved U.S. processing of the oilseed in December may spur
increased demand for supplies held by farmers, Grow said.
 Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open 0.5 cent to 0.7 cent a
pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open $4 to $5 higher
per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that adverse weather threatening
crops in Ukraine and a weaker dollar will spur demand for
supplies from the U.S., Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
