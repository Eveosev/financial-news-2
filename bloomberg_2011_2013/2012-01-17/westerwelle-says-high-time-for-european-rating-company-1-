German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said it’s “high time” for creating a European
rating company to compete with established U.S. rivals.  Discussions to create such a company are under way “with
colleagues in  Europe ” and these talks are being accelerated,
Westerwelle said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We need a European competitor,” Westerwelle said.
“That’s not only good for the euro, our currency. That’s also
good for transparency in this whole segment.”  The European Financial Stability Facility, the euro
region’s temporary bailout fund, lost its top  credit rating  at
Standard & Poor’s yesterday. Euro-area finance ministers will
discuss at a Jan. 23 meeting how to respond to the downgrade, a
person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity
because the talks are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
