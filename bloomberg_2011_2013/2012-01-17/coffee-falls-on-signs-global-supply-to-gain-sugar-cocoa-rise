Coffee futures fell to a one-week
low in New York on signs that global production will increase.
Sugar and cocoa advanced.  The worldwide coffee market may have a surplus in the
season starting in October as output expands in  Brazil , the
world’s biggest grower, Commerzbank AG said today in a report.
Global production will be 132.4 million bags in the current
season, up 3 percent from a December forecast, the  International
Coffee Organization  said yesterday.  “The ICO news is weighing on the market,” Drew Geraghty,
a broker at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City , New Jersey, said in
a telephone interview.  Arabica coffee for March delivery slipped less than 0.1
percent to close at $2.2515 a pound at 1:51 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price touched $2.211, the lowest
for a most-active contract since Jan. 9.  A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery advanced 0.1 percent
to 23.86 cents a pound.  Cocoa futures for March delivery rose $1 to $2,270 a metric
ton in  New York .  In London futures trading, robusta coffee fell, while
