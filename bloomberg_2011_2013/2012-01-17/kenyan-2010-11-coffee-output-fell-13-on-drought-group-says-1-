Kenya ’s coffee production declined
13 percent in the 2010-11 season after drought cut yields, a
coffee traders’ group said.  Output in the 12 months to Sept. 30 fell to 36,629 metric
tons from 42,096 tons a year earlier, Isaac Muchomba, an
official at the Kenya Coffee Traders Association, said today by
phone from the capital, Nairobi. It was the second successive
drop in output since the 2008-09 season, when Kenya produced
more than 57,000 tons, he said.  “We really had terrible weather in the main growing
central and eastern regions which hurt our yields,” Muchomba
said. Forecasts for this season, which started on Oct. 1, have
yet to be released as authorities study weather patterns, he
said.  East Africa ’s biggest economy earned $221.7 million from
the crop in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, compared with $171.3
million a year earlier, the Kenya Coffee Producers and Traders
Association said on Nov. 3.  Shipments fell 7 percent to 33.68 million kilograms (74.25
million pounds) packed in 552,057 bags, from 36.20 million
kilograms in 595,148 bags the previous season, the producers and
traders association said.  The country harvests the bulk of its crop from October
through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
