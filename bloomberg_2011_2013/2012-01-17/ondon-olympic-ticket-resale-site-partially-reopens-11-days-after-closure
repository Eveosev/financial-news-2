The  London 2012 Olympics  ticket
resale website will partially re-open today after being
suspended for 11 days because of technical problems.  The site, which is run by Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s
 Ticketmaster  division, will allow people to sell their seats
back to the local Olympic organizers at face value. The website
was suspended Jan. 6 after thousands of people went online to
buy and sell tickets on the opening day.  The site will re-open today at 3 p.m. local British time,
but only for people who want to sell their tickets, the London
2012 organizing committee said in an emailed statement.  The organizers will purchase tickets until Feb. 3, and then
will sell them to the public starting in April. That means the
site is no longer an exchange system for buyers and sellers as
originally planned. Tickets bought from the organizers cannot be
resold on the open market without the permission of local
committee, or Locog.  “We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by the
suspension of our ticketing resale platform,” Locog commercial
director Chris Townsend said in the statement.  “We believe this system - purchasing the tickets back from
customers now, and offering them again from April, will result
in a better customer experience for everyone,” he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
