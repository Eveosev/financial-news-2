Osram AG, the lighting business of
 Siemens AG (SIE) , will cut about 10 percent of its employees in
Germany as demand for traditional bulbs declines.  About 850 jobs will be cut through 2014, with as many as
200 additional employees moving to Siemens, Osram said in a
statement today. Osram has more than 10,000 employees in the
country.  “The future lies in LED and we will actively drive this
structural change,” Wolfgang Dehen, chief executive officer of
Osram, said in the statement. “That’s why it is important to
create clearness for our employees, early on and in an open
manner.”  Light-emitting diodes are taking market share from
traditional  light bulbs  as consumer awareness for lower-energy
products rises and legislation to cut energy spending takes
effect. Siemens AG,  Europe ’s largest engineering company,
shelved plans for an initial public offering of Osram on Sept.
14, following a slump in global equity markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
