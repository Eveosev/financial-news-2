Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Persian
Gulf country’s biggest lender, signed an agreement to buy a
majority stake in the Morocco-based Union Marocaine des Banques,
according to an e-mailed statement by the Doha, Qatar-based
lender today.  The acquisition is subject to the approval of regulators in
both countries and is part of Qatar National’s strategy to
expand its presence in  Africa , where it already operates in
Sudan,  South Sudan , Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Mauritania, the
lender said in the statement.  Qatar National is expanding overseas as some lenders seek
to offload businesses amid Eruope’s sovereign debt crises. The
bank is the last serious bidder for Turkey’s Denizbank AS after
the withdrawal of HSBC Plc and OAO Sberbank, people familiar
with the process said earlier this month.  Qatar National, which posted a 32 percent rise in profit
last year,  fell 0.2 percent  to 146.8 riyals on the Qatar
Exchange today. The shares are up 2.1 percent over the past year
compared to a 6.1 percent drop in the QE Index of Qatari
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
