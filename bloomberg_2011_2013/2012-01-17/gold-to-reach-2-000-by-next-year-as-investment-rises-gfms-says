Gold may climb to a record above
$2,000 an ounce by early next year as concern about currencies
and low  interest rates  spurs investors to seek a protection of
wealth, Thomson Reuters GFMS said.  Prices may rebound after Europe’s debt crisis strengthens
the dollar and curbs liquidity, driving bullion down to as low
as $1,550, the London-based researcher said today in a report.
Investment, which dropped 7 percent last year, will gain in this
year’s first half as scrap sales decline and central banks buy
the metal, countering a drop in jewelry demand and rising mine
production. The gains through next year may come as the metal
nears the “closing stages” of its  bull market , GFMS said.  Bullion climbed 6.4 percent since plunging to within 1
percentage point of a  bear market  on Dec. 29 as  Europe ’s leaders
contend with the region’s debt crisis. Prices jumped for 11
consecutive years and holdings in exchange-traded products
backed by the metal are within 2 percent of last month’s all-
time high, valued at $124.8 billion.  “In the short term, the exchange rate can and does play a
key role,” Philip Newman, a research director of precious
metals at GFMS, said in an interview from London yesterday.
“There’s still massive uncertainty. That uncertainty is
therefore likely to encourage gold investors to remain in the
market.”  Relative Performance  Bullion reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce in London in
September and advanced 10 percent last year, beating
commodities, global equities and Treasuries. Immediate-delivery
gold traded at $1,645 by 4:43 p.m. in  London  yesterday and will
average $1,640 in the first half, GFMS forecasts.  Total investment fell to 1,563 metric tons last year and
will rise 7.3 percent to 680 tons in the first half, compared
with a year earlier, the researcher said. Bar demand climbed 36
percent to a record 1,194 tons in 2011 and will rise 1.4 percent
in the first half. Coin purchases gained 13 percent last year
and will increase 2.7 percent in the first half, GFMS said.  China ’s jewelry fabrication jumped 16 percent to more than
500 tons for the first time last year, and demand from India
limited global declines to 1.9 percent, as U.S. purchases
dropped for a 10th consecutive year. Total consumption may drop
3.1 percent in the first half due to a less auspicious year in
 India  and as a weaker rupee versus the dollar boosts local
prices, GFMS estimates. India remained the largest jewelry and
total fabrication market last year, Newman said.  China’s usage “compensated for declines elsewhere,”
Newman said. “As prices start to strengthen, that could
impact” demand.  Scrap Sales  Scrap sales slipped 1.8 percent last year to 1,612 tons and
may fall 3 percent to 734 tons in the six months through June as
consumers become more accustomed to higher prices, GFMS said.
Mine output advanced 3.8 percent to a record 2,812 tons in 2011
because of new projects, and may be 1,400 tons in the first
half, up 3.2 percent from a year earlier, the researcher said.  Production cash costs rallied 14 percent to $628 an ounce
for the first nine months of last year and the producer hedge
book expanded by 12 tons in 2011, the first increase since 1999.
Gold producers sometimes sell future output at fixed prices
to secure loans and can reduce hedges by buying back contracts.  Central banks boosted net purchases more than fivefold to
430 tons last year, and may buy another 190 tons in the first
half, GFMS said. Combined official holdings stand at 30,788.9
tons, data from the London-based World Gold Council show.  “Attitudes among central banks haven’t really changed,”
Newman said. “There’s still that desire to come into the gold
market to diversify some of the assets away from foreign
exchange and to boost gold holdings.”  Bloomberg competes with  Thomson Reuters  in selling
