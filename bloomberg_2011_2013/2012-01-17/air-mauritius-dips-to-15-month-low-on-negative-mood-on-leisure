Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s fourth largest airline, closed at its weakest level in
15 months as the European debt crisis damped demand for leisure
stocks.  The stock declined for a fourth straight day, its longest
losing streak since July, weakening 2.1 percent, the most since
Jan. 6, to 14 rupees in Port Louis, the capital, its lowest
since October 2010.  “The mood is negative on hotels and airlines because of
the weaker euro,” Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at AXYS
Stockbroking Ltd., said in a phone interview from the city.  Air Mauritius financial statements are reported in euros,
according to filings to the  Stock Exchange of Mauritius . The
euro weakened 1.3 percent since Jan. 3 against the rupee,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
