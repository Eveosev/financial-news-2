The  European Patent Office  said
patent filings increased by 3 percent last year compared with
2010.  The office received 243,000 patent applications and granted
62,115 patents,  Munich, Germany-based EPO said in an e-mailed
statement today. Some 62 percent of all filings last year came
from outside  Europe , with U.S. applications at 24 percent,
Japanese applications at 19 percent and Chinese applications at
7 percent.  The EPO isnâ€™t part of the European Union and has 38 member
countries. The EPO offers the closest thing currently available
to an EU-wide patent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
