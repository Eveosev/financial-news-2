Kraft Foods said it will realign its
U.S. sales organization and cut 1,600 jobs in  North America 
throughout 2012 as part of its move to divide its snacks and
grocery businesses.  About 40 percent of the job cuts are due to the realignment
of U.S. sales, with organizations for both units in place by
April 1. Twenty percent of job cuts are currently open
positions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
