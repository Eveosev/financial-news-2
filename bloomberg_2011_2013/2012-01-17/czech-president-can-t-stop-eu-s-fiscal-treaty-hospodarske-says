Czech President Vaclav Klaus may not
block  Europe ’s new fiscal treaty as it will be effective even
without Czech participation,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing
the country’s top negotiator Jaroslav Kurfurst.  Klaus, the  Czech Republic ’s most high-profile critic of the
European Union and the bloc’s common currency area, has said he
won’t sign any treaty that would commit the nation to closer
fiscal integration in the EU and reduce its budget sovereignty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
