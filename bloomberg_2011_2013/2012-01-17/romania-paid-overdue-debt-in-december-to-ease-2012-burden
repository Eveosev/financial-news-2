Romania paid its overdue debt to
private companies in December and met its 2011  budget deficit 
target of 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, Finance
Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu.  The Balkan nation has taken advantage of higher than
estimated revenue, which helped it keep the budget gap to about
3 percent of GDP at the end of November, and paid its arrears to
companies as agreed with the  International Monetary Fund ,
Ialomitianu told reporters today in Bucharest.  “We paid our debts in December and we reduced the payment
burden for this year,” Ialomitianu said.  The government plans to narrow its budget deficit to about
1.9 percent of GDP this year to meet pledges to the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union, from which
it secured a 5-billion-euro ($6.4 billion) precautionary accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
