The  Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation  proposed regulations that would require banks with
assets above $10 billion to conduct self-administered stress
tests each year.  Under the proposal, the FDIC by mid-November each year
would provide banks with three economic scenarios for the
future. By Jan. 5, banks would send the FDIC a report on how the
institution would cope with the scenarios. The reports would be
published 90 days after that.  The rule closely tracks one proposed by the  Federal Reserve 
last year that outlines how Fed examiners will administer stress
tests to institutions with assets of more than $50 billion.  “Both the FDIC and the institutions being tested will
benefit from the forward-looking results that the stress tests
will provide,” acting FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said.
“The results will assist in ensuring an institution’s financial
stability by helping to determine whether it has sufficient
capital levels to withstand a period of economic stress.”  Richard Cordray , the director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, voted for the proposal on stress tests in his
first appearance on the FDIC board.  “Not only will they help protect consumer depositors but
the system as a whole,” Cordray said at the meeting.  The FDIC will be taking public comments on the proposal for
60 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
