Middle Eastern faces stare from the
walls of  Gladstone Gallery .  The black-and-white portraits, photographed by Iranian-
born, New York-based artist Shirin Neshat, were inspired by
recent political uprisings in the Arab world.  The meticulous calligraphy that covers the bodies and faces
-- in Neshat’s signature style -- comes from “Shahnameh” (The
Book of Kings), an epic poem composed between 977 and 1010 A.D.  The photos are divided into three groups: the Masses, the
Patriots and the Villains. You don’t have to know Persian to
feel the sense of defiance that fills the rooms.  Prices range from $30,000 to $80,000. The show runs through
Feb. 11 at 515 W. 24th St.; +1-212-206-9300;

global tour of Damien Hirst’s spot paintings.  On a rainy opening night, the emporium on West 24th Street
felt sunny thanks to some massive canvases and their colorful
dots.  A 21-foot square featured 16 spots, each measuring 3 feet
in diameter. Nearby was a 15-foot square with four 5-foot spots
in red, green, blue and yellow. If it were a bit smaller, I
could see it in my 3-year-old son’s room.  Around the corner, a long, narrow space filled with
manically dotted round canvases made me dizzy. I escaped to a
pop-up store by the entrance where you could grab a $7 key
chain, an $18 tote bag or $28 cufflinks all with “spot”
elements. A young boy and his father sighed upon learning that a
“spot” skateboard deck cost $735.  Most works in the shows are not for sale. “The Complete
Spot Paintings 1986-2011” runs through Feb. 18 at 555 W. 24th
St.; +1-212-741-1111; and 522 W. 21st St.; +1-212-741-1717;

floor, where thousands of porcelain sunflower seeds form a neat,
shallow 16-by-32-foot rectangle.  The installation is by  China ’s dissident conceptual artist
Ai Weiwei, who had covered the giant Turbine Hall at  London ’s
Tate Modern with 150 tons of similar seeds in 2010.  At Mary Boone the still, slate-colored surface resembles a
body of water. And all those delicate, perfectly crafted kernels
add up to 5 tons.  The sheer mass brings another dimension to work that also
captures the tension between singularity and sum, bulk and
fragility.  The price is $2.75 million; a smaller version is available
for $600,000. The show runs through Feb. 4 at 541 W. 24th St.;
