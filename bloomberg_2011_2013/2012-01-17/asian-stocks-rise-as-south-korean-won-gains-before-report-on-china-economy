Stocks rose, sending the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  to the highest since July, while commodities
and the euro climbed as reports bolstered optimism in the U.S.
and German economies and Spain’s borrowing costs decreased.  The Dow added 60.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at
12,482.07 at 4 p.m. in  New York  and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index increased 0.4 percent to 1,293.67. The  MSCI All-Country
World Index (MXWD)  gained 0.9 percent after the Shanghai Composite
Index rose 4.2 percent, its biggest gain since 2009, as  China ’s
economic growth topped estimates without dimming prospects for
monetary easing. Copper closed at the highest price since
October. The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.2735 and Spain’s two-
year note yield fell three basis points to 2.97 percent.  A U.S. Federal Reserve report showed manufacturing in the
New York region expanded at the fastest pace in nine months,
while German investor confidence jumped the most on record.
 Spain  sold 4.88 billion euros ($6.2 billion) of bills at lower
rates than previous auctions in its first offerings since S&P
cut its  credit rating  by two steps last week.  China’s economy 
grew 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest in more than
two years while topping the median 8.7 percent estimate.  “The economic data broadly exceeded expectations,”  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in
Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “That’s why we had an immediate lift to
the market,” he said. “What the auction in Spain tells me is
that the market is ahead of the rating companies.”  Rally Extended  The  S&P 500  added to last week’s 0.9 percent advance as
trading resumed following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday
yesterday. The index is up about 2.9 percent in 2012 for its

index rose to 13.5, the highest level since April, from a
revised 8.2 in December. Economists projected the gauge would

gains among nine of the 10 main industries in the S&P 500 today.  Earnings Season  Financial shares in the index slipped 0.8 percent as a
group.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
tumbled 8.2 percent, the most since October, after profit
unexpectedly fell amid a slump in trading revenue. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow.  Wells Fargo
& Co. (WFC)  climbed 0.7 percent to $29.83, the highest price since
April, after posting record profit for the fourth quarter and
full year, beating analysts’ estimates as mortgage financing
improved.  Sears Holdings Corp. surged 9.5 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, on speculation that the company may seek to go private.
Carnival Corp. tumbled 14 percent after the Costa Concordia
cruise ship ran aground off the coast of  Italy  on Jan. 13.  S&P 500 companies, which  beat  profit estimates in the
previous 11 quarters, probably will report a 4.6 percent

point to 1.86 percent after increasing four basis points

21.6, the ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
reported.  Greek two-year yields decreased 2.70 percentage points to
163.94 percent. Greece is running out of time to avoid becoming
the first euro nation to default after talks with lenders
stalled ahead of a March 20 bond payment that will cost 14.5
billion euros ($18 billion) the country doesn’t have.  Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  is due to meet tomorrow with
a group representing private Greek bondholders after a five-day
break to discuss forgiving at least half of the nation’s debt in
the euro area’s first sovereign restructuring.  Greece Swap  Greece is insolvent and will default on its debts, Fitch
Ratings Managing Director  Edward Parker  said. The euro area’s
most indebted country is unlikely to be able to honor a March 20
bond payment of 14.5 billion euros ($18 billion), Parker said in
an interview in Stockholm today. Efforts to arrange a private
sector deal on how to handle Greece’s obligations would
constitute a default at Fitch, he said.  Greece is nearing the agreement with private creditors that
would give them cash and securities with a market value of about
32 cents per euro of government debt, according to Bruce
Richards, a hedge-fund manager on the creditors’ committee, who
said he is “highly confident the deal will get done.  Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann 
said he can’t rule out that talks to agree on a debt swap will
fail.  The euro jumped 0.6 percent to 97.87 yen, snapping a two-

gauge of 24 commodities gained 1.2 percent. Oil rose 2 percent
to $100.71 a barrel, snapping a three-day slump, as France
pushed for faster enforcement of Europe’s proposed ban on
Iranian oil.  Natural gas fell for a sixth day on speculation mild
weather will result in below-normal demand, losing 6.8 percent
to $2.488 per million British thermal units, the lowest
settlement price since March 2002.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 2.1 percent, reaching
the highest level since November. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in  Hong Kong 
surged 4.5 percent, the most since Dec. 1. While China’s economy
expanded at the slowest pace in 10 quarters, growth beat the 8.7

easing,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment
Group, which manages $150 billion. “We are hearing China’s
senior leadership is very, very concerned about the outlook in
Europe.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
