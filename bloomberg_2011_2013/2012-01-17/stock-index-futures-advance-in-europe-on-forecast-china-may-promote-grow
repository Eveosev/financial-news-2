European stocks  climbed, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index extending a five-month high, amid
speculation that China’s slowest economic growth in more than
two years will lead to easier monetary policy.  Daimler AG (DAI)  led carmakers higher, rallying 3.8 percent.  Rio
Tinto  Group advanced 2.9 percent after the world’s  third-largest
mining company  said fourth-quarter iron ore production rose to a
record, driven by expansion at its mines and ports in
Australia’s Pilbara region.  The  Stoxx 600  added 0.9 percent to 253.27 at the close,
rallying to its highest level since Aug. 2. The gauge closed
above its 200-day moving average yesterday for the first time
since July.  “The reverse repo announced today is another step along
the policy-easing path initiated a few months ago, which we
would expect to continue through 2012, and this is likely to
support asset prices,” said Gerard Lane, an equity strategist
at Shore Capital in Liverpool, England.  National benchmark indexes climbed in every western-
European market except Luxembourg and Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 Index rose 0.7 percent, Germany’s DAX Index advanced 1.8
percent and France’s CAC 40 Index jumped 1.4 percent.  Gross domestic product  in  China , the world’s second-biggest
economy, increased 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, the statistics bureau said in Beijing. The economy
expanded at the slowest pace in 10 quarters, increasing pressure
on Premier Wen Jiabao to ease monetary policy. Even so, the pace
of growth beat the  median of 26 economist estimates  in a
Bloomberg survey of 8.7 percent.  China Stimulus  The People’s Bank of China said it injected 169 billion
yuan ($26.8 billion) into the financial market through 14-day
reverse-repurchase operations at 5.47 percent, according to a
statement posted on the bank’s website today.  “The positive growth headline and sticky inflation
pressures seemed enough to assure the People’s Bank of China to
choose temporary liquidity injection, via reverse repo, over a
more permanent tool of required-reserve ratio cuts before the
Chinese New Year,” said Wei Yao, the Hong-Kong based economist
for China at Societe Generale SA. The economist said today’s
reverse-repurchase operation was equivalent to a temporary cut
of 20 basis points in the required-reserve ratio.  The Stoxx 600 has  climbed 3.6 percent  in 2012, beginning to
recover from an  11 percent slump  last year when borrowing costs
in Italy and Spain reached euro-era records and governments
struggled to tackle waning growth.  EFSF Rating Downgrade  The European Financial Stability Facility, the euro area’s
bailout fund, lost its top credit rating yesterday at  Standard &
Poor’s  following downgrades of France and Austria on Jan. 13.
The rating company said on Dec. 6 that the loss of an AAA rating
by any of the EFSF’s guarantors may lead to a downgrade. The
EFSF, designed to fund rescue packages for Greece, Ireland and
Portugal partially with bond sales, owed its AAA rating to
guarantees from its sponsoring nations.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s request for German
help to support Italy’s economy reinforces the case for
quantitative easing from the  European Central Bank , according to
Paul Mortimer-Lee, the global head of market economics at BNP
Paribas SA in  London . Monti said it was in  Germany ’s
“enlightened self-interest” to do more to help bring down
borrowing costs for his country and other debt-stricken nations,
the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  German Investor Confidence  A report today showed that German investor confidence
jumped the most on record in January. The ZEW Center for
European Economic Research in Mannheim said its index of
investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict
economic developments six months in advance, surged to minus
21.6 from minus 53.8 in December, the biggest gain since the
index started in December 1991. Economists had forecast a
reading of minus 49.4, the  median of 39 estimates  in a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  Carmakers led gains among the 19 industry groups on the
 Stoxx 600 . Daimler rose 3.8 percent to 40.85 euros and  Renault
SA (RNO)  jumped 2.6 percent to 31.68 euros.  Rio Tinto advanced 2.9 percent to 3,694 pence after saying
that fourth-quarter iron ore production rose to 51.2 million
metric tons in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 50.1 million
tons a year earlier. That compared with a 52 million-ton
estimate from  RBC Capital Markets  and 49.6 million tons from
Credit Suisse Group AG.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  added 1.8 percent to 24.85
pence as a group led by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.
agreed to buy RBS’s aviation division for about $7.3 billion,
the lender’s biggest disposal since its U.K. government bailout
in 2008.  Afren Shares Soar  Afren Plc (AFR)  surged 13 percent to 130.5 pence. The company
said it discovered oil and gas at the Okoro East exploration
well off southeast Nigeria. The well encountered 549 feet of
vertical oil reservoir and 41 feet of gas, Afren said.  IMI Plc (IMI)  advanced 1.1 percent to 879 pence,  Smiths Group Plc (SMIN) 
added 2.4 percent to 960 pence and  Metso OYJ (MEO1V)  climbed 2.8 percent
to 31.19 euros after Exane BNP Paribas SA upgraded the shares to
“outperform” as it raised estimates for the capital-goods
industry, citing the stabilization of leading indicators.  Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCAA)  rallied 9.8 percent to 114.20 kronor
as DS Smith Plc agreed to buy a packaging business from the
Swedish tissue maker for 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) to
become Europe’s largest supplier of recycled cartons for
 consumer goods .  Eni, Essar Energy  Eni SpA (ENI)  rose 1.7 percent to 16.67 euros. The Italian  oil
company  plans to invest more than $600 million in Tunisia in
2012, state-run news agency TAP said, citing the company’s
deputy chairman, Franco Polo.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  plunged 26 percent to 127 pence, its
biggest drop since May 2010 and the largest decline on the  Stoxx
600 (SXXP) , after India’s Supreme Court set aside an earlier judgment
allowing the company’s subsidiary, Essar Oil Ltd., to defer
payment of  sales tax  under an incentive program. Sales tax
collected to date totals $1.25 billion, according to a statement
from the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
