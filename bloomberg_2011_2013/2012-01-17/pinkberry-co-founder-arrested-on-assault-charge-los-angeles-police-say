Young Lee, a co-founder of the
Pinkberry Inc. frozen yogurt business, was arrested yesterday at
 Los Angeles  International Airport for an alleged assault with a
deadly weapon, city police spokesman said.  Lee was taken into custody after arriving on a flight from
 South Korea , said Bruce Borihanh, a Los Angeles Police
Department spokesman, in a telephone interview today.  The assault allegedly occurred in downtown Los Angeles in
June, Borihanh said, adding it isn’t known if Lee had been out
of the U.S. since that time. The spokesman said he had no
additional information on the nature of the alleged attack or
its victim.  Lee, 47, is being held on $60,000 bail at the city’s
Metropolitan Detention Center, he said. Borihanh said he had no
information on any scheduled court appearances or an attorney’s
name for Lee.  Pinkberry’s media relations department didn’t immediately
respond to voice-mail messages seeking comment on the arrest.
Lee co-founded the company with restaurateur Shelly Hwang in
2005, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
