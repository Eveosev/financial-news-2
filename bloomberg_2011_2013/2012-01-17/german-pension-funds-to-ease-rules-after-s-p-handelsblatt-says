Two German pension funds for civil
servants in the federal government may ease their investment
rules for  government bonds  after  Standard & Poorâ€™s  downgraded
euro-area countries, the Interior Ministry said.  Officials in the German Finance and Interior Ministries
have been discussing the change for several weeks, an Interior
Ministry spokesman, who declined to be identified in line with
official policy, said in a phone interview today in Berlin. The
funds, which have holdings worth about 5 billion euros ($6.4
billion), can only invest in bonds rated AAA by all three major
credit-rating companies.  No decision has yet been made, the spokesman said. The plan
was reported earlier in  Handelsblatt newspaper .  To contact the reporters on this story:
