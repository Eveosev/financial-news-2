The zloty gained to its strongest in
two months versus the euro as an index of investor confidence in
 Germany , Poland’s main trading partner, rose the most on record.  The zloty appreciated as much as 1 percent to 4.3603 per
euro, its strongest since Nov. 9, and traded up 0.9 percent by
5:02 p.m. in Warsaw. Polish bonds rose for a second day, cutting
10-year  yields  by four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 5.76 percent, generic data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said today its gauge of investor and analyst expectations surged
to minus 21.6 in January from minus 53.8 in December. Global
stocks rose as  China ’s slowest economic growth in more than two
years fueled speculation monetary policy will ease and  France ’s
funding costs fell yesterday in the first debt auction since
losing its AAA rating at  Standard & Poor’s  last week.  “The zloty is gaining thanks to improvement in the global
mood,” Ernest Pytlarczyk, chief economist at Warsaw-based BRE
Bank SA, said in response to e-mailed questions from Bloomberg.
“Recent bond auctions in Europe, Germany’s ZEW index and news
from China helped the most.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
