Electricite de France SA withdrew
its opposition to a merger between  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  and
 Constellation Energy (CEG)  after reaching an agreement with the U.S.
utilities on the future of a nuclear power venture.  EDF, Constellation’s partner in five U.S. nuclear 
reactors, initially opposed the merger on concern it would 
put “the integrity of its investment” at risk, EDF Chief 
Financial Officer Thomas Piquemal said in a statement today.  “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Exelon
that protects Constellation Energy Nuclear Group’s operational
independence moving forward,” Piquemal said. EDF holds 7.2
percent of Constellation shares.  Exelon’s purchase may “have implications for the
development of new power generation capacity in the region”
because the combined company would hold such a large share of
the market, EDF said in October. EDF was concerned Exelon
would have “strong incentives” to discriminate against the
reactors it co-owns with EDF “financially, operationally and
otherwise,” the Paris-based company said at the time.  The Constellation and EDF joint venture operates five
nuclear plants on three sites in  Maryland  and  New York . Today’s
agreement will be filed with the Maryland Public Service
Commission ``shortly,’’ EDF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
