Tokyo Electric Power Co. decided to
keep an increase in electricity rates for companies to less than
20 percent, backing off from a more aggressive price rise
announced earlier, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  The utility known as Tepco trimmed the rate increase
because of resistances from corporate customers, Nikkei
reported, without saying how it got the information. The higher
rates equate to several hundred billion yen in additional annual
revenue,  Kyodo News  reported. Tepco will announce the plan
today, Nikkei said.  Tepco said its fuel costs will rise by 830 billion yen
($10.8 billion) to 2.31 trillion yen in the year ending March
2012 as it uses more thermal  power plants  to fill the void left
by nuclear plants shut for safety checks. Only two of the
company’s 17 nuclear reactors are now running after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami wrecked its Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant.  Tepco said on Dec. 22 it will raise corporate rates from
April and that the size of the increase will be announced in
January. About 240,000 contracts for corporate customers will be
affected by the new rates, according to Tepco.  The utility then said it will seek approval from the
government to raise tariffs for households “as soon as
possible.” Tepco is considering increasing rates for households
by 10 percent as early as this autumn, Kyodo reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
