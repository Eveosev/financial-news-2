House and condominium sales in
 Southern California  rose 14 percent in December from the
previous month as investors and second-home buyers made a record
share of purchases, DataQuick said.  A total of 19,247 homes sold last month in  Los Angeles ,
Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange
counties, the San Diego-based data seller said today in a
statement. Investors and second-home buyers accounted for 26.4
percent of transactions, up from 25.1 percent in November and
matching a February 2011 peak.  The regional housing market in 2012 “might offer the ‘rock
bottom’ for pricing that many buyers and sellers have been
waiting for,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in the
statement. Foreclosures and short sales, where a home is sold
for less than the amount owed, accounted for more than half of
Southern California sales, pushing values down.  The median price paid in December was $270,000, down 1.8
percent from the previous month and 6.9 percent from a year
earlier. Prices matched the low for 2011 and marked the 10th
consecutive decline on a year-over-year basis, DataQuick said.  November’s sales volume was down 1.4 percent from a year
earlier, the company said.  In a separate report today, the California Association of
Realtors said completed sales of existing single-family homes in
the state rose 3.3 percent from November and 0.1 from December
2010. It was the third gain in a row from the previous month and
sixth straight on an annual basis, according to the Los Angeles-
based group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
