percent to 1,562.71.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures rallied to a record on signs of tighter U.S.
supplies and rising overseas demand for beef, boosting costs for
restaurants.  U.S. exporters shipped 23 percent more beef in the 11
months ended Nov. 30, compared with a year earlier, Department
of Agriculture data show. Retail prices for the meat reached an
all-time high in November, and the cost will rise as much as 5
percent this year, more than any other food except seafood, the
government said.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.3 percent to

months rose 1.4 percent to $8,200 a metric ton ($3.72 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin also advanced in
London.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose to a five-week high on mounting
speculation that China will ease monetary policy, and the
dollar’s decline boosted the appeal of the precious metal as an

$1,655.60 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price reached
$1,668, the highest for a most-active contract since Dec. 13.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 2.1 percent to

Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since March 2002. The

4, 2009.  U.K. gas slumped as milder weather may reduce demand for
heating homes and businesses amid record stockpiles of the fuel.  Gas for summer, the six months from April, slipped as much
as 0.65 pence to 50.6 pence a therm, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest since November 2010.

million Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for the first time in four sessions as German
investor confidence jumped the most on record and as  France 
pushed for faster enforcement of the European Union’s proposed
ban on oil imports from  Iran .  On the Nymex, oil futures for February delivery rose 1.8
percent to $100.50 a barrel.  Brent oil for March settlement declined 23 cents to $111.11
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Statoil ASA, Chevron Corp. and

that better-than-expected economic data in  China , the U.S. and
 Germany  signals higher demand for raw materials.  Cotton for March delivery rose 2.8 percent to settle at
