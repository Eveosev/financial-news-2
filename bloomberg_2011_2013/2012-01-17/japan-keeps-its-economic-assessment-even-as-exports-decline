Japan ’s government maintained its
assessment that the economy is still picking up from the March
earthquake, with exports weakening recently because of slower
global growth.  “There are downside risks that could stem from further
slowing down of less resilient overseas economies due to the
euro zone crisis, which has been a cause for concern” in
financial markets, the Cabinet Office said in a monthly report
in Tokyo today. The government left its evaluation unchanged for
the third consecutive month.  Japan’s exports fell for the second straight month in
November as the stronger yen erodes profits at manufacturers
such as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  The Japanese currency is still
hovering near a postwar high against the dollar, prompting the
Ministry of Finance to say last month it plans to raise the
issuance limit for bills to fund intervention to a record.  The report also stated it was government policy to work
with the  Bank of Japan  to overcome deflation for the first time
since February last year. Consumer prices excluding fresh food
fell 0.2 percent from a year earlier in November after a 0.1
percent decline the previous month.  “The government will also decisively work to overcome
deflation and make an utmost effort to prevent the economy from
falling into a vicious cycle between yen appreciation and
deflation,” the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
