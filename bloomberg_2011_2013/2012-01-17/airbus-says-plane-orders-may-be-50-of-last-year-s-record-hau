Airbus SAS (EAD) , which had record orders
in 2011 to extend its lead over  Boeing Co. (BA) , said demand for its
new aircraft will likely drop by more than 50 percent this year
as an initial flurry of A320neo purchases wanes.  The European planemaker won 1,419 orders last year, beating
its previous high of 1,341 in 2007, the Toulouse, France-based
company said today in a presentation. Airbus, a unit of  European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. , delivered a record 534 planes,
ahead of budget, and predicted deliveries will rise to 570
aircraft in 2012.  The introduction of the A320neo with more efficient engines
unleashed demand from airlines seeking planes that burn less
fuel, helping extend Airbus’s lead over Boeing to a ninth year.
The U.S. planemaker had a net order tally of 805 planes and
deliveries of 477 planes. Both companies boosted production as
demand from  Asia , particularly  China , offset a slowdown in the
mature aviation markets of the U.S. and  Europe .  “Airbus’s record intake is the result of our strategic
decision on the A320neo,” Airbus Chief Executive  Tom Enders 
said in a presentation. “However, the continuous ramp-up to
unprecedented production rates on all programs will demand a
strong focus on the supply chain and our own delivery
capabilities.”  Airbus and Boeing face the challenge of increasing
production and driving sales in an environment where component
suppliers and airlines are encountering financing hurdles amid
the debt crisis.  EADS was little changed in Paris as of 11:16 a.m., after
rising as much as 1.3 percent earlier. The stock has advanced 8
percent in six months, compared with Boeing’s 7.3 percent gain.  Succession Plan   Enders is the most likely candidate to succeed retiring
 Louis Gallois  as CEO of EADS. Gallois today urged investors to
be patient on the succession plan, saying it may not happen
right away.  EADS will have a significant improvement in profitability
this year, Gallois said.  Airbus, which claims a 64 percent market share, expects to
win about 650 orders in 2012, according to Chief Operating
Officer  John Leahy . Only 4 percent of last year’s deliveries
went to North American carriers. The Asia Pacific region
accounted for 32 percent, and Europe 23 percent. Companies that
lease planes took delivery of 22 percent of the total.  Boeing Gathers Steam  Boeing is poised to outpace Airbus in orders this year,
Leahy said. The U.S. planemaker introduced a fuel-saving version
of the single-aisle 737 1 1/2 years after the introduction of
the neo, and demand for the 737 MAX is gathering pace, Leahy
said.  Boeing opted for the upgrade last year rather than an all-
new successor to the 737 NG amid questions about manufacturing
capabilities and competitive pressure from the A320neo.  For Airbus, Enders is increasing production to 42 single-
aisle planes a month by the end of 2012, and 10 wide-body A330
planes by 2013. The planemaker is still studying whether
component makers are in a position to meet a 44-unit target rate
without putting strain on the supply chain and causing delays.  Airbus pushed back the A350’s service entry by as much as
six months on Nov. 10, the project’s second delay, saying some
parts were arriving late. Production delays caused Boeing to
miss delivery goals for new 787 and 747-8 models last year. The
787 was more than three years late when the first plane was
turned over to All Nippon Airways Co. in September.  Production rates of the flagship Airbus A380 double-decker
jet are also on the increase, with 30 deliveries planned for
this year versus 26 in 2011.  Airbus’s tally from last year doesn’t include orders won
from AMR Corp.’s  American Airlines (AAMRQ) , which filed for  bankruptcy
protection  after placing orders with both Airbus and Boeing.
Though  American Airlines  Chief Executive Officer  Tom Horton  has
pledged to follow through on the orders, it may take several
years for the carrier to be in a legal position to buy them,
Leahy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
