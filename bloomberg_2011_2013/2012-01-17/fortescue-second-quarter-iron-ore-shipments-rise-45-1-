Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore producer, said second-quarter
shipments rose a better-than-expected 45 percent as the company
expanded output.  Shipments were 14.4 million metric tons in the three months
to Dec. 31, compared with 9.9 million tons a year earlier,
Perth-based Fortescue said today in a statement. That compares
with its guidance of 13.5 million to 14 million tons and  RBC
Capital Markets ’ forecast of 14 million to 14.5 million tons.  Fortescue, controlled by Australia’s third-richest person
 Andrew Forrest , is spending $8.4 billion to almost triple its
export capacity to 155 million tons a year. Over the next eight
years, global supply needs to rise by at least 100 million tons
each year to meet growing demand and replace operations with
high production costs, according to Rio Tinto Group.  Fortescue rose 2.8 percent to A$4.75 at 11:52 a.m. in
Sydney trading, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in the
benchmark S&P 200/ASX Index.  Iron ore prices fell 19 percent during the quarter to
average $141.27 a ton, according to data from The Steel Index
Ltd. Any price above $100 a ton was “reasonable” and
“sustainable,” Forrest said last month.  Fortescue’s average cost fell to $46.43 a ton, down from
$49.78 a ton in the September quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
