Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said that accusations that incoming defense minister Henry
Rangel Silva has collaborated with rebel groups in  Colombia  are
false and are attacks from “enemies” of his socialist
revolution.  Rangel Silva, who was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury
Department in 2008 for allegedly assisting narcotics trafficking
in neighboring Colombia, was sworn in as the new defense
minister today by Chavez in a nationally televised event in
Caracas.  “The attacks against Rangel Silva have intensified in
recent days, accusing him of I don’t know how many things using
lies,” Chavez said on state television. “They don’t have a
single bit of evidence, it’s all false. If the Venezuelan
bourgeoisie attacks our military chief, it’s because we have a
tremendous military chief.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
