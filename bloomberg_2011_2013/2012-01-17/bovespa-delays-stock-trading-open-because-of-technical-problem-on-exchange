The start of equity trading in  Sao
Paulo  was delayed because of a technical problem on the
Bovespa’s Mega Bolsa System.  There’s no estimate for when trading will begin, according
to  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) ’ press office. The session was scheduled to
open at 11 a.m. local time.  Bovespa-index futures rose 1.2 percent to 61,140 at 11:37
a.m. in Sao Paulo as speculation  China  will ease monetary policy
sparked a commodities rally and boosted the outlook for
Brazilian raw material producers.  Brazil ’s benchmark equity index jumped the most in two
weeks yesterday as stocks linked to domestic demand rallied
after a report showed the country’s economy expanded more than
forecast in November. The measure has risen 5.6 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
