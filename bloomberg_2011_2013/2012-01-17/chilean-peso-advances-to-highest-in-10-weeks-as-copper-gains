Chile ’s peso advanced to its
strongest level in 10 weeks, buoyed by a rally in copper, the
country’s biggest export.  The peso gained 0.6 percent to 496.23 per  U.S. dollar  as of
11:19 a.m. in Santiago from 499.25 per dollar yesterday. It
earlier touched 495.61, the strongest since Nov. 4. The
Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index  gained  0.6
percent.  Copper for March delivery rose as much as 3.4 percent to
$3.759 a pound. Copper accounts for half of exports from Chile,
the world’s largest producer of the metal.  The peso may appreciate as far as a technical level at 490
per dollar, said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  So-called forward points in the Chilean peso non-
deliverable forwards market fell to the lowest since November
after the central bank unexpectedly lowered its benchmark rate
by a quarter point to 5 percent on Jan. 12. Forward points track
the difference in value between the spot and forward peso prices
and function as a measure of interest-rate expectations.  The three-month peso forward rate was 500.72 pesos per
dollar today, from 505.67 pesos per dollar on Jan. 12. The
difference between the three-month forward price of the peso and
the spot price fell to 4.62, the lowest since June, from 5.35 on
Jan. 12.  Forward points are falling “partly because of the change
in  interest rates ,” Cortes said.  The declining differential pushed up basis swaps, a measure
of the cost of borrowing dollars in Chile compared to pesos. The
one-year basis swap rate reached 55 basis points today, up from
33 basis points on Jan. 11.  Offshore investors in the forwards market cut their net
short position in the peso to a one-month low of $5.1 billion on
Jan. 13, the central bank reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
