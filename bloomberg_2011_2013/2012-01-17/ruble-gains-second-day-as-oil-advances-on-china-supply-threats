The ruble strengthened for a second
day against the dollar as the threat of oil supply cuts raised
the price of crude and slowing Chinese economic growth spurred
bets monetary policy will ease.  The Russian currency gained 0.1 percent to 31.65 per dollar
at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, after earlier strengthening as
much as 0.6 percent. The ruble weakened 0.3 percent to 40.25 per
euro and was little changed at 35.5199 versus the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Crude,  Russia ’s main export earner, rose 1.5 percent to
$100.18 a barrel in  New York  after Chinese economic data grew at
the slowest pace in 10 quarters.  France  wants a delay of no more
than three months on a European Union embargo against Iran, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ second-largest
producer, an official with knowledge of the matter said
yesterday.  “People are tired of being cautious” about Russia,  Denis Korshilov , head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities at
Citigroup Inc. In Moscow, said by e-mail. “Oil looks well
supported due to Middle East tensions.”  Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the Russian currency at 32.0632 per
dollar in three months. Russia’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due
2020 rose, pushing the yield down three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.408 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
