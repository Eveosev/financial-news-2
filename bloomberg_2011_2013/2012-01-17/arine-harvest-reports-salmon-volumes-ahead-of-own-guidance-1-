Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) , the world’s
biggest salmon farmer, reported fourth-quarter fish harvest
volumes that were 6 percent higher than its own guidance.  Volumes were 105,000 metric tons compared with a 99,000-ton
guidance from the third quarter, the Oslo-based company said
today in a statement. Operational earnings before interest and
taxes were 390 million kroner ($65 million), helped by an asset
sales gain, while EBIT per kilogram in  Norway  was 4.1 kroner. An
analyst survey by TDN Finans expected Ebit of 343 million
kroner.  “The performance in Norway was largely in line with our
expectations but the overall performance was slightly weaker
than expected, although more in line with consensus,” Henning
Steffenrud, an analyst at First Securities, said in an e-mailed
note.  Marine Harvest rose as much as 3.7 percent in Oslo trading
and was 3 percent higher at 3.258 kroner as of 9:45 a.m. local
time. The  shares  dropped 58 percent last year after two straight
years of gains.  The company, which will release complete fourth-quarter
results on Feb. 8, reported net interest-bearing debt of 6.5
billion kroner at the end of the year, an increase of 5.8
percent over the third quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
