Samsung Group (SAMZ) ,  South Korea ’s largest
industrial group, said it will boost spending to a record 47.8
trillion won ($41.7 billion) this year to continue growth in its
chip and display businesses.  The investment by  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest maker of computer-memory chips, and its affiliates
represents a 12 percent increase from last year, the group said
in an e-mailed statement today. The companies will spend 31
trillion won in capital expenditure, according to the statement.
It didn’t give details on how the money will be allocated.  The investment may help further cement Samsung’s leadership
in electronics at a time when competitors have cut spending amid
slowing growth in the global economy. More than 70 percent of
the group companies’ planned capex probably will be spent by
Samsung Electronics, with a focus on mobile-phone chips and
next-generation displays for phones and TVs, said Song Myung Sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul .  “They are looking at the future,” Song said. “They are
turning their focus to areas that are growing rapidly.”  Samsung Electronics  shares  gained 0.6 percent to 1,036,000
won at the close of trading in Seoul, while the benchmark Kospi
index rose 1.8 percent.  Bond Issue  Today’s announcement follows comments by Samsung
Electronics Chairman Lee Kun Hee earlier this month that the
company needs to continue expanding investment and hiring.  Samsung companies, whose 2010 sales were equivalent to one-
fifth of South Korea’s gross domestic product, plan to add
26,000 employees this year in what will also be the group’s
largest-ever hiring, it said in today’s statement.  South Korean competitor LG Group, whose units include  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570) , said Jan. 13 it will reduce spending by 15
percent this year.  Samsung Electronics said yesterday it plans to issue its
first overseas bonds since 1997 to expand production capacity at
its Austin, Texas, chip factory, where processors used in mobile
devices such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone are manufactured.  Samsung may almost double spending on its logic-chip
business, which oversees manufacturing of Apple-designed A4 and
A5 processors, to a record 8 trillion won this year, Shin Hyun Joon, a Seoul-based analyst at Dongbu Securities Co., said
yesterday.  Operating profit at the business probably more than doubled
in 2011 and may increase 82 percent this year, according to an
estimate by Korea Investment & Securities Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
