Vietnam ’s dong gained the most in
five weeks on speculation banks need more cash as the end of the
year approaches. The five-year bonds were little unchanged.  The dong rose 0.2 percent to 20,998 per dollar as of 5:00
p.m. in Hanoi, the most since Dec. 13, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate 
at 20,828 per dollar, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent either side of the
official rate.  “Banks are in need of cash as residents withdraw deposits
ahead of Lunar New Year,” Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-
based analyst at Viet Capital Securities, said in a phone
interview.  The Southeast Asian nation will celebrate the Lunar New
Year, also known as the Tet festival, next week, from Jan. 23 to
Jan. 27.  Yields (GGVN5YR)  on five-year debt were little changed at 12.46
percent, according to daily fixings from banks compiled by
