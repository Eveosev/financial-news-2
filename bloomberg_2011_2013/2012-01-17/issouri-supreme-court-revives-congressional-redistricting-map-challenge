The  Missouri (STOMO1)   Supreme Court 
reinstated two legal challenges to the state legislature’s new
U.S. congressional district map, saying objections raised to the
boundaries warrant examination by a judge.  A lower court judge erred in rejecting without a hearing
the challengers’ contention that some of the new districts
weren’t drawn as compactly as the law requires, the state high
court said today in a 15-page ruling.  Slow  population growth  compared with that of other states,
as documented by the 2010  U.S. Census , required Missouri
lawmakers to eliminate one of its nine districts, the high court
said. Legislators adopted the new map over the objections of
Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, by overriding his veto in May.  “This court makes no prejudgment on these issues or on the
compactness of other districts, other than to hold that the
plaintiffs have stated a claim as to the compactness of the
districts that is subject to proof and defenses in accordance
with the evidence as in any other lawsuit,” the justices wrote.  The Supreme Court ordered Cole County Circuit Court Judge
Daniel R. Green to conduct a hearing and rule on the map’s
viability no later than Feb. 3. The Cole County seat is
 Missouri ’s state capital, Jefferson City.  A primary election for Missouri state and federal
legislators is slated for Aug. 7, said Ryan Hobart, a spokesman
for Secretary of State  Robin Carnahan .  The cases are Pearson v. Koster, SC92200, and McClatchey v.
Carnahan, SC92003, Supreme Court of Missouri.  To contact the reporter on this story:
