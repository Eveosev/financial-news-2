KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole
copper producer, jumped to a six-week high as the metal surged
on demand prospects following stronger-than-expected economic
growth in  China .  KGHM shares climbed 3.2 percent to 128 zloty at 1:55 p.m.
in Warsaw, the highest level since Dec. 6. That helped push
Poland’s WIG20 Index 2 percent higher in a second day of gains.  Copper neared a four-month high in New York trading after
Chinese gross domestic product expanded 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter, higher than the 8.7 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts. The country is the biggest global
copper consumer.  Poland’s government today approved a draft law to tax
copper and silver production after the  Finance Ministry  proposed
lowering the maximum level for a new mining levy, PAP newswire
reported, citing Deputy Finance Minister Maciej Grabowski. The
country, which holds a 32 percent stake in KGHM, plans to raise
about 1.8 billion zloty ($527 million) from the tax this year to
raise revenue and narrow its  budget deficit . The government
plans to introduce the measure as early as in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
