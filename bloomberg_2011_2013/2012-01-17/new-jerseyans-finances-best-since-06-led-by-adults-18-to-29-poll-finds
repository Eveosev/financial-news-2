One-third of  New Jersey  residents
say their finances have improved in the past year, the highest
percentage since 2006, with the most improvement among adults
age 18 to 29, a poll found.  The 32 percent of New Jerseyans who said they are better
off than they were last year is up seven percentage points from
January 2011, according to a survey by Fairleigh Dickinson
University’s  Silberman College of Business . Forty-one percent
said they are worse off, the lowest percentage since 2008.  Unemployment (USUSNJ)  remains a concern, with 63 percent of New
Jersey residents saying they or someone close to them has lost a
job in the past year, little changed from 65 percent in a
January 2011 poll. The percentage of respondents who are
somewhat or very concerned about getting fired remains at 32
percent. Those saying business conditions will improve was
steady at 54 percent, while those predicting it will improve
declined by 5 points to 21 percent.  “People are not necessarily more optimistic,” Sorin
Tuluca, a finance professor at the business school in Madison,
New Jersey, said in a statement accompanying the poll. “But
they are definitely less pessimistic.”  New Jersey’s unemployment rate was 9.1 percent in November,
down from 9.2 percent a year earlier. The rate averaged 9.5
percent in 2010, more than double the 2007 rate of 4.3 percent,
according to  data  from the New Jersey Labor Department.  Fed Index  The Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s coincident index for New
Jersey, a gauge of state-level economic conditions, has climbed
2 percent since January 2011 and is the highest since 2008. The
 index  is a composite of economic data, including nonfarm
employment, the jobless rate, average hours worked in
manufacturing and wages.  The telephone survey of 660 adults throughout New Jersey
who participate in their household financial decisions was
sponsored by Silberman and conducted by Fairleigh’s PublicMind
polling institute from Jan. 2-8. It has a margin of error of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
