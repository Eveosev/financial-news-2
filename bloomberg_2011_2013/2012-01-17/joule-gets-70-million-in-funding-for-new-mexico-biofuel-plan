Joule Unlimited Inc. , a closely held
biofuel developer, received $70 million in venture funding to
support the start of a test plant in  New Mexico  this summer.  The funds are the third round for a total of $110 million
in financing, the company said today in a statement. Founding
backer Flagship Ventures participated as well as other investors
Joule didn’t identify. Proceeds also will support research and
global expansion plans.  The facility in Hobbs will help with testing of the
company’s technology from its  Massachusetts  laboratory and Texas
pilot plant.  Joule, based in Bedford, Massachusetts, is developing a
process that uses genetically modified photosynthetic
microorganisms to make diesel, ethanol and chemicals from
sunlight and carbon dioxide.  The Hobbs plant will be as large as 5 acres (2 hectares)
initially, according to a  presentation  by Chief Executive
Officer Bill Sims in November. It may be expanded to 1,000 acres
to accommodate commercial production, Joule said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
