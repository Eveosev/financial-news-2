Senex Energy Ltd. (SXY) , a shale-gas and
oil explorer in  Australia , closed little changed in Sydney
trading after a newspaper report said  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK)  may be
considering a bid for the company.  Senex  increased  as much as 5.9 percent to 90 Australian
cents, the highest price since March 2000, after advancing 10
percent yesterday. The stock closed today at 84 Australian cents,
1.2 percent lower. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index was 1.7
percent higher and AGL Energy gained 0.7 percent to A$14.71.  Total SA (FP) ,  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and Arrow Energy Ltd., owned by
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, may also be looking at the company, the
Australian Financial Review said in its Street Talk column,
without saying where it got the information. Ian Davies,
managing director of Brisbane-based Senex, said last year the
explorer had initial talks with international energy producers
interested in a potential partnership.  Davies declined to comment on the newspaper report when
reached by telephone today. AGL doesnâ€™t comment on speculation,
Nathan Vass, a Sydney-based spokesman for the company, said in
an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
