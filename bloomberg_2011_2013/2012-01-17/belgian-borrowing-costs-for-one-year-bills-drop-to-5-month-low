Belgium  sold 2.96 billion euros of
3-month and 12-month treasury bills, compared with a target of 3
billion euros, as borrowing costs for one-year debt fell to the
lowest level in five months.  The debt agency in Brussels said it sold 1.2 billion euros
of 12-month securities at a weighted average yield of 1.162
percent, compared with 2.167 percent at the previous auction on
Dec. 13. Demand for the one-year debt was 2.06 times the amount
sold, down from 2.21 times in December.  Investors also bought 1.76 billion euros of three-month
bills at an average yield of 0.429 percent, compared with 0.264
percent in the previous sale on Jan. 3. They sought 2.24 times
the amount sold, up from 2.13 times two weeks ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
