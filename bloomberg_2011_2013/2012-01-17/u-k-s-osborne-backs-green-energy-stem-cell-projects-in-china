U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  backed joint scientific research projects into
 stem cells  and green energy with  China  as he sought to forge
links with companies in the world’s fastest growing economy.  The U.K. will invest 3 million pounds ($4.6 million) in
work carried out by the  Research Councils U.K. Energy Programme 
and the National Natural Science Foundation of China to develop
electricity generation on a small scale, the British Embassy in
Beijing said today. The U.K.  Medical Research Council  and the
same Chinese body will each invest 420,000 pounds in joint stem-
cell research.  “The U.K. has ambitious plans to engage with China on a
range of research projects,” Osborne said in a statement
released by the embassy. “Our research partnership recognizes
the priorities and strengths of the two countries.”  Osborne is on a three-day tour of  Asia , during which he’s
seeking to expand commercial ties with China and Japan.
Yesterday, he called for London to expand its role as an
offshore trading center for the Chinese yuan as Europe’s
deepening debt crisis prompts Britain to seek new growth
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
