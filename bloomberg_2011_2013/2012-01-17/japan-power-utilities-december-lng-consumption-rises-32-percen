Japan ’s power utilities increased
consumption of liquefied natural gas by 32 percent in December
as most of the country’s nuclear power stations remain idled for
checks after the Fukushima disaster.  Power companies led by  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  used 4.98
million metric tons of LNG last month, up from 3.76 million tons
a year earlier, according to data released by the Federation of
Electric Power Companies today.  Crude-oil use increased more than fivefold to 1.39 million
kiloliters, while fuel-oil consumption almost tripled to 1.36
million kiloliters, according to the data.  The average operating rate of nuclear plants in December
was 15 percent, down from 68 percent last year, it said. Japan
had six reactors operating with capacity of 5,624 megawatts, or
11 percent of the total, at the end of December as plants
undergo extensive safety checks following the meltdowns at  Tokyo
Electric ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi station in March.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of  fuel oil , crude, LNG and coal for December.
Fuel oil and crude volumes are in kiloliters, while those for
LNG and coal are in tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
