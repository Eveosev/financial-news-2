Highland Crusader Holding Corp.
asked a  New York  state court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by  UBS
AG (UBS)  seeking damages of more than $686 million for alleged
fraudulent conveyances and tortious interference.  UBS,  Switzerland ’s biggest lender, sued Highland Crusader
in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan  in September,
claiming the hedge fund “fraudulently induced” the bank to
restructure a collateralized debt obligation transaction in
2008.  Most of the lawsuit is a “rote regurgitation” of claims
that have been raised in the past against the fund’s parent,
Highland Capital Management LP, and dismissed, Highland Crusader
said in court documents filed yesterday.  “Here we go again,” Highland Crusader said in the filing.
The company called the Zurich-based bank’s complaint “yet
another fatally flawed attempt to impose contractual liability
on a Highland Capital Management LP managed third party based on
flimsy allegations and dismissed claims.”  Highland Capital, founded by James Dondero and Mark Okada
in  Dallas  in 1993, announced plans in October 2008 to close its
flagship Crusader Fund and the Highland Credit Strategies Fund
over a three-year period after suffering losses on high-yield,
high-risk loans and other types of debt.  The UBS communications office didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment on the filing.  The case is UBS Securities LLC v. Highland Crusader Holding
Corp., 652646/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
