Japanese  stocks  rose, following a
rebound in European markets, as investors shrugged off  Standard
& Poor’s  downgrade of  France  and eight other European countries.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co., which depends on  Europe  for about
40 percent of its sales, climbed 2.2 percent after French
borrowing costs eased and the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rose for
the first time in four days.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of factory
robots that counts  Asia  as its biggest market, gained 3.2
percent after  China  said its economy grew more than analysts
expected. Builders rose the most among the 33 industry groups on
the  Topix (TPX)  Index amid speculation post-disaster reconstruction
will boost earnings.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 1.1 percent to 8,466.40
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix advanced 0.9
percent to 731.53. Both gauges dropped yesterday after S&P’s cut
credit ratings for nine European countries.  “European markets didn’t take the downgrades very
seriously and that reassured investors,” said Kenji Sekiguchi,
general manager at Mitsubishi　UFJ Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of $75　billion. “Japanese stocks are
basically following the European markets.”  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 0.8 percent yesterday,
snapping three days of losses, as French borrowing costs fell at
the country’s first debt auction since S&P stripped Europe’s
second-biggest economy of its AAA rating. Stock markets in the
U.S. were closed yesterday for a holiday.  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  climbed 0.6 percent today.  Nippon Sheet Glass (5202)  rose 2.2 percent to 137 yen. Makita
Corp., a maker of power tools that counts Europe as its biggest
market, leapt 3.9 percent to 2,608 yen.  China Growth  China’s gross domestic product rose 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
in Beijing today, beating the median forecast of economists for
8.7 percent growth. The economy expanded less than 9 percent for
the first time since mid-2009, based on previously reported data.  Fanuc gained 3.2 percent to 11,970 yen. Kubota Corp., a
maker of farming equipment that gets almost 20 percent of its
sales in Asia, advanced 2.8 percent to 668 yen.  “China’s senior leadership is very, very concerned about
the outlook in Europe, which tells you the bias is to ease
policy more than they have already,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-
based chief investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at
Russell Investment Group, which manages $150 billion.  Obayashi, (1802)   Japan  Bridge  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 0.4 percent this year, compared with a
2.5 percent gain by the  S&P 500  and a 2.7 percent increase by
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in Japan’s broadest benchmark
are valued at 15.1 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 12.3 times for the S&P 500 and 10.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Obayashi Road Corp. and other construction companies
advanced on expectation the companies will benefit as Japan
rebuilds from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Obayashi 
surged 21 percent to 286 yen, extending yesterday’s 14 percent
gain. Japan Bridge Corp. soared 16 percent to 728 yen.  “Construction-related shares may extend their gains
through May on earnings,” said Hiroki Kawashima, a Tokyo-based
analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “There may be broad
selling after earnings reports are released.”  Japan Steel Works Ltd. (5631) , the world’s only builder of the
pressure vessels that hold radioactivity inside reactors,
gained the most on the  Nikkei 225. (NKY)  Shares advanced 6.6 percent
to 568 yen after Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the
government may allow nuclear plants to be restarted as early as
April following shutdowns in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.  To contact the reporter. on this story:
