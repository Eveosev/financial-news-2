The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
commodity shipping costs, fell below 1,000 points for the first
time since January 2009 on signs Chinese demand for  iron ore 
cargoes is slowing, exacerbating a glut of vessels.  The index slid for a 20th session to 974 points, extending
this year’s slump to 44 percent, data from the London-based
Baltic Exchange show. Charter rates fell for all four vessel
types within the gauge. The largest decline was for  capesizes 
carrying the steelmaking raw material, which fell 8.3 percent.  Weakening demand for iron ore in China, the biggest
consumer, is resulting in fewer charters of the vessels, said
Kasper Moller, director of shipbroker Maersk Broker  Asia .
Capesizes represent about 40 percent of the global fleet of
commodity carriers, estimates Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest
shipbroker.  “If the Chinese market just takes its foot off the
accelerator for a second that has an immediate impact,” Moller
said by phone from Beijing today. “We’re having a lot of new
ships being delivered, too.”  China , the biggest source of global shipping demand, is
slowing iron ore  imports  before Lunar New Year holidays that
start on Jan. 23, Oslo-based RS Platou Markets AS said
yesterday. Weather-related port disruption curbed shipments from
Australia and  Brazil  while rains in Colombia and  Indonesia  have
constrained coal exports.  The slowdown coincides with deliveries of new ships that
are expanding faster than demand, according to Maersk Broker.
Trade will swell 8 percent this year compared with 12 percent
for the fleet, it estimates.  Returns for capesize vessels slumped to $7,793 a day, the
lowest since May 20 and a 76 percent decline from their 2011
high of $32,889, set on Dec. 12, exchange data show. Average
earnings fell for the other three classes of dry bulk vessels
tracked by the gauge, with hire rates for  panamaxes , the largest
to transit the Panama Canal, at a 33-month low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
