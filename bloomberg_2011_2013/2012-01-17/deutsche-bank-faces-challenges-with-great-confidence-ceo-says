Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  said Germany’s largest lender is
confident it can overcome the challenges presented by Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis and tighter regulation as it enters 2012.  “We at Deutsche Bank approach these challenges with great
confidence,” he said, according to the copy of a speech to be
delivered in Frankfurt tonight. “We banks simply have to
overcome the new commercial realities.”  Citing higher  capital requirements  for banks and new limits
on certain financial activities, Ackermann said the adjustment
process “won’t be without pain.”  Consolidation among banks will rise as state-supported
lenders shrink and face capital shortages, he said. The five
biggest banks are likely to boost their market share in areas
such as fixed income, sales and trading as smaller competitors
exit the market, he said.  He warned against giving up on  Europe ’s common currency and
said “the euro won’t fail.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
