Thailand ’s government plans to spend
17 billion baht ($535 million) to buy rubber at above-market
rates to boost prices, Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce
Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said.  The government, through Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives, will provide funding worth 15 billion
baht to state-run Rubber Estate Organization and grower
cooperatives to buy rubber until the  local price  reaches 120
baht per kilogram, Kittiratt told reporters today. The plan will
be sent for Cabinet approval next week.  State-owned Bank for Agriculture will separately extend
another 2 billion baht to farmer cooperatives for purchasing
rubber above the market rates, Kittiratt said.  The plan is aimed at bolstering domestic prices after a 29
percent slump last year. Higher Thai prices could extend gains
on rubber futures, which have risen 10 percent this year.  “The appropriate and sustainable level for rubber is 120
baht per kilogram,” Agriculture Minister Theera Wongsamut said
to reporters today in Bangkok.  The June-delivery contract advanced 3.8 percent to 291 yen
a kilogram ($3,796 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, the highest settlement price for a most-active
contract since Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
