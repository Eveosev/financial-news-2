The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
question the legal immunity of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority and other private organizations that oversee the
country’s financial markets.  The justices today rejected an appeal from a securities
firm that accused Finra, as the brokerage-industry oversight
body is known, of misleading members about the potential cost to
them of its 2007 merger with the  New York  Stock Exchange’s
oversight unit.  The suit by Standard Investment Chartered Inc. also named
current and former Finra officers, including  Mary Schapiro , now
the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The suit centered on the proxy solicitation Finra issued in
2006 to change its bylaws to match those of the NYSE. Finra was
known as the National Association of Securities Dealers at the
time.  Standard Investment argued in its appeal that so-called
self-regulatory organizations are entitled to immunity only when
they are directly performing a duty on behalf of the government.
In throwing out the suit, a federal appeals court in New York
said those organizations also are immune for actions they take
“incident to” their regulatory functions.  Finra is one of more than 30 self-regulatory organizations
registered with the SEC. Standard Investment is based in  Costa
Mesa , California.  The case is Standard Investment Chartered v. National
Association of Securities Dealers, 11-381.  To contact the reporter on this story:
