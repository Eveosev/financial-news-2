German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
government shouldn’t keep the euro area intact at any price if
other countries balk at tough economic revamping,  Anton Boerner ,
the head of the country’s BGA exporters’ lobby, was quoted as
saying by  Handelsblatt .  The fact that  Germany  benefits massively from the euro
doesn’t mean the country should give in to political pressure
just to save the joint currency, the Dusseldorf-based
newspaper’s online edition quoted Boerner as saying in comments
published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
