Two funds, one controlled by
billionaire Kenneth Dart, may get a  U.S. Supreme Court (1000L)  hearing
in their legal fight to collect at least $2 billion owed by the
government of  Argentina .  The justices today asked the Obama administration for
advice on an appeal by Dart’s EM Ltd. and NML Capital Ltd., an
affiliate of the New York-based hedge fund Elliott Associates
LP, in a multi-pronged dispute stemming from Argentina’s 2001
default on $95 billion of bonds.  The funds, which refused to exchange their securities in a
2005 Argentine debt swap, are seeking to enforce $2 billion in
judgments they have won in U.S. court cases.  In the case acted on today, EM and NML are trying to seize
$100 million in Argentine central bank assets being held at the
Federal Reserve Bank in  New York . A federal appeals court said
that money is shielded under the U.S. Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act.  Dart is president of Mason, Michigan-based Dart Container
Corp., the world’s largest maker of foam cups. He gave up his
U.S. citizenship in the 1990s to avoid taxes and moved to the
 Cayman Islands .  Justice  Sonia Sotomayor  didn’t take part in today’s order.
She was involved in the litigation over Argentina’s bonds as an
appeals court judge.  The case is EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 11-604.  To contact the reporter on this story:
