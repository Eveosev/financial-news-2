LR Group Ltd., a closely held
Israeli company that provides infrastructure consulting services
to  developing countries , will help  Honduras  install as many as
500,000 smart meters by 2015 to fight energy theft.  The $300 million project has been approved by Honduras’s
government-owned utility Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica
and may be endorsed by lawmakers within two weeks, Gabi Nahum,
chief executive officer of Herzliya, Israel-based LR Group, said
in a telephone interview yesterday.  The smart meters will be placed at homes and atop  power
lines  and will allow ENEE to remotely cut off customers that are
consuming more energy than they’re paying for, Nahum said.  “This will revolutionize the way Honduras’s electricity
system works,” he said. “It will raise ENEE’s income,”
allowing it to invest more in supply.  The project, which has been in planning for two years,
includes a new billing system and training, he said.  ENEE, based in Tegucigalpa, doesn’t get paid for about 30
percent of the power it delivers due to so-called non-technical
losses, which includes energy theft, he said.  The utility may install in May the first meters on
transformers to gauge power consumption in specific areas and
may deploy them to monitor individual customers’ usage by the
end of the year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
