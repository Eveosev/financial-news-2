Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s biggest hotel
company, said sales rose 2.5 percent in 2011 and confirmed its
profit forecast, boosted by growth in economy lodgings.  Revenue climbed to 6.1 billion euros ($7.8 billion) from
5.95 billion euros in 2010, the Paris-based owner of the Novotel
and Ibis brands said in a statement today. The average estimate
of 17 analysts in a  Bloomberg survey  was 6.17 billion euros.
Fourth-quarter sales fell 1.1 percent to 1.5 billion euros,
affected by Accor’s strategy of selling and leasing back hotels.  The French hotelier, which generates 73 percent of  sales  in
Europe, is renovating economy lodges and combining them under
the Ibis brand to win travelers. Accor reiterated its October
forecast for 2011 earnings before interest and taxes of as much
as 530 million euros. The results will be reported on Feb. 22.  “Demand remained strong in the main European markets, in
 emerging markets  and in the U.S.,” the company said, while
“the situation in southern Europe continued to deteriorate.”  Accor has exited catering and casino businesses to focus on
hotels. To cut debt, the company is selling hotel freeholds,
while signing agreements to operate or franchise most of them.  Accor “significantly” exceeded its expansion target in
2011, the company said in the statement. The company opened
almost 39,000 rooms during the year.  In Europe, there is no growth in supply and 87 percent of
Accor’s expansion has been through the conversion of hotels from
competing brands, or independent lodgings, Chief Financial
Officer Sophie Stabile said on a conference call with analysts.
She said there was a “good trend” in asset sales last year and
that there’s no change in the environment this year.  The sales figures were released after markets closed. Accor
slipped 0.3 percent to 21.08 euros in Paris trading today. The
shares fell 41 percent last year compared with the 16 percent
decline of the  Stoxx 600 travel/leisure index.   To contact the reporter on this story:
