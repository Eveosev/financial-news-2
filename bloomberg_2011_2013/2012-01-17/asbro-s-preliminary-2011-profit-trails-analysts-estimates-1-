Hasbro Inc. (HAS) , the world’s second-
largest toymaker, reported preliminary full-year earnings per
share that trailed analysts’ estimates after sales growth in the
fourth quarter was weaker than expected.  Profit in 2011 may have risen as much as 4 percent to $2.85
per share, the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company said today
in a statement. Analysts projected $2.87, the average of 11
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said fourth-quarter
revenue growth “underperformed” in the U.S. and Canada during
the  holiday shopping season . Sales in that period probably
advanced to $1.33 billion, trailing the $1.39 billion average of
10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Hasbro  rose  1.2 percent to $33.07 at 12:12 p.m. in New
York. The shares declined 32 percent last year.  The company plans to report full fourth-quarter results on
Feb. 6.  Mattel Inc. (MAT)  is the world’s largest toymaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
