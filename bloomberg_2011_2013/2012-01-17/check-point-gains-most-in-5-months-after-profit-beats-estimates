Check Point Software Technologies
Ltd. (CHKP)  headed for its biggest gain in five months after the
world’s second largest maker of network-security equipment said
fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts’ forecasts.  Shares of the Tel Aviv-based company  rose  7 percent to
$54.44 at 2:55 p.m. in New York, poised for the biggest advance
since Aug. 11. Check Point was the third biggest gainer on the
 Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index  of the largest Israeli companies
traded in New York, which advanced 1.7 percent to 90.72.  Check Point  reported  fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 84
cents per shares, above the 81-cent forecast by 25  analysts 
surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit increased to $159.8 million from
$137.4 million in the year-earlier period as revenue rose 12
percent to $356.8 million, the company said in a statement
published by Marketwire.  The company reported “a very clean and solid quarter
alleviating some recent unfounded concerns about product
growth,” Shaul Eyal, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New
York, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “The Check Point story
remains on very solid ground, and we believe its high end
appliances could become a growth driver in 2012 and beyond.”  ‘Cyber Attacks’  Check Point, whose  customers  include Hewlett-Packard Co.,
International Business Machines Corp. and Dell Inc., is
benefiting from rising demand for corporate security spending.
Websites operated by the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange,  El Al Israel
Airlines Ltd. (ELAL) , and First International Bank Ltd. were attacked
yesterday by Internet hackers.  “As cyber attacks and security risks reach new levels of
sophistication, customer expectations for their security
infrastructure also increase,” Chief Executive Gil Shwed said
in the statement. The company predicts 2012 adjusted earnings
per share of $3.10 to $3.20, compared with $2.87 in 2011.  Shares will probably climb 30 percent to $70 in the next 12
months, Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, wrote in
an e-mailed report today, raising the forecast from a previous
$65 target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
