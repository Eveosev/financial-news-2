Directors of listed companies should
describe the effect of volatile  currency markets  and government
budget cuts on their international business in investor reports,
a U.K. accounting regulator said.  Reports should also review the implications of “one or
more euro area countries being forced to exit the euro area,”
the  Financial Reporting Council  said in an e-mailed statement.  Greece  and its creditors are yet to agree on the details of
a debt reduction package, more than two months after the nation
agreed to cut public spending in return for a 50 percent write-
off on the face value of its debt. The U.K.’s bank regulator,
the  Financial Services Authority , last year told lenders to
prepare contingency plans for the possibility of a country
leaving the single European currency.  “Directors of companies in the U.K. are trying to assess 
the risks to their companies’ business models in difficult and
rapidly changing economic conditions,” Stephen Haddrill, chief
executive officer of the FRC, said in the statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
