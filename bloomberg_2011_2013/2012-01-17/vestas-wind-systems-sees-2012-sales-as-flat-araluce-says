Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest wind-turbine maker, expects sales to be “flat” this
year compared with 2011, said Juan Araluce, chairman of the
company’s Mediterranean unit.  Higher sales in  emerging markets  are likely to offset
declines in the U.S. and Europe, he said in an interview at an
alternative energy conference in Abu Dhabi.  “To get back to really healthy sales growth, we need to
see the recovery in mature markets,” Araluce said. Vestas wants
to expand in Asia,  Latin America , Africa and the  Middle East , he
said.  The Danish company announced a 10 percent cut in its staff
on Jan. 12, as it tries to compete with Chinese suppliers and
cope with weaker demand in developed nations. Araluce will
become chief sales officer in a management reorganization that
takes effect Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
