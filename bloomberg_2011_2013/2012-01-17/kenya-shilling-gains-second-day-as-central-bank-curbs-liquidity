Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day as the central bank offered to tighten liquidity
through repurchase agreements.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 1.5 percent to 85.60 per dollar and traded 0.8
percent stronger at 86.25 at 12:58 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at
that level will be the highest level since Jan. 3.  The Central Bank of Kenya offered 500 million shillings
($5.8 million) of seven-day repurchase agreements, a bank
official, who did not wish to be identified in line with the
bank’s policy, said by phone today from Nairobi. In a repurchase
agreement an investor agrees to sell a security to another
trader, while at the same time arranging to buy it back at a
future date and at a pre-determined price.  “The shilling is strengthening due to the continued
operations of the central bank to curb  money supply  in the
market through its repurchase agreements,” Jeremiah Kendagor,
acting head of trading at Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank
Ltd., said today in a phone interview.  Tanzania’s shilling strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,583
againt the dollar and  Uganda ’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent
to 2,414.95.  -- Editors: Linda Shen, Alex Nicholson  To contact the reporter on this story:
