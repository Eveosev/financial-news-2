Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HDD) , the
world’s biggest maker of printers, plans to cut as many as 2,000
 jobs  globally to help it meet earnings targets.  The manufacturer aims to save 180 million euros ($229
million) by reducing capacity over the next two years, the
Heidelberg, Germany-based company said in a statement today.
Heidelberger is targeting operating profit before one-time items
of 150 million euros in the fiscal year ending March 2014.  Heidelberger is suffering as the volume of printed material
is shrinking and banks curtail financing of machinery among
small and mid-sized customers. The slump led competitor
Manroland AG to enter insolvency and bids are being received for
different divisions. The financial struggle of a competitor is
making customers more cautious, Heidelberger said.  “As expected, the economic uncertainties have made the
industry more reluctant to invest and resulted in weaker
demand,” the company said. “The interim insolvency of a
competitor is exacerbating this situation.”  Shares (HDD)  of Heidelberg jumped as much as 5.1 percent. The
stock fell 3 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 1.64 euros at 1.01 p.m.
in Frankfurt, valuing the company at 383 million euros.  The printer said  sales  in the quarter ended Dec. 31 were
little changed from the previous period at about 630 million
euros, with the order intake falling 4.2 percent. The operating
loss narrowed to 19 million euros, from 26 million euros a year
earlier.  Around 1,200 jobs in  Germany  will go, with the remainder
being cut abroad. The move will reduce production capacity  by
around 15 percent. The company had 15,666 employees as of Dec.
31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
