Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  needs to resign as he’s responsible for the country’s
economic problems and its political isolation, writer Gyorgy Konrad said in Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  “A junk country has a junk government and a junk prime
minister,” Konrad said in a four-column editorial on the front
page of the newspaper’s culture and arts section published
today. He was referring to Standard and Poor’s downgrade of the
country’s debt to junk last month. “Orban needs to go.”  Konrad, 78, a Hungarian novelist and essayist, was a
dissident under the communist regime in  Hungary  in the 1970s and
1980s and during that period was imprisoned for some time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
