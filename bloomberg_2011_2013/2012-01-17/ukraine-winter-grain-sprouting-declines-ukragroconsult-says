Sprouting of Ukraineâ€™s winter grains
declined after drought in the autumn, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  Winter grains, mostly winter wheat, sprouted on 83.3
percent of the planted area by Jan. 12, compared with almost 100
percent at the same point a year earlier, Liza Malyshko, a grain
analyst at the Kiev-based agricultural researcher, said today by
phone.  Winter crops in good condition covered 1.88 million
hectares (4.64 million acres), or 26.7 percent of the planted
area, she said. Plants rated as satisfactory accounted for 39.9
percent of the area, or 2.79 million hectares, the researcher
said.  About 2.3 million hectares, or 33.4 percent of the planted
area, had plants in poor condition, Malyshko said. Plants failed
to sprout on 1.4 million hectares, she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
