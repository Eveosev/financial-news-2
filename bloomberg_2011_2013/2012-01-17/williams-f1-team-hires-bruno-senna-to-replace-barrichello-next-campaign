The Williams Formula One team hired
Bruno Senna, the nephew of three-time champion Ayrton, who died
in 1994 while racing for the team.  Bruno Senna, 28, will replace 39-year-old Brazilian
compatriot  Rubens Barrichello , Grove, England-based Williams
said in an e-mailed statement. Barrichello, a former teammate of
seven-time champion  Michael Schumacher  at Ferrari, started 322
Grands Prix since 1993.  Senna drove for Hispania Racing team in 2010, and had eight
races for  Lotus Renault  last season. He’ll be the teammate of
Pastor Maldonado at Williams next season.  “It will be very interesting to drive for a team that my
uncle had driven for, particularly as quite a few of the people
here actually worked with Ayrton,” Senna said in a team
statement. “Hopefully we can bring back some memories and
create some great new ones too.”  Ayrton Senna was killed when he lost control of his
Williams car and it crashed into a wall at the San Marino Grand
Prix in Imola,  Italy . Italian prosecutors blamed poor
workmanship for the car’s steering column snapping. Team
officials were cleared of wrongdoing in trials in 1997 and 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
