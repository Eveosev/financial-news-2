Chinese stocks  in the U.S. rose for
the first time in four trading days amid speculation policy
makers may ease lending curbs after the world’s second-largest
economy expanded at the slowest pace in 10 quarters.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  advanced 1.1 percent to
100.68 in New York yesterday, the highest level in a week.
Software provider  AsiaInfo-Linkage Inc. (ASIA)  jumped the most since
October as Jefferies International Ltd. reiterated a “buy”
recommendation on the stock.  Aluminum Corp of China , the
nation’s biggest maker of the metal, surged to the highest in
more than a month as commodities prices rose the most in two
weeks.  New Oriental Education & Technology Group (EDU)  Inc. fell the
most in three months on a lower-than-predicted sales outlook.  China ’s economy expanded at the slowest pace since June
2009 in the last quarter of 2011, data released yesterday
showed, boosting expectations that the government will build on
last month’s first cut to bank reserve-requirement ratios in
three years by further loosening monetary policy.  “You’ll see an easing of reserve requirements in the near
future, that’s been well telegraphed to the market,”  Michael Shaoul , the chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New
York, which manages $1.3 billion, said by phone yesterday.
“We’ve started a typical down cycle when economic reality gets
worse and worse and the central bank reacts to that by adding
liquidity.”  China’s gross domestic product rose 8.9 percent in the
three months ended Dec. 31, from 9.1 percent in the previous
quarter, the statistics bureau said yesterday. Full-year
economic growth slowed to 9.2 percent from 10.4 percent in 2010,
the data showed.  Lending Rate  The People’s Bank of China hasn’t moved the nation’s
 lending rate  since July, when it was boosted to 6.56 percent
amid accelerating inflation. Policy makers reduced the amount
large banks must set aside as reserves by 50 basis points, or
0.5 percentage point, in December to 21 percent and consumer-
price growth slowed to 4.1 percent in December, from as much as
6.5 percent in July.  The Chinese government may roll out monetary easing
measures as early as this week,  Frederic Neumann , the Hong Kong-
based co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC Holdings Plc,
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday. “In
the short term, the Chinese will do everything to maintain
growth at 8 percent to 9 percent.”  Melco Jumps  Macau casino operator  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  rose
1.2 percent to a two-month high of $10.63 in New York, a 0.8
percent premium over its shares traded in Hong Kong and the
biggest gap in two days. Fourth-quarter gaming revenue in Macau,
the only place in China where public gambling is allowed,
increased 4.7 percent from the previous three months, the Gaming
Inspection and Coordination Bureau of the city said yesterday.  Ku6 Media Co., a Internet television service provider based
in Beijing, surged 139 percent to a six-month high of $3.30, the
biggest one-day advance since the shares started trading in
February 2005. The company forged a partnership with YouTube LLC
that will offer its video services on a new channel to viewers
outside China, Ku6 Media said in a PR Newswire statement issued
yesterday.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  surged 4.2 percent yesterday,
the most since October 2009, to 2,298.38 after the release of
the GDP figures and a China Securities Journal report said that
the National Social Security Fund had won approval to invest 100
billion  yuan  ($15.8 billion) in stocks and bonds. The Standard &
Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  of U.S. stocks was up 0.4 percent to 1,293.67
by the close of trading.  AsiaInfo Sales  AsiaInfo-Linkage, which provides software to
telecommunications companies, climbed 10 percent to $8.77, the
biggest jump since Oct. 4. Anita Chen, an analyst at Jefferies
in Hong Kong, maintained a “buy” rating on the company
yesterday, while cutting the 12-month price target to $10 from
$16.  The Beijing-based company’s  fourth-quarter sales  probably
rose 18 percent from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. AsiaInfo-
Linkage may  report  results for the last three months of 2011 on
Jan. 30.  American depositary receipts of Aluminum Corp, known as
 Chalco (ACH) , leaped 5.2 percent to $12.32, the highest level since
Dec. 1. Each ADR represents 25 common shares. The ADRs traded
0.9 percent lower than the company’s Hong Kong-listed shares,
compared with a 1.1 percent discount in the previous trading
session on Jan. 13.  U.S. stock markets were closed on Jan. 16 for the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday.  Yingli Green Gains  Aluminum for three-month delivery rose 3 percent to $2,228
a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level since Oct.
28.  Solar stocks also advanced in New York trading, led by
 Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , which jumped 8.7 percent to a
four-month high of $5.11. The Baoding, China-based maker of
solar modules has climbed 35 percent this year in New York.  New Oriental, China’s largest private education service
provider, tumbled 11 percent to $22.36, the biggest one-day drop
since October. Revenue for the quarter ended in February 2012
will be between $168.3 million to $176.2 million, the company
said in a statement yesterday. That compared with the $176.9
million average estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The sales forecast reflected a “negative impact” on New
Oriental’s business from the early timing of the Chinese New
Year holiday starting on Jan. 23, according to the statement.  Foreign Investment  Revenue for the three months through November rose 38
percent from a year earlier to $132 million, said the Beijing-
based New Oriental, which uses its own earnings calendar. Net
income during the period was up by 80.5 percent to $3.3 million,
or 2 cents per share, the company said.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index  Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., advanced 2.4 percent to a two-
month high of $37.62. The yuan was little changed at 6.3150 per
dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  China’s Commerce Ministry may release December foreign
direct investment data as soon as today. Investment from
overseas may have exceeded $110 billion in 2011 reaching a
record high, the ministry said on Dec. 30. The outlook for 2012
is “not optimistic,” the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
