Greece ’s government submitted
legislation to handle cases of corruption and other illegal or
unethical behavior in the public sector, as part of its reform
drive.  “The practices of the last decades show there is inherent
weakness of the present disciplinary checks system to respond
fast and effectively,” according to the introduction to the
bill, which was submitted late yesterday by the Administration
and E-Governance Ministry and posted on  parliament’s website .  Greece is working to make the public sector more efficient
as it pushes through reforms to meet commitments made in
exchange for international financing. Poul Thomsen, the
International Monetary Fund mission chief to Greece, said on
Dec. 14 that the country had to accelerate the pace of public-
sector reform.  The bill outlines disciplinary actions for public-sector
employees and administrators in cases including alleged bribery,
pedophilia, child pornography and coercion. Plans include the
creation of disciplinary boards for the first hearing of each
case, according to the bill.  The aim is to increase transparency and create boards that
promote objective decision making, for example by prohibiting
inclusion of union members, according to a report that
accompanied the bill.  In the past, long and fruitless disciplinary procedures
often discouraged people from reporting infringements, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
