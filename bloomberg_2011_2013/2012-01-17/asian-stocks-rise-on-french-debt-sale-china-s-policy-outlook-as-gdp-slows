Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index heading for the highest close in almost six
weeks, after French borrowing costs fell and the slowest Chinese
growth since 2009 added to speculation policy makers will ease
lending curbs in the world’s No. 2 economy.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s biggest lender, climbed 3.3
percent after  France  sold debt at a lower cost even after its
 credit rating  was cut.  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383) , a Chinese
property developer, added 9 percent to HK$8.39.  Paladin Energy (PDN) 
Ltd. surged 12 percent in Sydney after the uranium miner said
output climbed.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 2 percent to 117.92 as
of 7:54 p.m. in  Tokyo , adding more than $160 billion in market
value. More than eight stocks rose for each that fell on the
gauge. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday
said loans offered last month to the region’s banks helped avoid
“a major credit crunch.”  “It does seem like markets are taking a glass-half-full
view of  Europe  and they seemed to be very impressed by the
liquidity that’s coming out of” the ECB, said  Andrew Pease ,
Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific
region at Russell Investment Group, which manages $150 billion.
“Anecdotally, we are hearing China’s senior leadership is very,
very concerned about the outlook in Europe, which tells you the
bias is to ease policy more than they have already.”  French Debt Sale  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 1.1 percent, and
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.7 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang
Seng Index advanced 3.2 percent.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index
gained 1.8 percent as Mirae Asset Securities Co. led brokerages
higher.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.9 percent
today after U.S. markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.
The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 0.8 percent yesterday,
snapping a three-day loss, as French borrowing costs fell at the
country’s first debt auction since Standard Poor’s cut its
credit rating last week.  Financial companies contributed the most to gains on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index amid optimism Europe’s debt crisis won’t
throw the global financial system into disarray. HSBC rose 3.3
percent to HK$61.60.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s No. 2
lender by market value, advanced 1.4 percent to A$20.66.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 2.5 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 2.7 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Korean Brokerages  In South Korea, Mirae Asset Securities gained 9.3 percent
to 34,650 won. Samsung Securities Co. added 7.9 percent to
54,600 won, and Shinhan Financial Group Ltd. climbed 7.4 percent
to 41,650 won.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
 China ’s stock exchanges, climbed 4.2 percent. China’s gross
domestic product rose 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Beijing today. That
compared with the 8.7 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey and was down from a 9.1 percent expansion in the
previous quarter.  “They are more likely to cut the reserve ratio for banks
to provide more liquidity,” said Cedric Ma, Hong Kong-based
senior investment strategist at Convoy Asset Management Ltd.,
which oversees about $200 million. “There will still be more
easing even though it may not become an interest-rate reduction.
China is right now focusing on saving the economy rather than on
the market.”  Chinese developers rose in Hong Kong. Agile Property added
9 percent to HK$8.39, while  Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007)  climbed
4.2 percent to HK$3.26.  Paladin Energy surged after reporting a 24 percent gain in
output and forecasting a price increase for nuclear fuel. The
