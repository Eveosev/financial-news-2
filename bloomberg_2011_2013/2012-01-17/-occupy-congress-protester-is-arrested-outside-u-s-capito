Police arrested four protesters
after a few hundred people gathered outside the U.S. Capitol
building for an “Occupy Congress” demonstration today.  One man was arrested on a charge of assaulting a police
officer and three were being processed on charges of crossing a
police line, said U.S. Capitol Police spokeswoman Kim Schneider.  The demonstration was timed to coincide with the House’s
return to  Washington  today from its holiday recess. The Senate
reconvenes next week.  Protesters, affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street
movement, carried signs with such slogans as “Don’t Give Up
This Ship” and “Face It, Liberals, the Dems Sold Us Out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
