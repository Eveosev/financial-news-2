Citigroup Inc. (C)  joined  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  in posting its lowest revenue since the height of 2008’s
financial crisis as trading slumped.  Wells Fargo & Co. ’s revenue
slid less as core lending businesses improved.  Citigroup said fourth-quarter revenue fell 7 percent from a
year earlier to $17.2 billion. Net income declined 11 percent to
$1.17 billion as trading revenue dropped 37 percent, excluding
accounting adjustments, and  investment banking  tumbled 45
percent.  Concern that the European debt crisis would lead to a
global economic slowdown curbed trading volume and investment-
banking deals in the year’s second half. Wells Fargo, which
relies least on trading among the six biggest U.S. banks, said a
focus on loans helped soften the blow, with revenue down 4
percent to $20.6 billion. It had a record fourth-quarter profit.  “The banks with  capital markets  are ugly,” said James Reynolds, chief executive officer of Loop Capital Markets LLC,
on Bloomberg Television. “Fundamental banking looks OK.”  Citigroup fell 6.8 percent to $28.66 as of 12:37 p.m. in
New York, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank
Index. Wells Fargo, based in  San Francisco , advanced 1.3 percent
to $29.98. New York-based JPMorgan declined 2.2 percent to
$35.12.  U.S. banks’ revenue growth in 2011 was probably the slowest
since the Great Depression and is unlikely to improve in 2012,
Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television
last month. JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank by assets, said
last week that revenue fell 18 percent to $21.5 billion.  Cutting Jobs  Citigroup’s revenue was the lowest since the fourth quarter
of 2008, excluding a charge it took in the last period of 2009
tied to its repayment of government bailout funds. The New York-
based bank said today it would eliminate about 5,000 employees,
with about 25 percent coming from the securities and banking
business. It had disclosed plans last month to cut 4,500 jobs.  Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by market value, boosted
net income 20 percent to $4.11 billion, beating analysts’
estimates. Total commercial loan balances rose 7.3 percent from
the year-earlier period to $345.5 billion, while consumer loans
held on balance sheet fell 2.5 percent to $424.2 billion. The
bank also set aside less money for soured loans than a year
earlier and said it will continue seeking profits in residential
real estate, even after the U.S. housing collapse.  “We like the mortgage business,” Wells Fargo Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf  said today on a conference
call to discuss results. “We have been taking share in that
business. For two-thirds of Americans it’s the most significant
financial asset they’ll have.”  Capital to Shareholders  Stumpf, 58, reduced his staff by 3 percent to 264,200 and
reaffirmed plans to trim $1.5 billion in quarterly costs by the
end of this year. The bank plans on “returning even more
capital to our shareholders,” he said.  Citigroup’s earnings slump capped a year for CEO Vikram Pandit, 55, in which the shares slid 44 percent amid concern 
troubled European countries would default.  The firm’s revenue from trading stocks and bonds fell 9.8
percent, including accounting adjustments, from the same period
in 2010. Earnings also declined as the company sold unwanted
assets, and expenses rose 4 percent to $12.9 billion amid a push
to expand emerging-markets businesses.  Citigroup’s fourth-quarter results have missed analysts’
estimates in five consecutive years, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. For all quarters since 2004, Citigroup has beaten
estimates 54 percent of the time, compared with the 68 percent
average of 22 banks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Only 43
companies in the S&P, including two lenders, have worse
negative-surprise records.  To contact the reporters on this story:
