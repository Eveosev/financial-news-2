The Egyptian court trying  Hosni Mubarak  on charges that include complicity in the killing of
some of the protesters who ousted him from power started hearing
his defense lawyer’s statement.  Mubarak and former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli, who is
being tried alongside the former president, have denied all
charges against them. Prosecutors have called for the death
penalty for both men for their alleged roles in the killing of
demonstrators. At least 846 people were killed during the revolt
that started last January and led to Mubarak’s removal the
following month.  “I am defending a man who has served  Egypt  for more than
60 years,” in the armed forces and the presidency, the state-
run Middle East News Agency cited Mubarak’s lawyer, Farid elDib,
as saying today. “It’s a history that has been filled with
successes, accomplishments and also failures.”  The trial was adjourned until tomorrow, when the court will
continue to hear case for the defense, the state-run Nile News
channel reported. Mubarak’s trial began on Aug. 3 after pressure
from demonstrators demanding a swift and public prosecution of
the man they blame for corruption, political repression and
police abuses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
