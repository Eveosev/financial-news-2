Used  farm-equipment  values in the
U.S. and  Canada  gained in the fourth quarter as farmers paid
more for tractors, planters and combines amid tight supplies,
according to a Machinery Pete report.  The Machinery Pete Used Value Index rose to 9.4 out of 10
in the three months through Dec. 31 from 9.3 a year ago,
according to a report e-mailed to Bloomberg News yesterday.
Tight supplies, rising prices for new equipment and end-of-year
purchases by farmers boosted used values, said Greg Peterson,
the index’s author, who compiles data from more than 800
regional auctioneers in the U.S. and Canada.  “Strong used farm equipment values equal positive
conditions for strong sales of new farm equipment,” Peterson
said in an interview today. “I don’t think we are going to see
used prices drop.”  Used farm-equipment prices in the U.S. and Canada have
increased since 2004. The gains have accelerated since 2007 as
corn and soybean rallies put more cash in farmers’ pockets and
manufacturers reined in production, Peterson said. U.S. farm
income reached $100.9 billion in 2011, the Department of
Agriculture forecast in November.  Prices for 10- to 30-year-old combines in good condition
continued to attract higher prices, Peterson said. Prices for
used combines that are as much as three years old were stronger
than expected, Peterson said.  Deere & Co ., based in Moline, Illinois, is the world’s
largest farm-equipment maker, followed by Amsterdam-based  CNH (CNH) 
and Duluth, Georgia-based  Agco. (AGCO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
