Estonian teachers and day-care
workers will probably hold a nationwide strike next month as the
government hasn’t agreed to wage increase, the  Baltic News

workers’ union.  An agreement between the sides with the help of the public
conciliator is unlikely, Rondik was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
