(Corrects to show payment is canceled instead of delayed
in stories published on Dec. 14 and Jan. 10.)  Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.
Sloveniaâ€™s biggest bank, canceled an interest payment of 2.3
million euros ($2.9 million) on the 130 million euros of notes
sold in July 2005, the bank said on Jan. 10.  The lender, based in the capital Ljubljana, also canceled a
791,445 euros of interest due on Dec. 19, on a 100 million euros
of subordinated notes issued in Dec. 2004, it said on Dec. 14.  The cancellation of interest payments is tied to the state-
owned help to Nova Ljubljanska that was temporarily approved by
the European Commission in March last year, NLB said in a
statement to the Ljubljana stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
