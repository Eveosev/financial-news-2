(Corrects headline and remarks by Chinese foreign ministry
official in first paragraph.)  Allegations by U.S. Ambassador Gary
Locke that  China ’s human rights situation is getting worse are
“inconsistent with the facts,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu
Weimin said at a briefing in Beijing today.  Responding to a reporter’s question about Locke’s remarks
on the Charlie Rose show, Liu said China’s “strides and
achievements have been well known to all.”  “Over 80 percent of the Chinese people are satisfied with
the development of China,” Liu said. “With such strong public
support you cannot say that China is backtracking in terms of
human rights.”  In comments on the Charlie Rose Show, Locke said the human
rights climate “has always ebbed and flowed in China, up and
down, but we seem to be in a down period and it’s getting
worse.”  Locke said Chinese leaders were fearful of a repeat of the
Arab Spring, so “there’s been a significant crackdown on
dissension, political discussion, even the rights and the
activities of lawyers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
