OAO Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT) , a Russian oil
pipeline operator, offered to buy filling stations from  OMV AG (OMV) 
in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of its expansion in
the Balkans.  The Moscow-based company also plans to invest more than 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) to build an oil products pipeline
and use existing oil links in Croatia in partnership with Janaf,
the country’s state-owned oil pipeline operator, Zarubezhneft
General Director Nikolay Brunich told reporters in Zagreb today.
OMV of  Austria  is selling subsidiaries in Croatia and Bosnia as
central  Europe ’s biggest oil company focuses more on exploration
and production, it said on Dec. 6.  “The pipeline would increase export of oil derivatives
from refineries in Brod and Sisak,” Brunich said.  The pipeline would stretch from Slavonski Brod in  Croatia 
to the island of Krk in Omisalj, where Janaf has oil storage
capacities, Brunich said. The link would pass through Bosanski
Brod in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Zarubezhneft operates the Brod
refinery, and through Zagreb, he said.  INA Industrija Nafte d.d., the Croatian refiner controlled
by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., runs the Sisak refinery.  Zarubezhneft also plans to compete for oil and gas
exploration licenses in nine locations in Croatia, Brunich said.
Some of the sites were explored by Industrija Nafte until the
government revoked its license last year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
