NuvoSun Inc. , a closely held
producer of thin-film solar cells, expanded its third funding
round to $28.8 million with $10 million from  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) ,
the largest U.S. chemicals maker.  NuvoSun disclosed the financing today in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing, which didn’t include the
participants. Chief Executive Officer David Pearce confirmed the
investment in a telephone interview. Dow representatives did not
return phone messages seeking additional comment.  Proceeds from the latest funding will be used “just for
business operations,” Pearce said. NuvoSun last year opened a
40-megawatt production facility in Milpitas,  California , using
funds acquired in September 2010 from Dow and Pearce.  Any plans for adding overseas manufacturing plants are “on
hold,” Pearce said. “It doesn’t really strike me as the best
time to be adding capacity.”  Dow also invested in NuvoSun’s $5.9 million first funding
round that closed in February 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
