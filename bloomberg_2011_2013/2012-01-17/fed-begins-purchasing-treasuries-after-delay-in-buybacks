The  Federal Reserve  began buying
Treasuries as part of an asset-purchase program aimed at
lowering borrowing costs and stimulating economic growth.  The central bank listed $2.5 billion to $2.75 billion of
Treasuries for possible purchase between 1:15 p.m. and 2 p.m.
New York time. The securities mature from February 2036 to
November 2041, the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  said in a
 statement  today.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said earlier today
that it rescheduled itâ€™s the outright purchase of Treasuries
from the original 10:15 a.m. start time because of technical
difficulties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
