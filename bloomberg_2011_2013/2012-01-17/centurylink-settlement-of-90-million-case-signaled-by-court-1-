CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) ’s Qwest unit
settled a lawsuit over a utility-pole accident that left a
Colorado worker paralyzed, ending a case that at one point
produced a $90 million award.  CenturyLink today confirmed the accord after the U.S.
Supreme Court signaled that the two sides had settled. The high
court last week dismissed a Qwest appeal that challenged an $18
million punitive damage award in the case.  “The parties have settled their disputes to their mutual
satisfaction,” said Mark Molzen, a CenturyLink spokesman, in an
e-mail. Molzen wouldn’t disclose terms of the accord.  CenturyLink, based in Monroe,  Louisiana , rose 37 cents to
close at $36.96 in New York trading. The company acquired Qwest,
a regional phone company, last year.  A state-court jury awarded damages after concluding that
Qwest failed to properly maintain a rotted pole, which fell
while Andrew Blood was atop it removing attachments in 2004.  In addition to the punitive damages, the jury awarded $21
million in compensatory damages to Blood and his wife. A trial
judge increased the punitive damages to $62 million and added
interest. A Colorado state appeals court upheld the jury
verdict, while setting aside the increase because the judge
failed to hold a hearing.  William L. Keating, a Denver lawyer who represents the
family, didn’t return a phone call seeking comment.  The case is Qwest Services v. Blood, 11-341.  To contact the reporter on this story:
