Celanese Corp. (CE) , the world’s biggest
producer of acetic acid, said 2011 profit rose less than
expected because of falling European demand in the fourth
quarter.  Earnings last year were about $4.45 a share, compared with
an earlier forecast of $4.60 to $4.70 a share, Dallas-based
Celanese said today in a statement. The average estimate of 14
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $4.69. The company
earned $4.13 a share on an adjusted basis last year.  “Weakened” economic conditions, particularly in  Europe ,
led to less demand than initially expected for acetic acid and
related chemicals, Celanese said. Orders have improved in
January, Chief Executive Officer David Weidman said in the
statement. Acetic acid is used in polyester.  Full-year results imply fourth-quarter earnings of 56 cents
a share,  Hassan Ahmed , a New York-based analyst at Alembic
Global Advisors, said in a note. The average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 82 cents.  Celanese said it will earn more than $4.70 a share in 2012
and is “confident” it will meet profit goals for 2013, when
the company expects to earn at least $6 a share. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg on average estimated 2012 earnings of
$4.76 and 2013 profit of $5.37.  Celanese fell 0.4 percent to $46.33 at 5:25 p.m. in after-
hours trading in  New York .  “We believe the market will mostly overlook this guidance
cut in light of the above consensus 2012 guidance and
reiteration of 2013 guidance,” Ahmed said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
