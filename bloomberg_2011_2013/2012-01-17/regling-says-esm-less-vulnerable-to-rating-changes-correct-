(Corrects headline and first paragraph to say the ESM would
be less vulnerable to rating changes.)  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the
European Financial Stability Facility’s rating from AAA doesn’t
have much impact and the permanent European Stability Mechanism
would be less vulnerable to credit rating changes, EFSF Chief
Executive Officer Klaus Regling said today.  Asia and Middle East investors are still buying EFSF bonds,
he told reporters in Singapore. The euro area’s bailout fund has
significant investment commitments on new products and will sell
3-month or 6-month bills this week, he said.  The euro will continue to be a strong currency in the
global system and  Europe  doesn’t have a poor growth story, he
said. No country will be forced to leave the euro area, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
