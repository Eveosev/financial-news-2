National regulators in the European
Union backed plans by the region’s top antitrust official to
block the merger of  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and  NYSE Euronext (NRX) ,
according to a person with knowledge of today’s vote.  Representatives of national competition agencies supported
the European Commission’s proposed merger ban, said the person
who couldn’t be identified because the vote is private. The
commission isn’t obliged to follow the advice of the officials
from the 27-nation bloc.  EU regulators have told the two companies that they plan to
veto the deal to create the world’s largest exchange because it
would monopolize derivatives trading in the region, according to
two people on Dec. 31. The EU’s Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said the Brussels-based authority will decide on the
deal on Feb. 1. Companies can appeal a merger ban at the EU
courts.  Reuters earlier reported the result of the today’s vote
among national watchdogs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
