North Korea ’s trade expanded more
than 20 percent in 2010 to $6.1 billion on growing business with
China even as the economy shrank for a second year,  South
Korea ’s national statistics office said.  Trade volume increased 22.3 percent in 2010 after a 10.5
percent decline in 2009, Statistics  Korea  said in its annual
report today in Seoul. Commerce with China accounted for 57
percent, or $3.5 billion, of North Korea’s foreign trade, up
from 53 percent in the previous year. The totalitarian state
doesn’t report economic statistics.  North Korea’s gross domestic product contracted 0.5 percent
to 30 trillion won ($26.1 billion) in 2010, compared with South
Korea’s 1,173 trillion won, the  Bank of Korea  said in November.
Per capita income was 1.24 million won compared with South
Korea’s 24 million won.  Kim Jong Un took over as leader of North Korea in December
after the death of his father,  Kim Jong Il . The regime has
relied on economic handouts since the mid-1990s and an estimated
2 million people have died from famine, according to South
Korea’s central bank. The  United Nations  and the U.S. increased
sanctions on the country aimed at curtailing its nuclear weapons
program after 2010 attacks that killed 50 South Koreans.  Chinese aid to the stricken country will probably increase
as the government in Beijing seeks to avoid a flood of refugees
from crossing the 880-mile (1,416 kilometer) border it shares
with North Korea, analyst Dong Yong Sueng said. While food
shortages have contributed to rising defections, North Korea has
shown no willingness to ease sanctions by abandoning its nuclear
weapons program.  Economic Dependence  “North Korea’s economic dependence on  China  will
inevitably increase for the time being unless there’s some
resolution to the nuclear situation,” said Dong, a senior
fellow at the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul.
“China wants a stable North Korean regime and succession to
avoid a potential influx of refugees.”  North Korea (EFRAKP)  had a shortfall of as much as 700,000 metric
tons of food last year, which could affect a quarter of the
population, according to the United Nations Food & Agriculture
Organization. China provides almost 90 percent of energy imports
and 45 percent of the country’s food, according to a 2009 report
from the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations.  China is preparing to consent to a North Korean request to
provide 1 million tons of food in time for the April 5
anniversary of the birth of the country’s founder,  Kim Il Sung ,
 Japan ’s Fuji Television said on its website. The report didn’t
say where it obtained the information.  Providing Assistance  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin today told
reporters in Beijing that while he wasn’t aware of the report,
“we have always been providing assistance to the DPRK within
our capacity which we think will be conducive to the stability
and development of the country.” DPRK is an acronym of North
Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  Kim’s military had over one million soldiers in active duty
and 7.7 million reserve troops as of November 2010, today’s
report said, citing South Korean Defense Ministry figures. The
North operates under a military-first policy and has remained on
combat alert since the  Korean War  ended in 1953 with a truce and
not a peace treaty.  North Korea’s population rose to 24.2 million in 2010 from
24.1 million in 2009, about half of South Korea. Inter-Korean
trade rose 13.9 percent from a year earlier to $1.9 billion last
year, Statistics Korea said.  South Korea plans to set up a fund to raise as much as 55
trillion won to pay for eventual reunification with North Korea,
Unification Minister Yu Woo Ik said in an interview with
Bloomberg last October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
