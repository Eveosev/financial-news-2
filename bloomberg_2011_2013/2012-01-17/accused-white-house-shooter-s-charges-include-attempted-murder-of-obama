Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, the
Idaho man accused of shooting at the White House, was charged
with 17 criminal counts, including the attempted murder of
President  Barack Obama .  Ortega-Hernandez, 21, was charged today in U.S. District
Court in Washington by a federal grand jury. In addition to
attempted assassination of the president, Ortega-Hernandez was
charged with assaulting federal officers with a deadly weapon
and several firearm offenses.  Under federal sentencing guidelines, the charges carry a
possible prison term of life imprisonment, according to an e-
mailed statement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington.  Ortega-Hernandez is accused of firing a semi-automatic
rifle at the White House on Nov. 11 in an attempt to kill Obama.
He was arrested at a hotel near  Indiana , Pennsylvania, on Nov.
16 after a task force of federal and local law enforcement
officers searched for him.  Last month, U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola in
 Washington  ordered that Ortega-Hernandez remain in custody
during the grand jury investigation because he was a potential
flight risk and a danger to the community.  The case is U.S. v. Ortega-Hernandez, 12-00014, U.S.
District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
