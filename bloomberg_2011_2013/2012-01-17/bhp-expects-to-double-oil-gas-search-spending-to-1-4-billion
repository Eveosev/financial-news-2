BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Australia ’s
largest oil and gas producer, expects to more than double full-
year spending on petroleum exploration to $1.4 billion after
buying U.S. shale gas assets last year.  Spending, which was $565 million in the December half, will
be boosted by its new onshore U.S. program, the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. The company said in July it
spent $557 million on exploration in fiscal 2011.  BHP, also the world’s largest mining company, bought
Petrohawk Energy Corp. for $12.1 billion in cash and purchased
assets from Chesapeake Energy Corp. for $4.75 billion. The
company’s petroleum unit expects spending on U.S. shale to rise
to about $6.5 billion in the year ending June 2020 from about
$4.5 billion this year and an annual growth rate of at least 10
percent for the rest of the decade, BHP said in November.  Petroleum production climbed 36 percent to the equivalent
of 109.4 million barrels of oil in the half-year period, driven
by the Petrohawk and Chesapeake transactions, BHP said today in
a separate quarterly output statement.  BHP’s oil and gas assets include operations in the  Gulf of
Mexico , Australia and the Fayetteville shale area in  Arkansas .
The unit is led by chief executive officer J. Michael Yeager.  The Petrohawk transaction makes BHP the seventh-biggest
independent oil and gas company by resources, the company said
in a November presentation. BHP committed last year to spend
about $80 billion on growth projects by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
