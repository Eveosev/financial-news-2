Hungarian business lobby group
MGYOSZ called on the government to agree a bailout deal with the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union “as soon as
possible.”  The government should also “make lasting peace” with the
country’s banks and regularly consult investors in  Hungary  and
abroad, the association, which represents 6,000 companies, said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “Hungary’s international perception has become even worse
than its economic indicators would justify,” MGYOSZ said.
“Regaining trust is vital not only in relation to the EU,
national governments and the IMF but also working capital and
financial investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
