Russia’s grain crop will be “at
least” 90 million metric tons this year, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said.  The figure may be reached “on condition of favorable
weather and climate conditions,” the ministry said today in a
statement, citing Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik .  Russia’s target is to sow 50.8 million hectares (125.5
million acres) with all types of spring crops this year,
including 30.3 million hectares of grains, Skrynnik said at a
ministry meeting today. This will require financing of 224
billion rubles ($7.1 billion), including up to 150 billion
rubles of loans, she said.  Farmers are poised to use extra fertilizer on 15 million
hectares of winter crops this year, the statement showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
