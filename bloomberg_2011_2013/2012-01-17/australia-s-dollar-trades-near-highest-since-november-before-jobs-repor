Australia ’s dollar approached the
strongest level versus its U.S. counterpart in more than 11
weeks before a report that’s forecast to show employers added
jobs in December, boosting demand for the nation’s assets.  The Aussie rose for a second day against the greenback
after a private survey showed Australian  consumer confidence 
increased. New Zealand’s dollar climbed to its strongest since
November as home sales rose and prices stayed near the highest
since 2008. Demand for both South Pacific nations’ currencies
was bolstered as the  International Monetary Fund  proposed
boosting its lending capacity by as much as $500 billion to
safeguard the global economy.  “We could get a lift in the short term for the Aussie on
the back of the jobs data, which is likely to be relatively
strong,” said Jim Vrondas, a manager at the online foreign-
exchange dealer OzForex Ltd. in Sydney.  Australia’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to $1.0414 at 1:16
p.m. New York time. It touched $1.0450 yesterday, the most since
Nov. 1. The currency was 0.3 percent stronger at 79.99 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced 0.8

10,000 last month after declining 6,300 in November, the
statistics bureau will report at 7:30 p.m. New York time,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
jobless rate is forecast to remain unchanged at 5.3 percent.  Consumer Confidence  A sentiment index in the nation rose 2.4 percent to 97.1
this month, after falling 8.3 percent in December, according to
a  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute survey taken
Jan. 9-13. The reading was boosted by a 9.5 percent gain in the
sub-index tracking opinions on economic conditions over the next
year, said  Bill Evans , Westpac’s chief economist.  The Real Estate Institute of New Zealand Inc.’s index of
 house prices  fell 0.1 percent to 3,301.4 in December, according
