Israeli prosecutors have closed a
criminal investigation against Bank Hapoalim Ltd.’s Chief
Executive Officer Zion Kenan, citing lack of evidence.  The findings of the probe, opened a year ago, will be sent
to Supervisor of Banks David Zaken, the Justice Ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “Because some of the evidence uncovered during the
investigation wasn’t known to the banking supervisor when he
decided not to oppose the appointment of Kenan as CEO of the
bank, it was decided to transfer the findings of the
investigation to him for his perusal so that he can decide on
the significance of the findings from an administrative and
regulatory aspect,” the statement said.  Police had recommended a year ago indicting Kenan on
charges of fraud and breach of trust. The charges relate to a
loan granted to former chairman Dani Dankner by Hapoalim, the
second-largest bank by assets, during his term in office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
