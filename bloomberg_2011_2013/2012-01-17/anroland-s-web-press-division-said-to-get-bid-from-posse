Manroland AG (MRDCF) , the German printing-
press maker that filed for insolvency in November, has received
a bid from L. Possehl & Co. for its web-press unit in Augsburg,
two people with knowledge of the situation said.  The bid from Possehl, based in Luebeck, isn’t the only
offer for the unit, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. Possehl’s
interest was first reported by Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung.  Allianz SE (ALV)  had intended to list Manroland after it bought a
majority stake from MAN SE in 2006. Manroland, which is the
biggest maker of newspaper printing machines, has seen orders
fall by a half from 2006 to 2010 as readers switched to online
news and banks curtailed financing of machinery.  Eva Doppler, a spokeswoman for Manroland, and Lutz Nehls, a
spokesman for Possehl, declined to comment.  Platinum Equity, a Los Angeles-based buyout firm, has
offered to buy the sheet-fed unit, based in Offenbach, as well
as the web press division, according to the people. Platinum
couldn’t be reached for comment outside office hours.  Insolvency administrator Werner Schneider said yesterday
that two takeover concepts will be presented to the creditors’
committee for a decision on Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
