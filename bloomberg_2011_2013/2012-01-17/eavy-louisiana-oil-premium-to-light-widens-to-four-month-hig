Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil rose to
the largest premium to the Light Louisiana Sweet grade since
September as the profit for converting crude into distillate in
the U.S. Gulf Coast increased.  The gap between the two oils increased 90 cents to $2.30 at
12:08 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the  largest margin  between the two grades since Sept. 15.  The  profit  for converting two barrels of crude into one
barrel of gasoline and one barrel of heating oil or gasoil in
the U.S. Gulf Coast was unchanged today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The margin has risen 23 percent this
year. Heavy oils typically produce a larger proportion of
distillate fuels and less gasoline than light oils.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI lost 20 cents to
$10.45 a barrel at 12:08 p.m. in New York.  Heavy Louisiana
Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium gained 70 cents to $12.75 over the U.S.
benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened 5 cents to $11.75. Mars
Blend’s premium was unchanged at $8.30.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium was
unchanged at $7.90 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  added 15 cents to $7.80 over WTI.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 15 cents to $2.45 a barrel.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$21.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount was unchanged at $5.25. Syncrude is a
light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in
 Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
