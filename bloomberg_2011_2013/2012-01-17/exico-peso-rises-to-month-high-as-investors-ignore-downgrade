Mexico ’s peso rose to a two-month
high as Spanish bond yields fell at an auction, damping concern
that last week’s credit rating downgrades would deepen Europe’s
crisis and cut into demand for Latin American exports.  The peso strengthened 0.9 percent to 13.4381 per  U.S.
dollar , from 13.5528 yesterday. The currency touched 13.3972 in
intraday trading, the strongest level since Nov. 11. It’s
appreciated 3.7 percent this year after tumbling 11.5 percent in
2011.  Spain  paid an average 2.049 percent to sell 12-month debt
at an auction today, compared with 4.05 percent on Dec. 13. Last
week Standard & Poor’s cut the ratings on nine euro-area
nations, lowering Spain two levels to A.  “The placement of sovereign debt had favorable results,”
 Rafael Camarena , an economist at Banco Santander SA in Mexico
City, said in a telephone interview. “Basically, despite all
the news that we’ve seen about Europe, financial markets didn’t
see it as being bad. This is improving the European environment,
benefitting emerging-market currencies including the peso.”  Manufacturing in the  New York  region expanded in January at
the fastest pace in nine months, reflecting improving orders,
sales and employment, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York’s general economic index. The U.S. buys 80 percent of
Mexican exports.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
6.47 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
of the security rose 0.51 centavo to 130.76 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
