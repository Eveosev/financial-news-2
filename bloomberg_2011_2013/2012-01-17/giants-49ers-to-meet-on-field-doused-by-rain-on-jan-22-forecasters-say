As much as two inches of rain are
forecast in San Francisco leading to the  New York  Giants’
playoff game Jan. 22 at the 49ers, possibly ending before
kickoff.  Heavy rain will pass over the San Francisco area on Jan.
19-20, followed by another on Jan. 21 into the day of the
National Football Conference championship, according to  Tom Kines , a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania .  Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. on the U.S. West Coast. The
winner gets a spot in the Super Bowl.  “It looks like the first half of the day it’s raining, and
then there’s a possibility that the rain moves out in time for
game time,” Kines said in a telephone interview. “There could
be an inch or two out of all these systems combined, which is
significant.”  AccuWeather forecasts a high of 54 degrees (12 Celsius) in
 San Francisco .  The game will be played on grass at Candlestick Park. The
Giants (11-7), who upset the Green Bay Packers 37-20 in
Wisconsin on Jan. 15, are trying to reach the Super Bowl for the
first time since they beat the New England Patriots after the
2007 National Football League season. The 49ers topped the New
Orleans Saints 36-32 on Jan. 14 and are looking to reach the NFL
championship game for the first time since they beat the  San
Diego Chargers  for the title after the 1994 season.  The Patriots (14-3) host the Baltimore Ravens (13-4) In the
American Football Conference championship at 3 p.m. Boston time
the same day as the Giants-49ers play. The Patriots beat the
Denver Broncos 45-10 on Jan. 14 and the Ravens topped the
Houston Texans 20-13 on Jan. 15. Baltimore beat the Giants to
win the  Super Bowl  after the 2000 season.  There should be mostly sunny skies with the temperature
around 35 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) and little wind for the
AFC game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.  “If one of the two games is going to be affected by the
weather, it’s San Francisco,” Kines said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
