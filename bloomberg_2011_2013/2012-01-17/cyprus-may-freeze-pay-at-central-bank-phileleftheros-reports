Cyprus’s government may extend a
blanket two-year pay freeze in the public sector to the  Central
Bank of Cyprus ,  Phileleftheros  reported today, citing the
 European Central Bank .  A pay freeze wouldn’t violate the banks’s financial and
institutional independence, according to the ECB, the Nicosia-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
