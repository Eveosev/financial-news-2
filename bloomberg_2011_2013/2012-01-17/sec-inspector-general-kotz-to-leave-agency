U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Inspector General H.  David Kotz  is leaving the agency
after four years to join a private investigative firm.  Kotz will stay at the agency through the end of the month
before becoming a managing director at Gryphon Strategies in
Washington, the SEC said today in a statement.  Kotz, who previously served as inspector general of the
 Peace Corps , joined the agency in 2007 and oversaw a range of
investigations, including a probe of the SEC’s failure to catch
Bernard Madoff’s multibillion dollar fraud.  “I am tremendously proud of the accomplishments of my
office and the agency over the past four years,” Kotz said in a
statement today.  Kotz has recently been the subject of complaints by current
and former officials who have said some of his probes are overly
aggressive and his reports lack evidence of wrongdoing. Kotz and
his supporters say his work has helped the agency to recover
from missteps such as overlooking the Madoff Ponzi scheme.  To contact the reporter on this story:
