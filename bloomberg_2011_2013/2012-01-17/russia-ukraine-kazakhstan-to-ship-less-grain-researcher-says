Grain exports from Russia, Ukraine
and Kazakhstan are set to fall in the second half of the current
marketing year compared with the first six months, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  Shipments from the Black Sea region’s main exporters may
decline to about 24 million metric tons from January through the
year’s end on July 1, Olena Loshkaryova, a grain analyst at the
Kiev-based agricultural researcher, said today by phone.
Exports, including corn, wheat and barley, were about 31 million
tons in the first half, she said.  Russia’s grain exports may be between 6 million and 7
million tons in the first six months of 2012, according to
Loshkaryova. Kazakhstan shipped 4 million tons of grain,
including flour, from September through December and will
probably export another 5.5 million tons from January through
August, she said.  Ukraine is unlikely to be able to ship about 2 million tons
of grain a month through May, Liza Malyshko, an analyst at
UkrAgroConsult, said by phone. The country may fall short of the
21 million tons of exports forecast for the marketing year, she
said. Exports totaled about 9 million tons from July to
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
