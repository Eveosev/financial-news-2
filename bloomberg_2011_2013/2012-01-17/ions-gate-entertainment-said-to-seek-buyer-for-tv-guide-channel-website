Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) ,
which agreed last week to acquire the independent studio  Summit
Entertainment , is seeking buyers for the TV Guide cable channel
and website, according to an investor briefed on the deal.  The company, run from  Santa Monica , California, is seeking
a “substantial increase” over the $242 million it paid in
March 2009, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the briefing was confidential. Lions Gate began shopping
TV Guide two months ago, the person said.  The studio, maker of the “Saw” horror films and cable
TV’s “Mad Men,” prefers to sell the channel and website
together, the person said. In the six months ended Sept. 30, TV
Guide’s loss widened to $20.3 million from $13.6 million a year
earlier, according to Lions Gate  regulatory filings . Revenue
fell 11 percent to $50.8 million.  Lions Gate sold a 49 percent stake in the TV Guide channel
and website to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s One Equity Partners in May
2009 for $123 million. The bank retained an option for another 1
percent. The New York Post reported on the sale plans earlier
today.  Jon Feltheimer, Lions Gate’s chief executive officer, said
last year the studio planned to sell noncore assets. In June,
the company sold Maple Pictures, to Canadian distribution unit,
for $38.5 million to Alliance Films.  Last week, the company announced it purchased Summit for
$412.5 million in cash and stock. Most of the acquisition was
financed with cash from Summit, according to the Jan. 13
announcement.  Lions Gate, based in Vancouver, gained 4 percent to $8.94
at the close in  New York . The stock  rose  28 percent last year.
Billionaire Carl Icahn dropped a $7.50 a share buyout offer for
the company in December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
