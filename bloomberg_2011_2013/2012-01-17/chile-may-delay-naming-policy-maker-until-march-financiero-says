Chile’s government may wait until
March to nominate a fifth member to the central bank board after
failing to reach an accord with senators who must approve the
candidate,  Diario Financiero  reported, citing Senator Lily
Perez.  The government, which wanted to nominate a board member in
January, hasn’t sent senators a second list of possible nominees
after opposition members rejected its original proposals, the
Santiago-based newspaper  reported , citing Senator Andres Zaldivar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
