Slovenian political parties in
parliament agreed to seek constitutional changes to cap the
euro-region nation’s public debt after its  credit rating  was cut
by Standard and Poor’s.  “Our debt is above 45 percent of economic output and below
50 percent and we didn’t want to put a specific number on the
limit at this stage,” outgoing Prime Minister  Borut Pahor  told
reporters today in Ljubljana.  The first post-communist nation to adopt the euro had its
credit rating lowered one level to A+ with a negative outlook by
S&P on Jan. 13 along with eight other nations sharing the single
currency.  Slovenia, which has been without an official government
since September, wants to allay investors concern over its debt,
which more than doubled since 2007. The nation’s borrowing costs
surged to over 7 percent in November as the debt crisis
threatened  Italy , its Western neighbor and the third biggest
trading partner after Germany and  Austria .  Slovenia’s public debt will breach 50 percent of total
output at the end of the year and to 54.6 percent in 2013, the
European Commission said in a November report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
