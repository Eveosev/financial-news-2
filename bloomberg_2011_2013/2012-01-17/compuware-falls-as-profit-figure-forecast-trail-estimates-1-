Compuware Corp. (CPWR) , the Detroit-based
software company, fell the most in more than three years after
issuing a forecast for fiscal 2012 and a preliminary third-
quarter profit that both trailed analysts’ estimates.  The company may have net income of 40 cents to 42 cents a
share for the year ending March 31, and will report earnings of
about 10 cents for the third quarter ended Dec. 31, according to
a statement today. Compuware had been expected to earn 55 cents
for the year and 15 cents for the third quarter, according to
the average estimates by six analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  Compuware  fell  9.5 percent to $7.49, the biggest decline
since December 2008, at the close in  New York . The company is
expected to make a fuller report of third-quarter results on
Jan. 26.  Compuware said revenue from mainframe-license fees declined
10 percent in the third quarter compared with the year-earlier
period. Growth in both that area and in application performance
management “did not reach our high expectations,” according to
the statement.  The company provides infrastructure software. Products
include mainframe applications, collaboration technology,
project management tools, and application performance management
services for cloud and mobile applications.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
