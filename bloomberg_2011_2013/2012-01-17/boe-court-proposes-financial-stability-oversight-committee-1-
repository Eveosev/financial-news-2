The  Bank of England ’s supervisory
panel, known as the Court, said that the institution requires a
new internal committee to oversee its enhanced role in financial
stability.  “Court is of the view that an Oversight Committee for
financial stability is needed within the bank to supplement the
direct accountability of the bank to the Treasury Committee” in
Parliament, according to a statement to lawmakers released by e-
mail today in  London .  The Court offered its views in response to proposals from
the Treasury Committee as part of a review of the U.K. central
bank’s governance and of legislation on financial services. The
panel also welcomed suggestions by lawmakers that the Bank of
England governor should serve a single term of eight years. The
current holder of the post,  Mervyn King , will end the second of
two five-year terms in 2013.  “Court is not responsible for appointing the bank’s
governors,” the statement said. “Nevertheless, we welcome the
proposal from the Treasury Committee that future governors
should be appointed for a single term of eight years.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
