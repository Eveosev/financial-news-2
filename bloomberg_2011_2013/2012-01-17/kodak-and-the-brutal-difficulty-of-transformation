2012 has not gotten off to a great start for Eastman Kodak. Three of the company's directors  quit  near the end of last year, and  word recently emerged  that the company was on the brink of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The easy narrative is that Kodak is a classic case of a company blind to the disruptive changes in its marketplace. Like many easy narratives, this one is not quite right.  In the 20th century, Kodak was truly one of the world's powerhouses. Its rise to prominence began when it launched its affordable  Brownie camera   in 1900. In the decades that followed Kodak established a dominant position in the lucrative film business, with its "you push a button, we do the rest" slogan demonstrating its commitment to making photography accessible to the masses.  Of course, being a dominant film provider became increasingly irrelevant in light of recent technological shifts. Today people turn to digital cameras embedded in their mobile phones, share pictures over the Internet, and eschew prints altogether. Kodak wasn't blind to this shift. It created a working prototype of a digital camera in 1975. The engineer behind that project, Steve Sasson, offered  a memorable one-liner  to the  New York Times  in 2008 when he said management's reaction to his prototype was, "That's cute — but don't tell anyone about it." But Kodak  did  invest heavily in digital imaging — billions of dollars — and carved out a reasonable position in the digital camera space with its line of EasyShare products.* Early in the 2000s it made a bold bet: buying photo sharing site Ofoto in May 2001. As the decade wore on and its core business continued to deteriorate, Kodak brought in a new leadership team, downsized its core operations, and began placing bets on even more  radical ideas , such as a line of printers with low-cost ink. So Kodak actually saw the world pretty clearly and did what a lot of smart companies would have done in its circumstances. Yet, today it still teeters on the brink of insolvency.  Kodak's struggles show how brutally hard it is to get transformation right. The company took aggressive action, became a viable player in the emerging disruptive space, invested in new growth businesses, but it just doesn't seem like it was enough.  What lessons can we take from Kodak's struggles? It's the business model, stupid.  One fatal flaw of Kodak's efforts in photography is they primarily focused on . . . photography. In an alternative universe, Kodak could have taken Ofoto and shifted it from a site where people shared photos to one where people shared updates about their lives. If you're one of close to one billion Facebook users out there, you've certainly used a site like that before. Instead, Kodak used Ofoto as a way to get people to print pictures. It's natural for a company to extend the business model it knows, but it can cause it to miss big growth opportunities. Start before you need to.  This is the title of  the first day  of the 28-day training program in the back of  The Little Black Book of Innovation . The challenge — what I call  "The Innovator's Paradox"  — is when you have the freedom to change, you don't feel the urgency. For example, in the early days of Kodak's disruption, its core film business actually was growing. A lack of urgency allows a company to treat new growth efforts as science experiments that are academically interesting but not vital activities. However, once the urgency grows, freedom narrows rapidly, as attention goes to staunching the bleeding in the core business. Place multiple bets.  It's always hard to know which idea is going to be "The One," especially in fast-changing industries. An ideal response involves a portfolio and pipeline of growth strategies — again, started early enough that they have time to iterate, incubate, and grow.  Don't go it alone.  Almost every great company became great by beating back a group of similarly minded startups. That sometimes leads the winners to believe in their own infallibility. Sometimes  incumbents  conceive of and launch exciting disruptive businesses, sometimes they don't. Transformation-minded companies should be  promiscuous , investing in companies at the seeming  periphery  of their business.  While bankruptcy isn't necessarily the end of the line for Kodak, the stumbles of a smart company that did a lot of things right should make us appreciate the successful transformers even more. This is hard stuff. * Innosight director Clark Gilbert's doctoral research on this topic (with a particular focus on the newspaper industry's response to disruptive change), is a very worthwhile read on this topic. That research is summarized  here.  Gilbert's HBR article with Joseph Bauer that also discusses Kodak is available  here.
