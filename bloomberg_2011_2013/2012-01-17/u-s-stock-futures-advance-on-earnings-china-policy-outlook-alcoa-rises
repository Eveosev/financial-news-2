U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  to the highest level since July,
after reports bolstered optimism in the American and German
economies and Spain’s borrowing costs decreased at an auction.  Equities pared gains as financial shares slumped, with
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  losing 8.2 percent amid an unexpected drop in
earnings.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S. bank by market
value, gained 0.7 percent amid  record profit .  Sears Holdings
Corp. (SHLD)  surged 9.5 percent, the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, on speculation that the company may seek to go private.
Carnival Corp. tumbled 14 percent after the Costa Concordia
cruise ship ran aground off the coast of Italy on Jan. 13.  The  S&P 500  increased 0.4 percent to 1,293.67 at 4 p.m. New
York time, paring an earlier gain of as much as 1.1 percent. The
Dow rose 60.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,482.07.   “The economic data broadly exceeded expectations,”  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in
Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “That’s why we had an immediate lift to
the market,” he said. “What the auction in  Spain  tells me is
that the market is ahead of the rating companies.”  Stocks gained as manufacturing in the New York region
expanded in January at the fastest pace in nine months. German
investor confidence rose the most on record in January. Spanish
borrowing costs fell at an auction as investors ignored S&P
downgrades last week.  China’s economy  expanded at the slowest
pace in 10 quarters, sustaining pressure on Premier Wen Jiabao
to ease monetary policy.  Best Start  The S&P 500 is up 2.9 percent in 2012 for its best start to
a year since 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At
least 48 companies in the benchmark index are  scheduled to
report  quarterly results this week. S&P 500 companies, which
beat profit estimates in the previous 11 quarters, probably will
report a 4.6 percent increase in per-share earnings during the
September-December period, analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Nine out of 10  groups  in the S&P 500 gained. Among the
biggest companies,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  added 1.2 percent to $424.70.
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  advanced 1 percent to $85.69.  Wells Fargo added 0.7 percent to $29.83. Profit beat
analysts’ estimates as  mortgage financing  improved. New
mortgages rose 35 percent to $120 billion from the three months
ended September at Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender,
while dropping 6 percent from a year earlier.  Sears Surges  Sears surged 9.5 percent to $36.75. Sears, working to turn
around four years of declining sales, has lost ground as
shoppers have flocked to such rivals as Macy’s Inc. Edward
Lampert, who owns about 60 percent of Sears and serves as
chairman, may seek new capital and to reorganize operations,
said Paul Swinand, an analyst with  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in Chicago.  “Restructuring is often easier taken under private
hands,” Swinand said today in a telephone interview. “Anything
that gives you more flexibility is an advantage.”  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  added 1 percent to $38.13. The food
company said it will realign its U.S. sales organization and cut
1,600 jobs in  North America  throughout 2012 as part of its move
to divide its snacks and grocery businesses.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  rallied 1.2 percent to $29.10.  AT&T Inc. (T) 
is under so much pressure to add wireless spectrum after its
failed $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA that it may be compelled
to pay the highest premium in more than a decade to secure Dish.  With the industry facing network constraints and a scarcity
of new spectrum that’s making Dish a target, President and Chief
Executive Officer Joe Clayton says the company is open to future
acquisitions.  Reasonable Price  At $50 a share, cited as a reasonable price by Alpine
Mutual Funds, AT&T would have to pay a 77 percent premium for
Dish, the highest in an acquisition greater than $5 billion by a
telecommunications company since 2000, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 Diversified Financials Index retreated 2.2
percent for the biggest decline among 24 groups. Citigroup lost
8.2 percent to $28.22. Trading declines mirrored results at
JPMorgan, which said last week that revenue in every investment-
banking business fell from a year earlier.  Carnival (CCL)  tumbled 14 percent, the most since 2001, to
$29.60. The Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,200 people
when it ran aground hours after leaving a port near Rome to
continue a Mediterranean cruise. The accident has left at least
11 people dead.  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , the second-biggest cruise
line, fell 6.2 percent to $26.97.  Back to Work  Investors began to put cash back to work in January, buying
U.S. stocks, as expectations for global growth climbed to a six-
month high, a Bank of America Corp. survey showed.  A net 27 percent of the 214 respondents, who together
manage $655 billion in assets, said they were overweight cash.
That’s down from a net 35 percent in December. Asset allocators
became the most bullish on American equities since April 2010,
with the U.S. replacing  emerging markets  as their most favored
region for equities.  “We have started the new year with investors much less
pessimistic on global growth,” said  Gary Baker , BofA’s head of
European equity strategy at a press briefing in  London . “This
has translated into greater risk appetite. The U.S. has shown
fairly consistent improvement, largely exceeding expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
