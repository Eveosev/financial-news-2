Treasury  30-year  bonds rose, pushing
yields close to the lowest level of the year, as the  Federal
Reserve  began four consecutive days of purchasing debt without
any new issuance for the first time since June.  U.S. debt securities reversed earlier losses after the Fed
bought $2.522 billion of Treasuries in a session that took place
three hours late because of technical difficulties. The central
bank may buy as much as $15 billion in debt this week.  “The Fed purchases were constructive for the market,
especially in a low-volume environment,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “We are in a low-yield environment because nothing
has changed of late in the global atmosphere -- it’s only gotten
worse. Until there is some movement in policy, we will stay near
these levels.”  The 30-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
points, to 2.90 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent note due in
November 2041 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 104
4/32. The 10-year  yield  fell one basis point to 1.86 percent.  The gap between yields on two- and 10-year securities,
known as the yield curve, narrowed to 164 basis points from 177
basis points, a high for the year touched on Jan. 6. On Dec. 19
the gap touched 156 basis points, the lowest since October.  ‘Resistance to Sell’  The central bank bought debt maturing from 2036 through
2041, the New York Fed said in a statement today. The purchases
are part of a program, known as Operation Twist, to replace $400
billion of shorter-maturity Treasuries in Fed holdings with
longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs.  “There is resistance to sell ahead of buybacks this week
and with no supply,” said  Sean Murphy , a Treasury trader in New
York at  Societe Generale , one of the 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “We are still at safe-haven levels as
 Europe  is still the dominant driver in the market.”  Volatility in the Treasury market is near its lowest level
in almost seven months. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE
index, which measure price swings in Treasuries based on prices
of over-the-counter options maturing in two to 30 years, rose to
79.2 basis points on Jan. 13 after touching 77.1 a day earlier,
the lowest level since June 13. The 2011 average was 94.14, with
a high of 117.8 on Aug. 8 and a low of 71.5 on May 31.  Low Volume  Treasury market  volumes  remain below average. About $224
billion of Treasuries changed hands on Jan. 13 through ICAP Plc,
the world’s largest interdealer broker, below the one-year
average of $282 billion and the five-year average of $270
billion.  Congress will joust over a symbolic vote on the U.S. debt
limit this week while a decision on whether to extend $3
trillion in tax cuts into 2013 probably will wait until after
the November election.  The House returns today from its holiday break and plans to
vote on the debt limit tomorrow. Senators come back to
 Washington  on Jan. 23.  Inflation concern has fallen according to a measure of
traders’ expectations that the Fed uses to help determine
monetary policy. The so-called  five-year , five-year forward
break-even rate, which projects what the pace of consumer-price
increases will be for the five-year period starting in 2017,
fell to 2.44 percent, down from an average of 2.75 percent of
the past 12 months.  Consumer-Price Index  A report on Jan. 19 is expected to show the U.S. consumer-
price index rose 0.1 percent in December, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Ten-year  break-even  rates, the difference between yields on
10-year inflation-indexed bonds and nominal Treasuries of the
same maturity, touched 2 percentage points today. The rate
reached a 2011 high of 2.67 percent on April 11 and a low for
the year of 1.67 percent on Sept. 23. The break-even rate
represents traders’ expectations for the rate of inflation
during the life of the notes.  “We are going to be held hostage to European headlines for
the foreseeable future,” said  Adrian Miller , fixed-income
strategist at GMP Securities LLC in New York. “There will be
nothing in the market to drive it materially one way or the
other until we get some clarity from overseas.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
