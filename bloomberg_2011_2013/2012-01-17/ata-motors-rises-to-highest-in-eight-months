Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the Indian owner
of Jaguar Land Rover, is poised for its highest close in almost
eight months after sales of the luxury vehicles rose at the
fastest pace in 1 1/2 years.  The  shares  advanced 2.9 percent to 220 rupees at 9:53 a.m.
in Mumbai after surging as much as 3.6 percent. The stock has
gained 23 percent this year, compared with a 6.2 percent
increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   Rising demand from China and Russia helped Jaguar Land
Rover boost sales, said Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst with Quant
Broking Pvt. Deliveries increased 45 percent to 30,981 units in
December, the biggest monthly gain since June 2010, Tata Motors
said in a statement yesterday.  Land Rover  sales rose 54 percent,
boosted by the new Evoque compact sport-utility vehicle.  “Jaguar Land Rover volumes are rising on the back of the
Evoque,” Mumbai-based Banerjee said. “The Evoque is getting a
good response  across the world , and things are looking good for
Tata Motors.”  The Range Rover Evoque, which was introduced in September,
was named the North American truck of the year last week in
Detroit. It received 32,000 orders with deliveries running into
the first quarter of this year,  John Edwards , global brand
director of Land Rover, said on Nov. 10.  The Jaguar Land Rover unit, based in Gaydon, England,
generated 57 percent of Tata Motors’ revenue for the year ended
March 31, up from 53 percent a year earlier. Tata Motors,
 India ’s biggest truckmaker,  acquired  the brands from Ford Motor
Co. in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
