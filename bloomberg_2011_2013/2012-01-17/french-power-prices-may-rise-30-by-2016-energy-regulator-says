French state-regulated power rates
charged by Electricite de  France  SA could jump about 30 percent
by 2016, according to the energy regulator.  The increase would reflect inflation, higher wholesale
rates at which EDF sells nuclear power to rivals, a subsidy for
renewable energy, and transport and distribution costs, Philippe de Ladoucette, head of the Commission de Regulation de
l’Energie, told a conference today in Paris.  With an election due later in the year, the government is
under pressure to keep down energy costs for consumers. Prime
Minister  Francois Fillon  pushed up power prices last July and
said the increase would be limited to 2.9 percent until the
middle of this year.  France’s nuclear watchdog this month ordered EDF to improve
safety at nuclear plants following last year’s Fukushima
disaster. EDF Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  has said the
work would cost less than 10 billion euros ($13 billion).  The price at which EDF sells wholesale nuclear power to
rivals is sufficient to allow the utility to pay for work to
improve safety at nuclear reactors, Industry Minister Eric Besson said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
