Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  pay-TV
subscribers regained access to the  Tennis Channel  two days into
the Australian Open tournament, after the two sides reached an
agreement that ended a four-month blackout.  The multiyear deal gives Verizon FiOS customers in Texas,
Florida, California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and upstate New
York immediate access to the channel, the companies said today
in a statement. Other FiOS markets will get the Tennis Channel
by tomorrow, in time for the third round of men’s and women’s
singles matches at the year’s first grand slam event.  Verizon FiOS and Cablevision Systems Corp. customers lost
access to the Tennis Channel Sept. 4 after the pay-TV providers
decided they wouldn’t pay a fee increase to carry the channel or
move the station to their digital basic service packages.
Cablevision hasn’t reached an agreement with the Tennis Channel,
according to  Jim Maiella , a spokesman for the cable carrier.  The new FiOS agreement makes the Tennis Channel available
to customers that subscribe to the FiOS TV Ultimate HD package
as well as premium sports packages. New York-based Verizon will
“more widely roll out” the Tennis Channel next year, according
to the statement.  The Tennis Channel has live coverage of all four major
tennis tournaments -- the Australian Open, the  French Open ,
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. The closely held Tennis Channel is
based in  Santa Monica , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
