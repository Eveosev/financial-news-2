Ugandan lawmakers directed the
country’s Electricity Regulatory Authority to halt its plan to
increase power tariffs by 47 percent after board members didn’t

approved,  New Vision said , citing proceedings in parliament.  The regulator plans to implement the price increase, the
Kampala-based newspaper reported, citing Julius Wandera, the
company’s public relations officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
