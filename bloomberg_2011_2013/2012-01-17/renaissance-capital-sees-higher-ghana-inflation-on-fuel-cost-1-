Renaissance Capital  raised its
outlook for  Ghana ’s average inflation rate this year to 10.7
percent from 9.2 percent after an increase in fuel prices last
month in West Africa’s second-biggest economy.  Ghana withdrew subsidies on petroleum products from Dec. 29
after spending an estimated 600 million cedis ($346 million) on
them last year, Yvonne Mhango, Johannesburg-based sub-Saharan
Africa economist at  Renaissance Capital , said in an e-mailed
note to clients today.  Gasoline prices rose by 15 percent to 1.75 cedis per liter,
according to the  National Petroleum Authority , which regulates
Ghana’s fuel rates. The price increases came after crude  oil
prices  rose on the international market and the government cut
down on subsidies on the products, it said.  Not all subsidies were removed on gasoline and kerosene and
liquefied petroleum gas remain “heavily subsidized,” Yaro
Kasambata, spokesman for the Accra-based authority, said on Jan.
3. Subsidy spending was equivalent to 1.7 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011 and 4.2 percent of  government spending ,
said Mhango.  A higher inflation rate doesn’t warrant tighter monetary
policy, she said. The Bank of Ghana held its key lending rate at
12.5 percent for the third consecutive meeting on Dec. 21.  Inflation was unchanged at 8.6 percent in December from the
month earlier, holding below the central bank’s 9 percent
target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
