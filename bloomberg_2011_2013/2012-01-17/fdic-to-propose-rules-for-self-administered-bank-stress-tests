The  Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation  may vote today to propose regulations that would
require banks with assets above $10 billion to conduct self-
administered stress tests each year.  “The stress tests would provide forward-looking
information that would assist the FDIC in assessing the capital
adequacy of the banks covered by the rule,” the FDIC said in a
statement. “The banks that would be required to conduct the
stress tests are expected to benefit from improved internal
assessments of capital adequacy and overall capital planning.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
