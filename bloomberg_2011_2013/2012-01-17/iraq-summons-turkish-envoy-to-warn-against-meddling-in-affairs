Iraq  summoned the Turkish envoy in
Baghdad to warn against meddling in its internal affairs after
its neighbor said the Arab country is at risk of civil war.  Recent statements by Turkey’s government “would impact
negatively on relations between the two countries,” Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Muhammad Jawad al Dorki told Turkish
Ambassador Yunus Demirer, according to a  statement  on the Iraqi
ministry’s website.  Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said last week
that Iraq is at risk of sectarian strife and urged calm among
Shiites and Sunnis. Relations between the two countries have
deteriorated amid rising tensions between Shiite Iran and the
Sunni-ruled Arab states of the Persian Gulf, which accuse the
Iranian government of fomenting unrest in the region.  Turkey  has criticized Iraq’s Shiite prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, for issuing an arrest warrant on terrorism charges
for Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, a move that Erdogan called
“unacceptable.” The government of Iraq’s semi-autonomous
Kurdistan region has refused to hand over Hashimi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
