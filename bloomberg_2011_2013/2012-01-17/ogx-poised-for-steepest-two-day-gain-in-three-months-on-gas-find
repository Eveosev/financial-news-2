OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) 
posted the biggest two-day gain in three months after the
company said it found a large amount of hydrocarbons in shallow
waters in the  Santos Basin .  OGX  rose  1.9 percent to 15.26 reais in  Sao Paulo , bringing
its two-day advance to 7.8 percent, the most since Oct. 27,
2011. The benchmark Bovespa index  rose  1.1 percent.  “We believe this news will have a positive impact on OGX’s
shares,”  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  analysts Vicente Falanga Neto and
Christian Audi wrote in a note to clients dated today. “The
positive aspect of the news was the size of the discovery.”  OGX, based in Rio, found hydrocarbons in two separate
sections of the Fortaleza well in the BM-S-57 block, the company
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The Fortaleza well
contains the thickest reservoir OGX has found in the Santos
Basin, where the company has 1.8 billion barrels of potential
oil and natural-gas resources, according to data on the
company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
