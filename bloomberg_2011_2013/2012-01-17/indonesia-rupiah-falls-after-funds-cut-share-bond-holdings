Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened for a
second straight day after global funds pared holdings of the
nation’s assets on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will slow growth
in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy. Bonds gained.  Foreign ownership  of Indonesian government debt was 222.53
trillion rupiah ($24.2 billion) today, about 0.2 percent less
than the end of last week, according to finance ministry data.
International investors sold $3.1 million more local shares than
they bought yesterday, exchange data show.  “Investors are demanding a premium on Indonesia’s assets
as there are still concerns about Europe’s debt crisis,” said
Mika Martumpal, a senior market analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth
in Jakarta.  The rupiah slid 0.4 percent to 9,170 per dollar as of 3:30
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency has dropped 1.1 percent this year.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.07
percent today, according to the midday prices by Inter-Dealer
Market Association. The rate fell for a third day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
