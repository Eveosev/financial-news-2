The Lithuanian central bank alleged
that some missing assets at  Bankas Snoras AB (SRS1L) , the failed bank
seized by the state in November, may have been transfered to
private accounts of people related to former shareholders.  Snoras allegedly bought securities worth 1.03 billion litai
($380 million) that were later transfered to private Swiss bank
accounts of people related to former shareholders, central bank
Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas said in a presentation in Parliament
in Vilnius today. The securities would then be used as
collateral for loans and the funds would later be transfered to
offshore accounts.  Former Snoras owners  Vladimir Antonov  and Raimondas Baranauskas were arrested on Nov. 24 in  London  after Lithuanian
authorities issued European arrest warrants over claims of fraud
and embezzlement. The men deny any wrongdoing.  Another 553 million litai of the missing Snoras assets were
loans to offshore funds in the Cayman and British Virgin
Islands, the central bank said.  Snorasâ€™s liabilities exceeded assets by 2.8 billion litai,
Vasiliauskas said.  Missing Snoras property is being located in Austria, the
 Cayman Islands , Estonia, France, Latvia, Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Great Britain and Ukraine, Vasiliauskas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
