The pound fell against the euro and
the yield difference between two- and 10-year gilts was at its
narrowest in nearly three years as a report showed U.K. price
growth accelerated at the slowest pace in six months.  Thirty-year yields declined to a record low and sterling
snapped two days of gains as the annual inflation rate fell to
4.2 percent from 4.8 percent in November, adding to speculation
that easing price pressure may convince the  Bank of England  to
loosen monetary policy further by expanding its so-called
quantitative-easing program.  “The market seems to be raising bets that the Bank of
England will expand its quantitative-easing program next month
to support the economy, and a weaker inflation number will
bolster that view,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at
UBS AG in London. “More liquidity in the market will keep
pressure on the pound.”  The pound declined 0.4 percent to 83 pence per euro at 5:03
p.m. London time, after rising 1.1 percent over the previous two
days. The currency slid 0.6 percent to A$1.4767 after falling to
A$1.4713, the weakest since February 1985. Sterling strengthened
0.2 percent to $1.5348.  The two-year gilt yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.40 percent. The 2.25 percent note due in
March 2014 fell 0.03, or 30 pence per 1,000-pound ($1,538) face
amount, to 103.925. The 10-year  yield  was little changed at 1.96
percent.  Spanish Auction  The pound extended its drop against the euro after  Spain 
sold 12-month bills at an average yield of 2.049 percent, down
from 4.05 percent at the previous auction on Dec. 13. The rate
for its 18-month bills dropped to 2.399 percent from 4.226
percent last month.  The MSCI World Index of shares climbed 1 percent, and the
 FTSE 100 Index  of shares added 0.7 percent.  The pound declined 1.2 percent against nine developed-
nation currencies this year, making it the worst performer after
the euro, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indices.  The  difference  in yield between two- and 10-year notes
narrowed to 156 basis points, the least since March 2009,
according to closing prices. Longer-maturity bonds are more
influenced by the outlook for inflation than shorter-dated ones.  Gilts returned 0.5 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a gain of 0.4 percent for German  government bonds 
and 0.2 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  Slowing Inflation  U.K. consumer-price gains slowed to an annual 4.2 percent
compared with 4.8 percent in November and a peak of 5.2 percent
in September, the  Office for National Statistics  said in London.
It was the biggest drop in the inflation rate since April 2009,
the depth of the last recession.  The Bank of England kept its asset-purchase program, known
as quantitative easing, at 275 billion pounds on Jan. 12 and
left its main  interest rate  at a record low 0.5 percent to help
spur faltering economic growth.  Two-year note yields, which fell to a record low 0.27
percent on Dec. 30, will rise to 0.82 percent by year-end and
10-year yields will climb to 2.72 percent, according to analyst
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  “The yields where they are now don’t reflect the real
economy, but they reflect the fact that the U.K. is seen as a
safe haven and also all the quantitative easing being done,”
said Luke Hickmore, an investment manager at Scottish Widows
Investment Partnership in Edinburgh. “In the longer-term, as
these things start washing out, the yield won’t be 2 percent. It
will be more like 3 or 4 percent at least.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
