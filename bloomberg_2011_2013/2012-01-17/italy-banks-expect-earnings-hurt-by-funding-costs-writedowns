Italian banks expect that their
earnings will be hurt by rising costs of funding, lower revenue
and higher writedowns,  Bank of Italy  officials said.  Executives at the countryâ€™s biggest banks met today in  Rome 
with Bank of  Italy  Governor Ignazio Visco. Bankers expect modest
profitability in the next few months because of the economic
downturn, according to the officials.  The sovereign debt crisis has increased the funding costs
for the banks, so they are reducing lending to customers and are
providing loans at higher rates, they said. Bankers noted at the
meeting that less rigid collateral requirements of the  European
Central Bank  has helped ease the impact of higher funding costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
