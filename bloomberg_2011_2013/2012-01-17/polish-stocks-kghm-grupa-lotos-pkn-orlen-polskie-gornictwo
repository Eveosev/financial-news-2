Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  gained for a
second day, adding 24.93, or 1.1 percent, to 2,207.87, the
highest in five weeks, at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, jumped 3.6 percent to 128.5 zloty, surging to a six-
week high. Copper advanced as stronger-than-estimated economic
growth in China bolstered demand prospects and Rio Tinto Group
said its production of the metal fell, underlining threats to
supply.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest oil company, rose
for a second day, climbing 3.5 percent to 35.8 zloty, and  Grupa
Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, gained 2.4
percent to 22.51 zloty. Oil advanced on speculation that China
will intensify monetary stimulus, supporting fuel demand, and as
France pushed for a ban on Iranian imports.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA  (PGN PW), the
biggest Polish gas company, fell 4.2 percent to 3.92 zloty, the
steepest drop in two weeks. Poland will present its proposals
for a new tax on hydrocarbon extraction next month, PAP newswire
reported, citing Deputy Environment Minister Piotr Wozniak.  To contact the reporters on this story:
