Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA , Poland’s biggest natural-gas company, fell the
most in almost two weeks after PAP newswire reported the
government will present its plans for a new gas tax next month.  PGNiG shares lost 3.4 percent to 3.95 zloty at 2:58 p.m. in
Warsaw trading, the biggest decline since Jan. 3 on a closing
basis. The country’s benchmark WIG20 Index advanced 1.8 percent.  Poland will present proposals for a tax on hydrocarbon
extraction in the middle of February, PAP said, citing Deputy
Environment Minister Piotr Wozniak.  “It seems that a draft of the new law is on a fast-track
so it may come into force sooner than everyone has expected,”
Kamil Kliszcz, Warsaw-based analyst at BRE Bank SA said by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
