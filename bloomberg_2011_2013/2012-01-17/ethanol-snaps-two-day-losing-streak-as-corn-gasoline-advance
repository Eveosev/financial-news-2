Ethanol futures snapped a two-day
losing streak after corn climbed on concerns that inclement
weather will hurt crops in  South America  and as gasoline gained
on economic optimism.  Futures rebounded from a three-week low, advancing with
corn as hot, dry weather in South America threatened crops,
which could lead to higher input prices for U.S.-made ethanol.
Ethanol also rose with gasoline after the Federal Reserve Bank
of  New York ’s general economic index jumped to 13.5, the highest
level since April.  “Corn rallied basically on the South American weather
trade,” said Ian Jackson, a trader at SCB & Associates in
Chicago. “Ethanol was just joining the party. ”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 2.1 cents, or
1 percent, to $2.142 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have slipped 8.5 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.225 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
increased 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.235, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  increased 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.14 a gallon and in New York the biofuel advanced 1.5 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.23.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 3.71 cents to $2.7713 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery advanced 4.5 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $6.04 a bushel in Chicago. One such unit makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
