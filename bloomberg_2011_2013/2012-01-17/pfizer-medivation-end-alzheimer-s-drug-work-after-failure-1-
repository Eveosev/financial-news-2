Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and  Medivation Inc. (MDVN) 
ended their collaboration on the experimental drug Dimebon for
Alzheimer’s disease after the medicine failed in another late-
stage clinical trial.  Dimebon was one of two drugs New York-based Pfizer had in
its late-stage pipeline to treat the neurodegenerative disease.
The other is bapineuzumab, which Pfizer is developing with
 Johnson & Johnson . The treatments have different mechanisms of
action.  Dimebon didn’t show statistically significant results in a
study that evaluated the compound when added to a standard
treatment in patients with mild to moderate forms of the
disease, the companies said today in a statement. The companies
will end development of the drug for all uses, and will stop a
current study.  Medivation, based in  San Francisco ,  dropped  3.3 percent to
$53.90 at the close in  New York . Pfizer, the world’s biggest
drugmaker, gained less than 1 percent to $21.94.  Dimebon also failed in a late-stage trial in 2010, sending
Medivation shares down 67 percent in one day.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta  estimates  that at least 5 million Americans have
Alzheimer’s. The disease usually begins affecting people around
age 60. There is no known cure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
