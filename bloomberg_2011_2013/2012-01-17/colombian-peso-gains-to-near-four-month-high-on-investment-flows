Colombia ’s peso rose to an almost
four-month high after foreign-direct investment in the South
American country surged and global demand for higher-yielding
assets rebounded.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 1,837.40 per  U.S. dollar 
from 1,846 yesterday. It touched 1,832.31 on Jan. 13, its
strongest intraday level since Sept. 19. The peso has jumped 5.5
percent so far this year, the best performance among world
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Foreign-direct investment jumped 56 percent to $14.8
billion in 2011 from a year earlier, with 82 percent going into
oil and mining, according to preliminary trade balance data from
the central bank released on Jan. 13. Gains in global stocks
also helped boost the peso, said Julian Marquez, an analyst at
Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage. U.S. and European
stocks rose as slowing Chinese growth added to speculation that
monetary policy at the world’s second-largest economy will ease.  “Investment flows continue to be strong,” said Julian
Marquez, an analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest
brokerage. “The upside of the local economy is that it
continues to expand while other countries in  Latin America  have
a different story to tell.”  The economy expanded 7.7 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of
2006. It may grow as much as 6 percent in 2011, the fastest pace
since 2007, according to the central bank.  Brazil ’s economy, the
biggest in Latin America, shrank in the third quarter for the
first time in more than two years.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.39
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell
0.195 centavo to 120.739 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
