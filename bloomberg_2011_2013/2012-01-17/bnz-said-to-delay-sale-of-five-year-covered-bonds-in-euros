BNZ International Funding Ltd. is
delaying a sale of five-year covered bonds in euros, according
to two people with knowledge of the sale.  The bonds had been initially marketed at yield of 125 to
130 basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate and were
planned to total at least 500 million euros, a banker involved
in the transaction said yesterday. DZ Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co.,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , Natixis, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  were hired to manage the
deal.  Bank of New Zealand spokeswomen Erica Lloyd and Emily
Davies didnâ€™t immediately respond to an e-mail sent outside of
business hours.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
