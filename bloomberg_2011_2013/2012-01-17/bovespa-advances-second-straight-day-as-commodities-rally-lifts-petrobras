The Bovespa index gained for a
second day, after the exchange delayed the open of trading
because of a technical problem, as speculation  China  will ease
its monetary policy sparked a commodities rally and boosted the
outlook for Brazilian raw material producers.  Oil companies  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA  and
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  followed crude higher.  Vale SA (VALE5) , the
world’s largest iron-ore producer whose top export market is
China, rose after saying it plans to pay dividends of at least
$6 billion in 2012, a 50 percent increase from 2011.  The Bovespa advanced 0.7 percent to 60,353.14 at 1:15 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. Thirty-nine stocks gained on the gauge, while 28
dropped. The real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.7818 per  U.S.
dollar . The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
climbed 1.1 percent.  “China’s data lifted the global markets, including the
Bovespa,” Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps oversee 80 million
reais ($45 million) at Leme Investimentos in Florianopolis,
 Brazil , said by phone. “It’s positive news, especially for
commodities producers such as Vale.”  European and U.S. stocks advanced as China’s gross domestic
product grew 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, the statistics bureau said in Beijing today. While that
exceeded the 8.7 percent median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey, it was the slowest in 10 quarters, spurring bets that
the Asian nation may ease monetary policy.  Vale gained 2.6 percent to 40.31 reais. OGX, the  oil
company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , added 2 percent
to 15.28 reais, and Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known,
rose 0.8 percent to 23.83 reais.  Crude for February delivery jumped as much as 2.3 percent
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Technical Problem  The start of equity trading in Brazil, scheduled for 11
a.m. local time, was delayed for 85 minutes because of a
technical problem on the Bovespa’s trading platform, BM&FBovespa
SA said in a statement.  “Since there wasn’t any big event during the time stocks
should be trading, we could say that no harm was done,” Brugger
said.  The Bovespa has advanced 24 percent from a two-year low on
Aug. 8 as interest-rate cuts in Brazil and signs of progress in
solving  Europe ’s debt crisis buoyed demand for equities. The
gauge trades at 9.3 times analysts’ earnings estimates, which
compares with the ratio of 9.6 for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge sank 18 percent in 2011.  Traders moved 4.42 billion reais in stocks in  Sao Paulo 
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 6.49 billion reais in 2011, according to data
from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
