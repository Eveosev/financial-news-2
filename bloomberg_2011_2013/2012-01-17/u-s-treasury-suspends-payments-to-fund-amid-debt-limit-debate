The U.S. suspended investments into
a federal employee retirement fund to avoid breaching the
$15.194 trillion debt limit.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  informed Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  of the move in a letter today.
The so-called G-Fund will be “made whole once the debt limit is
increased,” Geithner said.  Lawmakers this week will debate a symbolic vote on the debt
limit. Under legislation passed in August after months of
negotiations between the Obama administration and Republican
lawmakers, the president has authority to veto any disapproval
resolution that clears both chambers of Congress. The limit
would then be raised Jan. 27.  House Republicans  plan to adopt a resolution tomorrow
rejecting President  Barack Obama ’s Jan. 12 request to raise the
debt limit by $1.2 trillion, though the measure will die either
in the Senate or by presidential veto. That will allow Obama to
lift the cap on his own after Republicans have gone on record
against it.  The debt-ceiling increase is to meet commitments already
made by the government. The Treasury has been relying on
accounting maneuvers similar to ones employed last year to
ensure that the limit isn’t breached.  Since the budget law was approved, the debt limit has been
raised twice, by a total of $900 billion. In the latest request,
the ceiling would rise to $16.394 trillion, which the Treasury
estimates will fund the government until late 2012.  In the last certification vote, the Republican-controlled
House passed a resolution of disapproval, while the Senate
didn’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
