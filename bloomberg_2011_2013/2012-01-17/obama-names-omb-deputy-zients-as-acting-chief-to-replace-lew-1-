Jeffrey Zients, a deputy at the
Office of Management and Budget, will serve as acting budget
director to replace Jack Lew, who is set to become President
 Barack Obama ’s chief of staff at the end of the month.  Zients, 45, who has led administration efforts to
reorganize the federal government, including a plan last week to
consolidate six federal agencies into one, will assume day-to-
day management of the fiscal 2013 budget that’s set to be
delivered to Congress the first week of February.  “I’m pleased to designate Jeff Zients to lead the Office
of Management and Budget,” Obama said today in a statement.
“Since day one, Jeff has demonstrated superb judgment and has
provided sound advice on a whole host of issues.”  Top OMB positions are subject to Senate confirmation and
Zients was confirmed to his current job in 2009. By naming
Zients acting director, Obama for now avoids a potential
election-year showdown with the Senate over a nomination.  Zients served as acting chief once before, when former
budget chief Peter Orzag departed and before Lew was confirmed.  Along with his title as deputy budget director, Zients was
the government’s first performance officer. Zients has 20 years
of business experience as a chief executive, management
consultant and entrepreneur, the White House said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
