Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said he’s prepared to intervene in the country’s
housing market if necessary, though the government has no plans
to take immediate action.  Flaherty, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said he’s
watching closely condominium markets in Vancouver and Toronto.  “We watch the housing market carefully, and we are
prepared to intervene if necessary,” Flaherty said, adding
there has been some “softening” in the country’s housing
market. “Having said that, we’re not about to intervene in the
housing market now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
