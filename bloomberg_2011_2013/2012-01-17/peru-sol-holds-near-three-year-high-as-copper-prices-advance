Peru ’s sol held near a three-year
high as copper gained on speculation China will seek to bolster
economic growth.  The sol was little changed at 2.6930 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.6925 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit. The currency earlier touched 2.6910, its
strongest level since at least December 2008.  China’s national statistics bureau said the world’s biggest
consumer of industrial metals expanded 8.9 percent in the fourth
quarter. While the expansion was above the 8.7 percent median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey, it was also
the slowest in more than two years. Copper, Peru’s top export,
rose to a four-month high in  New York .  The report fueled speculation China’s “central bank will
relax monetary policy to ensure a soft landing,” said  Roberto Flores , head of research at Lima-based brokerage Inteligo SAB.  Sylvia Chiu, an economist at SinoPac Financial in Taipei
who was the only analyst in a Bloomberg survey to predict the
fourth quarter growth figure, forecasts policy makers will cut
banks’ reserve requirement ratios to 19 percent by year-end from
21 percent today and push down benchmark lending rates.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.75 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
