Almarai Co. (ALMARAI) ,  Saudi Arabia ’s largest
food producer by market value, posted a 0.6 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit, excluding the effect of a decline in the
value of its investment in Saudi Zain.  Net income rose to 285.5 million riyals ($76 million) from
283.8 million riyals in the year-ago period, the Riyadh-based
food maker said in a statement to the  Saudi bourse today . The
mean estimate of seven analysts was for a profit of 199 million
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are bit disappointed with the numbers announced,”
Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst at Riyad Capital, said in a
phone interview today. “When considering the planned impairment
charge on Zain, the results appear worse. Almarai plans to book
the impairment charge in the final consolidated 2011 results,
possibly as it finalizes the magnitude of the impairment.”  Almarai shares fell 0.5 percent yesterday to 99.5 riyals,
valuing the company at 22.9 billion riyals.  Almarai may book an impairment of 136.7 million riyals on
its investments in Zain Saudi, Chief Financial Officer Paul-
Louis Gay said in October. The original value of Almarai’s
investment was about 270 million riyals to 280 million riyals,
and the impairment represents about 40 percent of that, he said.  Zain Saudi  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , controlled by Saudi billionaire Prince
Alwaleed and  Bahrain Telecom Co. (BATELCO)  abandoned in September a plan
to buy 25 percent in Zain Saudi for $950 million from  Kuwait ’s
Zain Group. The deal fell through because lenders refused to
transfer debt guarantees from Zain to purchasers,  Al Watan 
newspaper reported on Oct. 4, citing Zain Saudi’s Chairman
Prince Hussam al-Saud.  Almarai bought Zain Saudi shares for 10 riyals a share. The
stock closed at 5.7 riyals a share yesterday.  Almarai’s fourth quarter sales increased 16 percent to 2.1
billion riyals, compared with the same period last year,
according to the  company’s statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
