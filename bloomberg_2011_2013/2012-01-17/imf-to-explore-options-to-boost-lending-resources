The International Monetary Fund’s
staff will look into options to increase the fund’s lending
power, Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said, following a
discussion among the institution’s board of directors.  Officials from the Group of 20 nations have been
considering increasing IMF  resources , currently at about $385
billion, as a way to support a world economy threatened by the
European debt crisis. Euro-region nations have pledged to
channel 150 billion euros ($191 billion) to the IMF, while the
U.S. has said it has no plans to make bilateral loans to the
Washington-based institution.  “The biggest challenge is to respond to the crisis in an
adequate manner and many Executive Directors stressed the
necessity and urgency of collective efforts to contain the debt
crisis in the Euro Area and protect economies around the
world,” Lagarde said in an e-mailed statement.  Lagarde said the board also welcomed the commitment of
euro-area nations to increase fund resources, though it also
stressed that  Europe  needs “firewalls and other policies being
sufficiently strong to respond” to the debt turmoil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
