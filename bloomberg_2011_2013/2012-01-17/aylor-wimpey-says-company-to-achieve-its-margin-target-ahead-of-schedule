Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  expects its
operating margin to improve more quickly than previously
forecast after the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by volume
cut costs and redesigned development sites, Chief Executive
Officer Pete Redfern said.  “We will be reporting a 10 percent operating margin for
the second half of 2011, which is ahead of a target we set out
quite some time ago,” the CEO said on a conference call today.
“We can continue to add to that year on year.”  Taylor Wimpey completed 10,180 homes in 2011, a 2 percent
increase from the year earlier, the London-based company said
today in a statement. The average selling price was little
changed at 185,000 pounds ($284,380). In November, the company
said it would reach the operating margin target in 2012.  U.K. homebuilders are boosting profits by increasing focus
on houses and building on land bought at discounts during the
recession that ended in 2009. The government is trying to
bolster homebuilding with investment and mortgage guarantees
after banks reined in lending.  Taylor Wimpey gained as much as 4 percent to 42.38 pence in
 London , the highest price since March 2011. The shares were up
1.25 pence at 42 pence as of the 4:30 p.m. close of trading,
giving the company a market value of 1.34 billion pounds. At the
end of 2006, the shares traded at 323 pence.  Net debt fell to 120 million pounds at the end of December,
from 654.5 million pounds a year earlier. Operating profit may
have risen more than 80 percent in the second half from 49.1
million pounds a year earlier, the company estimated.  Widening Margin  Operating margin widened last year after the company
redesigned its U.K. developments to have fewer apartments,
simpler floor layouts in its homes and more standardized
designs, Redfern said on the call.  The margin, excluding the sale of Taylor Wimpey’s North
American business, may reach as much as 11.5 percent this year
and may expand by 2 percentage points a year as the company
builds more homes on land purchased after the recession, he
said.  Taylor Wimpey received planning consent on around 4,000
plots last year and has 6.4 years of supply at current
completion levels, it said. Cancellation rates fell to 15.8
percent from with 18.2 percent in 2010.  In  Spain , the company completed 109 homes compared with 136
a year earlier. The average selling price rose 11 percent to
238,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
