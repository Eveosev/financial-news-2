Pakistan  trails England by 150 runs
at the end of the opening day of their first Test in Dubai after
Saeed Ajmalâ€™s career-best seven wickets restricted England to
192 all out.  Mohammad Hafeez, on 22 runs, and Taufeeq Umar on 18, opened
the batting for Pakistan, which finished the day on 42-0.  Ajmal lifted Pakistan after England won the toss and
elected to bat. Matt Prior was unbeaten on 70 for England, which
was 43-5 after Ajmal got Kevin Pietersen leg-before-wicket on 2
runs. Alastair Cook,  Ian Bell , Stuart Broad and Chris Tremlett
also failed to reach double figures for England.  It was a career best for Ajmal, a 34-year-old spin bowler
who finished 7-55.  The teams will meet in Dubai again in the third and final
Test of the series. The second meeting will occur in  Abu Dhabi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
