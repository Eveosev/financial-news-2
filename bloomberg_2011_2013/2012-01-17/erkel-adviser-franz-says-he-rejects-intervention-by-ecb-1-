German government adviser Wolfgang Franz said that he opposed European Central Bank purchases of
euro-area sovereign bonds, citing  Germany ’s historical aversion
to debt.  “I reject intervention by the ECB, I reject euro bonds,”
Franz, the chairman of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of
economic advisers, said in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television’s Maryam Nemazee. He cited German experience of the
1920s, when its central bank financed public debt and then lost
its independence, stoking hyperinflation.  The euro “will survive” the debt crisis and the currency
will still have its current 17 members a year from now, Franz
said. Policy makers “will do their best to solve the euro
crisis with respect to  Italy , but also with respect to  Greece .”  The ECB has resisted a bigger role in the debt crisis now
in its third year, saying governments must tackle excessive
spending and deepen budget-policy coordination. Economists
including Royal Bank of Scotland Plc’s  Jacques Cailloux  and
Marchel Alexandrovich of Jefferies International say a bigger
ECB bond-buying program is needed to help save the euro.  Franz reiterated the council’s proposal that euro member
states should set up a debt redemption fund to make refinancing
easier for countries that carry out “plausible” economic
policy changes that are not appreciated by financial markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
