Former employees of  Solyndra LLC (SOLY) 
asked a bankruptcy judge to block a $500,000 incentive plan,
saying the  company ’s employees are already well-compensated.  Solyndra, the solar-panel maker based in Fremont,
 California , is also obligated to make public all information
about the planned payout to 21 workers, most of whom earn more
than $100,000 a year, a lawyer for the group, Frederick B. Rosner, wrote in a filing yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington, Delaware.  “Over 1,000 of the debtors’ terminated employees are
creditors” and “they are on the outside, looking in. Hands
cupped around eyes, eyes pressed against the glass, they strain
to see what is going on inside,” while “the hallmarks of
operating as a fiduciary in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case are
disclosure and transparency,” Rosner wrote.  Solyndra, whose $535 million federal loan guarantee was
criticized by Republicans in Congress, proposed the Key Employee
Incentive Plan, to be considered at a Jan. 23 hearing, to pay
bonuses of as much as 30 percent of a year’s salary to prevent
loss of personnel. It filed bankruptcy papers in September.  Officials at Solyndra couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment on the objection.  The case is In re Solyndra LLC, 11-12799, U.S.  Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
