Hungarian bonds fell for a third day
as European Union procedures against its most-indebted eastern
member over new laws on the judiciary, central bank and data
protection risked delaying financial assistance.  Yields on benchmark government notes maturing in 2022
climbed 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 9.892
percent by 10:24 a.m. in Budapest, the highest in more than a
week. The forint gained 0.3 percent to 311.96 per euro, after
depreciating 1.5 percent in the previous two sessions.  Hungary faces procedures by the European Commission over
the new regulations, Deputy Prime Minister Tibor Navracsics said
today. The  International Monetary Fund  and the EU broke off
talks on a bailout last month when Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
refused to withdraw the legislation, which the organizations
said threatened the central bank’s independence.  “The most negative reaction would be if the government
starts disputing the procedure, which in turn could seriously
delay the start of the official talks regarding external
assistance,”  Gyula Toth , a Vienna-based strategist for  emerging
markets  at UniCredit SpA, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
