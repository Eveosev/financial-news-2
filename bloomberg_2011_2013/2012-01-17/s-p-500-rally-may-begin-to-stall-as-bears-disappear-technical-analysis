The stock-market rally has driven
 short interest  to a nine-month low and bearish sentiment close
to a six-year low, a sign that few investors may be left to
propel further gains, Strategas Research Partners said.  Short interest, or total number of shares sold short, fell
to 168.8 billion on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq
Stock Market at the end of December, as the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  capped the best quarterly return since September 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The proportion of
respondents in the  American Association  of Individual Investors
survey who expect the market to decline over the next six months
reached  17.2 percent  this month, down from 50 percent in August.  Some analysts watch sentiment as a contrary indicator given
that optimistic investors have already purchased shares, leaving
less money to help drive prices higher. The  S&P 500  has jumped
18 percent from its October low as European leaders took steps
to contain the region’s sovereign debt crisis and data showed
the  U.S. economy  is improving.  “Real money is now needed to support the market rally,”
 Christopher Verrone , head of  technical analysis  at New York-
based Strategas, wrote in a note today. “Investor complacency
is growing,” he said. “The short-covering phase of this rally
is likely exhausted.”  Individual investors have yet to return to stocks after the
S&P 500’s surge of as much as 102 percent from a 12-year low in
March 2009. Equity mutual funds suffered a fifth straight year
of redemptions in 2011, the longest streak of outflows since at
least 1984, according to the  Investment Company Institute , a
Washington-based trade group.  Last time short interest was this low, in March, the S&P
500 peaked at 1,363.61 the following month. Short interest
reached its 2011 high of 200.5 billion shares in September, the
month before the benchmark index set its  low  for the year at
1,099.23.  The bearish sentiment reading was the second lowest since
November 2005, after the 16.4 percent in December 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
