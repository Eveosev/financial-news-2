ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, will eliminate 60 jobs at its
commercial bank in Asia by the end of June as part of its three-
year plan to reduce costs by 460 million euros ($590 million).  The company cut 13 jobs across six countries in Asia in the
past week and will make the remaining reductions in the first
and second quarters of next year, Mark Newman, chief executive
officer of ING’s commercial bank in Asia, said yesterday in an
e-mail to employees reviewed by Bloomberg.  “This measure taken at ING Commercial Banking Asia is the
result of a strategic business review to ensure our business
remains competitive,” Eileen Lau, a Singapore-based spokeswoman
for ING, said by e-mail. The company employs 850 people at its
commercial bank in Asia, she said.  The Dutch firm said on Nov. 7 it will eliminate 1,350
insurance jobs by 2014 and another 1,000 in commercial banking
to make the savings by 2015. Third-quarter net income dropped 64
percent to 609 million euros from 1.69 billion euros a year
earlier, the Amsterdam-based lender said in a statement that
day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
