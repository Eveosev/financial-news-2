China ’s manufacturing may expand in
November for the first time in 13 months, adding to signs that
economic growth is rebounding after a seven-quarter slowdown.  The preliminary  reading  was 50.4 for a purchasing managers’
index released today by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics.
It compares with a final level of 49.5 for October. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  A recovery in manufacturing would bolster prospects for a
sustained pickup in economic growth that slowed last quarter to
the weakest pace in more than three years. It would also reduce
the likelihood that the ruling Communist Party’s new leadership
including Li Keqiang, set to become premier in March, steps up
monetary and fiscal efforts to boost expansion.  A separate, government-backed index of purchasing managers’
views at manufacturers, which showed an expansion in October for
the first time in three months, is due to be released Dec. 1.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
