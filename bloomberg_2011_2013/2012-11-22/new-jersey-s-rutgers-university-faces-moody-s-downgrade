Rutgers, the state university of  New
Jersey , had $1.3 billion in debt placed on review for possible
downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service.  General-obligation bonds, certificates of participation,
lease revenue bonds and charter school project securities may be
affected, Moody’s said in a report today. It rates New
Brunswick-based Rutgers at Aa2, third highest.  Rutgers, with more than 58,000 students, has a “leveraged
balance sheet and significant future capital plans,” Moody’s
said. The Rutgers governing board voted Nov. 19 to take over the
Newark-based University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey,
which has about 6,000 students and owes $450 million to
bondholders.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
