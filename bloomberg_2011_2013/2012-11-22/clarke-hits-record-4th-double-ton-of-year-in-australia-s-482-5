Australia captain Michael Clarke
became the first batsman to score four Test double centuries in
a calendar year to help lift his team to 482-5 against South
Africa as their three-match series resumed in Adelaide.       Clarke, who’s unbeaten on 224, was one of three batsmen to
reach triple figures on day one of the second Test as Australia
racked up 5 1/2 runs an over after winning the toss.  David
Warner  blasted 119 off 112 balls, while  Mike Hussey  made 103.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
