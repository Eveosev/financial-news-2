Canadian  stocks  rose for a fifth day
as  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  gained the most in more than three
years and better-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data
indicated the world’s second-largest economy is rebounding.  RIM surged 18 percent, the biggest gain since April 2009,
after an analyst with National Bank Financial raised his
estimates for BlackBerry 10 sales next year.  Colossus Minerals
Inc. (CSI)  climbed 3.8 percent as gold rose.  Royal Bank (RY)  of  Canada  and
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  advanced. U.S. markets were closed today
for the Thanksgiving holiday.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 53.04
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,153.10 in Toronto. The streak of
gains is the longest in three weeks. The benchmark Canadian
equity gage is up 1.7 percent this year.  “The Chinese manufacturing data came in better than
expected,” David Baskin, president of Toronto-based Baskin
Financial Services Inc., said in a phone interview. His firm
manages C$440 million in assets. “So much of the world natural
resource trade goes to support Chinese growth so that’s the data
people are looking for.”  Technology stocks paced  gains  on the benchmark, rising 3.8
percent. Trading volume was 58 percent lower than the 30-day
average. The Canadian market sees little trading when U.S.
markets are closed, Baskin said.  RIM Soars  RIM soared 18 percent to C$12.03 after  Kris Thompson ,
analyst with National Bank Financial, said the BlackBerry 10
line of smartphones will sell better than expected. The new
phones, scheduled to go on sale in February, should post
shipments of about 35.5 million units next fiscal year, up from
a previous estimate of 31.6 million.  China’s purchasing managers’ index signaled the first
expansion in the country in 13 months with a preliminary reading
of 50.4, compared with a final level of 49.5 in October,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. A reading
above 50 indicates growth. Manufacturing gains bolster prospects
for a sustained pickup in economic growth that slowed last
quarter to the weakest pace in more than three years.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest diversified mining
company, increased 2.6 percent to C$32.59.  Colossus Minerals advanced 3.8 percent to C$4.36 as gold
gained for a second day.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  rose 0.4 percent to
C$34.75. Gold for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1,729.50 in electronic trading in New York.  Royal Bank, the nation’s largest lender, rose 0.4 percent
to C$57.81 and TD Bank gained 0.4 percent to C$80.99. Canada’s
major banks begin reporting fourth-quarter earnings next week,
with Royal first in line on Nov. 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
