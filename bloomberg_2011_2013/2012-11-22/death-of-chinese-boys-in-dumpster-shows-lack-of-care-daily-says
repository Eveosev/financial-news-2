The death of five runaway boys in
one of  China ’s poorest province, killed by carbon monoxide from
charcoal they burned inside a dumpster in which they took
shelter, shows a lack of family responsibility, a commentary in
the official newspaper of China’s Communist Party said.  The five boys in Guizhou province weren’t in school and had
run away from home, showing a lack of care by their families,
the commentary published in today’s People’s Daily said. Parents
have the same responsibility to their children, no matter if
they’re poor or migrant workers, according to the commentary
written by Wang Yunna, who wasn’t identified.  Today’s People’s Daily article follows others, such as a
Nov. 21 commentary in the Procuratorial Daily, that have called
the death of the boys evidence of the growing pressure on rural
households as more working-age residents leave farms to find
work in cities. Family care for children is “indispensable,”
the People’s Daily article said.  The five boys in Guizhou were the sons of three brothers,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported Nov. 20. Two of the
fathers worked as trash collectors in the southern city of
Shenzhen, while the other farmed land in their home town,
according to the report.  Four of the boys were left under the
care of a blind grandmother, according to Xinhua.  China’s urban population surpassed that of the countryside
for the first time in the nation’s history last year, according
to government statistics. The nation’s has more than 150,000
“street children,” Xinhua reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
