The Housing Finance Fund, Iceland’s
state-owned mortgage lender, said it’s working on a plan to
start issuing callable debt as it “clarified” a newspaper
report it was seeking early repayments on its bonds.  Trading in the fund’s bonds was halted on the Iceland
exchange after a report in newspaper Vidskiptabladid. The lender
has about 530 billion kronur ($4.2 billion) in outstanding HFF
bonds, making it the biggest issuer in Iceland after the
government.  “From the press coverage one could infer that HFF is
currently working on changing the terms of outstanding HFF
bonds,” the fund said. “Such changes aren’t possible and will
not be made without the bondholders’ cooperation.”  HFF is struggling as it loses market share to Iceland’s
commercial banks. The lender can only issue mortgages indexed to
inflation and price growth exceeding 4 percent has put the fund
at a disadvantage to rivals such as Islandsbanki hf and Arion
Bank hf, which both provide non-linked mortgages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
