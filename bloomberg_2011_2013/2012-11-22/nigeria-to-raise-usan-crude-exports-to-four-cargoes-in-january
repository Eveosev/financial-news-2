Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil
producer, plans to ship four 950,000 barrel cargoes of Usan
crude exports for January, one more than December, according to
a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  This is the first shipping plan to be released for
Nigeria’s oil exports in January. The other grades, including
the country’s benchmark, Qua Iboe, were not yet available.
Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
