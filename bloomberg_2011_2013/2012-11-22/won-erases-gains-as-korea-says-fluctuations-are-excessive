South Korea ’s won fell for a second
day after Deputy Finance Minister Choi Jong Ku said action needs
to be taken to curb “excessive” fluctuations in the  exchange
rate .  Government bonds  declined.  The currency retreated from a 14-month high after Choi said
at a press briefing in Gwacheon that various steps are being
studied to address won volatility, and measures on foreign-
exchange forward positions may be announced next week. The won
opened higher as global stocks advanced after U.S. Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  and Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr
announced a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.  “There is speculation the government intervened today to
stem the won’s gains,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based
currency analyst for Woori Futures Co. “Whether this will
succeed in curbing the appreciation trend will depend on the
effectiveness of policy measures to be announced.”  The won fell 0.2 percent to 1,085.73 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched
1,080.05, the strongest level since Sept. 9, 2011. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point,
to 5.70 percent.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 climbed three basis points to 2.90 percent, a
one-month high, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year
interest-rate swap was little changed at 2.78 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
