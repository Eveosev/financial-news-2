South  Africa ’s benchmark stock index
climbed to a record high as  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-
largest brewer, rallied the most in more than four years after
reporting earnings that beat analyst estimates.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH)  closed 0.9 percent
higher at 37,844.55, after earlier advancing as much as 1.3
percent. SABMiller, which makes up 9 percent of the gauge,
surged 5.8 percent, the most since October 2008, to 395.87 rand,
the highest since at least 1995 when Bloomberg started compiling
data on the stock.  Earnings before interest, taxation and amortization
excluding some items climbed to $3.17 billion, SABMiller said,
bolstered by gains in Latin America and Africa. That compared
with the $3.1 billion median  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The market was dominated by SABMiller today; the results
were very well received,” Thys van Zyl, a trader at Thebe
Stockbroking in Johannesburg, said by phone.  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of commodities jumped as much
as 0.8 percent after a Chinese manufacturing index signalled the
first expansion in 13 months. This boosted local resources
shares, Van Zyl said.  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , the biggest mining investor in South
Africa, advanced 1.9 percent to 243.30 rand.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
the biggest mining company, rose 1 percent to 277.28 rand.  SABMiller’s  30-day historical volatility , a measure of
stock swings, increased to 20.82 from 12.27 yesterday. The
FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s  30-day volatility measure was 
at 9.16 compared with 8.87 yesterday. A higher reading means an
asset’s price can have bigger moves. More than 5.8 million
SABMiller shares traded, almost three times the daily average
over the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
