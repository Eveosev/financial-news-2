China ’s  stocks  fell, following the
benchmark index’s biggest gain in three weeks, as waning
speculation of lower bank reserve requirements overshadowed an
increase in a manufacturing gauge.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. slumped to the lowest level since July
2010, leading liquor makers lower after Xinhua News Agency cited
China’s quality watchdog as saying samples made by JiuGuiJiu Co.
contain excessive levels of plasticizer. JiuGuiJiu has been
halted from trading this week.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-
Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , sank the most in a week after saying it will
continue to halt output at some smelting units.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  closed 0.7 percent lower at
2,015.61. It jumped 1.1 percent yesterday on optimism the
People’s Bank of China would cut the reserve-ratio requirement.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  rose 0.6 percent as a purchasing managers’
index signaled the nation’s manufacturing industry may have
expanded in November for the first time in 13 months.  “When the reserve-ratio requirement speculation didn’t
materialize, stocks dropped again today, showing the lack of
confidence among investors,” Deng Wenyuan, an analyst at
Soochow Securities Co., said by phone from Suzhou. “There’s
improvement in the economic data from October and as seen from
the PMI today, but we cannot make a concrete conclusion that the
economy is recovering yet. It may only show real improvement
from the second or third quarter next year.”  Lower Valuation  The preliminary  reading  of 50.4 for a HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics purchasing managers’ index released today
compares with October’s 49.5. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion. Data on industrial production, fixed-asset
investment, retail sales and exports growth exceeded economists’
estimates last month.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 0.8 percent to 2,177.55. The
Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, advanced 1 percent in  New York .  A gauge of consumer-staple companies in the CSI 300 Index
slumped 1.6 percent, the most of 10 industry groups, to close at
the lowest level since Aug. 26. Wuliangye Yibin, China’s biggest
liquor maker by revenue, fell 4.7 percent to 27.46 yuan, the
lowest close since July 23, 2010. Kweichow Moutai Co. sank 0.6
percent to 217.29 yuan. Sichuan Swellfun Co., part-owned by
Diageo Plc, tumbled 4.1 percent to 19.06 yuan.  Inspections showed as much as 1.04 milligrams per kilogram
of dibutyl phthalate, or DBP, against the “standard” of 0.3
mg, in JiuGuiJiu’s samples, Xinhua reported, citing the General
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine. Tests show that almost all Chinese liquor products
contain plasticizers, at an average 0.537 milligrams per
kilogram, Xinhua said, citing the China Alcoholic Drinks
Association.  Energy Shares  Baotou Steel, China’s biggest producer of the metallic
elements used in batteries and magnets, dropped 2.1 percent, the
most since Nov. 15, to 33.22  yuan . The company will shut for
another month smelting units that have been closed since Oct.
23, according to a statement to Shanghai’s Stock Exchange.  A gauge of energy shares in the CSI 300 declined 1.3
percent, the second-biggest drop among industry groups. The
 energy gauge  surged 1.7 percent yesterday, the most since Oct.
18. PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest oil producer, lost 0.9
percent to 8.51 yuan. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. fell 2.5 percent
to 16.50 yuan.  The Shanghai Composite slid to 1,995.17 yesterday before
rallying in the final hour of trading, the third time in two
months the gauge has rebounded after dropping below the 2,000
level. There had been speculation the PBOC would cut the
reserve-ratio requirement from Nov. 25 by 0.5 basis points,  Li
Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co., said
yesterday.  ‘Technical Bounce’  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 8.4 percent this year and
trades at 9.6 times estimated profit for 2012, compared with the
17.8 average multiple since Bloomberg began compiling the  data 
in 2006. The gauge’s trading volumes were 28 percent lower than
the 30-day average for this time of day, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Thirty-day  volatility  on the index was at 13,
compared with this year’s average of 17.1.  While stocks are due for a “technical bounce,” the gauge
may fall between 5 percent and 10 percent as prospects for
monetary easing diminish and U.S. budget concerns sour
sentiment, Hao Hong, Bank of Communications Co.’ managing
director of research, wrote in an e-mail yesterday. Hong is the
only strategist among 13 brokerages surveyed by Bloomberg at the
start of the year to forecast declines for Chinese stocks in
2012.  New Leaders  “The index is falling at a measured speed, most likely
countered by government purchases,” Hong said. The 2,000 level
“does not seem like a final bottom, even though valuation is
low,” he wrote.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 1.9 percent since the
ruling Communist Party named new leaders on Nov. 15 to oversee
the world’s second-largest economy. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN)  gained 2.1 percent in that time. The  iShares FTSE China 25
Index Fund , the biggest Chinese exchange-traded fund in the
U.S., advanced 1.1 percent yesterday.  -- Editors: Darren Boey, Chan Tien Hin  To contact the reporter for this story:
