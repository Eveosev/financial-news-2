Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest wind turbine maker, said talks with  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011)  about “strategic cooperation” are ongoing.  “I can confirm the talks are still existing,” Morten Albaek, the company’s chief marketing officer, said yesterday in
an interview in Sydney, declining to comment further on the
discussions first announced in August.  Some analysts have speculated that the chances of a deal
between Vestas and Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Heavy are fading.
Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas is seeking to return to a profit as
overcapacity in the industry squeezes margins.  “As time passes, the likelihood of a Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries deal has dwindled,” Daniel Patterson, a SEB AB
analyst in Copenhagen, said earlier.  Vestas’s bid to form a venture with Mitsubishi may be held
up because of delays in connecting turbine projects to the grid
in  Germany , Nordea Bank AB said last month.  Any partnership between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy would
coincide with a push by Japan to encourage more development of
renewable energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
