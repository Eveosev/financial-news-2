German electricity for 2013 delivery
fell to a record low, pushing loss margins for gas-fired power
plants to their widest in three weeks.  German baseload 2013 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, slid as much as 0.4 percent to 46.30 euros
($59.66) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the lowest level for the contract since it
began trading in May 2008.  The German clean-spark spread for next year, a measure of
gas-fired power plant profitability, widened by as much as 1.4
percent to minus 12.51 euros a megawatt-hour, its lowest level
since Oct. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany  may close as much as 14 gigawatts of aging fossil-
fueled capacity by 2015 as utilities start paying for permits to
emit carbon next year, Mark C. Lewis, an analyst at Deutsche
Bank AG, said today. Profits at gas-fed power plants in Germany
have been negative since the start of the year, which may
influence companies decisions to close plant, he said.  German December power, a European benchmark contract, fell
as much as 1.6 percent to 45.75 euros while the day-ahead
contract dropped as much as 7 percent to 46.50 euros amid
higher-than-expected wind output. Wind generation was at 5,584
megawatts at 1:03 p.m., compared with an earlier forecast for
today of about 2,000 megawatts from the website of Meteologica
SA, a Madrid-based weather bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
