Returns rose for the largest  oil
tankers  carrying Middle East crude to  Asia , the industry’s
benchmark trade route, according to the  Baltic Exchange .  Daily earnings for very large crude carriers on the Saudi
Arabia-to-Japan voyage gained 0.6 percent to $27,762, figures
from the London-based exchange showed today. Earnings reached
the highest level since May on Nov. 20, lifted by stronger
demand for crude as winter approaches. Each of the ships can
haul 2 million barrels of oil.  Charter costs for VLCCs on the benchmark voyage declined
0.5 percent to 55.29 industry-standard Worldscale points,
according to the exchange.  The Worldscale system is a method for pricing oil cargoes
on thousands of trade routes. Each individual voyage’s flat
rate, expressed in dollars a ton, is set once a year. Today’s
level means hire costs on the benchmark route are 55.29 percent
of the nominal Worldscale rate for that voyage.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a broader measure of oil-
shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs, fell
0.3 percent to 723, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
