Expectations for swings in
 Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to a four-year low as the central bank
intervened to stabilize the currency. Government bonds advanced.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, fell 20 basis points,
or 0.2 percentage point, to 4.50 percent. That’s the least since
August 2008. The rupiah reversed earlier losses to gain 0.1
percent to 9,628 per dollar as of 5:28 p.m. in Jakarta, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show.  The local currency’s movement last month was in line with
the central bank’s policy to  stabilize  it, the monetary
authority said in a Nov. 8 statement posted on its website. The
rupiah has weakened 5.9 percent against the dollar this year,
the second-worst performance among the 11 most-traded Asian
currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank
Indonesia’s  international reserves  increased for a fourth month
to $110.3 billion in October, central bank figures show.  “Price fluctuations in the rupiah have been limited due to
central bank intervention, despite its continued weakening
trend,” said Raditya Ariwibowo, a research analyst in the
treasury division at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta.
“Rising foreign reserves give the central bank more
ammunition.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.42
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
