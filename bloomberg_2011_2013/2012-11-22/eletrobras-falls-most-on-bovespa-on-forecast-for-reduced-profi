Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
South America’s largest power generator, fell the most on the
Bovespa index after saying earnings and sales will decline
significantly as the Brazilian government seeks lower rates.  Preferred shares slid 6.1 percent to 7.36 reais at 1:29
p.m. in Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the lowest
since October 2002. The benchmark Bovespa index gained 0.4
percent.  Eletrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based utility is known,
said in a regulatory filing today that earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization and revenue from generation
and transmission businesses will be “significantly lower” next
year.  Brazil  is ordering cuts to power rates of as much as 28
percent as part of an effort to bolster economic growth by
reducing expenses for manufacturers.  The government is offering Eletrobras 14 billion reais
($6.7 billion) in cash as compensation for agreeing to modify
rates laid out in contracts set to expire in 2015 and 2017, less
than half the 30 billion reais the company had said it expected
to receive.  Brazilian manufacturers pay more for electricity than their
peers in the U.S., most of the European Union and the largest
 emerging markets  -- China, Russia and  India  -- according to a
report published in July by the industrial federation of Rio de
Janeiro, known as Firjan.  Eletrobras’s preferred shares lost 71 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
