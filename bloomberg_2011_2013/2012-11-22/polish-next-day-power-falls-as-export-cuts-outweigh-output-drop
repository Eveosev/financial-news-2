Polish day-ahead electricity fell
for a fourth day as lower power shipments to neighboring
countries outweighed the effect of unplanned outages.  Next-day power in  Poland  declined 3 percent to 177.15 zloty
($55.59) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Companies including GDF Suez SA and  PGE SA (PGE)  were set to halt
651 megawatts of power in Poland for unplanned stoppages
tomorrow, data from the grid manager PSE Operator showed. In
addition,  Enea SA (ENA) , Poland’s third-largest utility, said it would
cut output by 260 megawatts at its Kozienice plant during most
of tomorrow’s peak hours. Imports from Sweden were set to flow
at a maximum of 600 megawatts for most of the day, amid reduced
exports to Germany, where day-ahead prices dropped on higher-
than expected wind output, grid data showed.  Next-day electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia rose dropped 3.9 percent to 47.73 euros
($61.50) a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the
countries’ market operators. The day-ahead contract in Hungary
settled 8.5 percent higher at 54.14 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
