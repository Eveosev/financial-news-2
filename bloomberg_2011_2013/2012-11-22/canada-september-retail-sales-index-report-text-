The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for September as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales edged up 0.1% to $39.1 billion in September,
following increases in the previous two months. Retail sales in
volume terms were flat.  In current dollars, gains were reported in 7 of 11
subsectors, representing almost 70% of total retail trade.  The largest increase in dollar terms among all subsectors
was a 0.6% rise at  motor vehicle  and parts dealers. A 0.9%
increase at new car dealers was partially offset by a 2.7%
decline at automotive parts, accessories and tire stores.  Following two monthly declines, sales rose 2.5% at
miscellaneous store retailers. Stores in this subsector include
used merchandise stores, office supplies and stationery stores,
and pet supplies stores.  Clothing and clothing accessories store sales increased
0.8% after falling for the previous three months. Higher sales
were reported by clothing stores (+0.8%) and shoe stores (+2.5%),
while sales fell at jewellery, luggage and leather goods stores
(-0.8%).  Food and beverage store receipts edged up 0.1%, the fourth
increase in five months. Sales were up 0.2% at supermarkets and
other grocery stores. Specialty food stores (+1.4%) rose for a
fifth consecutive month. Beer, wine and liquor store sales
declined 1.0%.  Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 0.8%. Sales
in this store type have been on a general downward trend since
the end of 2011, mainly as a result of lower receipts from sales
of televisions.  General merchandise store sales decreased 0.7%. Department
store sales declined 0.9%, while the “other general merchandise
stores” industry had a sales decrease of 0.6%.  Sales at gasoline stations declined 0.6% after two
consecutive monthly increases.  Sales up in five provinces  Retail sales rose in five provinces in September. Alberta
(+1.7%) reported the largest gain in dollar terms, in part a
result of higher sales at new car dealers. Sales advanced in
this province for three consecutive months.  British Columbia registered a 0.3% sales increase.  The largest decline in dollar terms was in  Quebec , where
sales fell 0.7%, partly as a result of lower sales at new car
dealers.  Sales in Ontario were flat in September, following an
increase in August.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
