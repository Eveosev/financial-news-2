India ’s rupee traded near a two-
month low before the government seeks lawmakers’ approval for
policy changes announced this quarter in the winter session of
parliament that begins today.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  needs legislators’ support
for plans to allow more foreign investment in pension and
insurance industries. Opposition parties are threatening a no-
confidence vote over an earlier move to allow international
supermarket chains to hold a majority stake in retail outlets.  Fluctuations in the rupee will be “contingent upon further
reforms, implementation of announced reforms and the broad
 Dollar Index ,” strategists at Citigroup Inc., including
Singapore-based Gaurav Garg, wrote in a report received today.
“With the ruling coalition reduced to minority status in both
houses of parliament, the market is suspicious of the outcome.”  The rupee slipped to 55.1450 per dollar as of 10:37 a.m. in
Mumbai, from 55.1250 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 55.3750 yesterday, the weakest level since
Sept. 13, when the government began announcing measures to
improve public finances and attract investment.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 9.75 percent.  The rupee rose earlier after U.S. data added to speculation
a recovery in the world’s largest economy is gathering momentum.
Jobless claims fell by 41,000 to 410,000 last week, Labor
Department data showed yesterday.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 55.95 per

compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 56.01 versus 55.98. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
