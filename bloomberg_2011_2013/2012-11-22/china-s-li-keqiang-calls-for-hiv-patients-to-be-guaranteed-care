Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang
called on hospitals to guarantee the right of those living with
HIV to care after he read reports about an individual who was
denied treatment, the Ministry of Health said.  The patient, who suffered from lung cancer and had been
denied treatment because of HIV, falsified medical records to
hide the infection in order to get surgery, the ministry said in
a  statement  posted to its website today. A report about the
patient in unidentified media attracted widespread attention and
was read by Li, the statement said.  Li instructed the ministry by telephone that people with
HIV should not be discriminated against, according to the
statement. He also added that the safety of doctors and nurses
treating HIV-positive patients was equally important, it said.  China was estimated to have 780,000 HIV carriers and AIDS
patients at the end of 2011, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported, citing a Ministry of Health Statement.  Li, a member of the nation’s Politburo Standing Committee,
was previously governor of the Chinese province of Henan, where
a blood collection program infected hundreds of thousands with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, New York-based Human Rights
Watch wrote in a March 2006  report .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
