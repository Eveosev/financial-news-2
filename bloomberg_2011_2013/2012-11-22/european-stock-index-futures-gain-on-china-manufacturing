European (SXXP)  stocks advanced for a
fourth day, posting the longest winning streak in five weeks,
after a report signaled Chinese manufacturing expanded for the
first time in 13 months.  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-largest brewer, jumped
the most in 13 months after reporting first-half profit that
beat estimates.  Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGO) , publisher of
Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper, surged the most in 3 1/2 years
after announcing a share buyback. Alcatel-Lucent SA soared 16
percent after the company was said be in financing talks with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.6 percent to 271.7, a
two-week high, at the close in  London . The benchmark gauge has
 rallied 16 percent  from its 2012 on June 4 as the  European
Central Bank  and the  Federal Reserve  expanded their asset-
purchase plans. The U.S. markets are closed today for the
Thanksgiving holiday.  “Everyone is waiting for the brakes to be eased a bit
after the new formation of the government,” said Christian Zogg, who manages about $540 million as head of equity and fixed
income at LLB Asset Management AG in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. “If
the Chinese economy wants to grow about 8 percent, it needs a
purchasing managers’ index that’s over 50.”  A PMI released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics showed a preliminary reading of 50.4 for November,
adding to signs that growth in the world’s second-largest
economy is rebounding after a seven-quarter slowdown. That
compared with a final level of 49.5 in October. A reading above
50 indicates expansion.  Euro-Area Manufacturing  Euro-area factory output contracted less than economists
had estimated, another Markit report showed. The measure of
manufacturing climbed to 46.2 this month from 45.4 in October.
That beat the average economist estimate of 45.6 in a Bloomberg
survey. Separate manufacturing PMIs for  Germany  and  France ,
 Europe ’s two biggest economies, also beat projections.  Spain ’s 10-year government bonds rose for a third day as
the nation’s borrowing costs declined when it sold 3.88 billion
euros of securities, exceeding its maximum target, for debt due
in 2015, 2017 and 2021.  The region’s debt crisis and a deadlock over Greek aid
raise the stakes for European Union budget talks starting today
in Brussels, testing whether the 27-nation bloc is heading for
more integration.  National benchmark indexes climbed in all of the 18
western-European markets. France’s CAC 40 increased 0.6 percent,
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX jumped
0.8 percent.  SABMiller Gains  SABMiller advanced 6.4 percent to 2,801 pence, for the
biggest increase since October 2011. Earnings before interest,
taxes and amortization, excluding some items, rose 17 percent to
$3.17 billion, the company said. That compared with the $3.1
billion median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Daily Mail  climbed 11 percent to 524 pence, for the largest
rally since April 2009. The company said it will buy back shares
for as much as as much as 100 million pounds ($160 million).
Daily Mail also said its net debt dropped to 613 million pounds
in the year ended Sept. 30, from 719 million pounds 12 months
earlier.  Separately, Liberum Capital Ltd. said Daily Mail has become
more of a business-to-business company than a newspaper group
and its shares must be re-rated accordingly.  Alcatel Financing  Alcatel-Lucent surged 16 percent to 92.5 euro cents, the
sharpest increase since February 2011, after people familiar
with the situation said the company is in talks with Goldman
Sachs about obtaining a loan to strengthen the unprofitable
network equipment vendor’s balance sheet.  Under terms still being discussed, the New York-based
investment bank would grant Alcatel-Lucent funding of an
undisclosed amount, while the Paris-based firm would offer some
of its assets as collateral, said the people, who asked not to
be named because the deal isn’t final.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  climbed 1.3 percent to 2.52 euros, the highest
price since Aug. 27, as Danske Bank A/S raised the stock to buy
from sell and more than doubled its price estimate to 2.90
euros. Danske said Nokia’s 2013 outlook continues to improve.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  added 1.7 percent to 693.5 pence after Barclays
Plc raised Europe’s second-biggest discount airline to equal
weight, a recommendation similar to hold, from underweight,
saying the company improved both “revenue and non-fuel cost
fundamentals.”  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group advanced 2.6 percent to 6.78 euros and
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  rose 4.9 percent to 12.51 euros. Barclays
raised its price estimates for the airlines by 58 percent to
6.30 euros and 12 percent to 11.50 euros, respectively, citing
lower restructuring risk.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 32 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
