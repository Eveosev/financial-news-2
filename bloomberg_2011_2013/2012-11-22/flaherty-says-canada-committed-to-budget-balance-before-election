Canada is aiming to balance its
budget before the next federal election expected in 2015 by
pressing ahead with cost cuts and forgoing new spending, Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today.  Flaherty, in a speech today where he announced the start of
public consultations for next year’s budget, said he will resist
pressure from “special-interest groups” for new spending or
tax breaks as he prepares the 2013 fiscal plan. He also pledged
not to increase taxes.  “We simply cannot afford to risk the future of our
children and grandchildren by running deficits longer than
necessary,” Flaherty said, according to a prepared text of the
speech distributed by his office. “Although we are prepared to
be flexible and pragmatic should circumstances warrant, our plan
is to stick to our plan: balanced budgets and low taxes.”  Last week, Flaherty issued a fiscal update that projected a
balanced budget in the fiscal year that begins April, 2016.  The government would act to protect the Canadian economy
should external risks to growth materialize and will continue to
build on “pro-growth initiatives” such as measures to improve
worker skills and training and encourage  venture capital , he
said.  “We will prepare accordingly and responsibly to protect
Canadians and the Canadian economy,” Flaherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
