Nigeria ’s naira advanced to its
highest level in two weeks amid increased inflows for purchases
of fixed-income securities.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer rallied for a
second day, gaining 0.3 percent to 157.3 a dollar at 3:04 p.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital, the strongest on a closing
basis since Nov. 8. The naira has appreciated 3.2 percent this
year, the second-best performing currency tracked by Bloomberg
in Africa.  The naira’s appreciation could be traced to tight monetary
conditions, improved supply of foreign exchange to the market by
oil companies and increased inflows from portfolio investors,
central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said Nov. 20 after the
Abuja-based regulator held its benchmark rate at a record-high
12 percent.  “Sales of foreign exchange by  oil companies  and offshore
portfolio investors had a role, too,” Gregory Kronsten, head of
economic and fixed-income research at FBN Capital Ltd. in
 London , said in an e-mailed note today.  Inflation, which accelerated for the first time in four
months to 11.7 percent in October on widespread flooding of
farms, is still above the bank’s target of less than 10 percent.  Borrowing Costs  Nigeria’s 10-year borrowing costs fell to a record low of
12.01 percent at an auction yesterday after the Debt Management
Office sold 25 billion naira ($159 million) of the notes due
January 2022, the Abuja-based agency said today. Demand was more
than double the supply. The central bank also sold 116.18
billion of Treasury bills yesterday.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. added Nigerian bonds to its benchmark
emerging-market index series last month, predicting the
inclusion may lure $1.5 billion to sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-
largest economy. Barclays will add Nigeria to its local-currency
government bond index in March, it said Nov. 6. The credit
rating of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-largest economy was raised
one level on Nov. 7 to BB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  Yields on 10-year naira debt fell 2 basis points to 12.27
percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 were
little changed at 4.4 percent  The central bank  sold $400 million  at foreign-currency
auctions this week, the most in eight. The regulator sells
dollars on Mondays and Wednesdays to keep the naira within a 3
percent band around 155 a dollar.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.2 percent to 1.8957 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
