Serbia’s current-account deficit
widened 27.7 percent in the first nine months from a year
earlier as the  trade gap  expanded, remittances fell and foreign
direct investments declined.  The January-September shortfall reached 2.46 billion euros
($3.17 billion), the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said on
its website today. The monthly gap almost doubled to 279.6
million euros compared with August.  The trade deficit expanded 9.5 percent from a year earlier
to almost 4.03 billion euros, as imports increased 4.4 percent
while exports grew 1.5 percent.  Remittances through September dropped 13.6 percent from a
year earlier to 1.4 billion euros, while foreign direct
investments were negative, the bank said. Nine-month portfolio
investment fell 94 percent to 96.5 million euros from 1.64
billion euros a year earlier.  The central bank forecasts this year’s current-account gap
at 3.1 billion euros, or 10.7 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
