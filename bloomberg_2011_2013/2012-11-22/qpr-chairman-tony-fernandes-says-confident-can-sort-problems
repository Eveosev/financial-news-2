Tony Fernandes, chairman of Queens
Park Rangers Football Club, said he was “confident” he can
turn things around at the English soccer club which has failed
to win a league game this season.  “I’ve been in worse situations before,” Fernandes said in
an interview with Bloomberg TV in Kuala Lumpur. “Let’s wait and
see. We remain confident that things can be sorted.”  Fernandes declined to comment on the fate of the club’s
manager  Mark Hughes .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
