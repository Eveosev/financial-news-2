U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said he’ll work to change European Union rules requiring
companies to submit quarterly performance statements, arguing
they encourage short-term thinking.  Responding to a July report he commissioned from the
economist John Kay into the equity market, Cable also supported
aligning fund managers’ pay with the interests of investors to
create incentives to deliver absolute returns rather than
tracking the market.  “Faced with the need to deliver short-term performance,
active asset managers will have an incentive to focus on what
the market is doing, seeking to outperform other asset managers
rather than to engage with companies to understand and foster
the creation of value,” Cable said in a speech to the National
Association of Pension Funds in  London  today. “So pension
schemes and other asset holders need to issue clear mandates for
active asset managers.”  In his report, Kay, a visiting professor at the  London
School  of Economics, said investors should act as “stewards”
of a small number of selected stocks over a long period,
encouraging them to take a deeper interest in the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
