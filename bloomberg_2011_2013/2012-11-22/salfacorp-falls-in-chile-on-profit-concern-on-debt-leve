Salfacorp SA (SALFACOR)  retreated the most in
three months after reporting a 15 percent decline in quarterly
profit and as  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  expressed concern over the debt
of Chile’s largest construction and engineering company.  Salfacorp slumped 3.5 percent to 1,060.5 pesos at the close
in Santiago, the biggest loss since Aug. 27. The Ipsa benchmark
index retreated 0.1 percent. Salfacorp is the worst performer
after  Multiexport Foods SA (MULTIFOO)  among members of the Ipsa over the
past 12 months, with a 22 percent slump.  The company had a profit of 2.9 billion pesos ($6 million)
in the third quarter, down from 3.43 billion a year earlier,
according to a statement filed yesterday with  Chile ’s securities
regulator.  “Although the company did not breach covenants, we are
still concerned about the company’s relatively high debt
levels,” Santander analysts Nicolas Khaliliyeh, Francisco Errandonea and Rodrigo Ordonez said in a note to clients today.  IM Trust SA, a Santiago-based brokerage, cut its
recommendation for Salfacorp yesterday to hold from buy, saying
asset sales have supported the company’s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, in
the past two quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
