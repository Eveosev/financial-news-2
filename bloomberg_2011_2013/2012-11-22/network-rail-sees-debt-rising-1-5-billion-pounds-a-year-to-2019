Network Rail Ltd., the U.K.
government-backed track and stations operator, said funding
needs will increase by about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) a
year until 2019  Net borrowing reached 28 billion pounds to the end of
September, up from 27.2 billion pounds in March, because of 2.1
billion pounds of capital spending driven by higher rail
passenger traffic, the state-owned company said in an earnings
statement. Network Rail is making plans for the five year period
from April 2014 and Finance Director Patrick Butcher said he
expects debt levels to grow.  “We see our debt continuing to rise at about the same
level as it has through the last three or four years, which is
going up a billion and a half or so a year,” Butcher said in a
phone interview. “That’s driven by the fact that the railway is
growing.”  The money is needed to upgrade work on Britain’s railways
as passenger levels continue to rise, he said. Last year there
were 1.3 billion train journeys on the network with some 25,000
trains running on its tracks each day, making the network the
busiest since World War Two.  Current projects include a 6 billion-pound upgrade to the
Thameslink line that spans  London  from north to south and the
Crossrail project to build an east-west line through the
capital, Butcher said.  Revenue totalled 3.2 billion pounds in the six months to
September, compared to 3 billion pounds last year, with net
operating income at 1.2 billion pounds, the company reported.
The value of Network Rail’s assets rose to 45.3 billion pounds,
up from 43.1 billion pounds in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
