Singapore â€™s stockpiles of residual
fuels rose to the highest level in more than four months,
according to data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
 fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
increased 4.6 percent to 22.2 million barrels in the week ended
yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the
ministry, said today in an e-mailed statement. Supplies are at
the highest level since July 4.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline rose 7.9 percent to 10.9 million barrels. Middle
distillates such as gasoil and kerosene fell 16 percent to 9.2
million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
