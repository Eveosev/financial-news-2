A bomb exploded early this morning
at the home of a Greek judge in the northern Athens suburb of
Halandri, police said.  The blast occurred at around 2 a.m. local time and
seriously damaged the judgeâ€™s home as well as surrounding houses
and vehicles, according to a police official, who did not want
to be named. No injuries were reported, police said.  The targeting of the judge may be related to a case of a
kidnapping of a Greek businessman, Athens News Agency reported,
without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
