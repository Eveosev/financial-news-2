Mota-Engil SGPS SA (EGL) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest construction company, will end the year with an order
book that exceeds 3.5 billion euros, Chief Financial Officer
Goncalo Martins said.  The builder forecast in March that its order book would
remain above 3.5 billion euros this year compared with 3.8
billion euros in 2011. Mota-Engil’s order book reached 3.3
billion euros in the nine months through September, it said in a
regulatory filing yesterday.  Mota-Engil also plans to maintain its debt “under
control” by seeking opportunities to sell non-strategic assets,
Martins said in an e-mailed response to questions. The company
is still “negotiating” a partnership with a Brazilian
construction company, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
