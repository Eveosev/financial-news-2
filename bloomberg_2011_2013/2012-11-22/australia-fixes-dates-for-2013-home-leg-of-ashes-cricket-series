Australia  will host next year’s
Ashes cricket opener against  England  12 weeks after the teams
are scheduled to finish their series in the U.K.  Cricket Australia today announced the dates for the 2013-14
edition of the sport’s oldest international rivalry, with the
first match starting Nov. 21 in Brisbane. Further Tests will
take place in Adelaide, Perth and  Melbourne  with the series
finale in Sydney scheduled to finish Jan. 7, 2014.  England, which holds the Ashes after a 3-1 away victory in
2010-11, hosts Australia in the U.K. next year in a five-match
series finishing Aug. 25. The teams are playing back-to-back
home-and-away contests to prevent a quick turnaround between the
Ashes and the 2015  World Cup , which will be co-hosted by
Australia and  New Zealand  early that year.  England, which will get three tuneup matches before the
opening Test and another tour game after the series opener, will
also play five one-day internationals and three Twenty20 games
in Australia, with those dates yet to be released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
