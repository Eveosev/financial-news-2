The ruble strengthened for a fourth
day as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, rose and companies
converted foreign currency revenue to pay taxes next week.  The ruble appreciated 0.1 percent against the dollar to
31.1519 at 5:03 p.m. in Moscow. It fell 0.4 percent versus the
euro to 40.1494 and dropped 0.1 percent against the central
bank’s euro-dollar target basket.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export earner, added 0.2
percent to $110.28 a barrel on signs  China ’s manufacturing is
expanding. The payments will total about 400 billion rubles
($12.8 billion), according to Alexei Egorov, an analyst with
Moscow-based OAO Nomos Bank.  “Rising oil prices remain the main growth factor for the
ruble,” Dmitry Polevoy, a Moscow-based economist at ING Groep
NV, said in an e-mailed note today. “The tax period is also
supportive.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.6250 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.6420 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell one basis point to 192,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields fell four basis points to
6.6729 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
