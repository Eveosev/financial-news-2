Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP) 
said December crude shipments on the Trans Mountain pipeline are
oversubscribed by 70 percent.  Subscriptions on the portion of the system delivering to
refineries in British Columbia and Washington were 72 percent
over capacity, the company said in an e-mailed bulletin.  The Trans Mountain mainline system is expected to transport
279,292 barrels a day in December, 2.5 percent more than
estimated November shipments of 272,336, according an Oct. 22
notice. Shippers will be able to deliver 30 percent of nominated
volumes in December, the company said.  The Puget Sound line will carry 132,696 barrels a day next
month, up 12.8 percent from this month, the Houston-based
company said.  The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) Trans Mountain system runs
from  Edmonton ,  Alberta , to terminals and refineries in central
British Columbia, the Vancouver area and the Puget Sound region
in Washington, according to the companyâ€™s website.  Products also move to California, the U.S. Gulf Coast and
overseas through the Westridge marine terminal in Burnaby,
British Columbia. The section of the line to the dock is
expected to transport 77,518 barrels a day in December. Three
barges and five tankers are scheduled to load during the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
