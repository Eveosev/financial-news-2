Brooklyn Nets forward Reggie Evans
was the first National Basketball Association player to be fined
under the league’s new anti-flopping rule.  Evans was fined $5,000 for a second offense in which he
faked an action that appeared to be caused by a foul from an
opponent.  Evans was disciplined for exaggerating contact from the  Los
Angeles Lakers ’ Metta World Peace two nights ago. He had been
warned for falling down with little or no contact during a fight
for a rebound against the  Boston Celtics  on Nov. 15.  Last month, the NBA adopted the anti-flopping rule that
fines players as much as $30,000 for falling to the court with
the intent of having referees call a foul on an opponent.  The rule will be enforced beginning this season, NBA
Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Stu Jackson
said in a statement.  “Flops have no place in our game -- they either fool
referees into calling undeserved fouls or fool fans into
thinking the referees missed a foul call,” he said.  The NBA’s Board of Governors and Competition Committee said
any player determined by video review to have committed a flop
will first receive a warning. Further violations will result in
fines and possible suspension, with discipline starting at
$5,000 for a second case and escalating to $10,000, $15,000 and
$30,000.  The league defined flopping as a physical act that appears
to have been intended to cause the referees to call a foul on
another player.  To contact the reporter on this story:
