Greek 10-year bonds advanced for a
10th day, pushing yields to the lowest since the nation’s debt
was restructured in March, amid optimism European policy makers
are taking steps to stem the nation’s fiscal crisis.  Spain ’s government securities rose for a third day as the
nation sold 3.88 billion euros ($5 billion) of securities at an
auction, exceeding its maximum target.  Greece ’s government has
appointed a team of officials to begin preparatory work on a
debt buyback, financial news website Capital.gr reported,
without citing anyone. German bonds were little changed as
leaders of the 27 European Union nations meet today for budget
talks. Finance ministers resume debate on Greece next week.  “It is very likely that we see an improvement in the loan
terms for Greece,” said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “We have seen in the past this
also feeds through to the other bailout countries. It was a good
sign that we exceeded the overall target” at the Spanish
auction, he said.  The yield on  Greek 10-year bonds  fell 32 basis points, or
0.32 percentage point, to 16.43 percent at 4:34 p.m. London
time, after falling 65 basis points to 16.10 percent. The 2
percent security due February 2023 climbed 0.78, or 7.80 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 34.47 percent of face value.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said yesterday she saw a
chance for a Greek aid deal as soon as next week, while Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the Eurogroup is united on the
idea of a bond buyback for the Mediterranean nation, although
some “technical questions” remained open.  EU Meeting  European Union finance ministers meeting in Brussels two
days ago left the next tranche of Greek aid frozen until another
gathering on Nov. 26. They failed to tackle the dual task of
steering an extra 32.6 billion euros to the country through 2016
while finding a way to tame the resulting increase in its debt,
already the highest in  Europe .  Spain sold notes due in October 2015 at an average yield of
3.617 percent, down from 3.66 percent at a similar auction on
Nov. 8. The country also sold securities maturing in July 2017
and April 2021. Separately, it sold 3.3 billion euros of bonds
due in September 2017 in a private placement to the social
security reserve fund.  ‘Doing Well’  “Spain has been doing well,” Allan von Mehren, chief
analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen said before the
auction. “Spanish bonds were selling off a bit until the
beginning of this week but we’ve seen risk sentiment improve
since then.”  The Spanish 10-year yield fell five basis points to 5.66
percent after dropping to 5.64 percent, the lowest level since
Nov. 7.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-
region markets today, followed by those of Ireland, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  of shares gained for a fourth
day, rising 0.6 percent. U.S. markets are closed today for the
Thanksgiving public holiday.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was at 1.43 percent after rising to
1.45 percent, the highest level since Nov. 7.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank for a
10th month in November, a report showed today. A  composite index 
based on a survey of  purchasing managers  was little changed at
45.8, from 45.7 in October, London-based Markit Economics said.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  German bonds returned 3.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities rose 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
