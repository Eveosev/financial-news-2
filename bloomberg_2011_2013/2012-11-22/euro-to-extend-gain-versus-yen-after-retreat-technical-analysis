The euro may extend gains that have
pushed it to the strongest since April versus the yen after
first weakening to a level of so-called support, Credit Suisse
Group AG said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency is poised to advance toward 107.74
yen, the 78.6 percent retracement of its slide from March until
July, according to analysts including  David Sneddon , head of
technical analysis research in  London , citing so-called
Fibonacci theory. Before that takes place, the euro is initially
poised to weaken to 104.62 yen, which represents the highs set
last month, they wrote.  “Acceleration through 104.83 yen paves the way for further
upside, eventually to 107.74 yen,” the analysts wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients. “Pivotal support now lies at the 104.62
prior high and we expect a brief correction back to this level
before the market extends higher.”  The euro gained 0.6 percent to 106.50 yen at 1:53 p.m. in
London after rising to 106.58 yen, the strongest level since
April 30. The last time it traded at 107.74 yen was April 23.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Support refers to an area where buy orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security, currency
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
