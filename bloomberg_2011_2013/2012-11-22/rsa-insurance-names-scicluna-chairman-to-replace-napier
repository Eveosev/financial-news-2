RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA) , the U.K.’s
biggest property and casualty insurer by market value, named
Martin Scicluna to replace John Napier as chairman.  Scicluna, a non-executive director of  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY) , will join RSA’s board on Jan. 1, the London-based insurer
said in a statement today. Napier will step down at the end of
this year after 10 years at RSA, according to the statement.  RSA, formerly known as Royal & Sun Alliance, has been
seeking to sell more insurance in markets such as Chile, Uruguay
and the Middle East to offset falling sales in Europe. The
company said Nov. 8 that  nine-month revenue  rose 4 percent as
growing demand in  emerging markets  offset  flat sales  in the U.K.  “Martin will bring a fresh approach that will support our
aims to deliver an excellent service to our customers and value
for our shareholders,” Edward Lea, a senior independent
director at RSA, said in the statement. “His considerable
knowledge and understanding of the financial-services sector and
his board experience will be real assets to the group.”  Scicluna will step down as a director of Lloyds in March,
the bank said in a separate statement. He chairs the  audit
committee  at Britain’s biggest mortgage lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
