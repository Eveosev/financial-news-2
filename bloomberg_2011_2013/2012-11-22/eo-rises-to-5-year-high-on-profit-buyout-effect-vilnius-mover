TEO LT AB (TEO1L) , Lithuania’s biggest
communications company, rose to a five-year high on renewed
investor demand after a financial report combined with the
smaller supply of shares after a buyout bid by  TeliaSonera AB. (TLSN)   The shares rose as much as 3.1 percent today in Vilnius,
closing up 2.8 percent at 0.728 euros, the highest since July
31, 2007. The move helped push the  OMX Vilnius (VILSE)  stock index up
1.45 percent today to a 12-month high of 352.25.  TeliaSonera of  Sweden  increased its stake in TEO LT to
88.15 percent through a voluntary takeover bid in June at a
price of 0.637 euros. Institutional investors, including  East
Capital Asset Management (EACBALT) , agreed to sell at that price, given
the poor outlook for telephone services. TEO shares have risen
10.1 percent since it reported on Oct. 15 that growth of
Internet, data and TV sales more than offset declines in phone
revenue in the third quarter.  “The company’s results are good and investors now expect a
dividend for this year of no less than last year’s,” Andrius
Suminas, a broker at Swedbank in Vilnius, said in e-mailed
remarks. “Given the small free float after the buyout,
investors seeking to buy the shares have to raise the price.”  Besides dividend expectations, some investors speculate
that TeliaSonera, which also offered to buy all of TEO’s shares
in 2009, may soon return with a third offer, Tadas Povilauskas,
an analyst at investment bank Finasta said by phone in Vilnius.  Today’s volume of 178,806 shares was twice the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
