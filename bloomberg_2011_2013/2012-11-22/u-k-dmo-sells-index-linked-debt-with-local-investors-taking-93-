   The U.K. sold 3.25 billion pounds
of 0.125 percent index-linked gilts maturing in 2044 through
banks, with 93 percent allocated to domestic investors, the Debt
Management Office said in a statement.  The bond was sold at a gross redemption yield of 0.331
percent. Sales by so-called syndication in the fiscal year which
started in April have reached 24.9 billion pounds, the debt
office said.  The transaction is part of the 164.4 billion pounds of the
Debt Management Office planned to raise for the government for
this fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
