New Zealand’s earthquake-devastated
Canterbury province, home to the nation’s third-largest city,
has recovered to pre-quake levels of economic activity,
according to ASB Bank Ltd.  A gauge of economic conditions in the South Island province
was 0.1 in November, indicating activity exceeded the level in
June 2010, ASB said in an e-mailed statement. Christchurch city
and the surrounding Canterbury province have been rocked by
quakes since September 2010, including a temblor in February
2011 that killed 185 people and closed the city’s business
center.  “Over recent months we have seen steady improvement in
most indexes,” Auckland-based ASB’s Chief Economist  Nick Tuffley  said. “Canterbury wage growth has been stronger than
the rest of the country. These price developments signal demand
is lifting, even if it is yet to be apparent in some activity
indicators.”  ASB compiled the gauge from a mix of construction, housing,
employment, consumption and production indicators with June 2010
based at zero. The monthly index was published for the first
time today. The construction sub-index was the only one with a
value exceeding zero, reflecting a surge in building consents
and concrete production, the bank said.
