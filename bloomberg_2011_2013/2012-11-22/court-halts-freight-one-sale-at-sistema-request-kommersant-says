A Moscow court blocked state OAO
Russian Railways board of directors from selling 25% plus one
share in Freight One at the request of AFK Sistema,  Kommersant 
said, without saying where it got the information  Sistema said its bid should be considered in talks on the
shares after the sale was blocked due to a financial reporting
technicality, Kommersant said. Russian Railways agreed to sell
the stake to a company controlled by Russian billionaire
 Vladimir Lisin  for 50 billion rubles ($1.6 billion), Kommersant
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
