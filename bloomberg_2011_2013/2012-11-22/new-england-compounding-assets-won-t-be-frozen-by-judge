New England Compounding Pharmacy
Inc., the  Massachusetts  company whose injectable steroids have
been linked to an outbreak of fungal meningitis, won’t have its
assets froze under a federal court order.  U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor in  Boston  rejected a
request for an asset freeze by plaintiffs in one of about a
dozen cases in the court filed against New England Compounding
and six individuals. The plaintiffs sought an order that would
have covered as much as $461 million, according to Saylor’s
ruling on a preliminary injunction yesterday.  “The court does not see a reason on the present record to
seize the intangible assets immediately and put the company out
of business,” Saylor said in his ruling. “If nothing else, it
appears that public health and the balance of equities favor an
orderly and proper recall of the company’s products.”  Saylor ordered  New England  Compounding not to pay dividends
to shareholders, award bonuses to officers and employees that
are outside the “ordinary course of business,” or make
extraordinary transfers of cash and assets.  Krista Robinson, a spokeswoman for New England Compounding,
didn’t immediately return a message yesterday after regular
business hours seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Cole v. New England Compounding Pharmacy,
12-12066, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
