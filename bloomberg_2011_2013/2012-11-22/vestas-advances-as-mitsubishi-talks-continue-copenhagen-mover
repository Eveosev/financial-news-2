Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest wind turbine maker, was the  biggest gainer  on the  OMX
Copenhagen 20 index (KFX)  today after the company said talks with
 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  are still continuing.  Vestas climbed as much as 5.8 percent, and rose 4.4 percent
to 25.50 kroner as of 9:32 a.m. The volume of Vestas shares
traded was 13 percent of the three-month daily average.  Morten Albaek, the company’s chief marketing officer, said
yesterday that talks over a “strategic cooperation” are still
underway, declining to comment further on the discussions first
announced in August. Nordea Bank AB said today a number of
market participants had started to doubt whether a venture with
Mitsubishi would materialize.  “Whether or not a deal will happen is still uncertain, but
an agreement is -- as we’ve said before -- a price trigger for
the share,” Jesper Bamberger, a stock adviser for Nordea in
Copenhagen, said in a note.  The Aarhus, Denmark-based company is looking for an
investor to help it weather falling turbine prices, Chief
Financial Officer Dag Andresen said Nov. 7. Vestas, struggling
to return to profit as overcapacity in the industry squeezes
margins, said the same day it will cut 3,000 more jobs and
reduced its full-year cash-flow forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
