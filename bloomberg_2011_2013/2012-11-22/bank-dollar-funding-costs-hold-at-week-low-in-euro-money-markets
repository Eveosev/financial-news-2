The cost for European banks to
convert euro interest payments into dollars held near the lowest
in more than a week, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to borrow in dollars, was 28 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate at 8:35 a.m. in  London , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The measure reached minus 30 on Nov. 16, the
most expensive in two months.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 29 basis
points, or 0.28 percentage point, below Euribor.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another rose to a 1 1/2-month high. The difference
between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-
OIS spread, was little changed at 12.9 basis points, the highest
since Oct. 8.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.072
percent yesterday, from 0.074 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was unchanged at 6.1 basis points, the lowest
since Aug. 1.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday to 226 billion euros ($290 billion) from 230 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
