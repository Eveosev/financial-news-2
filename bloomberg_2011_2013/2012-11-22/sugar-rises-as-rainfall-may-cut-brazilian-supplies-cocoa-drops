Sugar rose in  London  on speculation
that excess rain will reduce output in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer. Cocoa fell, erasing earlier gains.  Sugar-cane producing areas in Brazil will have rain this
week, after irregular precipitation in the previous 10 days
helped speed up the harvest, weather consultant Somar
Meteorologia said Nov. 20. Moisture in Center South, the main
growing area, by the weekend may affect fieldwork and
harvesting, Somar said Nov. 19.  “There’s about a month left in the crushing season, but
there are some rains maybe cutting that short and forcing mills
to leave cane in the field,” Keith Flury, an analyst at
Rabobank International in London, said by phone today.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in March rose 0.8
percent to settle at $522.40 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in
London. ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , where investors trade raw
sugar, cocoa and arabica coffee, is closed today for the
Thanksgiving holiday.  Cocoa for delivery in March fell 0.8 percent to 1,573
pounds ($2,506) a ton in London. Prices earlier rose as much as
0.7 percent on signs of increasing demand from processors.  Cargill Inc. is ramping up cocoa processing after a
slowdown earlier this year, Jos de Loor, president of the
company’s cocoa and chocolate unit, said in an interview
yesterday. Global grindings will rise 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent
in the 2012-13 season begun last month, he said. Bean demand
will outpace supply by about 50,000 metric tons in the period,
according to the International Cocoa Organization.  Robusta coffee for delivery in January advanced 0.6 percent
to $1,873 a ton after declining 2.2 percent in the previous four
sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
