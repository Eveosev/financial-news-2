Spain  sold 7.15 billion euros ($9.21
billion) of bonds, half to its pension reserve fund in a private
sale, as it shores up financing amid efforts to avoid a European
bailout.  The country sold 3.88 billion euros of debt at an auction,
exceeding the maximum target of 3.5 billion euros. In a separate
transaction it also sold 3.27 billion euros of notes maturing in
Sept. 2017 to the welfare reserve fund at a yield of 4.792
percent, according to the official gazette and a spokesman at
the Economy Ministry.  The Treasury has already sold all the bonds it had planned
to issue this year, and is pressing ahead with auctions to
finance its needs for 2013. The private placement with the
state’s 67 billion-euro pension reserve fund, which has
traditionally bought debt at auctions, comes after the
government also chose a private sale to raise money for its
regional bailout fund earlier this year.  “The private placement money may be used for the regional
lending fund or to go toward the overshooting of the central
government deficit this year,” Gianluca Ziglio, a strategist at
UBS AG in  London  said in a telephone interview. “Spain has a
lot of financing that still has to be accounted for, which the
market would probably struggle to take down, so they are trying
to find other ways to cover it.”  Holdings Doubled  The  Economy Ministry  spokesman said the fund was
reinvesting following a redemption. The fund can only invest 500
million euros per issue at each bond auction, making a private
placement more convenient, he said. A spokeswoman for the Labor
Ministry, which runs the social-security fund, said it was
investing excess liquidity, without giving details, and declined
to say why it didn’t buy the debt at auctions.  The reserve has almost doubled its holdings of Spanish debt
since 2008 as declining demand for the nation’s bonds prompted
it to start replacing German, French and Dutch debt with Spanish
equivalents.  The Treasury set out to sell 86.4 billion euros of medium-
and long-term debt this year and after today’s sale had sold 105
percent of that amount, it said in a statement. When the
government agreed in July to bail out the regions with as much
as 18 billion euros, it said it would keep its auction calendar
unchanged and raise the funds via a private placement among
Spanish banks and a 6 billion-euro loan via the state lottery,
which has still to be completed.  Even as the government says it will meet its budget-deficit
goal of 6.3 percent of gross domestic product this year,
economists expect a 7.1 percent shortfall, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, increasing potential borrowing needs.  Bailout Deliberations  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  continues to deliberate over
whether to seek a European bailout that would allow the  European
Central Bank  to buy Spanish bonds. He has said since Aug. 3 he
would consider seeking a rescue, which would be the second after
his government agreed to a 100 billion-euro  credit line  for the
nation’s banks in June.  At the auction today, the Treasury sold notes maturing in
2015 at 3.617 percent, compared with 3.660 on Nov. 8. The
current five-year benchmark was sold to yield 4.477 percent,
compared with 4.525 percent on the secondary market before the
sale and 4.766 percent at an auction in October. Bonds maturing
in 2021 yielded 5.517 percent.  Demand was 2.09 times the amount sold for the 2015 bonds,
down from 2.83 times on Nov. 8. It was 2.61 for the five-year
notes, from 2.47 times on Oct. 4, and 1.77 for the 2021 bonds.  “Today’s Spanish sale was comfortable,”  Raj Badiani , an
economist at IHS Global Insight said in a note. “We continue to
argue that the calmer Spanish sovereign financing environment is
a temporary respite, given the profound economic and fiscal
strains.”  The 10-year benchmark bond yield declined to 5.615 percent
at 4:40 p.m. in  Madrid  from 5.709 percent yesterday. Spain’s
borrowing cost have fallen from a euro-era record of 7.75
percent on July 25, before ECB President  Mario Draghi  first
signaled the bank’s willingness to intervene in markets when he
pledged to do whatever it takes to defend the euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
