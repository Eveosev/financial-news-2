U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will pledge 225 million pounds ($359 million) of
government money to help kick-start private housing and spur
economic growth.  “The coalition has identified major housing projects that
have hit a wall -- and we are intervening directly to unblock
them,” Clegg will say in a speech to the National House
Building Council in  London  today, according to extracts released
by his office.  Clegg will argue that homebuilding has been held back by
cash-flow problems following the banking crash; bureaucracy and
licensing issues and a lack of upfront investment for
infrastructure.  “Unless we take radical action we will see more and more
small communities wither, our big cities will become ever more
congested as we continue to pile on top of each other; and the
lack of supply will push prices and rents so high that, unless
you or your parents are very rich, for so many young people
living in your dream home is going to be a pipe dream,” Clegg
will say.  Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers
of Commerce, described Clegg’s pledge as “a welcome step in the
right direction.” He also said the government needs to be
“more ambitious,” and increase the Homes and Communities
Agency’s target by 100,000 homes by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
