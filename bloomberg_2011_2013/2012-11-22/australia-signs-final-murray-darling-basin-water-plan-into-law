Australia  signed into law a plan to
boost the amount of water returned to the Murray-Darling Basin
and ensure sustainable  food production  in last season’s second-
biggest exporter of wheat.  The government accepted the Murray-Darling Basin
Authority’s recommendation to return 2,750 gigaliters of surface
water to the environment, Environment Minister Tony Burke said
in a statement today. The plan will flush an average of two
million metric tons of salt from the system each year, he said.  The  Murray-Darling Basin , which extends from southern
Queensland to  South Australia , covers 14 percent of Australia’s
land and produces more than one-third of the nation’s food
including wheat and dairy. The government said Oct. 26 it would
spend an extra A$1.8 billion ($1.9 billion) over ten years from
2014 to increase the amount of water returned to the system by
450 gigaliters.  “Consistent over-allocation and mismanagement seriously
degraded the health of the system,” Burke said in the
statement. Discharging salt “will significantly  improve  water
quality and prevent land degradation,” he said.  The  Murray-Darling Basin Authority  was set up in 2008 to
create a plan to manage water in an area where some river beds
run dry in years of drought. Water  storages  in the Murray-
Darling Basin were 94 percent full as of Nov. 21, data on the
basin management authority’s website showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:
