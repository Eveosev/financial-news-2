Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose the
most in almost four months after yields fell at a government
debt auction. The dong weakened.  The State Treasury sold 1 trillion dong ($48 million) of
three-year notes with a 9.29 percent coupon yesterday, according
to a posting on the Hanoi Stock Exchange website. The treasury
sold the same tenor debt with a coupon of 9.55 percent on Nov.
13. Another 1 trillion dong of two-year securities were sold at
9.15 percent, compared with 9.35 percent previously.  “Demand at the auction was high, so the market thinks
prices will rise,” said Pham Phuong Lan, the Hanoi-based head
of fixed-income and currency trading at Bank for Investment &
Development of Vietnam.  The yield on the three-year bonds fell 18 basis points, or
0.18 percentage point, to 9.41 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest
decline since July 30 and the lowest level since Aug. 23. The
yield on the benchmark five-year notes dropped eight basis
points to 9.83 percent.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,863 per dollar as of
3:27 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much 1 percent on either side of the
daily fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
