Former world boxing champion Hector
“Macho” Camacho is clinically brain dead and family members
are trying to decide whether to take him off life support, the
 Associated Press  reported.  Camacho, 50, has been at Centro Medico trauma center in  San
Juan ,  Puerto Rico , after being shot in the face two days ago.
Dr. Ernesto Torres said today at a press conference that “Macho
Camacho has died, he is brain dead,” according to AP.  Camacho’s father wants his son taken off life support and
his organs donated, while one of the boxer’s sisters opposes the
idea, AP said. Camacho’s mother is also wavering and the family
is waiting for his oldest son to arrive in Puerto Rico later
today before making a decision, AP said, citing the boxer’s
former manager Ismael Leandry.  Camacho won junior lightweight, lightweight and junior
welterweight world titles in the 1980s. He was born in Bayamon,
part of the San Juan metropolitan area, retired in 2010 with a
79-6-3 career record, according to The Ring magazine’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
