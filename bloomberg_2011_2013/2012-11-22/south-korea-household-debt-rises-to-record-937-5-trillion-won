South Korea’s  household debt  rose to
a record in the third quarter as borrowing increased to finance
homes and consumption.  Household credit, the sum of home loans and credit
purchases, rose 13.6 trillion won ($12.5 billion) to 937.5
trillion won in the three months ended Sept. 30 from the
previous quarter, the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The Bank of Korea lowered its benchmark  interest rate  twice
this year to support growth. Asia’s fourth-biggest economy grew
1.6 percent in the three months through September from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
