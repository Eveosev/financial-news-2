OAO RusHydro jumped the most in more
than two months as Russian President  Vladimir Putin  approved a
cash injection of as much as 50 billion rubles ($1.6 billion)
for the country’s largest renewable energy producer.  RusHydro climbed 3.8 percent to 75.72 kopeks by the close
in Moscow, the biggest advance since Sept. 14. About 1.29
billion shares changed hands, equivalent to 2.1 times of the
three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Putin signed a decree approving a government proposal to
provide RusHydro with as much as 50 billion rubles from the
budget this year and allowing the company to issue additional
shares to increase its capital, according to an e-mailed copy of
the document. Putin delayed electricity tariff increases before
the presidential vote on March 4, hampering Rushydro’s efforts
to fund a four-year, $12.3 billion investment plan.  “Investors must be happy that the situation has been
resolved and that Putin had supported the government’s
proposal,” Ilya Koupreyev, an analyst at Aton Capital in
Moscow, said by phone.  The government’s stake in RusHydro should not drop below
60.5 percent, according to the decree.  To contact the reporter on this story:
