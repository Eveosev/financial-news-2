The U.K. may experience storms
through the weekend, potentially bringing floods and snow to
some areas, AccuWeather Inc. said.  Rainfall totals through tomorrow morning may reach 40
millimeters (1.6 inches) in some areas, with most regions
receiving 15 millimeters to 25 millimeters, the forecaster said
today in a  report  on its website. Wind gusts tonight may reach
50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour). Some parts of the
country received a month’s worth of rain in the past two days,
it said.  “Another round of locally heavy rainfall will once again
produce flooding problems,” AccuWeather said. “Strong winds,
combined with saturated ground, can lead to trees falling on
power lines and buildings.”  Another low pressure system will bring heavy rain and winds
on Nov. 24, AccuWeather said. A third storm system will arrive
late on Nov. 25 and Nov. 26, interacting with a cold air mass
that may cause snow, particularly in northern  England  and Wales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
