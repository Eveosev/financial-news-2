Thailand ’s five-year government
bonds rose, pushing the yield toward the lowest level in more
than a week, after foreign investors added to holdings amid
signs of a global economic recovery. The baht dropped.  Fewer people filed applications for unemployment benefits
in the U.S., while more Americans said this month the world’s
largest economy will improve than at any time in the past
decade, reports showed yesterday. Global funds  bought  $197
million more local sovereign debt than they sold in the first
three days of this week, according to data from the Thai Bond
Market Association.  “We have been seeing a recovery in economic data, which
improves risk sentiment,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency
strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “With plenty of
liquidity, funds are flowing to the Asian region.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 declined
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.024 percent as
of 3:10 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That approached a Nov. 20 level of 3.022 percent that
was the lowest since Nov. 9.  Thai exports probably climbed 20 percent in October after
rising 0.2 percent the previous month, based on the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey before official data due between
Nov. 23 and Nov. 28. U.S. jobless claims decreased by 41,000 to
410,000 in the week ended Nov. 17, the Labor Department
reported. The share of households expecting the U.S. economy
will get better rose to 37 percent in November, the highest
level since March 2002, according to a survey accompanying the
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index.  The baht slid 0.1 percent to 30.72 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at
4.30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
