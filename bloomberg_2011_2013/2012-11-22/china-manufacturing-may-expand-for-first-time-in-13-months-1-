A Chinese manufacturing index signaled the first expansion in 13 months, adding to signs that economic growth is rebounding after a seven-quarter slowdown.  The preliminary  reading  was 50.4 for a purchasing managers’ index released today by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics. It compares with a final level of 49.5 for October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Gains in manufacturing bolster prospects for a sustained pickup in economic growth that slowed last quarter to the weakest pace in more than three years. A rebound may smooth a once-a-decade leadership transition for the ruling Communist Party, set to install Li Keqiang as premier in March, and reduce the likelihood of additional monetary stimulus.  “The economic recovery continues to gain momentum,”  Qu Hongbin , chief  China  economist at HSBC in  Hong Kong , said in a statement. “However, it is still the early stage of recovery and global economic growth remains fragile.”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index climbed 0.8 percent as of 6:37 p.m. in  Tokyo , headed for its highest close in two weeks. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.7 percent lower after the biggest gain in three weeks yesterday, as waning speculation of lower bank reserve requirements overshadowed an increase in the PMI.  Higher Profit  China Gas Holdings Ltd. (384) , which supplies more than 7 million residential users and 40,000 industrial and commercial customers, said yesterday that it expects to report a “significant increase” in profit in the six months through September. Its shares gained the most in two weeks.  A separate, government-backed index of purchasing managers’ views at manufacturers, which showed an expansion in October for the first time in three months, is due to be released Dec. 1. The final HSBC-Markit index for November is due Dec. 3.  Zhang Zhiwei, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc., said that growth will pick up “strongly” this quarter to an 8.4 percent annual pace from 7.4 percent in the previous three months.  Some economic indicators in October pointed to a growth recovery, with exports rising at the fastest pace in five months and industrial output and retail sales exceeding forecasts. At the same time, new lending unexpectedly fell from a year earlier and  money supply  increased less than forecast.  Reserve Ratio  Economists have scrapped projections for any easing of monetary policy in the rest of 2012. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News Nov. 14-19 see China holding the reserve- requirement ratio for the biggest banks at 20 percent through the end of the year, based on the median estimate. That compares with the median forecast for a 0.5 percentage-point cut in last month’s survey.  China’s gross domestic product is poised to expand 7.7 percent this year, the weakest pace since 1999, based on the median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News this month. Growth may pick up to 8.1 percent in 2013, according to the median of 46 forecasts.  Elsewhere in Asia, Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  survived a bid to oust his government over its decision to allow foreign companies to open supermarkets in the country. A monthlong winter session of parliament started today and the ruling Congress party-led administration is looking to pass a series of laws aimed at turning around slumping support and an economy that is growing close to the slowest pace in three years.  European Summit  European leaders will begin a two-day summit in Brussels on the bloc’s next budget. U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  has threatened to veto a proposed spending increase that he says is excessive at a time when states are engaged in austerity policies.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output contracted for a 10th month in November, adding to signs that a slump in the 17-nation currency union will extend into the fourth quarter.  Brazil ’s unemployment rate probably fell to 5.3 percent in October from 5.4 percent in the previous month, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  South Africa ’s central bank is forecast to hold its benchmark  interest rate  at 5 percent.  Equity and bond markets are closed in the U.S. for the Thanksgiving holiday.  --Zhou Xin.
