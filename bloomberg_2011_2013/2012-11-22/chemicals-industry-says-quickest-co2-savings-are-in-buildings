Japan  and nations in  Europe  and
North America can help cut greenhouse gas emissions in the
building industry by 40 percent to 70 percent, a chemicals
industry lobby group said.  Governments should broaden incentives for technologies such
as wall insulation materials and reflective roof coatings to
decrease emissions instead of waiting for climate negotiations
that are progressing “very very slowly,” said Russell Mills,
vice chairman of the energy and climate leadership group at the
 International Council of Chemical Associations .  “Between now and 2050 you could save about 600 million
tons of CO2 equivalent a year,” Mills, who is also a global
director of energy and climate change policy at  Dow Chemical
Co. (DOW) , told reporters today in a telephone briefing. “The savings
potential in the buildings sector is huge and something
governments can control.”  While the industry is aware that “we also have to tackle
our own footprint,” and eventually reduce emissions faster than
the business-as-usual scenario, it has already cut back
consumption, Mills said.  Providing energy and building efficiency technologies to
poorer nations “is a challenge we should take up in ICCA,”
which for the first time will be an official observer to the
climate negotiations that start in Qatar this month, Mills said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
