Spain ,  Europe ’s second-largest wheat
buyer, cut imports of the grain by 38 percent in September from
a year earlier, while increasing corn purchases.  The country imported 695,429 metric tons of wheat in the

largest wheat importer last season, trade data show.  Spanish wheat imports from July through to September

a total of 6.11 million tons of wheat in the 2011-12 crop year.  September corn imports rose to 215,517 tons, from 173,854
