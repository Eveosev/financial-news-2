Russian  stock futures  rose to a two-
week high after a Chinese manufacturing index indicated the
first expansion in 13 months, signaling economic growth is
rebounding.  Futures expiring in December on the nation’s dollar-
denominated RTS Index gained 0.6 percent to 142,700 during
trading hours in  New York , where markets were closed for the
Thanksgiving holiday. Ruble futures were little changed at
31.283 per dollar.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 0.2 percent to 1,402.64
yesterday and has lost 1.6 percent in November. The benchmark
for Russian equities is little changed for the year, after
tumbling 17 percent in 2011. OAO RusHydro jumped the most in
more than two months yesterday as Russian President  Vladimir Putin  approved a cash injection for the country’s largest
renewable energy producer.  “The data we saw from  China  implies that fourth quarter
growth is actually going to be above consensus,” Julian Rimmer,
a trader at CF Global UK Ltd in  London , said by phone yesterday.
“It’s positive, but people will want to see a bit more evidence
or the Chinese easing a bit more.”  The preliminary November reading was 50.4 for a purchasing
managers’ index released yesterday by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. It compares with a final level of 49.5 for
October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  China’s share of Russian trade rose to 10.6 percent in
September from 10.1 percent a year earlier, according to  Russian
customs data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Urals Gains  Crude oil,  Russia ’s biggest export earner, traded near the
highest level in two days in New York amid concern that a cease-
fire between Israel and Hamas, which took effect on Nov. 21, may
not hold. Crude for January delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$87.14 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Brent oil for January settlement lost 0.3 percent to end
the session at $110.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Russian oil blend Urals crude climbed 0.2
percent to $110.28.  RusHydro added 3.8 percent to 75.72 kopeks in Moscow, or
2.4 U.S. cents, the biggest advance since Sept. 14. Trading
volumes were more than double the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Putin signed a decree approving a government proposal to
provide the company with as much as 50 billion rubles ($1.6
billion) from the budget this year and allowing it to issue
additional shares to increase its capital, according to an e-
mailed copy of the document.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in New York rose 0.3 percent on Nov. 21 to a
two-week high, led by OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest maker of
steelmaking coal. U.S. markets resume today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
