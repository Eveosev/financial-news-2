JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  may sell its
EcoSecurities carbon offset business in the U.K., according to a
report on the Carbon Finance  website  that sites unidentified
people.  The bank is keen to make an exit from the investment and
EcoSecurities executives are open to discussions with potential
buyers, the online news analysis service said.  Patrick Burton, vice-president of media relations at
JPMorgan in London, declined to comment on the report when
contacted by e-mail today.  JPMorgan acquired EcoSecurities in 2009 for 124 million
pounds ($198 million). The Oxford-based company is the largest
developer of carbon-offset projects under the  United Nations ’
Clean Development Mechanism, according to the UN Environment
Program’s Risoe Center in Roskilde, Denmark. The projects
generate Certified Emission Reductions that may be used by
companies in the European Union’s emissions-trading system.  CERs for December gained 2.6 percent to 80 cents yesterday.
