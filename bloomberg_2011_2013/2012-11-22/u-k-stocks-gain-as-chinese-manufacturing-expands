U.K. stocks  rose for a fourth day,
their longest winning streak in five weeks, as a report
indicated that China’s manufacturing industry will expand this
month for the first time in more than a year.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  posted the biggest gain on the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) 
after reporting first-half earnings that beat analysts’
estimates.  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  paced a
rally in mining stocks, each advancing more than 1.5 percent.
 Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGO)  jumped the most since 2009 after
announcing it will buy back shares over the next year.  The benchmark FTSE 100 rose 39 points, or 0.7 percent, to
5,791.03 at the close in London. The equity benchmark has
 rallied 10 percent from this year’s low  on June 1 as the
 European Central Bank  agreed on an unlimited bond-buying plan
and the  Federal Reserve  began a third round of asset purchases
in the U.S. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.7
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 0.4 percent.  “With the U.S. and China doing better, the world economy
might have a bit of a breather,”  Virginie Maisonneuve , who
helps oversee 202.8 billion pounds ($323 billion) as head of
global and international equities at Schroder Investment
Management Ltd., said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
“We’re trying to see if we have reached the end of the
deterioration, which is possible.”  In China, the preliminary  reading  for a purchasing
managers’ index increased to 50.4 in November from a final
figure of 49.5 in October, according to a release by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. The reading, which climbed
above 50 for the first time in 13 months, signals expansion.  Euro-Area Manufacturing  Euro-area factory output contracted less than economists
had estimated, a Markit Economics report showed. The measure of
 manufacturing  climbed to 46.2 this month from 45.4 in October.
That beat the average economist estimate of 45.6 in a Bloomberg
survey. Separate manufacturing PMIs for Germany and France,
Europe’s two biggest economies, also beat projections.  SABMiller surged 6.4 percent to 2,801 pence, its biggest
rally in 13 months. The world’s second-largest brewer said
 first-half earnings  before interest, taxes and amortization and
excluding some items rose to $3.17 billion. That compared with
the $3.1 billion-average analyst estimate.  A  gauge of mining stocks  listed on the FTSE 350 Index
advanced 0.8 percent. Glencore International Plc increased 2
percent to 340.7 pence, Xstrata gained 1.7 percent to 1,014
pence and  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  rose 2.4 percent to 299.1 pence.  Glencore and Xstrata extended their advance after the
European Commission approved its  $33 billion takeover  of Xstrata
Plc. Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said Glencore’s
offer to stop buying zinc from Nyrstar NV ensured that the
market for the metal would remain competitive.  Daily Mail  Daily Mail  jumped 11 percent to 524 pence, its largest
advance since April 2009, after saying it will buy back as much
as 100 million pounds of shares over the next year.  The publisher of the Daily Mail newspaper also reported
full-year adjusted earnings of 49.4 pence a share, exceeding the
 average analyst estimate  of 48.3 pence per share. Liberum
Capital said that the company’s business-to-business assets will
perform well over the next 12 months.  Mothercare Plc (MTC)  rallied 3.8 percent to 303 pence after
reporting a first-half  underlying pretax loss  of 600,000 pounds,
narrower than the average analyst estimate of 3.2 million
pounds. The results show encouraging signs that the children’s
clothing retailer will recover, Numis Securities wrote in a
report. The brokerage raised its price target on the shares.  Helical Bar  Helical Bar Plc (HLCL)  jumped 7.1 percent to 196 pence, its
largest gain since May 2009, after saying  first-half pretax
profit  increased to 5.2 million pounds from 4.1 million pounds a
year earlier.  Hochschild Mining Plc (HOC) , a silver producer with operations in
Latin America, dropped 1 percent to 487.3 pence. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its recommendation on the shares to sell from
neutral. The brokerage said that European silver-mining stocks
look expensive.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was 39 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. markets are closed today for the
