Chevron Corp. (CVX)  has five days to
respond to a lawsuit from  Repsol SA (REP)  for entering into an
agreement with  YPF SA (YPF)  to develop reserves in Argentina,
documents from the Spanish court where the case is filed show.  The mercantile court in Madrid gave the U.S. company 20
working days from Oct. 26 to answer the suit or risk being
excluded from the process, court documents obtained by Bloomberg
News show.  The court agreed to consider the case in the same decision,
saying it has the jurisdiction to do so. A court official, who
declined to be named in line with policy, confirmed the details
of the document, which isn’t public.  Repsol is suing Chevron after it signed a memorandum of
understanding with Buenos Aires-based YPF to study tapping wells
in Vaca Muerta shale formation. The deal was made after
 Argentina  expropriated Repsol’s majority stake in YPF, a
decision the Spanish company says is illegal and for which it is
seeking $10.5 billion in compensation from the Argentine
government.  Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, hasn’t been served
with any legal action, and any case would be “unproductive” as
Spanish courts don’t have the authority to rule on the issue,
James Craig, a spokesman for Chevron’s African and Latin
American operations, said yesterday. He didn’t reply to calls
and e-mails seeking comment today.  Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol, confirmed on Nov. 19
that the court had agreed to consider the suit against Chevron.  To contact the reporter on this story:
