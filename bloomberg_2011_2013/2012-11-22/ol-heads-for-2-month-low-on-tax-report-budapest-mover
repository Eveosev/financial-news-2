Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, fell to the lowest in more than two months, after
Nepszabadsag reported deductions from a new 50 percent  tax rate 
for energy companies won’t apply to all of their investments.  The shares fell 2.1 percent to 17,125 forint by the end of
trade in Budapest, the lowest on a closing basis since Sept. 6.
The benchmark BUX stock  index , in which Mol has the biggest
weighting at 32 percent, slumped 1.5 percent to 17,747.81.  Deductions from the tax rate announced last week will only
apply to investments that create a “large number of jobs,”
Nepszabadsag said, citing Peter Tajti, head of an industry group
representing natural-gas distributors. Few of the investments
expected in Hungary’s gas industry will be eligible for the
deduction, Tajti said.  “This is clearly a negative development that is likely to
trigger another sell-off and scare away investors for a while,”
Peter Csaszar, a Warsaw-based analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in
a research report today. “The majority of Mol’s domestic
investments in the energy business are of a maintenance nature,
thus it seems unlikely that Mol will be able to fully benefit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
