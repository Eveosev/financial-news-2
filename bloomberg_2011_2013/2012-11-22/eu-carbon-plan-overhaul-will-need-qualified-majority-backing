A potential overhaul of the European
Union’s emissions-trading system will require qualified-majority
backing from national governments, according to an official at
the EU’s regulatory arm.  Any draft measure in the future to introduce changes to the
carbon program design would be considered in an ordinary
legislative procedure, which doesn’t need unanimity, Piotr
Plizga, a policy officer at the European Commission’s climate
department, told a conference in Warsaw today.  The commission floated earlier this month six options to
strengthen the EU emissions-trading system in the long term,
ranging from deeper emission-reduction targets to price-support
mechanisms. Those scenarios are aimed at starting a debate on
the future of the bloc’s carbon program and do not constitute a
legislative proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
