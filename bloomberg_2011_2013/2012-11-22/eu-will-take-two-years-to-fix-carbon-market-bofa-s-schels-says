European Union lawmakers will
probably take one or two years to fix an oversupply in the
bloc’s carbon market as they deal with more urgent economic and
political problems, according to Bank of America Corp.  “With what’s happening with  Europe , given the huge
problems Europe has, I don’t see policy makers focused on
this,” Sabine Schels, an analyst at the bank, told delegates
today at the Emart energy conference in Amsterdam. “There’s not
enough political will.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
