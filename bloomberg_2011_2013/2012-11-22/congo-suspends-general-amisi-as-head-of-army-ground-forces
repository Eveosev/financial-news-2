Democratic Republic of Congo’s
government suspended the head of the army’s ground forces,
General Gabriel Amisi, after a United Nations experts’ report
accused him of trafficking ammunition.  Communications Minister  Lambert Mende  announced the
suspension on national television today, two days after Congo’s
army lost the city of Goma, the capital of mineral-rich North
Kivu province, to rebel forces.  According to a report published yesterday by the UN’s group
of experts monitoring Congo’s arms embargo, “The land forces
commander, Gen. Gabriel Amisi, oversees a network distributing
hunting ammunition for poachers and armed groups.”  Amisi was also accused of gold smuggling in last year’s
experts’ report, published in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
