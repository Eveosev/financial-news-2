Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index closing at its highest level in more than four months, as
the yen weakened past 82 to the dollar for the first time since
April, boosting earnings outlook for exporters.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 3.3
percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  added 2.3 percent after the carmaker
said  China  retail sales returned close to levels recorded before
a wave of anti- Japan  protests. Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s top
shipping line by sales, rose 3.6 percent after a gauge of  cargo
rates  recorded its longest winning streak since July.  NTN Corp. (6472) 
soared 15 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG said the bearing
maker will benefit from recovery in China.  The Topix rose 1.2 percent to 776.43, its highest since
July 4, at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo . More than three stocks
advanced for each that fell. The gauge gained 3.3 percent on the
week, extending a rally that started after the ruling party
called for elections last week. Japan’s markets are closed
tomorrow for a holiday.  “Today’s market is simply focusing on the currency,” said
 Naoki Fujiwara , a chief fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management
Co., which oversees about $6.3 billion. “The yen’s weakening
against both the dollar and euro is encouraging buying of
cyclical shares such as shipping, cars and other exporters.
Volume is swelling as foreign investors buy on expectations a
new government may step up stimulus measures.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  climbed 1.6 percent to
9,366.80 today, with volume more than 15 percent greater than
the 30-day average.  Election Rally  The Topix has risen 7.5 percent since Nov. 14, when Prime
Minister Yoshihiko Noda called for elections that polls show the
opposition party Liberal Democratic Party is likely to win.
Automakers and steelmakers are among industries leading gains as
the gauge approaches its strongest six-day advance since March
2011, amid speculation the LDP will push for a looser monetary
policy.  Japan’s broadest measure of share performance trades at 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less
than one means that companies can be bought for less than the
value of their assets.  The yen reached 82.59 against the dollar in Tokyo, the
weakest level since April 4. The Japanese currency also weakened
as far as 106.26 yen against the euro, its lowest since May 2.  Canon rose 3.3 percent to 2,912 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a
carmaker that relies on North America as its biggest market,
climbed 3.5 percent to 2,750 yen.  Toyota Surges  Toyota gained 2.3 percent to 3,515 yen. The automaker’s
operating profit declines by about 35 billion yen for every one
yen gained against the dollar, and by about 5 billion yen for
every one yen against the euro, said Joichi Tachikawa, a company
spokesman.  Toyota also got a boost after saying it expects demand for
Japanese cars in China to return to levels before protests
erupted in September over a territorial dispute.  Shipping lines gained after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure
of the cost of transporting commodities, added 0.7 percent
yesterday, rising for a nine straight day.  Nippon Yusen advanced 3.6 percent to 173 yen. Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines Ltd., the nation’s second-biggest shipping line by
revenue, climbed 2.4 percent to 211 yen.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index added 0.2 percent today. The
measure rose 0.2 percent yesterday in New York, as U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Egyptian Foreign Minister
Mohamed Amr brokered a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.  Jobless claims fell by 41,000 to 410,000 in the week ended
Nov. 17, the Labor Department said yesterday. The number of
applications matched the median forecast of 48 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  China Manufacturing  NTN gained the most in the Nikkei 225, rising 15 percent to
172 yen after Credit Suisse said the company may benefit from a
recovery in China as the government spending boosts demand for
bearings by railway companies.  Exporters to China gained as data showed manufacturing in
that nation may expand in November for the first time in 13
months. The preliminary reading was 50.4 for a purchasing
managers’ index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. That compares with a final level of 49.5 for October.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Murata Manufacturing Co., an electronic-parts maker that
depends China and  Taiwan  for 50 percent of its sales, climbed
2.5 percent to 4,600 yen in  Osaka .  TDK Corp. (6762) , an electronic
parts maker that gets more than 25 percent of its revenue in
China, rose 2.1 percent 3,180 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
