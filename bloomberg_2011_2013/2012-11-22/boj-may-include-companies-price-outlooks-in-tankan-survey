The  Bank of Japan (8301)  may include
companies’ views on prices in its Tankan survey of sentiment as
it looks to gain a broader view of how more than a decade of
deflation is affecting the economy.  The central bank said in  a statement yesterday  that it is
considering asking companies for their one-, three- and five-
year price forecasts in the quarterly survey, which it uses when
setting monetary policy.  The data would help rectify a lack of information on
medium- to long-term price forecasts by Japanese firms, the BOJ
said. The Tankan, which started in 1957 and surveys over 10,000
companies, is the country’s most closely watched gauge of
corporate sentiment.  The bank will seek public opinion on the proposal and
decide whether to proceed after Jan. 21. It plans to implement
the revision sometime around the first half of 2014 at the
earliest, according to the statement.  The BOJ revised down its inflation forecasts on Oct. 30
after  Japan ’s consumer prices fell for a fifth month in
September. It expects prices excluding fresh food to rise by 0.8
percent in the fiscal year that begins in April 2014, compared
with a 1 percent target announced in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
