Russia , the world’s third biggest
wheat exporter last season, is expected to ship 91 percent
of its 13.8 million metric tons of exportable grains by year
end, said rail group ZAO Rusagrotrans.  Russia may ship 12.5 million tons of its exportable cereals
for the 2012-13 season by the end of the calendar year,
Rusagrotrans, the country’s biggest carrier of grain by rail,
said in a note e-mailed today. Exports are seen at 14.2 million
tons if peas are included, the company said.  Outbound shipments of grain are seen slowing to 700,000
tons next month from about 1.45 million tons estimated for
November and 3.16 million tons in October, the company said.  Bigger corn shipments and smaller wheat and barley exports
are expected, Rusagrotrans said.  Russia’s deep-water ports on the Black Sea, including
Novorossiysk, the country’s major export hub, are expected to
handle 678,000 tons of grain this month, or 47 percent of all
shipments, Rusagrotrans said. That compares with 34 percent in
October.  Drought in the country this year caused domestic wheat
prices to surge and wiped out exporters’ profits by mid-
November, Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the country’s Grain
Union, said yesterday. Traders are now shipping more corn mostly
to Spain, Israel and  Turkey , as well as increasing exports of
peas and oilseeds, he said.  Wheat futures for March delivery have risen 32 percent and
corn futures for March have advanced 15 percent on the Chicago
Board of Trade this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
