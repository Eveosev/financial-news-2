Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. (933) 
said it’s seeking a new chief executive officer for its trading
and bunkering business after the former head quit amid
slackening fuel demand from the shipping industry.  The company is looking for a replacement for Quek Chin Thean, the former chief of Brightoil Petroleum (Singapore) Pte.
who resigned last week, Ella Mak, a spokeswoman for Brightoil,
said in a telephone interview from  Hong Kong . The company
appointed Stephen Qi Jun as chief operating officer to take
charge of daily operations, she said.  Brightoil is making changes to its oil-trading and ship-
fueling business amid an “extremely challenging shipping market
environment with poor demand and lower margins,” according to
an e-mailed statement from the company today.  The daily-operations team includes fuel oil traders Patrick
Latham, Jason Song Qi and Tan Chuan Hong, according to the
statement. Brightoil named Li Gang head of global marine
bunkering and Gary Wu chief risk officer to increase risk
management, according to today’s statement.  The group’s crude traders are led by Kevin Du and include
Zhang Xincheng, Tsuyoshi Minami, Robert French, Li Shiyong and
Manosh Saha, the company said.  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings expected a “significant
loss” for the three months through September because of a
“depressed” shipping industry and lower demand for marine
fuel, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing Nov. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
