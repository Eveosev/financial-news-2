European Union carbon permits were
little changed after demand for allowances in an auction
declined compared with a previous sale and German power for 2013
fell to a record.  Permits for December rose two cents to 6.79 euros ($8.73) a
metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. They earlier
fell as much as 2.5 percent to 6.60 euros a ton. Trading volume
was 9.3 million tons, the least since Nov. 1.  German baseload power for next year dropped as much as 0.4
percent to 46.30 euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest since the
contract began trading in May 2008, before erasing losses.  The EU sold 4.5 million permits at 6.64 euros a ton in its
fourth auction of allowances for 2013. Bidders sought 9.2
million permits in the auction, twice the volume for sale.
Buyers yesterday bid for 2.8 times as many permits as were
offered by the U.K. in its first sale of allowances for the next
phase of the bloc’s carbon market.  The EU, Greece,  Germany  and the U.K. are selling a total of
21 million tons of permits this week as the EU ramps up its
auctioning program before the start of the third phase, which
runs from 2013 through 2020.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
dropped 1.3 percent to 79 cents at 4:59 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
