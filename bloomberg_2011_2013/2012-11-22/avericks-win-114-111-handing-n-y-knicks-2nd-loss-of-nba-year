O.J. Mayo scored 27 points and the
 Dallas  Mavericks used a third-quarter run to give the New York
Knicks their second National Basketball Association loss of the
season.  Vince Carter added 25 points off the bench as the Mavericks
(7-6) won 114-111 last night at the American Airlines Center in
Dallas. Carmelo Anthony had 23 points to lead the Knicks (8-2).  “I tried to get them off of Carmelo, but they played
excellent defense,” said Knicks center Tyson Chandler, who had
21 points and 13 rebounds. “They really forced us into some
tough shots down the stretch.”  The second road loss of the season for the Knicks dropped
New York into a tie with the Memphis Grizzlies for the best
record in the NBA.  The Mavericks trailed 72-64 with six minutes left in the
third period before ending the quarter with a 20-8 run that
included 10 points by Mayo.  Dallas extended its lead to 12 points midway through the
fourth period before a late Knicks rally pulled New York within
one point at 112-111 with 75 seconds remaining. Anthony lost the
ball on the Knicks’ next possession and then missed a 15-foot
jumper with four seconds left.  At Oracle Arena in Oakland,  California , the Golden State
Warriors (7-5), led by Stephen Curry’s 25 points, defeated the
Brooklyn Nets 102-93.  Brook Lopez scored 22 points for the Nets, who fell to 6-4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
