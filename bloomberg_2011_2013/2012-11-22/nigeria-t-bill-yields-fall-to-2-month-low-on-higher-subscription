Nigerian Treasury bill yields
declined to the lowest in almost two months at an auction
yesterday as investors bid for three times the 116.18 billion
naira ($738 million) on offer.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold 30.647 billion naira of
91-day bills at a yield of 12.40 percent, the Abuja-based
central bank said today in an e-mailed statement, the lowest
since a Sept. 26 sale. The bank sold 31.246 billion naira of
182-day debt at 12.45 percent and 54.29 billion naira of 364-day
securities at 12.50 percent. Bids totalled 355.9 billion naira,
the highest since Oct. 24.  The central bank held its benchmark interest rate at a
record high of 12 percent to check inflation and stabilize the
local currency, it said Nov. 20. Inflation, which accelerated
for the first time in four months to 11.7 percent in October on
widespread flooding of farms, is still above the bank’s target
of less than 10 percent.  “Subscription is rising due to attractive yield,” Wale
Abe, chief executive officer of the Financial Market Dealers
Association, which groups lenders trading in the money market,
said by phone today. “By holding the  interest rate  at 12
percent, investors expect the central bank will borrow at a rate
that is at par with the benchmark rate or above it.”  The naira, which was 0.2 percent stronger at 157.42 a
dollar as of 11:49 a.m. in Lagos, has risen 3 percent this year,
making it the second-best performing currency in  Africa  after
the Guinean Franc.  Barclays will add Nigeria to its local-currency government
bond index in March, it said Nov. 6. JPMorgan Chase & Co. added
the West African nation’s bonds to its benchmark emerging-market
index series last month. Yields on 10-year naira debt fell two
basis points to 12.27 percent, according to yesterday’s prices
compiled on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  Nigeria  also sold 23.907 billion naira of 91-day securities
at a yield of 12.40 percent, 30.104 billion naira of 182-day
debt at 12.45 percent and 37 billion naira of 364-day bills at
12.50 percent yield to non-competitive bidders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
