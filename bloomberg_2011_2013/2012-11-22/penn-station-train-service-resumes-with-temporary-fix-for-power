Trains are starting to run again at
New Yorkâ€™s  Penn Station  after a  power failure  led to the
temporary suspension of all service.  The commercial power failure disabled the use of track
switches, Amtrak said in an e-mailed statement. Crews
temporarily resolved the issue with an alternate power source.  Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains are running as much as
90 minutes late. Long Island Rail Road began limited service out
of Penn Station, according to its Twitter page.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
