Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said his government is working to strike an
agreement on a bailout program it needs to recapitalize banks
and pay its bills.  “We’re still working very hard,” Christofias told
reporters during a European summit in Brussels today. In Nicosia
earlier, Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said Cyprus may need as
much as 17.5 billion euros ($22.5 billion) of aid, almost the
size of the country’s economy.  The ANA news agency reported today that Cyprus had reached
an agreement on emergency aid. A Cypriot official said on
condition of anonymity that a deal is nearly complete and an
announcement may come as soon as tomorrow.  Cyprus in late June became the fourth euro-area nation to
request a financial rescue since a 2010 bailout of  Greece . The
bailout will encompass banks weakened by their exposure to the
 Greek economy  as well as the public sector.  Talks between Cyprus and the so-called troika that oversees
euro-area bailouts “are continuing, and we hope outstanding
issues are settled soon,” Shiarly said in Nicosia.  The rescue will amount to about 6 billion euros to
refinance state debt from 2013 to 2016 and 1.5 billion euros to
cover fiscal deficits, Shiarly said, while as much as 10 billion
euros may be required for the bank recapitalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
