Workers at Anonima Petroli Italiana
SpA’s Falconara  refinery  near Ancona,  Italy , plan to stage a 
one-week strike starting Dec. 1, Ansa reported.  The labor protest, over pay and safety, will result in a
“cold-stop” of the site, the news agency said Nov. 20, citing
an unidentified union official.  The refinery can process 78,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
