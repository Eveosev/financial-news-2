Nokia Oyj  rose to its highest level
in almost three months as Danske Bank A/S recommended buying the
stock and after three block trades lifted the unprofitable
Finnish mobile-phone maker’s U.S. shares 12 percent.  Nokia shares climbed 1.3 percent to 2.52 euros at the close
in Helsinki, the highest level since Aug. 27. The Stoxx Europe
600 Index advanced 0.6 percent.  The stock has risen for four straight days amid signs that
the Espoo, Finland-based company’s new Lumia smartphone is in
demand, which may help revive Nokia’s sales and challenge the
iPhone and Android devices. Danske Bank analyst  Ilkka Rauvola 
raised his recommendation on the shares to buy from sell today.  “Nokia’s Windows Phone model 920 is doing better than
expected, and the outlook may continue to improve,” Rauvola
wrote in a note to clients, adding he expects 36 million
smartphones using Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone 8 software
like the Lumia to be sold in 2013, up from an earlier estimate
of 23 million devices.  Nokia’s American deposit receipts surged yesterday after
three block trades totaling 4 million shares helped lift the
stock above its 200-day moving average for the first time in 33
months. Trading volume today in Helsinki was 61.9 million
shares, almost double the three-month average.  Nokia on Nov. 19 said it received reports that its new
Lumia 920 smartphone had sold out in Germany. Such reports may
reflect “Nokia’s small initial volumes,” according to Rauvola.  To contact the reporter on this story:
