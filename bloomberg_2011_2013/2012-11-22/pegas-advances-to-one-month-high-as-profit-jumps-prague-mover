Pegas Nonwovens SA (PEGAS) , a Czech maker of
nonwoven textiles, rose to the highest level in about a month
after reporting a 57 jump in third-quarter profit.  The shares rose less than 1 percent to 465 koruna in
Prague, the highest level on a closing basis since Oct. 24.  Net income rose to 8.6 million euros ($11.1 million) in the
third quarter while revenue increased 10 percent to 47.9 million
euros, the Znojmo, Czech Republic-based company said in a
regulatory statement today.  “The results were above our estimates and market
consensus,” Josef Novotny, a Prague-based analyst at Ceska
Sporitelna AS, wrote in a note. “We expect a positive market
reaction today.”  The company expects an annual increase in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at the “lower”
end of its forecast range of 5 percent to 15 percent, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
