American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that counts the U.S. as its largest shareholder,
said it plans to invest about $500 million in  People’s Insurance
Company (Group) of China ’s initial public offering.  AIG currently owns about 9.9 percent of PICC Property &
Casualty Co., a unit of PICC Group with publicly traded shares
in Hong Kong, the insurer said in the statement through  Business
Wire  today. PICC Group, China’s biggest property insurer, is
seeking as much as HK$27.8 billion ($3.6 billion), according to
a regulatory filing.  PICC Group has commitments for about $1.85 billion of
shares from so-called cornerstone investors, including AIG, two
people with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Cornerstone
investors typically agree to hold  shares (2328)  for a fixed period of
time in exchange for a guaranteed amount of the offering.  The IPO would be the largest in Hong Kong since October
2010, when AIA Group Ltd. sold $20.5 billion of shares, and more
than double the $3.2 billion raised by companies in the city
this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  AIG is also exploring a joint venture with PICC Group and
PICC  Life Insurance  Co. that plans to distribute insurance
products, including life insurance, in major cities in China,
AIG said in the statement.  Shares of PICC Property rose 0.8 percent to HK$9.95 as of
10:31 a.m. local time in Hong Kong. They have declined 5.2
percent this year, trailing the 17 percent gain in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   To contact the reporters on this story:
