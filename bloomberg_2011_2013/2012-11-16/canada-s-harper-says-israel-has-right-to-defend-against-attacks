Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said Israel has the right to defend itself against
attacks that he linked to terrorism.  “We have been concerned obviously for some time about the
presence of a terrorist group, Hamas, in charge in the  Gaza
Strip ,” Harper said in response to a question today in Quebec
City, Quebec. “We condemn this terrorist group’s attacks on
Israel, we recognize and support Israel’s right to defend itself
against such terrorist attacks, but obviously we urge all sides
to take all precautions possible to spare any innocent lives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
