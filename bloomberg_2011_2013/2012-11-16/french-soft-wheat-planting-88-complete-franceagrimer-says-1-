France ’s soft-wheat crop was 88
percent  planted  as of Nov. 12, down from the year-earlier 98
percent pace, crop office FranceAgriMer said.  About 53 percent of the winter crop, to be harvested in
2013, had  emerged  from the soil, compared with 90 percent at the
same time last year, the agency reported today on its website.
Parts of the country have had excess rain in recent weeks. Wheat
planting in France, the European Union’s biggest grower, started
at the end of September.  Tillering , the leaf-development phase that follows
emergence, had started for 6 percent of the crop, compared with
26 percent last year.  France’s winter  barley  was 97 percent planted as of Nov.
12, against 99 percent last year.  Durum  wheat, the hard variety
of the grain used to make pasta, was 51 percent sown, down from
85 percent in 2011.  Farmers harvested 92 percent of the country’s  corn  crop,
compared with 100 percent a year earlier, FranceAgriMer said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
