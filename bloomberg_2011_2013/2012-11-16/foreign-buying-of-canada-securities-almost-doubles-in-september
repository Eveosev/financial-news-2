Foreign net purchases of Canadian
securities almost doubled in September from the month before on
government bond sales, the federal statistics agency said.  Purchases totaled C$13.9 billion ($13.9 billion) in
September and the estimated August purchase was increased to
C$7.56 billion from an initial C$6.90 billion,  Statistics Canada 
said today in Ottawa.  Total purchases included C$8.94 billion of  government bonds 
and C$1.52 billion of money-market paper, the report said. Non-
Canadians purchased a net C$3.29 billion of the country’s
stocks, led by shares of financial companies.  Year-to-date securities purchases of C$62.7 billion trailed
last year’s comparable total of C$70.1 billion, Statistics
Canada said.  Canadians  bought  a net C$6.03 billion of foreign securities
in September, following a sale of C$1.68 billion in August, led
by C$4.45 billion of stocks and C$1.58 billion of debt. The
September purchases included C$1.73 billion of Maple bonds,
Canadian-dollar debt issued by foreign organizations, the most
since October 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
