UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
are boosting their share of the structured note market with the
biggest Italian and Spanish lenders issuing the most securities
since at least 2007.  UniCredit sold $2.69 billion of the securities through Nov.
16, making it the fourth-biggest global issuer this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Germany ’s DZ Bank AG
dominates the market with $15 billion of issuance, followed by
Deutsche Bank AG at $4 billion and UBS AG with $3.1 billion,
data show. Santander sold almost $577.9 million of notes, almost
four times its total for last year.  UniCredit and Santander are lifting their share of a market
that’s shrinking as investors shun the securities because low
 interest rates  are hurting returns. Total issuance of $72
billion this year is the lowest since 2003, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Silvia Lamberti, a spokeswoman for UniCredit in Vienna,
declined to comment. Angela Roche Riesco, a Santander
spokeswoman, also wouldn’t comment. The data exclude the U.S.
and doesn’t count securities where the amount of principal
repaid can vary.  UniCredit sold the fourth-largest structured note this year
outside of the U.S., according to Bloomberg data. The 609.9
million euros ($777.3 million) of five-year securities, issued
on July 13, pay an annual coupon of 5.1 percent for three years.
After that time investors receive three times the three-month
euro interbank offered rate, capped at 5 percent.  In the U.S., sales of the notes so far this year are at
$34.4 billion, the least since Bloomberg began tracking the data
in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
