Portugal’s Socialists, the biggest
opposition party, led the ruling  Social Democrats  of Portuguese
Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  by a wider margin in a survey
of voters' intentions, Expresso reported.  The survey indicated 26.9 percent backing from  voters  for
the Social Democrats, 3.1 percentage points less than in a poll
published in October, the Portuguese weekly newspaper said. The
survey indicated 35 percent support for the Socialists, an
increase of 0.2 percentage points,  Expresso said .  The survey also indicated 10.1 percent support for the
conservative  People’s Party , which is part of the ruling
coalition, 0.1 percentage point more than in the previous poll,
according to Expresso.  The survey published today was carried out by Eurosondagem
SA from Nov. 7 to 13, and 1,033 valid telephone interviews were
used, Expresso said. The margin of error is 3.05 percent,
Expresso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
