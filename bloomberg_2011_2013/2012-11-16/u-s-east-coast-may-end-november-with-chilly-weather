The U.S. East Coast will close out
November with seasonal or slightly cooler than normal weather
while the southwestern states warm up.  MDA EarthSat Weather  predicts that the Northeast and mid-
Atlantic regions will have seasonal temperatures Nov. 26-30,
while  Florida ,  Georgia  and  South Carolina  dip 3 to 4 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.2 Celsius) below normal.  The Southwest is expected to be 5 to 7 degrees above normal
for the period, according to Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA.  “The end result is a pattern not unlike that average
pattern the past couple of months, with most stable warmth in
the Southwest, marginal cold in the Southeast, and variability
from the Midwest to Northeast,” MDA said.  November is the start of the heating season that runs until
March, when the most natural gas traditionally is consumed in
the U.S. Cooler-than-normal weather in the high-population areas
of the East Coast and Midwest helps boost demand for energy to
heat homes and businesses.  U.S. gas stockpiles fell 18 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 9, the earliest decline for a heating season since
2007, after expanding to a record 3.929 trillion cubic feet the
previous week, an Energy Department report yesterday showed.  Natural gas for December delivery has advanced 20 cents, or
5.7 percent, to $3.703 per million British thermal units so far
this week in  New York . The futures are up 8.8 percent from a
year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
