Voltech Group, an Indian provider of
services to the power industry, plans to set up a solar plant in
the southern state of  Tamil Nadu  to supply companies facing
mandatory clean-energy targets.  The Chennai-based company will set up a 2-megawatt farm by
March using panels from NanoPV Technologies Inc., the company
said in a statement. It plans to expand capacity to 10
megawatts, according to the statement, which didn’t give a
timeframe.  Demand for solar power is set to surge in Tamil Nadu after
the state announced a policy last month requiring large
consumers of electricity, including exporters, manufacturers and
operators of telecommunications towers, to source at least 6
percent of their electricity from solar by 2014.  India  has a
national goal of building 20,000 megawatts of sun-powered
capacity by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
