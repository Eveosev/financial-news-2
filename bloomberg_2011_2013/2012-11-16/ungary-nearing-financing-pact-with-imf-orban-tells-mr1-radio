Hungary  wants to reach a financing
agreement with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union and is close to a deal, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  told
state-run MR1 radio.  Orban, speaking in an interview on the channel today, also
reiterated that Hungary is seeking a “safety net” rather than
a loan from the international lenders as the country “can
certainly stand on its feet without an IMF loan.”  “The reason I propose that Hungary should keep negotiating
with the IMF is because hard times are coming in Europe, much
harder than many people think,” Orban said. “Hungary isn’t
just negotiating with the IMF, but with a joint IMF/EU
delegation. In recent months we’ve not been negotiating with the
IMF part but with the EU part, and we’ve made much progress.”  Hungary requested aid a year ago as its  credit rating  was
cut to junk. Talks for a loan of about 15 billion euros ($19
billion) were delayed multiple times because of the Cabinet’s
resistance to legal and economic conditions set by the IMF and
the EU. The IMF has no date set to continue aid talks with
Hungary, Gerry Rice, a spokesman for the Washington-based
lender, said Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
