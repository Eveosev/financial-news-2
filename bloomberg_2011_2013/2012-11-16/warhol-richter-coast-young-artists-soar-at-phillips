Phillips de Pury & Co. sold $79.9
million of contemporary art last night, setting records for four
young artists but failing to stir much excitement about top lots
by  Andy Warhol ,  Gerhard Richter  and  Jean-Michel Basquiat .  The evening’s tally surpassed the presale low estimate of
$73.6 million, although six of the 35 lots failed to find
buyers.  “At the end of the week there’s a bit of fatigue,” said
 Wendy Cromwell , a New York-based art adviser.  Phillips followed two stellar evening sales at Christie’s
and Sotheby’s earlier this week at which buyers spent a total of
$787 million on postwar and contemporary art.  Coupled with their day sales, the three auction houses sold
more than $1 billion of postwar and contemporary this week.  The top lot at Phillips, “Mao” (1973) by Warhol, sold for
$13.5 million. It was one of 14 lots whose sellers had been
guaranteed an undisclosed minimum price financed by the auction
house, third parties or a combination thereof.  Estimated at $12 million to $18 million, it drew a sole
bidder and was sold to that “gentleman in the room,” as he was
described by auctioneer Simon de Pury.  Another guaranteed lot, Basquiat’s 1982 canvas
“Humidity,” was estimated at $12 million to $18 million. It
drew a sole telephone bid to bring $10.2 million.  An abstract 1985 painting “Kegel (Cone)” by Richter,
whose market has risen dramatically in recent years but was
tepid this week, fetched $12.4 million just past its presale low
estimate of $12 million.  Sparking Fireworks  Works made in the past four years by younger artists
sparked fireworks. Tauba Auerbach’s small trompe l’oeil 2010
canvas “Untitled (Fold)” sold for $290,500, nearly double her
previous record set in June at Phillips in  London . In 2006,
Auerbach’s paintings went for $15,000 on the primary market.  Sterling Ruby’s 2008 “SP 17,” an 11-foot-wide spray-
painted canvas, brought $626,500, exceeding the presale high
estimate and nearly double his previous record of $326,500 set
at Phillips a year ago.  “It’s expensive,” said Don Rubell, co-founder of the
Rubell Family Collection and Contemporary Arts Foundation in
Miami where four monumental paintings by Ruby were shown in a
recent exhibition called  “American Exuberance.”   “People can’t get enough of them, I guess,” he said,
speaking of the record-setting young artists. “The reality is
they will be even more expensive a year from now.”  Chewing Gum  Dan Colen’s “S & M,” a 2010 canvas densely covered with
masticated-looking chewing gum in bright colors, was another
winner. Estimated at $200,000 to $300,000, it went for $578,500,
smashing the artist’s previous record of $386,500 set at
 Sotheby’s (BID)  in 2009.  The bidding for the Colen started at $140,000 with hands
going up all over the room; Cromwell placed the winning bid on
behalf of her client.  “It was a targeted purchase,” she said after the sale.
“It’s something I identified several years ago and tried to
obtain for the client on the primary market and could not.”  Phillips, which is owned by the Russian retailer Mercury
Group, charges buyers 25 percent of the hammer price up to
$50,000, plus 20 percent from $50,000 to $1 million and 12
percent above $1 million. Presale estimates don’t include the
buyer’s premium, while the sale total does.  Muse highlights include Jeremy Gerard and Philip Boroff on
 theater .  To contact the reporters of this story:
