European Union carbon permits may
drop below 6 euros ($7.65) a metric ton before a vote on a
plan to address the market glut set for Dec. 13, according to
Deutsche Bank AG.  Isabelle Curien, an analyst at the bank in Paris, forecast
prices will trade from 6 euros a ton to 8 euros a ton in the
period, according to an e-mailed research note.  “However, given the very large volume of allowances
coming to market in coming weeks, particularly from the
pool of 120 million Phase-3 allowances to be auctioned early,
we think there is a risk that prices could fall below 6 euros a
ton in the short term,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
