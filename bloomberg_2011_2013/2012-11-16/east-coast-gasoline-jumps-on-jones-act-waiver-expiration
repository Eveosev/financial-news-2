Gasoline advanced for the first time
in  three days  in New York Harbor as the waiver of shipping
regulations following  Hurricane Sandy  approaches an end even as
supplies in the region are at a four-year low.  Under the 1920 Jones Act, ships carrying cargo between U.S.
ports must be U.S.-built, flagged and crewed. On Nov. 2,
Secretary of Homeland Security  Janet Napolitano  issued a waiver
of the act, which allowed foreign-flagged ships to load fuel on
the U.S. Gulf Coast through Nov. 13 and deliver them to the U.S.
East Coast by Nov. 20.  Stockpiles of motor fuel on the East Coast fell by 1.54
million barrels to 45.1 million in the week ended Nov. 9, the
Energy Department reported yesterday. That’s the third
consecutive weekly decline and the lowest level since Sept. 26,
2008.  Reformulated,  84-octane gasoline  in the  New York  Harbor
gained 2 cents to trade at a premium of 17 cents a gallon over
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:23 p.m. Prompt
delivery of the fuel advanced 3.39 cents to $2.8801 a gallon.  Ships are delivering 1.75 million barrels of gasoline and
blendstocks to the Northeast under the waiver, according to data
compiled by the U.S. Transportation Department’s Maritime
Administration.  Phillips 66’s 238,000-barrel-a-day  Bayway refinery , which
is the largest single site in the New York Harbor area, is shut
after being taken offline Oct. 29 when Hurricane Sandy left the
plant flooded and without power in New Jersey. Phillips said
Nov. 5 that it planned to resume normal operations in two to
three weeks.  Hess Corp.’s Port Reading unit, with a capacity of 70,000
barrels-a-day and also located in  New Jersey , resumed operations
this week and plans to return to full rates by early next week,
the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
