A European Union carbon trade worth
about 195 million euros was cleared on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange yesterday.  The trade of 24.68 million metric tons of December 2013
carbon allowances that may have been brokered or carried out
directly between the buyer and the seller was at an undisclosed
price, according to data from the exchange. The contract traded
at 7.90 euros ($10.06) a ton 49 seconds later, the data show.  EU permits for December this year, the industry benchmark,
fell 3.2 percent to 6.90 euros a ton on ICE today at 10:14 a.m.
The contract has dropped 17 percent so far this week, which
would be the biggest weekly fall since Nov. 25 last year, as the
European Commission in Brussels seeks to fix a glut in supply.  The EU is seeking to push more commodities trading onto
regulated exchanges from less-regulated over-the-counter
markets. ICE handled a record volume of 78.8 million tons of
carbon permits yesterday, worth about 562 million euros at
yesterdayâ€™s closing price for the benchmark contract of 7.13
euros a ton.  United Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December rose 7.4 percent to 73 euro cents a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
