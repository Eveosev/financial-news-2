McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  sold its first
bonds in  Europe  in more than a year, taking advantage of
investor demand in the region as debt issuance overtakes 2011.  The world’s largest restaurant company by sales raised 500
million euros ($637 million) from 12-year notes yielding 53
basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, or 2.375
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Companies, banks and agencies sold 639 billion euros of
debt this year, a 9 percent increase from the same period in
2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Demand means highly rated
borrowers are paying record-low coupons, with  Nestle SA (NESN)  issuing
four-year notes last month that pay 0.75 percent and  Siemens AG (SIE) 
offering 0.375 percent on 2014 bonds.  “This will be one of the lowest coupons McDonald’s has
ever had to pay,” said Geraud Charpin, a  fund manager  at
Bluebay Asset Management Ltd. in London, which oversees $47
billion. “The spread is attractive versus secondary paper, but
the overall yield is quite unattractive. This is an industry
that has been very stable and demand in credit has been high.”  The sale is McDonald’s first in the European currency since
it raised 350 million euros from 4 percent bonds due 2021 in
February last year. The notes yield 46 basis points more than
swaps, down from an issue spread of 57, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  bond issue  will be used for general corporate purposes,
Becca Hary, a spokeswoman for the  Oak Brook , Illinois-based
company, said by e-mail.  SFL Spread  Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise SA (FLY) , the French real-estate
company, sold 500 million euros of five-year bonds yielding 275
basis points more than the benchmark swap rate. The Paris-based
firm returned to the  bond market  after pulling a sale of 500
million euros on Sept. 11 that was offered at a spread of about
250 basis points.  SFL’s existing debt was one of today’s worst performers in
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s investment-grade bond index,
with the yield premium on its existing 4.625 percent notes due
2016 widening eight basis points relative to German government
debt.  The cost of insuring against default on European corporate
debt rose for a second week, signaling deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Crossover, SovX  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 31
basis points this week to 565. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of
125 companies with investment-grade ratings climbed six basis
points to 137.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 14 governments increased nine basis points this
week to 126.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers rose seven basis points this week to
187 and the subordinated index rose eight basis points to 319.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  -- Editors: Andrew Reierson,  Paul Armstrong   To contact the reporter on this story:
