Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest
athletic-shoe maker, agreed to sell its Cole Haan fashion brand
to private-equity firm  Apax Partners  for $570 million as it
focuses on faster-growing businesses.  The transaction is expected to be completed in early 2013,
Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike said today in a statement. Nike
said in May that it was seeking to sell Cole Haan and soccer
brand Umbro.  Nike Chief Executive Officer  Mark Parker  is focusing on the
business units with the most growth potential and profitability.
 Iconix Brand Group Inc. (ICON)  agreed to buy Umbro in October for $225
million in cash.  “It frees Nike up to concentrate on the healthiest piece
of the business,”  Matt Powell , an analyst for SportsOneSource
in Scarborough, Maine. “Putting all of management’s attention
to driving athletic footwear worldwide is a good strategy.”  Nike rose 1.9 percent to $92.59 at the close in New York.
The shares have dropped 3.9 percent this year.  The company bought Cole Haan in 1988 for $95 million,
including debt. After a year of ownership, the division had
sales of $87 million.  In the fiscal year ended May 31, Cole Haan increased
revenue 2.7 percent to $535 million. That made up 2.2 percent of
Nike’s $24.1 billion in total sales. The unit had 178 stores,
including 109 in the U.S.  Decent Price  That means the sale price was about one times that of Cole
Haan’s annual revenue, which is decent considering it sold Umbro
for less than what it paid in 2008, according to  Paul Swinand , a
retail analyst for  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in Chicago.  The sales of Umbro and Cole Haan come after the units had a
combined loss of $43 million before interest and taxes in fiscal
2012 and would lose as much as $75 million if owned for all of
fiscal 2013, the company has said.  One potential hurdle to selling Cole Haan was what would be
done with the Nike patents used in some of the unit’s shoes.
Nike technology will continue to be used by Cole Haan during a
transition period, Mary Remuzzi, a Nike spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. She declined to say what would happen after that.  Apax, based in London, partnered with Jack Boys, who left
the CEO role at Nike’s Converse unit in 2009. Apax has
experience in retail and fashion, buying  Tommy Hilfiger  in 2006
for about $1.6 billion and then selling it to Phillips-Van
Heusen Corp. for about $3 billion in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
