New Zealand ’s economic growth will
accelerate next year and sustain that expansion in 2014 and
beyond, boosted by the stimulus from rebuilding the earthquake
damaged city of Christchurch, Prime Minister John Key said.  “The domestic stimulus from Christchurch is actually very
strong for a long time, it doesn’t stop in 2013,” Key said in
an interview on TV3’s “The Nation” today. He disagreed that
growth will peak next year.  The Reserve Bank in September forecast  growth  will
accelerate to 2.9 percent in the year ending March 2014 then
slow to 2.2 percent a year later.  New Zealand’s central bank updates its forecasts next
month, as does the Treasury Department which in the May budget
projected 3.1 growth in 2014-15.  “The  Reserve Bank  is a little more conservative,” Key
said. “If the Reserve Bank really believed that there would be
no growth beyond 2013 to speak of then the Reserve Bank would
cut  interest rates .”  Central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler kept the official cash
rate at a record-low 2.5 percent last month. Borrowing costs
have been held at that level since March last year, just weeks
after an earthquake killed 185 people and wrecked the heart of
Christchurch, the nation’s third-largest city.  New Zealand economic fortunes are tied to the global
recovery, Key said. Exports make up 30 percent of gross domestic
product.  “We have got the country growing but not as fast as we’d
like,” he said. “We are a nation that sells to the world, and
if the world is slowing down then we slow down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
