Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, mediating a dispute among parliamentary supporters
of Prime Minister  Mario Monti , opened a path to holding
elections in March, about one month before the government’s term
expires.  Napolitano, who had asked the government to stand until the
end of its term, stepped back from that request and said he
would evaluate parliament’s record when setting a date for the
national vote, according to a statement from the president’s
office distributed by e-mail. Regional elections may be set for
March 10, according to Napolitano, who issued the statement
after meeting with Monti and the speakers of parliament.  Napolitano intervened after Monti’s government provoked
criticism from supporters by scheduling the regional votes for
February. Silvio Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party, the
biggest member of Monti’s coalition, threatened to bring down
the government unless it held regional and national votes on the
same day. By delaying the regional vote to March, the general
election could be moved up.  Napolitano is seeking to get two more pieces of legislation
through parliament before allowing lawmakers to disband the
government coalition and commence campaigning. The president
asked for the 2013 budget, as well as a new electoral law to
allow the winner a better chance of forming a stable government.
That’s often a difficult task given Italian voters’ tendency to
scatter votes among many parties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
