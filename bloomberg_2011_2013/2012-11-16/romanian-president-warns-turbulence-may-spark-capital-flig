Romania  risks having net capital
outflows should it enter a new period of political turbulence,
President Traian Basescu said.  The Balkan nation, which forecasts about 3 billion euros
($3.8 billion) in capital inflows this year, saw higher-than-
expected capital flight during the summer after a government-led
effort to suspend the president failed, Basescu said during a
televised speech from Bucharest today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
