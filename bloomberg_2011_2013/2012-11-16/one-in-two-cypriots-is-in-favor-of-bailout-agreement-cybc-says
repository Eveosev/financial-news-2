One in two Cypriots believes that
Cyprus, the fifth euro area-member to request financial aid,
should instead sign a loan agreement with international lenders,
a poll by  Cypronetwork  for state-run broadcaster  CyBC  showed.  The poll found that 38 percent of those interviewed are
against the signing of an aid deal with the so-called troika of
the  International Monetary Fund , the European Commission and the
 European Central Bank .  Cypronetwork interviewed 1,205 people between Oct.26 and
Nov. 7. No margin of error was given.  Click here for Web link.  To contact the reporter on this story:
