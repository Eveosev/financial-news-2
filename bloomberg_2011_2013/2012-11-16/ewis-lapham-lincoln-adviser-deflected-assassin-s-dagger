In bed recovering from a bad
accident, Secretary of State William Seward was awakened by the
screams of his daughter, Fanny. Bursting into the room was a man
brandishing a gun and a knife.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  It was April 14, 1865, and John Wilkes Booth was just
entering Ford’s Theatre to assassinate President Lincoln.
Seward’s attacker was Lewis Powell, a member of the pro-
Confederacy conspiracy organized by Booth to kill the top three
U.S. leaders.  Despite the fact that his gun misfired, to get to his
target Powell had severely injured two of Seward’s sons as well
as his military nurse.  Fearing for his daughter’s life, Seward interposed his body
between Fanny and the armed man but was pushed back down on the
bed. Powell stabbed him repeatedly, cutting up Seward’s face and
neck: A jaw splint may have saved his life by deflecting the
knife from the jugular.  Powell was later caught and hanged along with fellow
conspirator George Atzerodt, who was supposed to kill the vice
president but got drunk instead.  I spoke with Walter Stahr, author of “Seward: Lincoln’s
Indispensable Man,” on the following topics:  1. Presidential Aspirations  2. Lincoln’s Cabinet  3. Assassination Attempt  4. Alaska Purchase  5. High Achievement  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
