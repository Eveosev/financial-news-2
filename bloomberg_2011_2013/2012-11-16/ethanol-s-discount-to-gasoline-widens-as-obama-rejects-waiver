Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed after the Obama administration rejected requests to
waive requirements for blending the fuels.  Ethanol rose 1.6 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.351 a gallon
on the Chicago Board of Trade, contracting the additive’s
discount to gasoline to 35.91 cents a gallon from 36.12 cents
yesterday, based on December futures prices. Gasoline’s premium
was 99.8 cents on Sept. 28.  Gasoline refiners will be required to blend 13.2 billion
gallons of the biofuel this year, the Environmental Protection
Agency said in rejecting petitions seeking the waiver from the
governors of  Arkansas ,  North Carolina ,  Maryland ,  Delaware ,
 Georgia ,  Virginia , New Mexico and  Texas . Market conditions don’t
justify such a move, the agency said in an e-mailed statement.  “The Obama election victory kind of telegraphed this,”
said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “He’s
thought of as supporting green energy. It’s more or less baked
into the market.”  Gasoline for December delivery rose 1.39 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.7101 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
while corn for March delivery advanced 0.8 percent to $7.31 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped
1.5 cents to $2.41 a gallon and in  Chicago  the additive was
unchanged at $2.35, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Spot Trading  Ethanol in  New York  tumbled 2 cents to $2.43 a gallon and
on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to $2.49.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Nov. 9, down from 92
percent in the prior period and the lowest level in four weeks.  This year’s U.S. corn harvest is forecast at 10.7 billion
bushels, the smallest in six years because of the worst U.S.
drought since the 1950s, the Agriculture Department said Nov. 9.
About 4.5 billion bushels will be used to make ethanol in the
year starting Sept. 1, or 42 percent of the 2012 crop,
department estimates show.  Under a 2007 energy law, the EPA can suspend the mandate
for blending ethanol with gasoline to stretch supplies if the
requirement would severely harm the economy of a state, region
or the U.S. The legislation calls for the U.S. to use 15 billion
gallons of corn-based ethanol annually by 2015.  Production Down  Ethanol production  is down 14 percent this year to 824,000
barrels a day, on pace to drop on an annual basis for the first
time since 1996 as companies wrestle with declining margins for
making the fuel from corn, Energy Department data show.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 28
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be made from the
sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol companies would have been decimated if the EPA
granted the waiver request, Kitt said.  “You could really hurt the market here,” Kitt said. “It
would wipe you out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
