Hungary’s cost to insure debt with
credit-default swaps rose to the highest in five weeks as a
dispute between U.S. political parties on the budget hurt
investor appetite for riskier assets.  The contracts rose 10 basis points to 318 by 4:43 p.m. in
Budapest, the highest since Oct. 11. The forint climbed 0.2
percent to 284.3 per euro, paring its loss this week to 0.3
percent, a fourth consecutive week of declines.  Hungary, the most indebted of the European Union’s eastern
members, extended its recession into a third consecutive quarter
as the euro region’s crisis weakened exports, the statistics
office reported yesterday. The benchmark MSCI Emerging Market
Index headed for its biggest weekly slide since July and
European stocks dropped to a two-month low as U.S. President
 Barack Obama  prepared to hold talks with Republican lawmakers on
the country’s so-called fiscal cliff.  “International sentiment is quite gloomy,” Zoltan Arokszallasi, a Budapest-based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG,
wrote in a research report today. “The American ‘fiscal cliff’
problem is remaining in investors’ focus. For that reason we’re
not expecting substantial forint appreciation.”  The U.S. fiscal cliff is the collection of $607 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take
effect at the beginning of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
