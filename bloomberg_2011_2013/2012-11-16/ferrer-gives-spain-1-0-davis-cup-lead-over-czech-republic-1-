David Ferrer  beat Radek Stepanek in
straight sets to give defending-champion Spain a 1-0 lead over
the  Czech Republic  in the Davis Cup tennis final.  Ferrer, ranked fifth by the ATP World Tour, won 6-3, 6-4,
6-4 over Stepanek at the 02 Arena in Prague. Ferrer is the
highest-ranked player on the Tour in the final, while the 34-
year-old Stepanek is ranked 37th.  “I played well, and I’m happy with my game,” the 30-year-
old Ferrer said. “It puts us 1-0 up, but it’s a very long
tie.”  Sixth-ranked Tomas Berdych faces No. 11 Nicolas Almagro in
today’s second singles match on the indoor hard court in Prague.
The best-of-five final continues with a doubles match tomorrow
and two reverse singles the following day.  Spain is trying to win the premier team event in men’s
tennis for the fourth time in five years and sixth time in all.
The Spanish team is without  Rafael Nadal , the world’s fourth-
ranked player, who’s been sidelined since June by a knee
injury.  The Czech Republic lost its only previous final appearance
to Spain in 2009. The former Czechoslovakia captured its lone
Davis Cup title in 1980.  The Davis Cup is celebrating its 100th final this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
