Chile’s peso touched a 12-week low
on speculation U.S. budget wrangling will weigh on global
economic prospects and sap demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso depreciated 0.1 percent to 484.45 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:57 a.m. in Santiago after touching 486, the weakest
intraday level since Aug. 20. The currency has fallen 1 percent
this week, its biggest drop since the five days ended Oct. 26.  Investors sought refuge in the dollar before the opening
round of talks today between President  Barack Obama  and
congressional leaders to avoid $607 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff. The U.S. is Chile’s
biggest export destination after  China . Copper, which makes up
most of Chile’s exports, traded at almost a two-month low.  “Markets haven’t stopped falling, and that has dragged
down commodities and currencies as well,” said Eugenio Cortes,
the head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa
SA in Santiago. “The Chilean peso is no exception. The market
is concerned about everything Obama faces in negotiations with
the Republicans and the tax rises. An increase in taxes would be
a strong blow to the  U.S. economy .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
