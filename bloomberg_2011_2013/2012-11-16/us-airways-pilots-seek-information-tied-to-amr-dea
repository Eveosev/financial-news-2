US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  pilots are
seeking a court order to gain access to information they say
they need to evaluate a possible merger with bankrupt American
Airlines.  The US Airline Pilots Association, the union representing
US Airways pilots, wants to question the airlines about the
merger talks and obtain documents, according to papers filed
today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  The union has “not been provided critical information
about the terms of the proposed combination and USAPA needs such
information to ensure a fair and effective merger,” it said.  US Airways has been pursuing a merger with Fort Worth,
Texas-based  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines. Tempe, Arizona-based
US Airways this week made its case for a merger to AMR’s
unsecured creditors committee, according to people familiar with
the matter.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
