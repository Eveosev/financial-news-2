Portugal ’s Socialist Party, the
biggest opposition group in parliament, said it asked the
country’s lenders to change their strategy of “austerity at any
cost” for the southern European country.  “That change is urgent because we have reached a critical
moment in the country’s life,” Socialist leader Antonio Jose Seguro said after a meeting in Lisbon today with the so-called
troika, comprised of officials from the European Commission, the
 European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund .  Seguro reaffirmed that his party would oppose a government
plan to cut spending by about 4 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in
the two years through 2014 as it would result in the reduction
of basic services in areas such as health and education.  The troika officials began the sixth quarterly review of
Portugal’s 78-billion-euro financial aid program this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
