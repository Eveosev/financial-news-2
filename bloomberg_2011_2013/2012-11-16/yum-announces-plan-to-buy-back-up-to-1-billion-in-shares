Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , owner of the Taco
Bell and KFC dining chains, will buy back as much as $1 billion
in additional shares amid rising sales and profit this year.  The restaurant operator joins other consumer companies
looking to reward shareholders.  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  and
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  increased stock buyback programs yesterday,
while  Nike Inc. (NKE)  boosted its dividend by 17 percent. Louisville,
Kentucky-based Yum has this year repurchased $815 million of
common stock at an average price of $66 a share, according to a
statement.  Yum rose 1.1 percent to $71.89 at the close in New York.
The shares have gained 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
