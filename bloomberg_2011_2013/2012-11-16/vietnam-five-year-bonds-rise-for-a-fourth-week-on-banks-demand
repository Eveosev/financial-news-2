Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose for a fourth week on speculation an increase in cash at
banks spurred demand for debt. The dong weakened.  The overnight interbank deposit  rate  fell 109 basis points
this week, the most since the five-day period ended Sept. 21,
signaling an improvement in funding availability, according to
daily fixings from banks compiled by Bloomberg. Rising funds
amid weaker demand for credit prompted banks to buy bonds in
recent weeks, said Nguyen Tan Thang, fixed-income investment
director at Ho Chi Minh City Securities Joint-Stock Co.  “It’s all about liquidity,” said Thang. Cash at banks may
start to decline toward year-end as seasonal demand for credit
increases, he said.  The yield on benchmark five-year bonds fell seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, this week to 9.97 percent,
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield was unchanged today.  Banks bought 186 trillion dong ($8.9 billion) of  government
bonds  this year, “a lot more” than in previous years, Central
Bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said Nov. 13. Bank loans grew 5
percent so far in 2012, said Binh. Credit rose 14.4 percent in
the whole of 2011, according to the government.  The dong slipped 0.1 percent this week to 20,858 per dollar
as of 3:04 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency was little changed from a week earlier.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
