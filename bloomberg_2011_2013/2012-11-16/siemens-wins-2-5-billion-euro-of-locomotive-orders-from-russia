Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest
engineering company, won an order for 675 locomotives from OAO
Russian Railways valued at about 2.5 billion euros ($3.18
billion) as the state rail monopoly boosts spending to upgrade
Soviet-era infrastructure.  Siemens Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  signed a
framework agreement in the Kremlin with the head of Russian
Railways today, coinciding with a visit by German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  to Russian President  Vladimir Putin .  The 675 locomotives will be produced at Siemens’s joint
venture in Russia with the Sinara Group and delivery from 2016
through 2020, said Dmitry Pumpansky, the CEO of Sinara Group  Russian Rail plans to spend 1.1 trillion rubles ($31.5
billion) in the next three years, raising investments in
refurbishing its aging park. The program includes purchases of
770 locomotives a year in 2013 to 2015, according to a statement
this month, compared with 2,200 locomotives bought in the
previous five years for about 164 billion rubles.  In May 2010, Russian Railways awarded Siemens a contract to
deliver 221 locomotives for about 42 billion rubles, and orders
for high-speed Sapsan passenger trains.  The German engineering company, based in Munich, has
expressed interest in potentially building and operating a $21
billion rail link between Moscow and  St. Petersburg  before
Russia hosts the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament, Russian
Rail’s unit for high-speed lines said in February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
