The pound strengthened from a two-
week low against the euro amid speculation this week’s declines
were excessive given the U.K. has a better economic outlook than
the single-currency region.  Sterling advanced for the first time in six days versus the
17-nation euro before European finance ministers meet next week
to seek agreement on how to cut  Greece ’s debt levels. A report
yesterday showed the euro-area economy sank into recession for
the second time in four years. U.K. gilts were little changed.  “We expect sterling to continue to outperform the euro,”
said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “The outlook for the U.K. may
not look brilliant but the euro region is in a recession. The
U.K. has a comparative advantage over the euro region in the
eyes of investors.”  The pound rose 0.5 percent to 80.15 pence per euro at 4:43
p.m. London time after depreciating to 80.65 pence yesterday,
the weakest level since Oct. 31. The U.K. currency was little
changed at $1.5855 after dropping to $1.5829 yesterday, the
lowest since Sept. 5.  Sterling has gained 1.6 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro slumped 2.8 percent and
the dollar slid 0.6 percent.  Greece Deficit  European officials have granted Greece an additional two
years to reach budget-deficit goals in its bailout program. The
region’s finance ministers will discuss ways to resolve the
funding shortfall resulting from that extension at a Nov. 20
meeting in Brussels.  The  Bank of England  cut its growth outlook in its quarterly
inflation report and raised its inflation projection on Nov. 14,
a day after the Office for National Statistics data showed
consumer prices rose 2.7 percent in October from a year earlier,
the fastest since May.  The 10-year gilt yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.73 percent. The price of the 1.75 percent
bond maturing in September 2022 rose 0.07, or 70 pence per
1,000-pound face amount, to 100.22. Two-year yields were little
changed at 0.24 percent.  Gilts returned 3.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
