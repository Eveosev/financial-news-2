Mary Miller , the  U.S. Treasury ’s
undersecretary for domestic finance, said completing the Volcker
rule ban on proprietary trading isn’t “as easy or simple as any
of us would like.”  Miller, in remarks prepared for a speech in Chicago today,
said “we are making steady progress on the Volcker rule.” The
rule, named for former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , is
a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act limiting proprietary
trading by banks that take consumer deposits.  On the so-called Basel III international bank-capital
proposals, Miller said she thinks that “while we strongly
believe that finalizing the regulations is critically important
for certainty and planning, we also believe there are merits to
considering alternative, simpler approaches to rules that apply
to community banks.”  U.S. banking regulators pledged earlier this week to write
capital rules shaped by community-banker concerns. Officials
from the  Federal Reserve , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
Office of Comptroller of the Currency said at a Senate Banking
Committee hearing on Nov. 14 that they would “tailor” the
Basel rules as appropriate to community banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
