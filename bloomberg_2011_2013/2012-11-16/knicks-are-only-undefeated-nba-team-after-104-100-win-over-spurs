The New York Knicks overcame a 12-
point deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the host  San
Antonio  Spurs 104-100 for their best start since the 1993-94
season.  The Knicks are now 6-0, one win shy of tying their 7-0
start 19 years ago. They are the only undefeated National
Basketball Association team this season.  The Knicks began their rally with seven minutes remaining
when  Jason Kidd  hit back-to-back 3-pointers as part of an 8-0
run at the AT&T Center in San Antonio. J.R. Smith’s 25-foot 3-
pointer with 1:47 left gave New York a 97-95 lead.  “Everybody stayed together,” Kidd said in a radio
interview. “We’re going to lose or win this game by playing
together. This just shows our experience that we didn’t panic.”  Raymond Felton  had 25 points and Smith came off the bench
to add 17 points for the Knicks. Kidd scored 14, Tyson Chandler
had 13 points and 11 rebounds, and reserve Rasheed Wallace added
10 points.  “We just kept grinding, we got down but we were still in
the game,” Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  said during a news
conference. “Our defense just got stingy and we got stops and
we made the winning plays down the stretch.”  The Knicks top the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division,
1 1/2 games ahead of the Brooklyn Nets, who beat the Boston
Celtics 102-97 last night.  Tony Parker  had 19 points and 12 assists to lead the Spurs,
who had a 57-55 halftime advantage. Kawhi Leonard had 16 points,
while  Tim Duncan  added 14 points and 14 rebounds.  “It’s the first time I’ve ever won in San Antonio, so I
feel pretty good,” Woodson said. The win “shows me this team
is for real and we’re fighting to win our division.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
