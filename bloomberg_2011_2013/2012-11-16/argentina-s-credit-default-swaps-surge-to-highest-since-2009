The cost to protect Argentine bonds
against default jumped to a three-year high as concern mounted
that the country’s legal battle with defaulted debt holders will
spark a new halt in payments.  Five-year  credit default swaps  gained 384 basis points to
3,040 basis points, the highest in the world, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts climbed as much as 640
basis points earlier to 3,296, the highest since April 2009.
One-year swaps surged 848 basis points to a record 7,419.350 at
4:49 p.m. in New York.  Argentina  is scheduled to file a brief today with U.S.
District Judge Thomas Griesa before he decides how much the
country will have to pay defaulted bondholders including Elliott
Management Corp.’s NML Capital Fund. In a Nov. 9 conference,
Griesa requested the government also provide today an affidavit
affirming that it won’t “evade directives” of the court’s
orders, in response to concern President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  would disregard its decision.  A federal appeals court in New York upheld on Oct. 26
Griesa’s earlier ruling that Argentina can’t pay restructured
bondholders without honoring its securities that are still in
default. The South American country has reached restructuring
agreements with holders of about 93 percent of its defaulted
bonds after halting payments in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
