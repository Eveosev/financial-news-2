The decline in Greek house prices
accelerated in the third quarter as demand for property weakened
amid rising unemployment.  Prices fell 12 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, including a drop of 12 percent in the capital Athens
and 11 percent in Thessaloniki,  Greece ’s second-largest city,
the  Bank of Greece (TELL)  said today in an e-mailed  report .  The third-quarter decline followed a 10 percent drop in the
second quarter and 9 percent in the first three months of the
year, according to revised data published by the bank today.  Greece’s jobless rate climbed to more than a quarter of the
workforce in August, extending its record high as Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras pushed through more austerity measures linked to
the country’s bailouts from international lenders.  The number of property transactions involving loans from
financial institutions fell to 4,948 in the quarter from 6,356
in the previous three months and 9,641 in the same period of
2011, according to the report. That was down 22 percent on the
quarter and 49 percent on the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
