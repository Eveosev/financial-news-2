U.S. loan funds, which have seen 22
straight weeks of inflows from investors, are benefiting as the
high-yield bond market sees the the biggest withdrawals since
June, according to  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   Investors pulled $1.3 billion from speculative-grade notes,
with declines of $740 million in exchange-traded funds and $530
million from closed-end securities. Buyers have poured on
average $350 million per week since the start of September into
securities that buy floating-rate debt, compared with $70
million for the rest of 2012.  High-yield bonds in the U.S. have lost 0.6 percent this
month after posting gains of 12.9 percent this year through
October, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
Loan funds have overtaken high-yield securities in terms of
percent change in net assets in 2012, Hans Mikkelsen, a credit
strategist at Bank of America, wrote in a research note
yesterday.  Loans have “a better long-term value proposition than
bonds while also shielding investors from the risk of rising
interest rates,” Mikkelsen wrote in the note.  The JPMorgan Leveraged Loan Index, which tracks the largest
dollar-denominated loans, rose to 186.78 on Nov. 8, the highest
level on record. The gauge has since declined 0.2 percent to
186.17 this week.  Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds
are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
