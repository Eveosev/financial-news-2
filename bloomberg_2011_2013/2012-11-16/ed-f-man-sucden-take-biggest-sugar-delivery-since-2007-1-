ED&F Man Sugar Ltd. and Sucres et
Denrees SA took the biggest delivery of white, or refined, sugar
in five years as exchange rules imposing limits came into force.  Sweetener delivered against the expired December futures
contract on NYSE Liffe in  London  totaled 8,496 lots, or 424,800
metric tons, exchange data published today showed. That was the
biggest delivery since May 2007, when 810,800 tons changed hands
to settle the expiry of May futures.  ED&F Man accepted 215,000 tons of sugar, and Sucres et
Denrees took 209,800 tons, the companies said in separate e-
mailed statements. The deliveries were below the 250,000-ton
limit set by the exchange. Cargill Inc. delivered 250,000 tons,
Corinne Holtshausen, a spokeswoman for Cargill Inc., commented
by e-mail today. Louis Dreyfus Commodities Suisse SA delivered
174,800 tons, exchange data showed. Julie Hibon, a spokeswoman
for Louis Dreyfus did not reply to two e-mails and did not
return a phone call from Bloomberg News today.  Most of the sugar, or 230,800 tons, will come from ports in
 Brazil , the worldâ€™s largest producer. Another 46,000 tons will
come from  Guatemala , and 148,000 tons will be from  India , the
second-biggest producer and largest consumer.  NYSE Liffe introduced delivery limits on its London
commodity contracts in September, and the rules took effect for
white sugar at the December expiry. A company willing to exceed
the curbs must apply for an exemption. The exchange may permit
buyers to take delivery of as much as double the limit in
certain cases, including a physical commitment to deliver the
commodity obtained via the exchange to a client.  To contact the reporter on this story:
