The 100 wealthiest people on the
planet lost $26.1 billion from their collective net worth this
week as global markets fell amid concern about the U.S.’s so-
called fiscal cliff and Europe’s debt crisis.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder Bill Gates, 57, lost $1.8
billion as shares of the world’s largest software maker
retreated 8 percent during the week. The Redmond, Washington-
based company replaced its Windows division chief Steven
Sinofsky on Wednesday, less than a month after the release of
Windows 8. Gates, the world’s second-richest man, is worth $60.4
billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  “Investors got buried under global headlines,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Harris Private Bank in
Chicago, which oversees about $60 billion of assets, said in a
phone interview. “Anything with an international growth bias
got hammered.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPY)  has dropped 4.8 percent
since U.S. President  Barack Obama  was re-elected on Nov. 6th. He
met with congressional leaders Friday to discuss the fiscal
cliff, a collection of $607 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts scheduled to take effect next year. House Speaker
John Boehner said the budget talks were constructive and he
would accept an increase in government revenue if coupled with
spending cuts.  The euro-area economy contracted 0.1 percent in the third
quarter, slipping into recession for the second time in four
years, a Luxembourg-based statistics office said Thursday.  The S&P 500 lost 1.45 percent during the week to close at
1359.88 in New York. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 2.74
percent, closing at 262.86.  Slim, Ortega  Mexican telecommunications magnate  Carlos Slim , 72, remains
the richest person in the world, with a fortune of $70.6
billion, down $1.2 billion during the week.  Europe’s richest man,  Amancio Ortega , the 76-year-old
founder of  Inditex SA (ITX) , the world’s biggest clothing retailer and
owner of the Zara clothing chain, is No. 3 on the list with a
net worth of $51.7 billion, $5.5 billion ahead of  Warren
Buffett , 82.  Mark Zuckerberg, 28, CEO and co-founder of  Facebook Inc. (FB) ,
added $2.2 billion to his fortune after the world’s biggest
social networking site lifted restrictions on 804 million shares
held by former employees and those who sold at the initial
public offering, almost doubling the total available to the
public. Facebook stock gained 22.7 percent for the week.
Zuckerberg ranks 72nd on the index with a net worth of $12
billion.  Fallen Apple  Laurene Powell Jobs, the 49-year-old widow of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
co-founder Steve Jobs, is no longer among the 100 richest people
in the world. Apple shares have fallen 24.5 percent since
hitting their all-time high eight weeks ago. Her net worth is
$9.7 billion.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York. The valuations are
listed in U.S. dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
