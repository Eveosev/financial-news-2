The Australian government said it
will phase out a solar incentive program in January, six months
earlier than scheduled, to cut electricity bills for homes and
businesses next year by as much as A$100 million ($103 million).  The decision “will strike the appropriate balance between
easing upward pressure on electricity prices and supporting
households and suppliers who install solar” systems, Climate
Change Minister Greg Combet said today in a statement.  The government program provided additional support for
small-scale solar power by multiplying the number of
certificates the systems would create under the government’s
Renewable Energy Target, according to the statement.  The early removal of the incentives is a “decisive and
positive step by the government toward minimizing the cost
burden of the renewable energy target on Australian families and
businesses,”  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) ,  Australia ’s largest
electricity retailer, said in an e-mailed statement.  The Sustainable Energy Association of Australia said the
decision was “untimely and unnecessary.” Electricity
regulatory reform would dwarf savings from the government’s
announcement today, according to the industry group, which
represents companies from Rio Tinto Group to  Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES)   The government is still supporting small solar systems and
solar hot water heaters with its renewable energy policy, which
sets a goal of getting 20 percent of the nation’s electricity
from renewable energy by 2020, Combet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
