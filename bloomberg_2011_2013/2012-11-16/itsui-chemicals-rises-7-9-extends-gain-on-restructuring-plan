Mitsui Chemicals Inc. (4183) , Japan’s
third-biggest chemical maker, rose the most in more than three
months and extended yesterday’s surge as investors welcomed the
company’s commitment to restructure operations.  The  shares  advanced 7.9 percent to 178 yen, the biggest
gain since Aug. 7, at the close in Tokyo. The stock, which rose
7.1 percent yesterday, was the second best-performing stock
among shares listed in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average today.  Deutsche Securities Inc. analyst Takato Watabe reiterated
his buy rating on the stock after a business outlook briefing
held by the Tokyo-based company on Nov. 14. Mitsui Chemicals
confirmed the “management’s commitment” to reform its business
portfolio by strengthening value-added products and
restructuring low-margin operations, Watabe wrote in a report
the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
