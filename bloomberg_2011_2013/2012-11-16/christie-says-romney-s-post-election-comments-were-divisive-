New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
said he agrees with Louisiana Governor  Bobby Jindal ’s criticism
of  Mitt Romney ’s comments on why he lost the presidential
election.  Romney, in a conference call with donors Nov. 14, said
Barack Obama won the election in part because of “gifts” he
bestowed on voters, particularly minorities, through government
programs.  Christie, a first-term Republican, called Romney’s comments
‘‘divisive.’’ He said he and Romney remain friends.  ‘‘It’s time to pivot and move on,’’ Christie said today in
an appearance on MSNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
