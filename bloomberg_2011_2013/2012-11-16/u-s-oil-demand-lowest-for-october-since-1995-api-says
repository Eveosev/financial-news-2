U.S. oil demand fell in October from
a year earlier as economic growth remained weak, the American
Petroleum Institute said.  Total petroleum deliveries, a measure of demand, dropped
2.3 percent from a year earlier to 18.4 million barrels a day,
the lowest October level since 1995, the industry-funded group
said in a monthly report today. Demand increased 1.3 percent
from September, according to the API estimate.  Gasoline deliveries were 8.63 million barrels a day, down
0.2 percent from a year earlier and up 0.6 percent from
September, the API said.  Use of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, slid 6.1 percent from a year earlier to 3.76
million barrels a day. Demand for ultra-low-sulfur diesel, the
type used by the trucking industry, fell 3.2 percent to 3.51
million.  “Unemployment remains high and economic growth has been
extremely modest,” John Felmy, chief economist at the API, said
in the report. “Petroleum demand is reflecting that.”  Jet fuel consumption increased 1.9 percent from a year
earlier to 1.41 million barrels a day.  Crude-oil production jumped 13 percent from a year earlier
to 6.65 million barrels a day. Output in the lower 48 states
rose 14 percent to 6.07 million. Alaskan production gained 2.7
percent to 581,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
