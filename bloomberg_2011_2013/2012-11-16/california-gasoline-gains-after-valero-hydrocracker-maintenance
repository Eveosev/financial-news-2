Spot gasoline in  San Francisco 
gained for the first time in five days after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
said the Benicia refinery in Northern California performed work
on a hydrocracker.  The 170,000-barrel-a-day plant conducted “very brief
planned maintenance” on the unit today,  Bill Day , a spokesman
at the company’s headquarters in  San Antonio , said by e-mail.
“No material impact to production.”  California-grade gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
climbed 1 cent to a discount of 3.5 cents a gallon over gasoline
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:41 p.m.
East Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The same fuel
in Los Angeles gained for the first time in eight days,
increasing 2.25 cents to 8.75 cents a gallon against futures.  The Benicia hydrocracker, which breaks down oil feedstock
into lighter products such as gasoline, is back at “planned
rates,” Day said.  California-grade, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco was 2.5
cents a gallon over Nymex heating oil futures for a fourth day.
CARB diesel in  Los Angeles  held at a premium of 4.25 cents a
gallon.  Conventional 84 sub-octane gasoline to be blended with
ethanol in  Portland ,  Oregon , fell for the fifth day, dropping
3.25 cents to 17.5 cents a gallon under gasoline futures. Low-
sulfur diesel in Portland was unchanged at 12 cents a gallon
over heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
