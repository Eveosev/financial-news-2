World soccer ruling body  FIFA  says
it will consider a request to stop investors from buying stakes
in the transfer rights of players.  Southern European clubs including Porto, Benfica and
Atletico Madrid are selling the stakes as banks shut off credit.
The practice, known as third-party ownership in English soccer,
was banned by the Premier League in 2007 after it obstructed
 Carlos Tevez ’s move to  Manchester United .  FIFA’s so-called  Football Committee , led by  Michel Platini ,
asked the Zurich-based ruling body’s administration to submit a
proposal by the end of March, according to an e-mailed statement
today. Platini, who is president of European soccer governing
body UEFA, has said the practice is draining clubs of their
wealth.  The investment model began in South America in the 1990s
with agents acquiring stakes from clubs in the future fees of
players they represented. Globally, it could now be worth more
than $500 million to soccer clubs, according to Julio Senn, a
partner at Madrid-based law firm Senn, Ferrero, Asociados Sports
& Entertainment SLP.  The proposal will be submitted by the end of March. Any
rule change would need to be approved by FIFA’s Congress, which
next meets in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
