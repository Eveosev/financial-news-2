Activision (ATVI)  Blizzard Inc. reported
more than $500 million in retail sales from “Call of Duty:
Black Ops II” in the first 24 hours of the game’s release.  The performance makes a game in the “Call of Duty” series
the biggest entertainment release for the fourth straight year,
Activision said, citing data from Chart-Track, retail customer
sell-through information and internal company estimates.  The release of the military video game was timed to take
advantage of the coming holiday shopping season. The first 24
hours of sales typically equate to 25 percent to 35 percent of
the total through December, according to  Michael Olson , an
analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos. in Minneapolis.  “Sales for the `Call of Duty' franchise have exceeded
worldwide theatrical box office receipts for ` Harry Potter '
and `Star Wars,' the two most successful movie franchises of
all time,” Activision Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick said
today in a statement. “Given the challenged macro-economic
environment, we remain cautious about the balance of 2012 and
2013.”  Activision, based in  Santa Monica , California, rose 4.7
percent to $11.05 at the close in New York. The shares have
declined 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
