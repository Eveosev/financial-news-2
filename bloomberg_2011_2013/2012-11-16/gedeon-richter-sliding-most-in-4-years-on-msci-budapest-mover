Gedeon  Richter Nyrt .,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, had the biggest two-day decline in four years
after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  said it will drop the company from its Hungarian
index at the end of this month.  The shares slumped 3.7 percent to 37,000 forint, bringing
its decline in the past two trading sessions to 8.9 percent, the
most on closing basis since the two days through Nov. 6, 2008.
The benchmark BUX stock index in which Richter has a 19 percent
 weighting  slid 1.7 percent.  Richter was the only Hungarian stock to be removed from the
MSCI Hungary Index as part of a semi-annual  review  of the
gauge’s members, effective Nov. 30, according to a statement on
MSCI’s website. Investment fund that follow MSCI indexes will
probably be selling Richter shares right through the date of the
index change, according to Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. and  KBC
Groep NV. (KBC)   “The selling pressure in the next two weeks can create
good buying opportunities,” Gergely Palffy, Budapest-based
analyst at KBC Securities, wrote in a research report today.  MSCI cut Richter from the index citing lower trading
volume, Equilor said in the research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
