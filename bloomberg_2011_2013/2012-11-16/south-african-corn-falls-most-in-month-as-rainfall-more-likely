South African corn declined the most
in a month on speculation the weather in the main growing
regions will improve. Soybeans dropped the most in more than
seven weeks.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell 1.7 percent to 2,434 rand a metric ton by the
midday close in Johannesburg, the most since Oct. 15. The yellow
variety dropped 1.2 percent to 2,494 rand a ton. Soybeans for
delivery in December, declined 1.9 percent to 5,285 rand a ton,
the most since Sept. 26.  “The weather outlook for next week is looking better, that
is why prices are down a bit today,” Andrew Fletcher, an
independent trader, said by phone from Kroonstad in the north of
 South Africa ’s Free State province. Farmers need rain to prepare
the ground before planting next season’s crop.  The province, which produces 40 percent of the nation’s
corn, is partly cloudy and hot with isolated thundershowers
today. It is forecast to be sunny tomorrow and has a 17 percent
chance of rain on Nov. 18, the  South African Weather Service 
said on its website. On Nov. 21 and Nov. 22, there is an 18
percent to 64 percent chance of rain, with an 11 percent chance
of moderate rain on Nov. 22,  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods and
the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December declined 0.8 percent to
3,677 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
