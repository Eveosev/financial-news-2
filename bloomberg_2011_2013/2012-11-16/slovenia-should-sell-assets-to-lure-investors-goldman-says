Slovenia should sell state-owned
companies to attract investors from outside the country,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Alexander Dibelius said.  “As a small country you have the advantage to be
adjustable and quick in adopting changes,” Dibelius, who runs
the bank’s operations in Germany,  Austria , Russia and central
 Europe , said in an e-mailed statement from industry body AmCham
Slovenia today. “Slovenia has good companies, excellent people,
geostrategically, you have access to all parts of Europe and the
chances to change for the better is in your own hands.”  Slovenia, the first post-communist nation to introduce the
euro in 2007, is struggling to avoid the need for a bailout from
international lenders as political gridlock grips the nation of
2 million people. The government of Prime Minister  Janez Jansa 
is pushing ahead with an overhaul of the economy with some
measures threatened by a possible referendum.  Labor unions and opposition leaders have filed a motion for
a people’s vote on government plans to recapitalize state-owned
lenders like Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and the creation of a
wealth fund.  Dibelius favors the creation of a “bad bank” in Slovenia
because such a plan “frees banks burdened by bad loans so that
they can again give loans to the economy.”  Slovenia wants to accelerate plans to sell state-owned
companies including  Nova Kreditna Banka (KBMR)  Maribor d.d. and Telekom
Slovenije d.d., Finance Minister Janez Sustersic said in an
interview last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
