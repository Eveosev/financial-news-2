Taiwan dollar  forwards had the worst
week in more than five months as overseas investors cut holdings
of the island’s stocks amid concern a global slowdown will hurt
exports.  Government bonds  were steady.  Global funds sold $458 million more local shares than they
bought this week, according to exchange data. Export orders
declined 0.5 percent in October from a year earlier, after a 1.9
percent gain the previous month, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before official
data due Nov. 20. The Taiwan dollar reached NT$28.959 on Nov.
12, the strongest level in 14 months.  “Investors think there isn’t much room for the currency to
appreciate further,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based
foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “We’re seeing
foreign funds pull out as well.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.6 percent to
NT$29.1 versus the greenback this week as of 4:26 p.m. in
Taipei, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest weekly drop since the five-day period ended June 1. The
contracts slipped 0.4 percent today and were at a 0.6 percent
premium to the spot rate, which retreated 0.4 percent from a
week ago to NT$29.272, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was 1.12 percent, little changed from Nov. 9,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The overnight  interbank
lending rate  was steady at 0.387 percent, a weighted average
compiled by the  Taiwan  Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
