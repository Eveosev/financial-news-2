The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
increased to a one-month high, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced three basis points to 130.5
basis points as of 8:50 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices show. The gauge is on track for its
highest close since Oct. 11 and has advanced 6.3 basis points
since Nov. 9 for its second straight weekly rise, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased six basis
points to 153 as of 11:48 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. The benchmark is also set for its highest
close since Oct. 11, according to data provider CMA and has
climbed 5.8 basis points over the past five days, the second
consecutive weekly increase.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 198 as
of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The measure
has fallen 4.3 basis points this week, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The indexes are benchmarks for protecting bonds against
default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A
drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an
increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
