Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR)  AS,  Turkey ’s
largest bank by assets, says it will provide guarantees for
checks after the government scrapped jail terms for bad checks,
leading to a surge in their number.  Bounced checks increased by 58 percent on an annual basis
by the end of October, while checks submitted to be cashed rose
by three percent, according to  central bank data . The Turkish
government passed a law in January scrapping jail terms for
those convicted of writing bad checks.  “With this system, the person writing the check will get
an Isbank guarantee for it within loan limits set by the bank,”
Isbank Deputy Chief Executive Officer Suat Ince said at a news
conference in Istanbul today. “This will make checks a reliable
payment method again.”  Isbank will not charge the writer or the receiver of the
check any fee for the service, he said. Check-writers can get
their checks guaranteed by Isbank through text messages, the
Internet or by using Isbank branches, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
