Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said guidelines being developed by the government may
limit certain kinds of foreign investment.  “It’s inevitable that there will be a substantial foreign
direct investment in  Canada ,” Flaherty told reporters today in
 New York . “The question then is what form does that take, what
form does it not take, and that’s what the government is looking
at now with respect to the guidelines.”  Flaherty said the government is “in the middle” of
discussing the investment rules. “We’re looking at it broadly,
and we’re looking at the various issues which we think need to
be addressed related to foreign direct investment in Canada.”  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  has said the government will
release a new “policy framework” on foreign investment around
the time it completes its review of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s $15.1 billion
takeover of  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   “The prime minister has said the guidelines will be ready
in the not-too-distant future, which I realize is relatively
vague, but that’s where we are,” Flaherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
