InterOil Corp. (IOC)  rose after announcing
government approval of its proposed Papua New Guinea liquefied
natural gas plant, allowing the sale of stakes in the project to
help finance it.  InterOil climbed 1.9 percent to $62.57 at the close in New
York. The shares have increased 22 percent this year.  Approval by Papua New Guinea’s National Executive Council
“clears the way” for the project, initially designed to export
3.8 million metric tons a year, the Australian company said in a
statement today. Sale of a stake in the Elk and Antelope gas
fields and in the initial plant output is anticipated “in the
coming weeks,” according to the statement.  “We’re now in a position to fast-track the project,” Phil Mulacek, chief executive officer of the Cairns-based company,
told investors yesterday on a conference call. “The green flag
has dropped and the final phases of bidding and closure can
begin. We expect to finalize our LNG partner agreements
immediately.”  Papua New Guinea will increase its stake in the Elk and
Antelope fields to 50 percent from 22.5 percent, InterOil said.
Terms of the added interest will be the subject of discussions
that “will commence shortly,” the company said.  InterOil is in talks with oil companies and Asian utilities
about becoming partners in the fields and taking output from the
Gulf LNG facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
