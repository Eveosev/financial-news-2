Cyprus has received a revised draft
of the bailout agreement from international creditors that calls
for 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in spending cuts, state
television CyBC reported.  The  International Monetary Fund , the  European Central Bank 
and the European Commission expect Cyprus to agree to scrapping
the so-called 13th salary for government employees next year, a
timetable for privatizations, and eliminating the government
allocations to the Social Insurance Fund. The more than 7
billion-euro government debt to the Social Insurance Fund that
pays pensions to workers at private companies will be written
off, the Nicosia-based channel said today, without disclosing
how it got the information.  Cyprus, which in June became the fifth euro-area country to
request international rescue, will also have to cut public
sector salaries, pensions, and the lump sum received by civil
servants upon retirement as well as to freeze wage indexation
for the duration of the adjustment program, CyBC said.  The islandâ€™s government believes that the public debt will
remain sustainable even after Cypriot banks, which wrote down
more than 4 billion euros on Greek  government bonds , receive 9.5
billion euros in fresh capital, CyBC television said.  The east Mediterranean island will also have to overhaul
supervision of its cooperative saving banks, CyBC reported and
added that only viable cooperatives will receive fresh capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
