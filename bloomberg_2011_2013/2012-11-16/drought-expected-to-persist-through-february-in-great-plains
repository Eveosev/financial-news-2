The drought that has dried out
farmland in the Midwest and Great Plains is expected to persist
at least through February in most areas and spread across Texas.  Drought will probably linger from Nevada to western
 Missouri  and Iowa during the period, according to the  U.S.
Climate Prediction Center  in College Park, Maryland. It’s also
likely to spread into parts of western and eastern Texas where
it had been absent.  Conditions are expected to improve in parts of  North
Dakota ,  Minnesota ,  Wisconsin  and Illinois and in eastern
Missouri and Iowa, the climate center said yesterday.  The Midwest drought, the worst since 1956, sent corn prices
to record highs earlier this year and choked traffic on the
Mississippi River as water levels fell. It is now blamed for the
worst crop conditions for U.S. winter wheat in at least 27
years, which will affect feed costs for cattle producers in the
Great Plains.  In Kansas, the biggest grower of winter wheat, there has
been little or no rain for a month to nourish newly planted
crops that go dormant until about March and are harvested in
June. Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade are up 32
percent this year, the biggest gain among the 24 commodities
tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  At least 58.8 percent of the contiguous 48 states are
currently covered by drought, with 6 percent of the region in
the worst category of dryness, according to the U.S. Drought
Monitor in Lincoln,  Nebraska .  To contact the reporter on this story:
