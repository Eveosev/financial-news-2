The latest Czech economic data are
not endangering the central bank’s efforts to keep inflation at
around its 2 percent target, the  CTK  newswire reported, citing
board member  Eva Zamrazilova .  The central bank has “already done really a lot” to
improve the economic situation, the CTK quoted Zamrazilova as
saying. Zamrazilova has voted against all three interest rate
cuts that brought the main rate to 0.05 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
