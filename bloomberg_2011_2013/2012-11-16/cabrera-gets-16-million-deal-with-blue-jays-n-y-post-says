Melky Cabrera signed a two-year, $16
million free-agent contract with the Toronto  Blue Jays  as he
comes back from a suspension for drug use, the  New York  Post
said.  The newspaper didn’t say where it got its information on
the signing. Cabrera was a free agent after the end of his one-
year, $6 million deal with the San Francisco Giants.  An outfielder formerly with the New York Yankees, Cabrera
was batting .346 with 11 home runs and 60 runs batted in when he
was barred for 50 games last season for using testosterone, a
banned muscle builder.  He’s the latest big name to move to the Blue Jays, who are
finishing a trade with the Miami Marlins that will bring All-
Star shortstop  Jose Reyes , pitchers Mark Buerhle and Josh
Johnson, and other players to Toronto.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
