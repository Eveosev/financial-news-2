India dominated  England  on the
second day of the first cricket Test in Ahmedabad, reducing the
visitors to 41-3 after Cheteshwar Pujara’s double century
allowed the hosts to declare on 521-8  Pujara, 24, playing in his sixth Test, was unbeaten on 206
when captain M.S. Dhoni called time on his team’s innings.
England’s batsmen failed to profit in the same manner as
debutant Nick Compton, night watchman James Anderson and
Jonathan Trott fell in quick succession.  All but one of the 11 wickets to fall in the match fell to
slow bowlers with England’s Graeme Swann finishing the opening
innings on 5-144 and Ravichandran Ashwin leading India with 2-
21.  Compton, whose grandfather played for England, made his
debut following the retirement of former captain Andrew Strauss.
He scored nine before being bowled by Ashwin while Anderson
added two and Trott went without scoring.  Virender Sehwag yesterday set  India  on its way, smashing
117 in as many balls. Yuvraj Singh marked his return to India’s
Test line up for the first time in a year by scoring 74. He’d
been away from the sport for a year battling a rare germ cell
cancer.  The match is the first of four Tests between the teams.
England, which swept the series when the teams met in the U.K.,
hasn’t won a Test series in India since a 1984-85 tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
