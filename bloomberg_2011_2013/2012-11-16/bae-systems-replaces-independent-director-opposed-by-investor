  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  has named Nick Rose
as an independent director less than a month after the largest
shareholder in the U.K. defense firm called for the replacement
of incumbent Peter Mason.  Mason’s term was due to expire on Jan. 21 and he will
retire at the May 8 annual general meeting, London-based BAE
said in a statement. Rose, who has chaired the  audit committee 
at BAE since October 2010, will be part of the board’s
nominations committee. That organization would lead the search
for a new chairman.  In the wake of BAE’s proposed merger with European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., Invesco Ltd. sent a letter to
management asking chairman Dick Olver to quit and also demanding
the departure of independent director Peter Mason.  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) ,
which holds a 13.4 percent stake, opposed the merger claiming it
made little financial sense and added that BAE was misguided on
its capital allocation strategy and on the high price paid on
acquisitions.  Olver, whose term expires in May 2014, took over as BAE
chairman in the middle of 2004 from Richard Evans, who retired.
He previously worked at  BP Plc. (BP/)  After the merger plan broke
down, Olver said that BAE would revert to its previous strategy.
He expressed support for the management team under Chief
Executive Officer Ian King and said that no personnel changes
were planned.  BAE shares fell as much as 4 pence or 1.3 percent today to
302.40 pence, the lowest level since Aug. 2, and were trading at
303.10 pence at 9:34 a.m. in  London , valuing the business at
9.85 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
