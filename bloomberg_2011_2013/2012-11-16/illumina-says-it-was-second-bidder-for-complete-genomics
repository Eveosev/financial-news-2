Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , the U.S. leader in
genetic sequencing, said it had offered $3.30 a share to acquire
rival  Complete Genomics Inc. (GNOM) , or 5 percent more than the bid
from BGI-Shenzhen that was accepted by the company.  Complete Genomics considered Illumina’s offer
“inadequate” because of the likelihood the deal wouldn’t
receive clearance from antitrust regulators, the  Mountain View ,
California-based company said today in a filing. The company
named the bidder only as “Party H.”  BGI-Shenzhen, a Chinese operator of genome-sequencing
centers, agreed to acquire Complete Genomics in September for
$3.15 a share, or about $117.6 million, to expand in the U.S.
market for medical and research DNA testing. The board of
Complete Genomics has unanimously recommended that stockholders
accept BGI’s offer.  Illumina, based in  San Diego , said in a filing today that
its offer was in cash and came without “any condition for
further due diligence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
