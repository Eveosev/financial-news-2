U.S. municipal-bond yields extended
their post-election plunge, dropping to the lowest in 45 years
as potential tax increases fueled demand.  The  interest rate  on 20-year general-obligation bonds fell
0.14 percentage point to  3.41 percent  in the week ended Nov. 15,
according to a Bond Buyer index. That beats last week’s 3.55
percent, the lowest since April 1967. The new level hasn’t been
seen since February 1967.  Tax-exempt munis have led a fixed-income rally following
the Nov. 6 U.S. elections. The re-election of President  Barack Obama , who seeks to increase the top federal income-tax rate to
39.6 percent from 35 percent, is boosting the appeal of the tax-
free securities, according to investors and traders.  “It’s not a huge leap to think that the highest tax
bracket will be higher than it is now,” said Ken Friedrich,
head of municipal sales, trading and syndication at  RBC Capital
Markets  in New York. “That, coupled with the Obamacare surtax,
is net positive for munis.”  Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act calls
for a 3.8 percent surtax on  capital gains  and dividend income,
and a 0.9 percent surtax on earned income for individuals making
more than $200,000 per year.  Beating Treasuries  The $3.7 trillion muni market has earned about 8.3 percent
this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. That
includes a 1.2 percent gain this month, the biggest since July.
Local bonds have outpaced their federal counterparts, which have
returned 2.8 percent, the data show.  In the 10-year segment, the  yield  on benchmark munis
declined as much as 0.09 percentage point this week to 1.49
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s a record low for
a Bloomberg Valuation index that began in January 2009. The
market was closed on Nov. 12 for the observance of Veterans Day.  The Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 22 will also close the
bond markets, which increased demand this week, Friedrich said
in a telephone interview.  States and cities are poised to sell $3 billion next week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That would be the least amount
of  issuance  since the week ended Sept. 7, which was also
holiday-shortened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
