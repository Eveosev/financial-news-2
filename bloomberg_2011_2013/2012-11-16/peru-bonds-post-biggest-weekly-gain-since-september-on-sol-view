Peru’s sol-denominated bonds
registered their biggest weekly gain since September as bets
foreign investment will spur gains in the currency boosted
demand for the securities.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent bond due
August 2020 declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 4.26 percent this week, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The yield dropped one basis point today. The price
rose 0.27 centimo this week to 123.24 centimos per sol.  Foreign investors are buying bonds to take advantage of
recent weakness in the sol, said Alberto Jabiles, a bond trader
at  BBVA Banco Continental  in Lima. The sol touched a three-month
low this week after the central bank increased  reserve
requirements  to slow credit demand. Mining, energy and
infrastructure projects will fuel economic growth next year and
spur gains in the currency, Jabiles said.  “There’s been a little spike in the currency which has
made foreign investors think now is a good moment to buy” sol
bonds, he said in a phone interview from Lima. “Buying bonds is
one of the few ways to get into the currency.”  The sol fell 0.2 percent to 2.6080 per  U.S. dollar  in
trading today, paring its weekly gain to 0.2 percent, according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency touched 2.62 on
Nov. 13, its weakest level since Aug. 10.  The central bank bought $10 million in the spot market
today and said on its website it paid 2.6080 soles per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
