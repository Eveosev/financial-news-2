The European Union will freeze
auctions of 2012 carbon allowances for airlines after deciding
earlier this week to seek a delay in implementing emission curbs
on flights into and out of the region’s airports.  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm, said it
asked the European Energy Exchange AG, which hosts auctions for
25 member states, to put sales of permits for aviation on hold.  Germany , which holds separate auctions on EEX, and the
U.K., whose auctioning platform is ICE Futures  Europe , are also
contacting those exchanges to postpone sales of allowances for
airlines, the commission said on its website today.  “The commission will provide more information about the
volume and timing of 2012 aviation allowance auctions in due
course, so as to ensure that the appropriate volume is auctioned
by April 2013,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
