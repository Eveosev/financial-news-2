Support for  Estonia ’s ruling Reform
Party fell to the lowest level in more than three years in
November after media criticized its handling of a financing
scandal,  public broadcaster ERR  reported, citing a poll it
commissioned.  Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip ’s party had 26 percent backing,
the lowest since 2009, according to the Oct. 24-Nov. 14 survey
of 901 respondents by TNS Emor. The opposition Social Democrats
had 25 percent support, the Center Party had 23 percent and
junior coalition partner Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit was favored
by 17 percent of those polled, the most since at least August.
No margin of error was given.  Reform on Oct. 24 evicted party member Silver Meikar, who
said in May that he’d received about $9,400 in cash from party
officials in 2009-2010 and donated the funds to the party under
his own name, a practice he said was widespread. Anonymous
donations to political parties, as well as donations by
companies, are prohibited under Estonian law.  An investigation by state prosecutors into party financing,
which targeted suspects including Justice Minister Kristen Michal, was closed Oct. 15 because of a lack of evidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
