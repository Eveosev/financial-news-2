Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  capped the
biggest two-day gain since March 2011 amid surging volume as the
yen weakened on speculation elections next month will hand power
to an opposition party pushing for more central-bank easing.  Exporters  Canon Inc. (7751)  and Honda Motor Co. gained more than 5
percent as the currency’s depreciation boosting the earnings
outlook.  Daiwa Securities  Group Inc. jumped 7.1 percent to lead
gains among brokerages. Ube Industries Ltd. sank 5.6 percent
after Citigroup Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. cut their equity
ratings on the chemicals maker.  The Topix rose 1.9 percent to close at 751.34 in Tokyo,
with more than three shares advancing for each that fell. The
gauge rose 4 percent in the last two days after elections were
called for next month. For the week, the measure climbed 2.8
percent. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 2.2 percent to
9,024.16 on volume 62 percent above the 30-day average.  “There’s expectation the new party will increase stimulus
heavily, making Japanese shares relatively more attractive,”
said Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $33 billion at
Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Investors are changing
to a risk-on mood.”  Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda   dissolved parliament today,
triggering an election on Dec. 16 that polls suggest his
 Democratic Party  of Japan will lose. Shinzo Abe, the leader of
the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party , called yesterday
for the central bank to pursue unlimited monetary stimulus to
end deflation and revive an economy that shrank last quarter at
the fastest pace since the 2011 earthquake.  Brokerages gained the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Daiwa Securities jumped 7.1 percent to 348 yen. Nomura
Holdings, Japan’s largest brokerage, advanced 5 percent to 316
yen.  Yen Weakens  Exporters gained after the yen depreciated to as low as
81.46 against the dollar last night in Tokyo, the weakest level
since April 25. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to
103.99 today from 103.13 at the close of  stock trading 
yesterday. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Canon, the world’s biggest camera maker, jumped 5.8 percent
to 2,697 yen.  Honda Motor (7267) , a carmaker that gets about 80 percent
of its sales abroad, climbed 5.1 percent to 2,591 yen.
Bridgestone Corp., the world’s largest maker of tires, rose 3.8
percent to 1,875 yen.  The Topix has fallen 19 percent since the DPJ took power on
Sept. 16, 2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares
advanced 27 percent in the same period  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The measure fell 0.2 percent yesterday as Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. forecast earnings that missed estimates and lawmakers
prepared for budget talks.  Ube Industries declined the most in the Nikkei 225, falling
5.6 percent to 170 yen after Citigroup cut the chemicals maker’s
rating to neutral, saying a recovery in the market for materials
used in nylon will take time. Nomura cut its rating to reduce
from neutral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
