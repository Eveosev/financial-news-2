The  Federal Housing Administration 
will raise annual premiums by 10 basis points, sell 10,000
delinquent loans per quarter and boost relief for borrowers as
part of a plan to improve the agency’s finances, U.S. Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan said today.  Donovan spoke at a briefing in Washington a day after the
FHA reported a $16.3 billion deficit in its insurance fund due
to defaults on loans it insured during the housing bubble.  “This set of measures will reduce the likelihood that FHA
will need to tap into Treasury assistance next September,”
Donovan said.  The FHA, which currently backs 15 percent of U.S.
mortgages, provides liquidity to the housing market by insuring
lenders against losses on loans with down payments as low as 3.5
percent. The premium increase outlined today is for the annual
fee charged to borrowers to guarantee their lender will be made
whole in the event of a default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
