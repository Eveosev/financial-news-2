The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development approved Kosovo as its 66th member, saying it
wants to boost economic growth and rebuild infrastructure in the
Balkan nation.  Kosovo will become an EBRD recipient country by Dec. 17,
the London-based lender said today in an e-mailed statement. The
decision is independent of the positions of EBRD members on
Kosovo’s status, the bank said.  “The bank will work to develop the private sector as well
as investing in infrastructure improvements and will help to
strengthen the economy more generally,” EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti said.  Kosovo declared independence from  Serbia  in 2008 and has
been recognized by the U.S. and 22 out of 27 European Union
states. Its infrastructure suffered during bombing by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in 1999 that drove the Serb
army out of the predominantly Albanian province.  German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle welcomed the
EBRD’s decision, saying in a statement that it “opens the way
for further support for the economic and social development of
the country.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
