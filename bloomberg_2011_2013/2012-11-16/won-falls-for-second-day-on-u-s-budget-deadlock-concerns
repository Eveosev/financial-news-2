South Korea’s won weakened the most
in almost two months as investors awaited President  Barack
Obama ’s meeting today with lawmakers to gauge progress on the
U.S. budget deadlock.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The U.S. presidential elections this month set up a budget
showdown, pushing the nation closer to a so-called fiscal cliff
of $607 billion in spending cuts and tax increases that threaten
to hurt the world’s biggest economy. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  stock index fell
0.5 percent today to close at the lowest level since Aug. 3.
Global funds sold $454 million more local shares than they
bought this week through yesterday, exchange data show.  The won fell 0.5 percent to 1,092.23 per dollar in  Seoul ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,092.38 earlier, the weakest since Nov. 9. It declined 0.4
percent for the week, the biggest drop since the five days
ending July 13.  “The U.S. fiscal cliff is a continuous concern in the
 currency market , triggering stock declines and a weakening of
the won,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-based currency analyst
for Samsung Future inc.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 5.57 percent.  Earlier this week, “losses in the won were limited despite 
declines in the Kospi index and ongoing fiscal-cliff concerns 
because of exporters selling the greenback,” said Kim Dong Young, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Industrial Bank of 
Korea.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 was steady at 2.84 percent today, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap was unchanged
at 2.77 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
