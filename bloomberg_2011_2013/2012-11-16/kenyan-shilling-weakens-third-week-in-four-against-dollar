Kenya ’s shilling dropped for the
third week out of four as companies paid taxes and the central
bank sold repurchase agreements.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy was trading
at 85.60 per dollar at 4:15 p.m. in Nairobi, unchanged from
yesterday’s closing level, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The shilling has retreated 0.3 percent this week.  “The shilling is seen range-bound in coming days as
companies withdraw money from banks to pay value added taxes,
which are due around the 20th day of every month, helping
tighten liquidity in the market,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) 
commented today in an e-mailed note to clients.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted all 7.06 billion
shillings ($82.5 million) of bids for seven-day  repurchase
agreements  and 14-day term auction deposits. The bank had
offered 10 billion shillings of securities and accepted 560
million shillings for repurchase agreements at an average of
7.202 percent and 6.5 billion shillings for 14-day term auction
deposits at an average of 7.896 percent.  The Ugandan shilling gained less than one percent to
2,612.50 a dollar. The Tanzanian currency strengthened less than
1 percent to 1,596.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
