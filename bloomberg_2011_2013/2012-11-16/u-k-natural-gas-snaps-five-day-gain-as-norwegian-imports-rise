U.K. natural gas for next-day
delivery declined, snapping a five-day advance, as imports from
 Norway  and  Belgium  increased. Electricity for the next working
day also dropped.  The gas contract fell as much as 1 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Flows from Norway were as
high as 100 million cubic meters a day, the most since Nov. 10,
Gassco AS data show. Belgian imports were at a rate of 22
million cubic meters a day, a five-day high, according to data
from pipeline operator Interconnector U.K. Ltd.  Day-ahead gas  slid 0.35 pence, or 0.5 percent, to 65.8
pence a therm at 4:27 p.m. London time after reaching 66.7 pence
yesterday, the most since October. Month-ahead gas climbed 0.3
percent to 67.55 pence a therm. Thatâ€™s equivalent to $10.70 per
million British thermal units and compares with $3.77 per
million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  The  delivery system  will contain 347 million cubic meters
of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow, up from 341 million at the start of
today,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Gas accounted for 36 percent of U.K. power production at
4:20 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 41 percent, nuclear 13
percent and wind 1.6 percent.  Electricity for the next working day fell 3.8 percent to
47.85 pounds a megawatt-hour. Month-ahead power rose 0.5 percent
to 50 pounds a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
