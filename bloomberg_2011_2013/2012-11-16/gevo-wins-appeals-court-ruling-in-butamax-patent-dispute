Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC, a
joint venture of DuPont Co. and  BP Plc (BP/) , lost an appeals court
bid to block  Gevo Inc. (GEVO)  from selling some of its biofuels
products while a patent-infringement case is pending.  Gevo has raised “a substantial question of validity” of
the Butamax patent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit  said  in upholding a judge’s decision not to issue a
court ban. The court did say that U.S. District Judge Sue
Robinson in Wilmington, Delaware should reconsider her
interpretation of the patent. The case is part of a broader
dispute between the two companies over genetically engineered
microorganisms used to produce biofuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
