Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
South America’s largest power generator, fell to the lowest in
nine years on a report it will lose 20 billion reais ($9.6
billion) a year if it accepts a government proposal on rates.  Eletrobras, as the state-run company is known, tumbled 12
percent to a nine-year low of 11.60 reais. It was the biggest
fall among 818 stocks in the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index today.  The stock has lost 31 percent since Nov. 1 when the
government published a proposal for companies with generation
and transmission assets set to expire in 2015 and 2017 to reduce
rates in exchange for automatic license renewals. Newspaper
Estado de  Sao Paulo  reported yesterday, a public holiday in
Brazil, that accepting the proposal could lead to losses of 20
billion reais a year. The company didn’t respond to an e-mailed
request for comment on the Estado story.  Today’s plunge was spurred by “newspaper reports yesterday
saying how much the company will lose,” Marcelo Varejao, an
analyst at brokerage Socopa, said in a phone interview from Sao
Paulo. “Earnings also weigh because people can start projecting
what things will be like in the future.”  Eletrobras reported  earnings  after the close of trading
Nov. 14, with quarterly profit falling to 1 billion reais from
1.56 billion reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
