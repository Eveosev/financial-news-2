Spain ’s 10-year government bonds
rose for a second day as the prospect of a bailout prevented
borrowing costs from rising even as the economy worsened.  The securities pared their fourth  weekly decline . Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is yet to request aid, which is needed
before the  European Central Bank  would step in to buy the
nation’s debt. Data yesterday showed Spain’s economic recession
dragged into a fifth quarter. Greek 10-year bonds advanced for a
sixth day as Italian Finance Minister  Vittorio Grilli  said he is
confident that euro-region finance chiefs will reach an
agreement on aiding  Greece  when they meet next week.  “The possibility of bond buying may be putting a ceiling
on yields,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank
Plc in London. “It seemed to me as if there were some buyers as
the Spanish 10-year yield got close to 6 percent.”  The rate on Spain’s 10-year bonds fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.87 percent at 4:15 p.m. London
time. The yield climbed to 5.96 percent on Nov. 13, the highest
level since Oct. 1. The 5.85 percent bond maturing January 2022
rose 0.185, or 1.85 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,271) face amount,
to 99.805.  Still, the rate has risen five basis points since Nov. 9,
and was set for a fourth weekly gain, the longest run of
increases since the period ending June 1.  Spain plans to sell bonds due between 2015 and 2021 on Nov.
22, the nation’s Treasury said today.  Obstacle Removed  European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  this week removed an obstacle blocking Rajoy’s path to
a sovereign bailout, endorsing his deficit-reduction efforts as
the recession deepened. The spending cuts and tax increases
Rajoy has introduced for this year and next are enough to
satisfy the EU, Rehn said on Nov. 14.  Greece was this week granted an additional two years to
reach budget-deficit goals in its bailout program. European
finance ministers will be discussing ways of plugging the
funding gap resulting from that extension at a meeting in
Brussels on Nov. 20.  “We know that there are several options for helping Greece
get through this very important challenge,” Grilli said in an
interview with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television’s “On
the Move” in  London . “I am clearly optimistic that we can come
to a decision.”  Greek Yield  The yield on Greece’s 2 percent security due in February
2023 fell for a sixth day, dropping 13 basis points to 17.42
percent, and leaving the price at 32.1 percent of face value.  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by those of Greece, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  German 10-year bund yields were little changed at 1.33
percent. They dropped to 1.31 percent on Nov. 13, matching the
lowest since Aug. 31. Two-year notes yielded minus 0.034
percent. Negative yields mean investors who hold the securities
to maturity will receive less than they paid to buy them.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 2.1 percent, while Italian securities earned
18 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
