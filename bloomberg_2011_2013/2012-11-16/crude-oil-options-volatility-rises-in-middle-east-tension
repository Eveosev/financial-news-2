Crude oil options volatility rose
along with the underlying futures on concern that Middle East
crude shipments may be endangered by the clash between  Israel 
and Hamas.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.51 as of 3:35 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 28.63 yesterday.  Crude oil for December delivery, which expired today,
advanced $1.22, or 1.4 percent, to $86.67 on the Nymex, the
highest settlement since Nov. 6. Israel extended its bombing of
Gaza while Palestinian missiles struck areas near  Jerusalem  and
 Tel Aviv .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $100 calls, which gained 10 cents to 30 cents a barrel
on volume of 2,794 lots at 2:32 p.m. January $95 calls were the
second-most active, with 1,894 lots exchanged as they increased
20 cents to 61 cents.  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 59
percent of the 46,093 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets made up 57 percent of
the 118,953 contracts traded.  January $75 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 6,966 contracts. They were unchanged at 26 cents
a barrel. January $100 calls dropped 10 cents to 20 cents on
volume of 6,537 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
