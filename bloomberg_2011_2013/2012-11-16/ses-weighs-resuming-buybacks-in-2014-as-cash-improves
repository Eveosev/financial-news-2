SES SA (SESG) , the world’s largest publicly
traded satellite operator, is considering a resumption of share
buybacks as soon as 2014 when slowing spending will allow it to
use cash for repurchases, its chief executive officer said.  “Now we have a lot of investments but in two or three
years if we have cash flows building up again there will be
financial headroom again and then we can do share buybacks,”
CEO Romain Bausch said today in an interview at a conference
organized by Morgan Stanley in Barcelona.  SES, which has 52 satellites and is adding capacity to
accommodate demand, suspended repurchases after buying back and
canceling shares valued at about 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion)
from 2006 to 2011. The Luxembourg-based company, whose customers
include Spain’s biggest phone company  Telefonica SA (TEF) , also paid
 dividends  of about 1.5 billion euros during that period.  The company expects earnings will grow steadily over the
next few years, Bausch said. “That’s why the gross dividend can
also grow 10 percent year on year,” he said, while ruling out
any one-time payouts.  “Most of the growth is coming from  emerging markets  such
as  Latin America , Asia and Africa,” he said. SES could also
boost growth by acquiring a small satellite company, while it’s
not considering any asset disposal to raise cash in the near
term, Bausch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
