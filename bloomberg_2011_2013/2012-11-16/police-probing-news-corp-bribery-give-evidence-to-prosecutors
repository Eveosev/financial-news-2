London police investigating bribery
at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s best-selling Sun tabloid and other titles gave
files of evidence on seven suspects to British prosecutors who
will consider filing criminal charges.  The evidence, sent to the  Crown Prosecution Service ,
relates to three public officials and four journalists, said  Sue Akers , the  Metropolitan Police Service  officer leading the
probe. Akers described the files in an Oct. 31 statement posted
today on the website of a judge-led inquiry into media ethics
triggered by widespread wrongdoing at News Corp. titles.  The New York-based company has given evidence to police as
it seeks to manage the bribery probe and a related phone-hacking
investigation that led to the closure of its News of the World
tabloid last year. The first criminal charges in the bribery
case were filed in September, when April Casburn, a Metropolitan
Police detective chief inspector, was charged with offering to
sell information to the newspaper.  Police have made 52 arrests in the bribery investigation,
called Operation Elveden, including a former Ministry of Defence
employee and a member of the armed forces detained Oct. 23.
Akers said files of evidence are being prepared on the remaining
suspects and will be given to prosecutors “in due course.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
