Republican Senator Robert Portman,
in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s Political Capital with
 Al Hunt  airing this weekend, proposed extending the expiring
U.S. tax cuts, including those for the wealthy, for six months -
- with a trigger that if Congress can’t come up with enough
loophole closings that the top rate would rise to 39.6 percent.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome back. We are joined by one of the most
influential Republicans in the United States, Senator Rob
Portman of Ohio. Thank you for -  ROB PORTMAN: That’s not saying much, is it?  HUNT: No, it is. It is. Senator, you know the huge fight
over the Bush tax cuts. The president is adamant that he will
not allow the top 2 percent to continue. I know you don’t want
any kind of tax increases, but something has to happen. What
kind of a deal do you think you could agree to?  PORTMAN: Well, I think there’s only one logical thing to
do, and that’s to continue the current tax code for six months.
Or maybe it’s a year.  HUNT: - the president (inaudible) he says adamantly not.  PORTMAN: Well, I think he - I think he might consider it,
if at this point, when you make that agreement not to create the
great uncertainty and the huge tax increases that could push us
into recession, which is what, you know, outside analysts are
saying, including the CBO and Federal Reserve, but if we make a
commitment right now that, once the tax reform is done, which is
what ought to happen, pro-growth tax reform, and once the
entitlement reform is done, which I think can be done in six
months, after all, as you know, the work’s been done by a lot of
different groups, there will be increased revenues. Those
increased revenues will come from those who are in what are now
- what is now the top two brackets. And there could be some
other revenue.  HUNT: I understand that’s what you like, but the White
House has been adamant, they will not accept that deal. They say
we will not accept it on a commitment. Now, where they’ve left
some room is right now they say, if you can come up with a deal
that raises the kind of revenue right now - not six months from
now - they won’t necessarily hold to the 39.6 percent rate.
Would you accept something that is - that keeps the rates at
about 35 percent or 36 percent and limits deductions, like the
28 percent credit the president proposed, but also increases the
estate tax and capital gains and dividends taxes, which is part
of this package?  PORTMAN: Well, I mean, I would accept anything that has to
do with pro-growth tax reform, one, and, two, entitlement
reform. they’re connected, as you know.  HUNT: Ultimately, they are in a big package. But right now,
in the short term, in December, are you saying you won’t take
any deal on taxes?  PORTMAN: Well, no. I’m saying I think we ought to have a
deal on taxes.  HUNT: So why not extend the tax cuts for the 98 percent and
come back later and then deal with the upper-income tax cuts
later? In other words, have - have the Bush tax cuts expire for
the rich and extend them for everybody else, and then next year
deal with the tax cuts for the rich?  PORTMAN: Because it’s going to hurt the economy. Everybody
who’s looked at it -  HUNT: So that’s - that’s a nonstarter for you?  PORTMAN: But why would you want to do that? Why not say,
“Let’s go ahead and reform the tax code, make a commitment now
we’re going to have additional revenue”?  HUNT: But you can’t do it. You can’t do it in three weeks.  PORTMAN: Well, no, the - the reform wouldn’t occur now. It
would occur six months from now, July 4th -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: - ever happen.  PORTMAN: Well, if it doesn’t happen, then you would revert
back to the existing, you know, law, which was -  HUNT: So the deal - if you don’t come up with a deal, you
would go back to the 39.6 -  PORTMAN: Yeah, you have to have a trigger.  PORTMAN: - the president would get what he wants. He wants
to sort of exact his political pound of flesh here after the
election. I understand that. But let’s not do it in a way that
hurts people who are trying to find work, Al.  HUNT: So let’s talk about the overall package. The
president says he wants a $4 trillion 10-year package, but he’s
counting $1.1 trillion that’s already been done on the spending
side. So he says $1.6 trillion would be taxes and the rest would
be spending cuts, mainly entitlements. Give me your impression
of the size and the shape of that kind of a package.  PORTMAN: Well, look, I am concerned about folks who are
taking credit for something that’s already happened, because
we’ve got to do so much more.  HUNT: So is that insufficient?  PORTMAN: Well, you know, it is insufficient to deal with
the crisis we face. I mean, it’s impending. It’s on our
doorstep, $16 trillion in debt. It’s going to $20 trillion if we
don’t change direction.  HUNT: And how about the competition, the mix of taxes and
spending power?  PORTMAN: Well, you know, we need to have pro-growth tax
reform. The exciting opportunity here, Al, is that we can reform
our tax code in ways that’s going to create jobs and
opportunity. Let’s take advantage of that. We can also reform
our entitlement programs to make them actually more efficient,
work better for a lot of seniors, give them more choices.  HUNT: Senator Portman, your colleagues, John McCain and
Lindsey Graham, have said that Susan Rice is unacceptable as a
potential secretary of state nominee because they believe that
she didn’t tell the truth about Benghazi. You’re on the Armed
Services Committee. Do you feel that - that she is disqualified
from what you know so far?  PORTMAN: I don’t - I haven’t looked into her background
sufficiently, but I think they can do better, given what
happened. I’m so discouraged, Al, by what occurred there and the
fact that -  HUNT: You wouldn’t - you wouldn’t necessarily pledge to
filibuster the way Senator McCain -  PORTMAN: Well, no. I’d like to - I’d like to look at, you
know, her background in a more thoughtful way. But I am - I am
very discouraged by what I’m reading and hearing now. And I’m on
the Armed Services Committee. I’m also on the Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs Committee.  HUNT: If they can do better, who should be better? Who
would be better?  PORTMAN: Well, I don’t know. I like John Kerry, my
colleague in the Senate, as a potential nominee. He’s got broad
experience. I don’t agree with him on policy issues for the most
part, but I think he’s a guy of integrity in terms of his
foreign policy issues. He’s actually been willing to stand up
and express his own view independent of the administration now
and again, including on  Syria  and other issues.  HUNT:  Mitt Romney  said this week that he lost the
presidential election because Barack Obama gave stuff to blacks
and Latinos and women and it caused a larger turnout. Do you
agree with that assessment?  PORTMAN: I think we lost the election for a number of
reasons. It’s sort of all-of-the-above. I also think we lost it
very narrowly, so if you look at Ohio, it was a difference of
100,000 or so votes, making it a more narrow victory for Barack
Obama than George Bush had in 2004, when all of the stuff that
was very narrow with John Kerry. So it was a close election. You
look at the national numbers, the country’s divided, Al.  HUNT: But was it because of the stuff that the -  PORTMAN: Well, I will tell you, from - you know, I was the
chairman of the  Ohio  campaign. And I will tell you what my view
is, having done some of the after-action, you know, reviews.
One, it was the fact that we weren’t responding for months and
months to a barrage of negative ads - you and I have talked
about this - including on the auto industry and other things in
Ohio. We were outspent, but also I think we could have responded
to some of the attacks in earlier and more appropriate ways.  HUNT: But that’s different than saying he gave stuff -  PORTMAN: Second is -  HUNT: So I gather you do disagree with Governor Romney on
that?  PORTMAN: Well, I think second is turnout. I mean, the
Democrats did a better job on turning out their voters. I mean,
if you look at what happened in Ohio, there actually was -  HUNT: I’m not going to get an answer on whether you
disagree on stuff?  PORTMAN: Well, you know, I think there are other ways to
explain this. And I - you know, I think what is surprising to
people is to find out that  Barack Obama  received significantly
fewer votes than he received in 2008, but so did Republicans  PORTMAN: And then, finally, Al, I will say, on the economic
issues that you care so much about, you know, I think we weren’t
able to take these bigger issues about the economy, about the
deficit, and about the proposals, the five-point plan and so on,
and - and enable people to understand how it’d affect them and
their lives.  HUNT: Senator Rob Portman, you will be a major player in
all these issues in the months ahead. Thank you so much for
joining us.  PORTMAN: Thank you, Al. Great to be on with you again.  HUNT: And when we come back, the last word.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
