British police arrested a suspected
member of the Basque terror group ETA in Liverpool, northwest
 England , today, the Spanish Interior Ministry said.  Raul Sanchez Fuente Vilota was detained in the city this
morning after 17 years on the run, the ministry said in an e-
mailed statement. He is accused of several murders as a member
of ETAâ€™s Vizcaya unit.  Vilota is at least the sixth suspect to be captured this
year as Spanish authorities collaborate with colleagues in
 France  and the U.K. to round up members of the group, which
declared an end to violence last year. ETA killed more than 800
people during a four-decade fight for independence for the
Basque region of northern Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
