Ivory Coast  will invest $4 billion
over the next six years in energy infrastructure to boost
electricity output by 80 percent, outgoing Mining and Energy
Minister Adama Toungara said.  Power production will increase by 1,100 megawatts, Toungara
told reporters today at the opening of an industry conference in
the capital, Yamoussoukro.  The expansion of the Azito and the Ciprel power plants,
both located in Abidjan, the commercial capital, will cost $776
million, while $660 million will be invested in the hydropower
dam of Soubre in the southwest, he said. The capacity of the
Aggreko power plant, located in the south of Abidjan, will also
be reinforced, he said.  Another $750 million will be invested in the three power
plants including ContourGlobal and Starenergie outside of
Abidjan and Mirman in Jacqueville, 50 kilometers (31 miles) west
of the city, Toungara said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
