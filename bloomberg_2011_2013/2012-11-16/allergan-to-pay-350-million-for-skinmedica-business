Allergan Inc. (AGN) , the Botox maker
weighing the sale of its obesity unit, will expand the range of
its skin care products by agreeing to purchase a unit from
SkinMedica Inc. for $350 million.  SkinMedica’s products include a prescription treatment for
reducing female facial hair and lotions to reduce the appearance
of wrinkles. The closely held company will receive an extra $25
million if certain sales goals are met,  Irvine , California-based
Allergan said in a statement today.  Allergan’s range of skin care products includes wrinkle
reducers Botox and Juvederm. The agreement doesn’t include
SkinMedica’s Colorescience make-up line, which will be spun out
as a separate company. Last month, Allergan it may sell the
obesity business, which includes the Lap-Band weight loss
device, because of falling sales.  “The acquisition will allow us to expand our product
portfolio to better meet the needs of our existing base of
physician customers and their patients,” said Allergan Chief
Executive Officer David Pyott in a statement.  Allergan rose less than 1 percent to $88.71 at the close of
New York trading. The shares had gained 6.9 percent in the past
12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
