U.S. stock-index futures were little
changed, paring an earlier decline, as President  Barack Obama 
prepared to hold talks with Republican lawmakers on the so-
called fiscal cliff.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in December
fell 0.1 percent to 1,350.6 at 7:07 a.m. in New York after
earlier falling as much as 0.5 percent. Contracts on the Dow
Jones Industrial Average declined 9 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,513.  Obama holds his first face-to-face talks with House Speaker
John Boehner since the election today. He also hosts House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
