Natural gas futures may rise next
week after reaching a one-year high yesterday as colder weather
helps reduce a stockpile surplus of the heating fuel, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Eight of 16 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast that futures
will advance on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through Nov.
23. Seven, or 44 percent, said gas will fall and one said prices
will stay the same. Last week, 62 percent of participants said
gas would drop this week.  U.S.  gas stockpiles  fell 18 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 9, the earliest decline for a heating season since
2007, after expanding to a record 3.929 trillion cubic feet the
previous week, an Energy Department report yesterday showed.
Temperatures in the eastern half of the U.S. will be normal or
lower over the next 11 to 15 days, according to MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  “The storage numbers were impressive enough, given the
kind of weather we had,” said Tom Saal, senior vice president
of energy trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in Miami.  Natural gas for December delivery advanced 28.7 cents, or
8.2 percent, to $3.79 per million British thermal units this
week in New York. Today’s settlement was the highest since Oct.
31, 2011. The futures are up 13 percent from a year ago.  “The market is still in an uptrend, even though we made a
new high and then it fell down a little bit,” Saal said.  Cold Weather  The low in  Detroit  on Nov. 29 may be 19 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 7 Celsius), 12 below normal, while New York temperatures
drop 11 below normal to a low of 27 degrees, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  The heating season from November through March is the peak
period for U.S. gas  consumption . About 50 percent of U.S.
households use gas for heating, according to the Energy
Department.  Gas stockpiles  totaled 3.911 trillion cubic feet last week,
5.6 percent above the five-year average for the period, the
department said yesterday. The supply  gap  narrowed from 6.6
percent the previous week.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 49 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  8      7      1  To contact the reporter on this story:
