U.S. Assistant Secretary for
European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Gordon called on  Georgia  to
guarantee transparency as former officials were arrested after
billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s parliamentary election
victory.  Police arrested Ex-Deputy Interior Minister Shota Khizanishvili and 11 other former officials yesterday on charges
including computer hacking and illegal wire-tapping, the
Prosecutor’s Office said today. Bacho Akhalaia, a former defense
and interior minister, was sentenced to two months pre-trial
detention this month after being charged with abuse of office
and false imprisonment.  “It’s absolutely critical to be scrupulous in both reality
and perception of how this process is working,” Gordon told the
reporters today in the capital, Tbilisi, after meeting
Ivanishvili, who’s now prime minister. “If this looks like or
it’s designed solely to go after political adversaries or isn’t
done in a transparent way, the whole country will pay the
price.”  U.S.-backed President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party was
unexpectedly defeated by Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition in
Oct. 1 elections. The billionaire has said the authorities won’t
impose selective justice on officials from the former regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
