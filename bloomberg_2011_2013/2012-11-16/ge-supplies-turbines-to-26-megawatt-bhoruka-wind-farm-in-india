General Electric Co. (GE) , the third-
biggest wind turbine maker, has supplied 26 megawatts of
machines to Bhoruka Power Corp.’s wind farm in southern India,
GE said in an e-mailed statement.  The turbines, manufactured at GE’s plant in Pune, were
installed at Yelisurur in southern Karnataka state in August and
have been generating more electricity than projected, according
to the statement.  GE has been gaining market share in India, the world’s
third-biggest for  wind turbines . It signed a deal to supply at
least 450 megawatts of machines over three years to Hyderabad-
based developer  Greenko Group Plc (GKO) , Greenko President Mahesh Kolli said in July. GE didn’t install a single turbine in India
in the previous three financial years, according to data from
the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
