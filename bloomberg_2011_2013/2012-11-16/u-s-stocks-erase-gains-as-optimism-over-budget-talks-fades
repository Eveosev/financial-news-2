U.S. stocks erased gains as optimism
over budget talks in Washington faded.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,353.39 at 2:28 p.m. in New York after climbing as much as 0.6
percent as House Speaker  John Boehner  said talks about the so-
called fiscal cliff with President Barack Obama were
“constructive” and he’d accept higher government revenue if it
was coupled with spending cuts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
