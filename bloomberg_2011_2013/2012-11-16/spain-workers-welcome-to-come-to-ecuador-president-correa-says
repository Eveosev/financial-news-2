Ecuadorian President  Rafael Correa 
said his country would welcome Spanish workers fleeing recession
and unemployment at home.  “There are Spaniards coming to  Ecuador  and we await them
with open arms,” Correa said in an interview with Spanish
public broadcaster Television Espanola today. He said salaries
in Latin America were competitive and the country needed trained
workers such as doctors.  Spain relied on migrants to help meet demand for labor
during its 10-year housing boom, a trend that boosted the
population of Ecuadorians in Spain to more than 400,000,
according to Spain’s  statistics institute . A five-year economic
slump that has pushed the jobless rate above 25 percent is
forcing migrants to return home and Spaniards to seek work
abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
