Almost half of drivers from ages 18
to 29 use the Internet behind the wheel, as more people buy
smartphones, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said.  Forty-eight percent of motorists in that age group access
the Web while driving, up from 29 percent in 2009, State Farm
said in a statement today, citing surveys it conducted.  Insurers such as State Farm, the largest seller of auto
coverage in the U.S., have joined regulators in encouraging
vehicle operators to increase their focus on safety. In 2010,
3,092 people were  killed  and more than 400,000 injured in motor
vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver, according to U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.  “The mobile internet is generating another set of
distractions for drivers to avoid,” said Chris Mullen, director
of technology research at Bloomington, Illinois-based State
Farm, in the statement. “Regulation, enforcement, education and
technology all have a role to play.”  Sales of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone jumped 81 percent in 2011 to
about  72 million units  from about 40 million units a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  National Transportation Safety Board  this week
identified the elimination of distracted driving as one of its
 top challenges  for 2013. The board is encouraging technology
that disables devices when in reach of vehicle operators,
including those running planes and trains.  Social Networks  Reading social media networks while driving climbed to 36
percent this year from 21 percent in 2009, for drivers 18 to 29,
State Farm said. Checking e-mail rose to 43 percent from 32
percent.  State Farm’s latest survey was conducted online in July.
Responses are received from about 1,000 insurance consumers each
year. Results are based on responses from people who have a
driver’s license, own a mobile phone and are behind the wheel at
least an hour a week. State Farm is owned by its policyholders
and has no publicly traded debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
