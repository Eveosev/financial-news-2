Sulzer AG (SUN) , a Swiss pump maker,
opened a wastewater pumps production plant in  China  to serve the
water supply and treatment industries, raising to 16 the number
of production and services locations in the country.  The Winterthur-based company said today in a statement that
the Kunshan factory is Sulzerâ€™s sixth in China.  Sulzer pumps, mixers and compressors will help address
demand in the growing wastewater market in China, where two-
thirds of its 600 cities suffer from water supply problems, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
