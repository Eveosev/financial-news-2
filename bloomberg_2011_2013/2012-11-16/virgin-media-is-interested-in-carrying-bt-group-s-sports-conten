Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) , the U.K.’s second
largest pay-television company, is interested in carrying the
sports programs that  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  has acquired this year as part
of an expansion into television rights.  “It’ll be interesting how it will play out,” Virgin Media
Chief Financial Officer Eamonn O’Hare said at a Morgan Stanley
conference in Barcelona today. “Hopefully they will see value
in the 4 million customers that we have, and see that as a route
to market for their valuable content.”  O’Hare said he was open to talking to BT about carrying the
shows. BT, the U.K.’s biggest fixed-line phone company, has
acquired rights to broadcast Premier League soccer games and
English rugby matches, challenging pay-TV providers such as
 British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY)  which also bid for the
rights. BT has said it plans to release its BT Sport service by
next summer and hasn’t given details about the format.  Phone and cable companies are increasingly offering a
similar suite of services -- bundles of television, high-speed
Internet and phone lines. Virgin Media, BSkyB and BT are using
exclusive rights to shows and movies as well as video-on-demand
services to differentiate themselves and to make extra money by
leasing rights to competitors.  “We do think customers will want more fragmented,
different-sourced content,” O’Hare said. “But we think they
will definitely value a one-stop-shop.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
