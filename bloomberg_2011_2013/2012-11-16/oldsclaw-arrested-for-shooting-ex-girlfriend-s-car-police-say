Chamique Holdsclaw was arrested and jailed last night in Atlanta after being accused of shooting into the car of a former Women’s National Basketball Association teammate and breaking its windows with a bat.  Holdsclaw, a 2000 Olympic gold medalist, pursued 29-year- old Jennifer Lacy to her car on Nov. 13, according to a police report. Lacy, who plays for the Tulsa Shock, and Holdsclaw were teammates with the Atlanta Dream in 2009. Lacy identified the 35-year-old Holdsclaw as an ex-girlfriend, according to the police document.  No one was injured, according to the police report.  Holdsclaw remained in custody this morning in Fulton County Jail, Tracy Flannigan, a spokeswoman for the Fulton County Sherriff’s Office, said in a telephone interview. Her bond was set at $10,000 on one charge each of aggravated assault, second- degree criminal damage and reckless conduct, Flannigan said.  Holdsclaw is scheduled to appear before a judge this morning and it’s not known if she has retained an attorney, according to the spokeswoman.  In a statement posted on the Shock website, Lacy thanked family, friends and fans “for their concern during this difficult time.”  Holdsclaw led the University of  Tennessee  to three consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association championships from 1996 to 1998. She wrote in a book released this year that she had bout of clinical depression and a made an attempt at suicide in 2006, when she was a member of the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks.
