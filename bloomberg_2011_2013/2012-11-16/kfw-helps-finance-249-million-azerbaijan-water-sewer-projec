The Germany development bank KfW and
the governments of Switzerland and  Azerbaijan  are financing a
195.4 million-euro ($249 million) project for water systems in
two former Soviet republic cities.  About 55.4 million euros has been made available for the
first phase of the project, which started in 2008 to
rehabilitate or replace drinking water cachements and the water
supply systems in Ganca and Shaki west of the capital Baku, KfW
said on its  website .  The second and third phases are being readied and will
include further expansion of water distribution and sewer
systems in the cities to 2016 as well as the construction of
wastewater treatment plants, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
