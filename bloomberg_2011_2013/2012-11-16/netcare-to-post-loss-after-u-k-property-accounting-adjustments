Netcare Ltd. (NTC) , an owner of private
hospitals in  South Africa  and Britain, said it will post an
annual net loss, after making non-cash accounting adjustments on
its U.K. property unit.  Per-share earnings “will be between 360 percent and 370
percent lower” in the year through September than a year
earlier, the company said in a stock exchange filing today. Per-
share earnings excluding one-time profits and losses will fall
10 percent to 20 percent, it said. Netcare earned 1.17 rand
(13.14 U.S. cents) per share on that basis in fiscal 2011.  Netcare acquired General Healthcare Group’s 35 U.K.
hospital properties in 2006 and its debt facility is due to
mature in October next year, making the accounting adjustment
necessary, the Johannesburg-based company said. While the unit
is seeking refinancing, this will not be in place by the time
Netcare’s annual results are released on Nov. 19.  Adverse financial developments at the property unit have
“no commercial effect on the financial status of Netcare,”
because all U.K. debt is ring-fenced and there is no recourse to
its South African operations, the company said. “None of
Netcare’s existing debt facilities will be impacted by the
changes in accounting assumptions” at the property unit.  Netcare’s shares advanced 1 percent, to 17.92 rand as of
11:46 a.m. in Johannesburg, giving the company a market value of
26.2 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
