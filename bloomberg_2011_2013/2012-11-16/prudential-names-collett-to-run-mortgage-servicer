Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, promoted Hal Collett to
president of the asset resources unit, where he’ll oversee
servicing of about $69 billion in commercial mortgages.  He replaces Catherine Rodewald, who plans to retire at the
end of this year, the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer said
today in a statement.  Prudential is expanding in commercial mortgages as the
insurer seeks to boost investment income with interest rates
near record lows pressuring bond yields. The unit had $69.4
billion in its loan servicing portfolio as of Sept. 30, up from
$66.9 billion a year earlier.  “We are excited to have an executive with the breadth and
depth of Hal’s experience,” David Twardock, president of
Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., said in the statement.  Prudential services and originates loans for the insurer’s
general account and institutional clients.  Warren Buffett ’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  is also betting on commercial mortgages
after a 2009 deal with  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK)  to create
Berkadia Commercial Mortgage.  Collett, 38, joined Prudential Mortgage Capital in 2002 and 
his most recent job there was vice president of asset management
and credit surveillance. He previously was manager of investor
reporting at Orix Capital Markets. A graduate of Texas Tech
University with a master’s in business administration from the
 University of Texas  at Arlington, he is based in Dallas and will
report to Twardock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
