At least three civilian militiamen
supporting  Yemen ’s army against al-Qaeda militants were killed
and four others wounded today in a suicide bombing in the
southern province of Abyan, said Ali al-Said, a leader of the
militia group.  A man wearing a bomb-laden belt entered a government
building in Zinjibar, the provincial capital of Abyan, and blew
himself up, al-Said said by telephone. The fighters, members of
a militia group named Popular Committees, were inside the
building, he said.  The state-run Saba news agency confirmed that three people
were killed in the suicide bombing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
