D.E Master Blenders 1753 NV, (DE)  the
coffee and tea company spun off by Sara Lee Corp. in June, said
it became aware of accounting irregularities at its Brazilian
operations after gaining independence and isn’t responsible for
any losses incurred by investors.  The company was only informed of possible irregularities
after publication of its prospectus and after the shares started
trading, Chief Executive Officer Michiel Herkemij wrote in a
letter today to VEB, a Dutch shareholder group.  “If any damages were suffered by shareholders, DEMB is of
the opinion that it is not liable for such damages,” Herkemij
wrote. “The VEB was the one that caused turmoil in the market
with its initial disproportional response.”  VEB said in August that investors should be compensated
after the discovery of the accounting issues. The irregularities
involve uncollectable accounts receivable and incorrect
recognition of sales, according to Master Blenders. The company
said Oct. 11 that the anomalies would reduce net income by 14
million euros ($17.8 million) less than previously indicated.  Master Blenders  shares  fell 1.5 percent to 8.82 euros at
the close of trading in Amsterdam. The stock dropped 5.6 percent
on Aug 2 after the company said it would restate earnings.  The maker of Pickwick tea has said it discovered the
irregularities after the end of Sara Lee’s fiscal year as new
management conducted an investigation of the accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
