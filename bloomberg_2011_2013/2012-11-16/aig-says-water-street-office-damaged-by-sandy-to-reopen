American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer displaced from its Manhattan headquarters by
superstorm Sandy last month, said a separate building it owns at
175 Water Street will return to service on Nov. 19.  The headquarters, at 180 Maiden Lane, is expected to reopen
“within weeks,” the New York-based insurer said today in a
memo to employees.  Superstorm Sandy, which made landfall Oct. 29, lashed New
York and New Jersey and closed down about a third of lower
Manhattan office space for at least a week, forcing employees to
work from home or other locations. AIG’s global property-
casualty unit is based at 175 Water St., and the tower holds
about 1,500 employees, said Matt Gallagher, an AIG spokesman.  “AIG’s buildings in  New York City  that were affected by
 Hurricane Sandy  are making great progress and will soon begin to
reopen,” the insurer said in the memo. “180 Maiden, 80 Pine,
32 Old Slip and 1 NY Plaza are also making progress.”  The building at 180 Maiden Lane is co-owned by  SL Green
Realty Corp. (SLG)  and closely held Moinian Group. It suffered heavy
flooding from the storm, SL Green said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
