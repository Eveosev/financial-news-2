Croatian lawmakers confirmed the
appointment of Ivan Vrdoljak as economy minister and  Vesna Pusic 
as deputy prime minister to replace Radimir Cacic, who held both
posts before resigning on Nov. 14.  Cacic left after being sentenced to 22 months in jail by a
Hungarian court for causing a fatal road accident. Vrdoljak has
been construction minister in Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic ’s
government, while Pusic also serves as foreign minister. Ana
Mrak Taritas was confirmed as construction minister to replace
Vrdoljak in that post.  Vrdoljak and Pusic are part of the Croatian People’s Party,
a junior partner in the 10-month-old Cabinet led by Milanovic’s
Social Democrats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
