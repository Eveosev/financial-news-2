Renata Hesse, a senior Justice
Department official involved in cases in which AT&T Inc. and
Oracle Corp. were charged with anticompetitive conduct, will
become the acting head of the departmentâ€™s antitrust division,
said a person familiar with the matter.  Hesse will take over from Joe Wayland, the current acting
assistant attorney general for antitrust, said the person, who
lacked authorization to speak publicly about the move and asked
not to be identified.  To contact the reporters on this story:
