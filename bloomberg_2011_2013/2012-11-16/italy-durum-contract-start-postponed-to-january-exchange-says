The start of a durum wheat futures
contract in Milan will be postponed until Jan. 21, Borsa
Italiana SpA said in an e-mailed statement.  The exchange previously said trading might start as early
as Nov. 19. Durum wheat is used to make pasta, and Italy is the
European Unionâ€™s largest grower. IntercontinentalExchange Inc.
introduced Canadian durum futures trading in Winnipeg in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
