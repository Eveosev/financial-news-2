Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd.
said it expects a loss on its gross margin in the third quarter
after shipments of its solar products fell 17 percent from the
second quarter.  The company based in Baoding,  China , said it expects a
gross margin in the range of minus 22 percent to minus 24
percent, according to a statement released today. Yingli also
expects to realize non-cash charges related to inventories and
depreciation expenses and to reverse a provision it made in the
first quarter related to duties in the U.S.  “We are inspired that our industry leadership continues to
be solidified as we quickly expand our market share,” said
Bryan Li, chief financial officer of Yingli.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
