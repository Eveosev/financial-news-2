Asian  equities  outside of Japan
slipped as investors waited to see how China’s new leaders will
manage the world’s second largest economy. Japan’s Nikkei 225
Stock Average surged the most in two months amid speculation an
election next month will hand power to an opposition party that
advocates more economic stimulus.  Citic Securities Co., China’s top brokerage, dropped 2.3
percent.  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  lost 2.2 percent after the beverage
maker formed part of a takeover bid for Fraser & Neave Ltd.
Honda Motor Co., Japan’s third-largest carmaker, advanced 5.1
percent as the yen weakened, boosting the earnings outlook for
the exporter.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index (MXAPJ)  lost 0.4
percent to 431.98 as of 7:30 p.m. in Tokyo, extending this
week’s decline to 2.2 percent. The gauge extended losses for a
second day as China’s Communist Party appointed new leaders.  “A lot of China’s leaders are new and there’s been little
coverage on their current positions,” said Tim Leung, a
portfolio manager who helps manage about $1.5 billion at IG
Investment Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “I’m quite sure in the longer
term we will notice the change, but it’s very difficult to make
predictions at this point.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , which includes Japanese
companies, rose 0.4 percent today, paring this week’s losses to
1.1 percent. The gauge gained 9.5 percent through yesterday from
this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added stimulus to
spur economic growth and data showed a slowdown in China may be
ending.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  slipped 0.3 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.5 percent, while Taiwan’s Taiex Index
fell 0.2 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index was little
changes after the government said growth this year will be at
the lower end of a its forecast and the expansion in 2013 may
hold near a three-year low.  Leadership Change  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 0.8 percent, while
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.2 percent. The Communist
Party named  Xi Jinping  as general secretary on yesterday,
putting him in line to become president, while Vice Premier  Li
Keqiang  is forecast to replace Premier Wen Jiabao.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average extended yesterday’s
surge, rising 2.2 percent, with volume 62 percent above its 30-
day average. Japan’s broader Topix Index jumped 1.9 percent,
posting its biggest two-day gain since March 2011. Japan’s yen
traded near its lowest level against the  U.S. dollar  since
April.  Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  will dissolve parliament
today, triggering an election on Dec. 16 that polls suggest his
 Democratic Party  of Japan will lose. Shinzo Abe, the leader of
the main opposition LDP, called yesterday for the central bank
to pursue unlimited monetary stimulus to end deflation and
revive an economy that shrank last quarter at the fastest pace
since the 2011 earthquake.  “The opposition Liberal Democratic Party is likely to win
the upcoming Japanese election and implement more aggressive
monetary and fiscal action,” said Matthew Sherwood, Perpetual
Investment’s head of markets research in Sydney. Perpetual
manages about $25 billion.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent yesterday as Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. forecast earnings that missed estimates and
lawmakers prepared for budget talks.  Shares on the Asian benchmark index traded at 13.2 times,
compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 Index and 11.9 times for
Stoxx Europe 600.  Chinese brokerages dropped amid concern that the
appointment of  Wang Qishan  as the head of China’s ruling party’s
discipline body would stifle reforms. Wang has a track record of
implementing market-oriented reforms in the past and his
reassignment dashes hopes for economic reforms, Adam Wolfe, a
senior economist for Asia at Roubini Global Economics, wrote in
an e-mail on Nov. 15.  Citic Securities dropped 2.3 percent to HK$14.50 in Hong
Kong. Haitong Securities Co., the nation’s second-biggest
brokerage, slipped 1.6 percent to HK$10.08.  F&N Takeover  Kirin sank 2.2 percent to 969 yen in Tokyo and Fraser &
Neave gained 1.6 percent to S$9.28 in Singapore. Kirin is
seeking to acquire Fraser & Neave’s food and beverages unit as
part of the proposed takeover.  The takeover group, led by Singapore’s Overseas Union
Enterprise Ltd., offered S$13.1 billion for F&N, topping an
offer from Thai billionaire  Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi , and said
Tokyo-based Kirin will buy the food and beverage unit. OUE rose
3.2 percent to S$2.62 in Singapore.  Consumer discretionary  companies accounted for the largest
gains among 10 industry groups on the Asian benchmark. Honda
rose 5.1 percent to 2,591 yen, Toyota Motor Corp. advanced 3.4
percent to 3,325 yen and Nissan Motor Co. climbed 5.1 percent to
738 yen.  Japanese banks gained after Bank of America Corp.
strategist  Michael Hartnett  wrote in a report that the lenders’
shares are the best way to bet on a return of the LDP to power,
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. advanced 1.6 percent to 128 yen and
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  gained 2.8 percent to 366
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
