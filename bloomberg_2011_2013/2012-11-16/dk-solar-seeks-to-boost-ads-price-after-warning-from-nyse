LDK Solar Co. said it’s seeking to
boost the value of its American depositary shares after
recieving a warning from the  New York  Stock Exchange that it’s
not meeting the listing requirements.  The ADSs that represent shares of the Chinese solar panel
maker didn’t meet the exchange’s standards to have a closing
price of $1 or more over a consecutive 30-day trading period as
of Nov. 5, LDK said in a statement today.  “The company has notified the NYSE of its intention to
cure this deficiency,” LDK said in a statement.  Suntech Power Holdings Co., LDK’s bigger rival, disclosed a
similar warning on Sept. 21 and also said it will work to boost
its stock.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
