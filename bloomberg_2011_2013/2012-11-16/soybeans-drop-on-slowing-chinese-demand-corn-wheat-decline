Soybeans fell to the lowest in
almost five months on reports that  China  canceled previous
purchases as improved planting progress in South America boosted
potential for record crops. Corn rose and wheat declined.  China, the world’s biggest soybean consumer, canceled 10
cargoes totaling 600,000 metric tons, Commerzbank AG said today
in an e-mailed report, citing the country’s National Grain and
Oils Information Center.  Rain  followed by dry, warm weather will
aid planting and early crop development the next two weeks in
parts of Brazil as dry weather eases flooding in  Argentina  for
sowing, World Weather Inc. said in a report.  “Reports of China canceling soybean imports put the market
on the defensive,” Chad Henderson, the president of Prime
Agricultural Commodities Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview. “Right now, there are fewer worries
about the potential for record crops in  South America .”  Soybean futures for January delivery dropped 1.3 percent to
close at $13.8325 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after touching $13.7225, the lowest since June 22.
Prices, which reached a record $17.89 in September, fell 4.7
percent this week.  Corn futures for March delivery jumped 0.8 percent to $7.31
a bushel on the CBOT. Still, the grain slid 1.5 percent this
week, the first drop in three weeks.  Wheat futures for March delivery retreated 0.9 percent to
$8.5375 a bushel in Chicago. It was the sixth straight decline,
the longest slump since September 2011.  The U.S. was the leading shipper of all three commodities
last year. Corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
