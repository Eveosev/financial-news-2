European auto sales declined 4.6
percent in October, with  Renault SA (RNO)  and  General Motors Co. (GM) 
reporting the largest drops, as a recession in countries using
the euro discouraged consumers from making large purchases.  Registrations in the 27-member European Union plus  Iceland ,
 Norway  and Switzerland fell to 998,899 vehicles from 1.05
million a year earlier, the Brussels-based European Automobile
Manufacturers Association, or  ACEA , said today. Ten-month sales
decreased 6.9 percent to 10.7 million cars.  The euro-area economy went into a recession for the second
time in four years in the last quarter, according to the
European Union statistics office. The ACEA predicts Europe’s car
sales will reach a 17-year low in 2012 and estimates that as
much as 30 percent of production capacity isn’t in use.
Carmakers are responding by shutting plants and cutting prices.  “Discounts have been going on for two years now,” said
Xavier Caroen, a Paris-based analyst at Kepler Capital Markets.
“People just don’t want to buy cars.”  The October decline slowed from an 11 percent plunge in
September. Last month had an average two more shopping days in
the region than October 2011, Caroen said.  Spanish Contraction  Among  Europe ’s five biggest markets, Spain led car-sales
declines with a 22 percent drop, and registrations fell 12
percent in  Italy  and 7.8 percent in  France . Sales increased 0.5
percent in  Germany  and 12 percent in the U.K.  European sales by Renault, which is based in the Paris
suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, fell 21 percent to 86,735
vehicles. GM, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe,
posted a 14 percent drop to 70,313 cars, led by a 21 percent
plunge at its Chevrolet marque.  Opel is  offering  a 30-day money-back guarantee on cars in
its home market of Germany to take the risk out of signing a
contract to purchase or lease a new vehicle. Buyers can give the
car back if they’re not satisfied and have driven less than
3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles), according to a promotional
website.  Dealer discounts in Germany surged last month to an average
of 12.5 percent off the list price, the highest level in more
than two years and up from 11.1 percent a year earlier,
according to trade publication  Autohaus PulsSchlag . Fiat SpA,
 PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and Renault offered the steepest price
reductions, ranging from 14.7 percent to 15.5 percent.  Audi’s Gain  European sales by Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen AG (VOW3) ,
the region’s biggest carmaker, rose 1.5 percent to 255,120
vehicles last month, as an 11 percent jump at its Audi luxury
brand more than made up for declines at other divisions. Daimler
AG, owner of luxury-car brand Mercedes Benz, posted a 3.2
percent sales gain to 53,178 units.  Registrations by Munich-based  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ,
the world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, fell 1.4 percent in
the region to 63,902 cars.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-biggest carmaker, sold 121,107
cars in Europe, a 5.1 percent decline. The Paris-based
manufacturer said in July that it had burned through about 200
million euros ($255 million) in cash monthly at its automotive
unit for the past year, and outlined plans to close a factory
amid cost-cutting measures targeted at reducing its headcount in
France by 8,000.  EU Backing  The French government has moved to support Peugeot, which
is junk-rated by all three major ratings companies, by backing 7
billion euros in new bonds for its financing arm. The EU
outlined plans on Nov. 8 to increase funding for the auto
industry as part of an effort for a coordinated response with
labor leaders and politicians to the car market contraction.  Fiat (F) ’s European sales fell 5.8 percent to 64,736 cars.
Dearborn, Michigan-based  Ford Motor Co. (F) , which is closing three
plants in Europe, reported an 8.1 percent drop in sales in the
region to 74,899 vehicles.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, is
proposing to roughly double funds for research and development
in the car sector to about 2 billion euros in the 2014-2020
budget, Industry Commissioner Antonio Tajani said on Nov. 8. The
EU also plans to bring together carmakers, unions and government
officials to discuss additional measures, including job cuts and
plant closings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
