China’s  yuan  was set for the biggest
weekly gain in a month as the government expanded a quota for
foreigners to invest in domestic securities.  Yuan positions  at Chinese banks accumulated from sales of
foreign exchange climbed 21.6 billion yuan ($3.47 billion) in
October, the central bank said today. China will increase the
 Renminbi  Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor Program by 200
billion yuan from 70 billion yuan,  Guo Shuqing , chairman of the
securities regulator, said Nov. 11. The Communist Party unveiled
its new leaders yesterday, with Xi Jinping replacing  Hu Jintao 
as party secretary.  “China is encouraging inflows of capital as a way to
stimulate its economy, which will keep the yuan at a strong
level,” said  Daniel Chan , executive vice president at Glory Sky
Global Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The key uncertainty now is
who will be in charge of economic policies in China’s new
leadership and how aggressive they are in terms of reforms.”  The yuan rose 0.19 percent this week to 6.2334 per dollar
as of 10:29 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It was unchanged on the day, after the
People’s Bank of China weakened the  reference rate  0.06 percent
to 6.2945.  The currency touched 6.2252 on Nov. 14, the strongest level
since the government unified the official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993. The spot rate is allowed to fluctuate
as much as 1 percent from the central bank’s fixing and touched
the upper limit of its trading band for a ninth day yesterday.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.13 percent
today to 6.2358 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.08
percent to 6.3410, a 1.7 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, today to 1.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
