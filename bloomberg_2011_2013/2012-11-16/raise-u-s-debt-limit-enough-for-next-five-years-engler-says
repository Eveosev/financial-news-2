The U.S. government should raise the
debt ceiling high enough to cover projected deficits for the
next five years, said  John Engler , president of the  Business
Roundtable .  The U.S. is expected to reach the $16.4 trillion ceiling
this year, and the Treasury Department can take other steps to
extend borrowing authority into early 2013. In 2011, Congress
came within days of breaching the debt limit.  “It’s a terribly blunt, clumsy instrument to try to use,”
Engler, a former Republican governor of Michigan, said in a
Bloomberg News interview. “It’s not a good weapon for anything
except destroying our own  credit rating .”  Republicans, including House Speaker  John Boehner , have
demanded that any increase in the debt limit be matched with
spending cuts.  Engler, whose Washington-based group’s members are chief
executives of large corporations, said lawmakers should address
the debt limit soon, as part of negotiations over averting the
$607 billion fiscal cliff of automatic spending cuts and tax
increases scheduled to begin in January.  The issue isn’t a constructive way to address spending, he
said.  “It only is about: Can we borrow the money to pay for the
spending that’s already taking place?” Engler said.  Over the next five years, even if expiring tax cuts aren’t
extended, the U.S. is projected to accumulate more than $1.5
trillion in additional deficits, according to the  Congressional
Budget Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
