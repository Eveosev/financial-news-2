Following is the text of the U.S.
 industrial production  and capacity utilization report.  Industrial production declined 0.4 percent in October after
having increased 0.2 percent in September. Hurricane Sandy,
which held down production in the Northeast region at the end of
October, is estimated to have reduced the rate of change in
total output by nearly 1 percentage point. The largest estimated
storm-related effects included reductions in the output of
utilities, of chemicals, of food, of transportation equipment,
and of computers and electronic products.  In October, the index
for manufacturing decreased 0.9 percent; excluding storm-related
effects, factory output was roughly unchanged from September.
The output of utilities edged down 0.1 percent in October, and
production at mines advanced 1.5 percent. At 96.6 percent of its
2007 average, total industrial production in October was 1.7
percent above its year-earlier level.  Capacity utilization for
total industry decreased 0.4 percentage point to 77.8 percent, a
rate 2.5 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011)
average.  Market Groups  The production of  consumer goods  declined 0.9 percent in
October. The output of durable goods advanced 0.2 percent, but
the output of nondurables fell 1.2 percent. Among durable
consumer goods categories, the index for automotive products
rose after having declined in each of the previous three months;
the production of home electronics moved up; the output of
appliances, furniture, and carpeting was unchanged; and the
index for miscellaneous goods decreased. Among non-energy
nondurables, there were losses in the indexes for foods and
tobacco, for clothing, and for paper products. Despite storm-
related outages, the index for chemical products edged up. The
output of consumer energy products stepped down 0.7 percent,
partly reflecting a decline in residential utilities.  The output of business equipment moved down 1.2 percent in
October, and all three of its major components registered
similarly sized losses. The production of transit equipment
decreased 1.2 percent, nearly offsetting its gain in September.
The indexes for information processing equipment and for
industrial and other equipment each fell slightly more than 1
percent in October, but both indexes were about 5 percent above
their year-earlier levels.  The output of defense and space equipment declined 0.8
percent in October after a solid advance in September.  Among nonindustrial supplies, the output of construction
supplies decreased 0.5 percent in October after having moved up
in September, and the production of business supplies declined
0.7 percent in October and was 0.4 percent above its year-
earlier level.  The output of materials to be processed further in the
industrial sector rose 0.1 percent in October. A large gain in
the index for energy materials more than offset declines in the
non-energy categories.  The output of durable materials
decreased 0.5 percent, its third straight monthly decline. The
index for consumer parts was unchanged in October and stood 15.1
percent above its year-earlier level. The output of equipment
parts decreased 0.3 percent in October. The index for nondurable
materials dropped 1.1 percent, reversing the gain of the
previous month; each of its major components moved down. The
output of energy materials rose 1.6 percent.  Industry Groups  Manufacturing output declined 0.9 percent in October.
Excluding the estimated effects of  Hurricane Sandy ,
manufacturing output was little changed from its September
level. Declines were widespread across both durable and
nondurable goods industries. The factory operating rate slipped
to 75.9 percent in October, a rate 2.9 percentage points below
its long-run average.  The production of durable goods decreased 0.6 percent in
October. Losses of more than 1 percent were recorded in the
indexes for machinery and for electrical equipment, appliances,
and components. The output of wood products edged up, but
production declined in all other major categories of durables.
Capacity utilization for durable goods manufacturing was 75.8
percent, a rate 1.3 percentage points below its long-run
average.  The index for nondurables dropped 1.0 percent in October
and stood 0.5 percent below its year-earlier level. Sizable
declines were recorded in October in the production of food,
beverage, and tobacco products; apparel and leather products;
paper; printing and support activities; and petroleum and coal
products. Capacity utilization for nondurable manufacturing was
77.5 percent, a rate 3.4 percentage points below its long-run
average.  Production in the non-NAICS manufacturing industries
(logging and publishing) fell 3.4 percent in October. The output
of publishers was held down by the effects of Hurricane Sandy.  Mining output advanced 1.5 percent in October after having
gained 0.9 percent in September; the extraction of crude oil
rose significantly in both months. Capacity utilization for
mining moved up 1.1 percentage points in October to 90.4
percent, a rate 3.1 percentage points above its long-run
average. The output of utilities edged down 0.1 percent in
October; it was unchanged in September. The operating rate for
utilities fell 0.2 percentage point in October to 75.2 percent,
a rate 11.1 percentage points below its long-run average.  Capacity utilization rates in October for industries
grouped by stage of process were as follows: At the crude stage,
utilization increased 0.5 percentage point to 87.8 percent, a
rate 1.5 percentage points above its long-run average; at the
primary and semifinished stages, utilization dropped 0.4
percentage point to 75.0 percent, a rate 6.1 percentage points
below its long-run average; and at the finished stage,
utilization fell 1.0 percentage point to 76.4 percent, a rate
0.8 percentage point lower than its long-run  average.  Notice
Calculating Disaster Effects on Industrial Production  The effect of Hurricane Sandy on industrial output was
estimated using the same procedures employed to assess the
effects of previous natural disasters. For some industries,
timely high-frequency physical product data that reflect the
imprint of natural disasters on industrial output exist. For
other industries, estimates of natural-disaster effects are
constructed using the following methodology.  First, information
from the  Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) is used to
determine which counties were affected by the disaster; FEMA
issues Major Disaster Declarations and Emergency Declarations
based on the needs of the counties. Second, the U.S. Census
Bureau’s County Business Patterns data are used to measure each
industry’s share of employment located in the affected counties.
Third, the duration that facilities in the affected areas were
idled is estimated based on the declaration type assigned to
each county by FEMA.  Fourth, given this information, an
estimate of the magnitude of the disruption is constructed for
each industry, and the industry-specific effects are aggregated
using industrial production weights to obtain an overall
estimate of the effect on top-line industrial production and on
the major industry aggregates. In subsequent months, as physical
product data and other information become available, the
disaster effects are further updated and refined.  Notice
Revision of Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization  The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue its annual
revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the
related measures of capacity utilization at the end of March
2013. The revised IP indexes will incorporate detailed data from
the 2011 Annual Survey of Manufactures, conducted by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Annual data from the  U.S. Geological Survey 
regarding metallic and nonmetallic minerals (except fuels) for
2011 will also be incorporated. The update will include
revisions to the monthly indicator (either product data or input
data) and to seasonal factors for each industry. In addition,
the estimation methods for some series may be changed.  Any
modifications to the methods for estimating the output of an
industry will affect the index from 1972 to the present.  Capacity and capacity utilization will be revised to
incorporate data through the fourth quarter of 2012 from the
Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity, which covers
manufacturing, along with new data on capacity from the U.S.
Geological Survey, the U.S. Department of Energy, and other
organizations.  Once the revision is published, it will be available on the
Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17. The 2013
release schedule is also available on the website.  References and Release Dates
