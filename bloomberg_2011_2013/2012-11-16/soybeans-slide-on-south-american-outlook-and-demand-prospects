Soybeans fell for a second day in
Chicago, reaching the lowest price in almost five months on
forecasts for improving weather in  South America  and prospects
of declining demand.  Brazil , which has experienced dry weather, had showers in
northern regions yesterday and some growing areas may see as
much as 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) in the next five days,
Commodity Weather Group said today in a report.  Argentina , where
conditions have been too wet, may be mostly dry today and
tomorrow before some showers occur Nov. 18, Telvent DTN said.  “Weather conditions in South America look favorable for
crop development over the near term,” Ker Chung Yang, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said in a report e-mailed today.
Investors also may be closing bets on price gains in the absence
of news that reflects stronger demand, he said.  Soybeans for delivery in January slid 1.6 percent to $13.80
a bushel at 7:01 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The oilseed
touched $13.775, the lowest level for a most-active contract
since June 22. Prices are down 4.9 percent this week and 23
percent below the record $17.89 reached Sept. 4 as drought cut
yields in the U.S.  China , the world’s biggest soybean consumer, canceled 10
cargos totaling 600,000 metric tons, Commerzbank AG said today
in an e-mailed report, citing the country’s National Grain and
Oils Information Center.  December Shipment  China scrapped deliveries “that were supposed to be
dispatched in December and January and that just a few weeks ago
had been agreed at significantly higher prices,” said analyst
Carsten Fritsch at Commerzbank in  Frankfurt . It is “likely that
these shipments will be renegotiated at lower prices,” he said.  Corn for delivery in March declined 0.8 percent to $7.1925
a bushel. The grain has dropped 3.1 percent this week.  Wheat for delivery in March fell 0.3 percent to $8.585 a
bushel, poised for a sixth straight decline, the longest losing
streak since September 2011. The contract is down 4.8 percent
this week. In Paris, milling wheat for delivery in January rose
0.1 percent to 269.50 euros ($343.40) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  The European Union issued export licenses for 695,294 tons
of wheat in the week ended Nov. 13, the most grain since
September 2010, data from the bloc showed yesterday. U.S. wheat
export sales fell 39 percent in the week ended Nov. 1 from the
prior period to 220,949 tons, according to the most recent data
from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . It will release figures
for the following week today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
