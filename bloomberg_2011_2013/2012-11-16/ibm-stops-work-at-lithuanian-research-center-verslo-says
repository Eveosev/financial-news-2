International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  has stopped working at a research center it set up with
the Lithuanian government in 2010 as the European Union refused
to help finance the initiative, Verslo Zinios reported.  IBM put participation in the project on hold several months
ago as  Lithuania  failed to get financing from the EU to match
the company’s contributions, the newspaper said, citing Vice
Minister of Economy Adomas Audickas.  Lithuania is negotiating with the EU about funding
possibilities and with IBM about reducing the government’s
commitments, the newspaper cited him as saying.  IBM may cancel its five-year contract with Lithuania by the
end of this year if no agreement is reached, Audickas said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
