Pakistan suspended mobile phone
services in Karachi and Quetta because of security threats
relating to the start of the Muslim holy month of Muharram,
after a wave of sectarian killings since last month.  The suspension was ordered between 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local
time, Amir Pasha, a spokesman for Pakistan Telecommunications
Co.’s mobile unit, said by telephone from Islamabad.
Motorcyclists were barred in Quetta while the  High Court  of
Sindh reversed a government order for them to stay off the roads
in Karachi.  The restrictions come after 500 people were killed in
Karachi in mostly sectarian attacks since September, according
to police. Thousands of people have been killed in violence
between majority Sunni and minority Shiite Muslims in Pakistan
since the 1980s. Shiite Muslims account for about 20 percent of
Pakistan’s population of 190 million.  At least 43 people were killed and 50 wounded in a 2009
bombing in Karachi during a procession of Shiite Muslims to mark
Ashura, the ninth and tenth days of Muharram, the first month of
the Islamic calendar.  Mobile phone services were last suspended in parts of the
country in October because of security threats. Interior
Minister Rehman Malik has said terrorists often use motorcycles
to launch attacks and mobile phones to trigger explosive devices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
