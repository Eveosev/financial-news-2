Latam Airlines SA (LFL)  posted its longest
streak of losses in six months after the airline’s chief
executive officer said it is considering selling new stock to
help reduce debt and regain an investment-grade  credit rating .  Latam, which became the world’s most valuable carrier when
it bought  Brazil ’s Tam SA in June, retreated for a seventh day,
dropping 1.8 percent to 11,053 pesos at the close of trading in
Santiago. It was the biggest decline in  Chile ’s benchmark Ipsa
index, which fell less than 0.1 percent.  The airline had its credit rating reduced to BB+ from BBB
by  Fitch Ratings , one level below investment grade, on the day
the combination with the Brazilian carrier was completed. CEO
Enrique Cueto told Diario Financiero in an interview that Latam
is considering a share sale to improve debt ratios, which Fitch
has said could lead to an upgrade.  “The decline today is obviously related to the news,
although the stock has been falling ever since the merger as the
market is expecting announcements on how it plans to recover its
investment grade,” Pablo Alvarez, an analyst at Banco Penta,
said in a phone interview from Santiago.  Latam, based in Santiago, also will reduce flights and
replace unprofitable aircraft in Brazil, where operations
probably will shrink 7 percent next year, the newspaper cited
Cueto as saying. The airline’s press department confirmed
Cueto’s statements in an e-mailed response to questions.  Latam has retreated 18 percent since June 22, when it
completed the merger with Tam, underperforming the Ipsa, which
dropped 4 percent in the same period of time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
