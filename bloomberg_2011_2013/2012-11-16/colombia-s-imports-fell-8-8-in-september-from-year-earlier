Colombia ’s imports rose 7.8 percent
to $5.22 billion in October compared with the same month last
year, the government statistics agency said today in a report on
its website.  Colombia posted a $22.4 million  trade surplus  in October.
The trade surplus compares with a median forecast for a $365
million surplus in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Spending on imports has been boosted by an 8 percent
appreciation in the Colombian peso this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
