The Philippine peso fell, completing
its biggest weekly decline in three months, as official data
showed the pace of growth in overseas remittances slowed in
September.  Government bonds  advanced.  Funds sent home by Filipinos abroad rose 5.9 percent from a
year earlier to $1.84 billion, following an increase of 7.6
percent in August, an official report showed yesterday. Exports
and remittances account for about 30 percent of the $225 billion
economy. U.S. President  Barack Obama  meets with lawmakers today
to address the so-called fiscal cliff, which involves spending
cuts and tax increases due early next year.  “Most regional markets have been affected by what’s
happening on the external side, especially in the U.S. as there
are talks over the fiscal cliff,” said Radhika Rao, an
economist at Forecast Pte. in  Singapore . “On the domestic
front, peso remittances slowed and the market is obviously
sentiment-driven.”  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 41.335 per dollar in
 Manila , according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
lost 0.7 percent this week, the most since the period ended Aug.
17. It reached 41.050 on Nov. 8, the highest level since March
2008.  The currency has been unable to strengthen beyond the
“psychological barrier” of 41 per dollar, Rao said. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 4.70 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Obama is meeting with Democratic and Republican leaders in
Congress to discuss ways to avoid $607 billion in automatic
budget reductions and tax additions set to take effect in
January. Without a compromise, the world’s largest economy may
tip into a recession, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The yield on the Philippines 5.875 percent bonds due March
2032 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.65
percent this week, according to Tradition Financial Services The
yield dropped two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
