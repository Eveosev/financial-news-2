Bank of America Corp.  hired analyst
Paul Shea from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  to join an equities sales team
catering to hedge funds and other institutional clients, said
two people with knowledge of the move.  Shea will join the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm as
a director on its event-driven desk, which involves securities
linked to mergers and other corporate actions, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the move isn’t public.
Shea was at Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank for three years, most
recently as a special-situations desk analyst, and previously
worked at  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the people said.  Wall Street firms are under pressure as equities-trading
revenue at the nine biggest companies dipped 11 percent in the
first nine months of the year to $29.2 billion amid shrinking
trading volume. Bank of America is ranked fifth by revenue,
behind Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse
Group AG and JPMorgan.  Shea will report to  Michael Lynch , head of cash equity
distribution in the Americas, the people said. Shea declined to
comment on the move when reached by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
