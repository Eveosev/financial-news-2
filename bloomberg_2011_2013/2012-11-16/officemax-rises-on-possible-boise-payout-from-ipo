OfficeMax Inc. (OMX)  rose to the highest
level in 18 months after a company in which it owns a stake
announced an initial public offering that could bring the
office-supply retailer more than $300 million.  OfficeMax, the third-biggest U.S. office-supply store,
advanced 12 percent to $9.22 at the close in New York, the
highest price since May 12, 2011. The stock has more than
doubled this year.  Boise Cascade LLC, which distributes building products
through its subsidiaries, filed for an IPO yesterday after the
markets closed, seeking to raise as much as $200 million.
OfficeMax has a 20.4 percent stake in that company’s parent
Boise Cascade Holdings, which could be worth more than $200
million when the company goes public,  David Strasser , an analyst
for Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, wrote in a note to clients.  OfficeMax, based in Naperville, Illinois, could see more
than $130 million in payments from the IPO, including $110
million from equity and $23 million in dividends, he wrote.  Including OfficeMax’s stake in the public company, “Boise
could be worth over $340 million for OfficeMax,” wrote
Strasser, who recommends buying the shares.  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  and  Office Depot Inc. (ODP)  are the first- and
second-largest U.S. office-supply retailers by sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
