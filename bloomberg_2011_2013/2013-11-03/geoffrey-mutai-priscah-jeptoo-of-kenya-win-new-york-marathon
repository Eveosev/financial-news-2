Geoffrey Mutai won the men’s race and
his Kenyan compatriot Priscah Jeptoo took the women’s title at
the  New York  Marathon.  Mutai in 2011 became the first person to run record times
to win both the  Boston  and New York marathons. That year, Mutai
ran the fastest time ever to win the 115th Boston Marathon in
two hours, three minutes, two seconds, besting Haile
Gebrselassie’s run of 2:03:59 in Berlin in 2008. It didn’t
qualify as a world record because the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer)
Boston course is considered too straight and has too many
downhill sections.  Deba went clear around the 20-mile mark today and the 29-year-old Jeptoo passed her with about two miles to go. Jeptoo’s
unofficial time was 2:25:07.  The New York Marathon was canceled last year after at least
41 people died and 4.8 million in the region lost power because
of  Hurricane Sandy , the strongest Atlantic storm on record,
which came ashore on Oct. 29. About 21,000 entrants from the
2012 field returned this year, with about 48,000 in total
competing.  Race organizer the New York Road Runners staged today’s
edition seven months after three people died and more than 260
were injured in dual bombings near the finish line of the Boston
Marathon.  The men’s and women’s champions each receive $100,000 from
total prize money of $600,000.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
