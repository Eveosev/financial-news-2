China ’s Communist Party removed the
military chief of the restive Xinjiang province from its top
decision-making body in the region.  Peng Yong was removed from the Standing Committee of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region while Liu Lei was appointed as
a member to the Committee, Xinjiang Daily  reported  on its
website today, without elaborating. Peng was named a member of
the Standing Committee of Xinjiang and commander of Xinjiang
Military Area Command since 2011, according to a  profile  on the
website of China’s Communist Party.  Peng’s dismissal came after China’s security chief Meng
Jianzhu said in an interview with Phoenix Television the people
in a vehicle that crashed near Beijing’s  Tiananmen Square  last
week, leaving five dead, had links to a Uighur militant group in
Central Asia.  Chinese police detained five suspects within 10 hours of
the Oct. 28 crash with help from authorities in Xinjiang, Xinhua
reported Oct. 30. They were identified by names that aren’t
typical of Han Chinese, without being described as Uighurs. The
suspects said they knew Usmen Hasan, the driver of the car,
Xinhua added.  Police found knives and religious material in the sport-utility vehicle, which was driven by a man whose mother and wife
were inside when it crashed near Tiananmen Square, according to
Xinhua.  The incident, which left all three plus two tourists from
the  Philippines  and the Chinese province of Guangdong dead, was
“carefully planned, organized and premeditated,” Xinhua
reported, citing the police.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
