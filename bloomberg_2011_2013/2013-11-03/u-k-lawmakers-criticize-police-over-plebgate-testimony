A panel of U.K. lawmakers criticized
police for their testimony in its investigation into events that
led to the resignation of a cabinet minister.  Andrew Mitchell , the Conservative chief whip in charge of
party discipline in the House of Commons, resigned last year
after being accused of calling police officers outside Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s central London residence “plebs”
because they refused to let him cycle through the main gate, a
charge he denied.  The Commons Home Affairs Committee called three officials
from the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file
officers, for questioning last month about allegations they had
given inaccurate accounts of their role in the affair, which has
become known in the U.K. as “plebgate.”  The panel said in a report published in London today their
testimony was “misleading, possibly deliberately so, and
lacking in credibility.” It said it was recalling two of the
officials to apologize and correct their testimony.  “The narrative of what we have seen could rival any great
work of fiction,” the panel’s chairman, Keith Vaz, said in an
e-mailed statement. “At every point and at every level, instead
of being transparent, we have uncovered a process that obstructs
the truth. If this can happen to a cabinet minister, what hope
is there for anyone else?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
