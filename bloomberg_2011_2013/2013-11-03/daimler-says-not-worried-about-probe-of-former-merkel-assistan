Daimler AG (DAI)  said it’s not concerned
about an investigation whether Eckart von Klaeden, a former aide
of  Chancellor Angela Merkel , violated corruption rules by
joining the German carmaker.  “We’re looking forward to the prosecutor’s investigation
with great equanimity and have absolutely no doubts about the
integrity of Eckart von Klaeden,” Joerg Howe, a spokesman for
Daimler, said today by phone. The investigation by the Berlin
prosecutor’s office was triggered by an anonymous report, he
said.  Von Klaeden, a former state minister at Merkel’s
chancellery, announced in May he would join Daimler as head of
external affairs. He stayed at his government job until
September.  Von Klaeden has contacted prosecutors through his lawyer
and is “fully” cooperating with them, Handelsblatt cited him
as saying in an interview. “I am confident that the allegations
that were anonymously brought against me can be completely
cleared.”  Von Klaeden didn’t immediately reply to requests for
comment through Daimler and by phone. The Berlin prosecution
office didn’t answer phone calls. German news magazine  Der
Spiegel  first reported the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
