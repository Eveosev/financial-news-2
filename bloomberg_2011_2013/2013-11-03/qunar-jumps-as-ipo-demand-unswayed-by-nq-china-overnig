Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. and  58.Com
Inc. (WUBA)  jumped after selling shares above their price targets, a
signal that appetite for Chinese companies remains unshaken by
Muddy Waters LLC’s fraud allegations against NQ Mobile Inc.  Qunar, a travel-booking service controlled by  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) ,
rose 89 percent Nov. 1 after selling American depositary
receipts at $15 each, above an initial target of as much as
$11.50. 58.Com, a Chinese online marketplace similar to
Craigslist, has soared 47 percent from its initial public
offering price of $17 on Oct. 31. The Bloomberg China-US Index
of the most traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. advanced 1 percent
last week as the gauge capped a four-month rally.  Five Chinese firms have completed U.S. IPOs this year,
rallying an average 43 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Both Qunar and 58.com raised their target price
ranges before completing the offering, underscoring investor
confidence even as  NQ Mobile (NQ)  has lost 44 percent following Muddy
Waters’ Oct. 24 report saying it inflated sales. NQ co-Chief
Executive Officer Omar Khan said the company’s revenue is real.  “NQ has no impact on other China names -- it’s an isolated
case,” Erik Lam, director of Asian equity sales at Auerbach
Grayson & Co. in  New York , said by e-mail Nov. 1. “Qunar is the
leading search-based commerce platform for the travel industry
in  China . Revenue growth has been very strong. Qunar’s upward
revision to its  price range  bodes quite well for a pipeline of
new IPOs by Chinese tech companies.”  ETF Gains  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 3.8 percent last week to
$37.83, the most in eight weeks. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
completed a four-week rally.  Qunar’s ADRs jumped to $28.40 after its $167 million IPO.
The 89 percent first-day surge was the best start among the five
Chinese IPOs this year. The offering had an initial target of
$9.50-$11.50, which was later boosted to as much as $14,
according to filings of the Beijing-based company.  Baidu, operator of China’s largest search engine, purchased
in 2011 a majority stake in Qunar, whose reported sales jumped
75 percent from a year earlier to 358.8 million  yuan  ($58.5
million) for the first six months this year while net loss
narrowed from a year earlier to $2.8 million.  The number of Qunar’s active  web users  grew to 31.4 million
for the 12 months through June, from 12.6 million in 2010, the
company said in its filing.  ‘Long-Term Profitability’  “Short term, we are going to focus on market share as well
as cash flow balance,” Cc Zhuang, CEO and co-founder of Qunar,
said in a phone interview in New York Nov. 1. “We are trying to
build something that can generate long-term profitability.”  58.Com, which raised $187 million in its IPO, priced its
sale of 11 million ADRs at $17 apiece, higher than its initial
target range of $13 to $15. Its ADRs surged to $25 last week.  The company posted net income of $285,000 for the first
half this year, compared with a net loss of $19.3 million a year
earlier, its prospectus showed. The company’s revenue, mainly
from merchant membership charges and sales from customers’
online marketing, jumped 51 percent to $58.8 million in the six
months through June.  The IPOs were “mainly driven by the companies’ recent
income statement results, which showed significant revenue
growth with high gross margins,”  Francis Gaskins , president of
 Marina Del Rey , California-based IPOdesktop.com, which monitors
initial public offerings, said by e-mail Nov. 1.  NQ Mobile, based in Beijing, sank to $12.78 last week.
 Carson Block , the Muddy Waters founder whose short call prompted
a three-day plunge in NQ Mobile following his report, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview Nov. 1 the stock will be delisted
amid allegations it fabricated revenue and lied about its cash.  ‘Absolutely Absurd’  Khan said a delisting from the New York Stock Exchange is
“absolutely absurd” in a separate interview with Bloomberg TV
on the same day.  Rich Adamonis , a spokesman for the New York
Stock Exchange, said the bourse had no comment.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in  Hong Kong  advanced
4.9 percent last week to 10,678.69 and the  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.8 percent to 2,149.56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
