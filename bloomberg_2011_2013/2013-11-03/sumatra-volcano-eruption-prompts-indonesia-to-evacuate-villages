Indonesian authorities evacuated
people at four villages within 3 kilometers of Mount Sinabung,
in North Sumatra, after the volcano erupted, according to the
 National Disaster Management Agency .  The government raised the status to stand by, the second-highest level, last night after the mountain spewed ash as high
as 7,000 meters and the number of volcanic quakes increased,
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman at the disaster agency said by
phone. He didnâ€™t provide the number of people evacuated.  Mount Sinabung is located about 40 miles southwest of
Medan, the provincial capital of North Sumatra. About 13,000
people were evacuated when the volcano erupted in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
