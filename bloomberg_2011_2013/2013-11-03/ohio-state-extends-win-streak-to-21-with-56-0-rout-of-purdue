Braxton Miller threw for 233 yards
and four touchdowns as fourth-ranked  Ohio State University 
recorded its 21st straight win 56-0 against  Purdue University  in
college football.  In other games involving top ten-ranked teams in the Bowl
Championship Series, it was No. 3  Florida  State 41, No. 7 Miami
14; No. 8 Clemson 59, Virginia 10; and No. 9 Missouri 31,
Tennessee 3.  Ohio State (9-0, 5-0 Big 10) hasn’t lost a game in 22
months. Coach Urban Meyer tied a personal best by winning his
22nd consecutive game, which includes his final victory at
Florida.  Tight end Jeff Heuerman caught five passes for a career-high 116 yards and scored a touchdown.  “It was an early morning, we had to get up early, we had
to get prepared, we had to eat well,” Miller said. “We had to
get the guys going and the coaches talked to us and got us
hyped.”  The Boilermakers (1-7, 0-4 Big Ten) have tallied eight
consecutive scoreless quarters and failed to reach the red zone
for the third consecutive game.  “We didn’t tackle very well, we had guys out of place
quite a few times (on defense) and we need to get off the
blocks,” Purdue coach Darrell Hazell said. “We can’t get a
quarterback beat up the way we did. We had problems in pass
protection.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
