EBay Inc. (EBAY)  removed yellow Star of
David armbands and other Holocaust-related items offered for
sale on its website and issued an apology for what it called a
lapse in its standards.  San Jose , California-based EBay said it also made a
donation to charity “to reflect our concern,” according to an
e-mailed statement today. Company spokesman Steven Heywood said
by e-mail that 25,000 pounds ($40,000) were given to an
“appropriate charity.”  “We very much regret that we didn’t live up to our own
standards,” the company said. “We don’t allow listings of this
nature, and dedicate thousands of staff to policing our site and
use the latest technology to detect items that shouldn’t be for
sale.”  U.K. newspaper Mail on Sunday reported today that about 30
items were on sale, including a concentration camp uniform
offered for 11,200 pounds that was thought to have belonged to a
Polish baker who died at the Auschwitz death camp. Other
offerings were a pair of shoes belonging to a death camp victim
and yellow Star of David armbands used to single out Jews for
persecution, the newspaper said.
