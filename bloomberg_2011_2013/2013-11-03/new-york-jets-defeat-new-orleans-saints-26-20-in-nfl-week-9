The Seattle Seahawks beat the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers 27-24 in overtime after the biggest comeback in
franchise history, while the  New York Jets  rebounded from a 40-point loss with a 26-20 upset of the New Orleans Saints.  Steven Hauschka kicked a 27-yard field goal on the second
possession of overtime as the Seahawks (8-1) rallied from a 21-0
deficit to push their home winning streak to 12 games. The
Buccaneers, who were 16 1/2-point underdogs, are 0-8 for the
first time since the 1985 National Football League season.  The comeback was “just a tremendous statement that our
guys made about hanging together and believing,” Seahawks coach
 Pete Carroll  told reporters. “They competed so hard.”  The Indianapolis Colts also had a comeback victory last
night, pulling out a 27-24 road win over the Houston Texans
after trailing 24-6 in the third quarter.  Andrew Luck  threw
three second-half touchdown passes to T.Y. Hilton, including the
go-ahead score with just over four minutes remaining, as the
Colts improved to 6-2. Texans coach  Gary Kubiak  is in stable
condition after being taken to a local hospital when he
collapsed as the teams left the field at halftime.  The Jets intercepted Saints quarterback Drew Brees twice in
yesterday’s win at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New
Jersey. Chris Ivory and rookie quarterback Geno Smith each had
rushing touchdowns for the Jets (5-4), who were 6 1/2-point
underdogs against a Saints team that had a 6-1 record.  Lone Unbeaten  The Kansas City Chiefs (9-0) remained with NFL’s only
undefeated team by getting two defensive touchdowns to rally for
a 23-13 road win against the Buffalo Bills (3-6). Sean Smith had
a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown for the Chiefs,
while Tamba Hali scored on a 11-yard fumble return in the fourth
quarter to snap a 13-13 tie.  The  Philadelphia Eagles  routed the Oakland Raiders 49-20 as
quarterback Nick Foles tied the NFL’s single-game record with
seven touchdown passes.  The Dallas Cowboys (5-4) beat Minnesota 27-23, avoiding an
upset at home against the 1-7 Vikings when  Tony Romo  threw a
seven-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Harris with 35 seconds left.  Tom Brady  passed for a season-high 432 yards and four
touchdowns to lead the New England Patriots to a 55-31 win over
the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Cleveland Browns (4-5) dropped
the defending Super Bowl-champion Baltimore Ravens to 3-5 with a
24-18 victory.  The Washington Redskins (3-5) beat the San Diego Chargers
(4-4) 30-24 in overtime on Darrel Young’s third touchdown of the
game, and the Carolina Panthers (5-3) shut out the  Atlanta
Falcons  (2-6) in the second half to pull away for a 34-10
victory.  Chris Johnson  scored two touchdowns as the Tennessee
Titans (4-4) beat the St. Louis Rams (3-6) 28-21.  Monday Night  Week 9 play -- which began Oct. 31 with a 22-20 overtime
win for the Miami Dolphins (4-4) against the Cincinnati Bengals
(6-3) -- concludes tonight with the Green Bay Packers (5-2)
hosting the Chicago Bears (4-3).  The  Denver Broncos ,  Detroit Lions ,  New York Giants ,  San
Francisco 49ers ,  Arizona  Cardinals and Jacksonville Jaguars were
off this week.  In Seattle, the Buccaneers scored two touchdowns in a 41-second span of the second quarter to open a 21-0 lead.  The Seahawks rallied behind Russell Wilson, who ran for a
score and threw two touchdown passes including a 10-yarder to
Doug Baldwin to tie it with 1:51 left in the fourth quarter.  After Seattle’s defense held Tampa Bay to negative yardage
on the first drive of overtime, Wilson and running back Marshawn Lynch moved the Seahawks 52 yards in nine plays for Hauschka’s
winning field goal.  Three-Yard Runs  The Jets, after falling behind 14-6 behind a pair of
touchdown passes from Brees to  Jimmy Graham , took the lead for
good in the second quarter as Ivory and Smith each had three-yard touchdown runs. Ivory finished with 139 of the Jets’ 198
rushing yards, while  Nick Folk  kicked four field goals for New
York to improve to 23-for-23 on the season.  The Jets sealed the victory when they forced Brees into an
incompletion on a fourth-and-19 play with 1:21 left. New York
has alternated wins and losses in its first nine games, tying
the 2005 Patriots for the longest such streak to start a season.  “We didn’t know how we’d win it and all that, but all I
know is that I have a team that believes and will fight to the
end and find a way,” said Jets coach  Rex Ryan .  Chiefs Survive  The Chiefs were able to match the best start in franchise
history even though they were outgained 470-210 in total yardage
in Buffalo. Kansas City scored 10 points off interceptions by
Bills rookie quarterback Jeff Tuel, including Smith’s return,
and Hali’s score after a fumble by Buffalo receiver T.J. Graham
put the Chiefs ahead for good.  Kansas City has held each of its first nine opponents to 17
points or fewer, tying a NFL record set by the 1977 Atlanta
Falcons.  In Oakland, California, Foles became the seventh
quarterback to throw seven touchdown passes in a NFL game.
Denver’s  Peyton Manning  started the 2013 season by throwing for
seven touchdowns against the Ravens.  Foles threw touchdowns to five players, including three to
Riley Cooper, for the Eagles (4-5), who had failed to score an
offensive touchdown in their past two games under first-year
coach Chip Kelly. The Raiders fell to 3-5.  “Whenever I’ve looked at records throughout my whole life,
the greatest things about them is the guys you do them with,”
Foles said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
