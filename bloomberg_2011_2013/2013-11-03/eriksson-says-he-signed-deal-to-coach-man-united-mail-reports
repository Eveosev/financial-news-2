Former England soccer manager Sven-Goran Eriksson said he signed a contract to succeed  Alex Ferguson  at  Manchester United  in 2002, the Mail on Sunday
reported, citing the Swede’s new autobiography.  Ferguson, who retired earlier this year, originally planned
to do so 11 years ago before changing his mind. Eriksson was
still the England manager at the time.  “I knew it would be tricky,” Eriksson was cited as saying
in his book. “I had a contract with England until the 2006
 World Cup  and I would be severely criticized if I broke that
contract. But this was an opportunity to manage Manchester
United, probably the biggest club in the world.”  Eriksson said he signed the contract with United only to
learn later that Ferguson had reversed his decision to retire.  He also said that he clashed with Ferguson over his
decision to take United striker  Wayne Rooney  to the 2006 World
Cup in Germany when he was recovering from injury.  A Manchester United spokesman didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment on Eriksson’s statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
