Geoffrey Mutai and Priscah Jeptoo of
 Kenya  won the New York City Marathon, a race canceled a year ago
by  Hurricane Sandy  and then buffeted by security worries after
fatal finish-line bombings in Boston.  Mutai, who set a course record in winning the last edition
two years ago, won today’s 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race in a
time of two hours, eight minutes, 24 seconds. Jeptoo, 29, won
the women’s race in 2:25:07.  “It was a very tough race,” Mutai, 32, said in a
televised interview. “To defend your title is not easy.”  The men’s and women’s champions each received $100,000 from
total  prize mone y of $600,000.  Mutai won the 2011 edition in 2:05:06 and that year also
ran the fastest time ever to win the 115th  Boston  Marathon in
2:03:02, besting Haile Gebrselassie’s run of 2:03:59 in Berlin
in 2008. It didn’t qualify as a world record because the Boston
course is considered too straight and has too many downhill
sections.  Mutai broke free from a group of nine runners with about
four miles remaining today and finished 52 seconds ahead of
Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede, while Lusapho April of  South Africa 
was third in a time of 2:09:45.  Jeptoo Kicks  In the women’s race, Jeptoo trailed Buzunesh Deba, an
Ethiopian, by almost 3 1/2 minutes after 13 miles and had erased
the deficit with about two miles remaining. Deba, a Bronx
resident, finished second in 2:25:56 and Jelena Prokopcuka from
 Latvia  was third in 2:27:47.  “I started to push the pace,” Jeptoo told reporters. “I
was having confidence that I will make it.”  The New York race was canceled last year amid criticism
after at least 41 people died and 4.8 million in the region lost
power because of Sandy, the strongest Atlantic storm on record,
which came ashore on Oct. 29.  City officials and the New York Road Runners, which stages
the race that it says pumps $340 million into the city’s
economy, had planned to continue with the event as scheduled on
Nov. 4, even as critics said emergency resources were being
diverted to the marathon from rescue and recovery efforts.  On Nov. 2, 2012, New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said the
marathon would go on because “there are an awful lot of small
businesses that depend on these people.”  The objections continued, particularly after the New York
Post published a photo of  portable emergency power generators 
being used for a Central Park marathon tent as city residents
went without electricity. Bloomberg, who is founder and majority
owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, said later that day
that the race was off.  Record Entry  About 47,000 people had registered for 2012, including
about 20,000 from overseas, according to the NYRR, and some
complained about the cancellation after committing time and
money to be there. About 21,000 entrants from the 2012 field
returned for the race this year, with a record 50,740 runners
beginning the race in temperatures of about 48 degrees
Fahrenheit 9 Celsius).  Along with trying to recover from a public-relations
nightmare, NYRR staged today’s race seven months after three
people died and more than 260 were injured in dual bombings near
the finish line of the Boston Marathon.  Increased Security  Mary Wittenberg, chief executive officer of NYRR, spent
part of the Boston Marathon in bleachers near the finish line on
Boylston Street. She said in an interview that she was on a
train to  New York  when she learned of the bombings, which
occurred about three hours after the winners had finished. NYRR
had 22 employees at the race, none of whom were injured.  NYRR honored the victims of the Boston bombings throughout
today’s race, giving each entrant a blue and yellow ribbon, the
colors of the  Boston Athletic Association .  NYRR said it spent about an additional $1 million on this
year’s race, half toward increased security and half to increase
cancellation insurance. It said it also incurred a $4 million
deficit in fiscal 2013, which included the 2012 marathon, with
costs including refunds to runners and a $1 million donation to
Sandy relief efforts.  On the New York course this year, runners had visual cues
in case of an emergency. Using a plan instituted at the Chicago
Marathon after a runner’s heat-related death in 2007, New York
runners could see colored-coded flags at each fluid station
along the course: green signaled conditions were good, yellow to
use caution, red to convey extreme caution and black that the
race is over.  Wheelchair Record  In the wheelchair division,  University of Illinois  senior
Tatyana McFadden of the U.S. won in 1:59:13 to become the first
athlete to win the New York, Boston,  London  and Chicago
marathons in the same year. Marcel Hug of  Switzerland  won the
men’s wheelchair event in 1:40:14.  After winning the race’s first 13 editions, beginning in
1970, only one American man has crossed the finish line first,
Meb Keflezighi in 2009. Ryan Vail was the top-placed American
today, crossing the line in 13th place in 2:13:23. Kim Smith was
the top American female finisher, in sixth place in 2:28:49.  To contact the reporters on this story:
