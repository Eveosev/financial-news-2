Brooklyn  Nets center-forward Andray
Blatche was fined $15,000 by the National Basketball Association
for making an obscene gesture during his team’s 101-100 win over
the Miami Heat two nights ago.  Blatche’s actions occurred with two minutes, 40 seconds
left in the game on Nov. 1 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn,
according to Rod Thorn, president of the league’s Basketball
Operations.  Blatche, 27, was celebrating a three-point shot by
Brooklyn’s Joe Johnson when he made a gesture of a sexual nature
on the sidelines, ESPN reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
