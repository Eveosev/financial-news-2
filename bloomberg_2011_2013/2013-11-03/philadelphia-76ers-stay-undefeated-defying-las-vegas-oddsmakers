The Philadelphia 76ers continue to
defy the Las Vegas oddsmakers and have extended their National
Basketball Association record to 3-0 with a 107-104 victory over
the Chicago Bulls.  During the preseason, the Las Vegas Hotel’s Super Book
projected a historically bad season for the 76ers by setting the
lowest win total in recent memory, according to assistant
manager  Jeff Sherman .  The 76ers top the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division
after defeating the Bulls,  Washington Wizards  and two-time
defending champion  Miami Heat  this season.  “We understand what everybody has said and written about
us,” Philadelphia coach Brett Brown told reporters. “Our guys
have put in the day-to-day stuff, which has always been our
message. I’m lucky I’ve found a group that enjoys each other’s
company and they enjoy playing together.”  Last night, rookie Michael Carter-Williams had 26 points
and 10 assists, while  Evan Turner  scored 20 points and Spencer Hawes added 18 points and 11 rebounds for the 76ers, who trailed
by as many as 18 points in the second half before surging to win
on their home court at the Wells Fargo Center.  “In this league, no lead is safe,” Bulls coach  Tom Thibodeau  said. “I know you get tired of hearing that. But in
one minute, a team can make up 10 points very quickly.”  The Bulls (1-2) were led by  Carlos Boozer  with 22 points
and 10 rebounds and Luol Deng with 20 points.  In other NBA games last night, it was Indiana 89, Cleveland
74; New Orleans 105, Charlotte 84; Dallas 111, Memphis 99;
Toronto 97, Milwaukee 90; Houston 104, Utah 93; Portland 115,
San Antonio 105; and Golden State 98, Sacramento 87.  To contact the reporter on this story:
