A  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR)  train
derailed about 180 kilometers (111 miles) west of  Alberta â€™s
capital Edmonton today.  Thirteen cars on a train traveling eastbound derailed
around 1 a.m. local time, including 12 loaded with lumber and
one carrying sulfur dioxide, which is considered a dangerous
good, Patrick Waldron, a CN Rail spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  There were no injuries or environmental concerns because
the car carrying sulfur dioxide is upright and not leaking,
Waldron said. CN Rail crews are on site and the cause of the
derailment is being investigated, he said.  The incident follows the explosion of CN Rail cars last
month near Gainford, Alberta, after 13 cars carrying oil and
propane derailed and led to the evacuation of the community for
more than two days. Regulators are scrutinizing the transport of
crude by rail in  Canada  and the U.S. after a train carrying oil
jumped the tracks and exploded in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
