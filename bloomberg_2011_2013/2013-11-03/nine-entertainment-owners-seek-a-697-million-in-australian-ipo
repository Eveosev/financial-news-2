Nine Entertainment Co. and its owners
are seeking as much as A$697.3 million ($660 million) in
 Australia ’s largest initial public offering in almost three
years to repay debt and return funds to existing investors.  Nine will sell 125 million new shares and 179.7 million
existing shares at A$2.05 to A$2.35 apiece, the Sydney-based
company said today in a prospectus published on its website.
Nine, which will have a market capitalization of as much as
A$2.2 billion after the IPO, will raise as much as A$294 million
from the sale of new stock, based on the  price range .  The share sale values Australia’s second-largest media
company at as much as A$2.77 billion including debt, the
prospectus shows. Nine shares will be priced on Dec. 5 and start
trading the next day.  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) ,  Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)  and
other funds took control of Nine last year in a debt-for-equity
swap that saw previous owner CVC Capital Partners Ltd. lose the
majority of its investment. The company, which also owns a
ticketing business and the country’s largest indoor music venue,
in the past two months bought an affiliate station in Western
Australia state and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s 50 percent stake in the
Mi9 joint venture.  Nine forecast sales of A$1.57 billion for the year to June
30, 2014, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of A$305 million, according to the prospectus. The
company estimated profit for the financial year will rise to
A$139.5 million from A$136.7 million in the previous 12 months.  Gyngell Bonus  Oaktree will cut its stake to 14.3 percent from 27.8
percent while Apollo’s holding will be reduced to 22 percent
from 25.6 percent as part of the IPO. Other funds that are among
Nine’s owners will trim their collective holding to 30.2 percent
from 46.5 percent.  Under the restructuring plan agreed last October, about 60
percent of a A$5.75 billion debt and equity investment by CVC
was wiped out. Senior lenders including Apollo and Oaktree
received A$573 million in cash and a 95.5 percent stake in Nine,
according to Federal Court documents in December. London-based
CVC had bought the broadcaster from billionaire James Packer’s
Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd.  Chief Executive Officer David Gyngell will receive a A$2.5
million cash bonus for completing the IPO and 4.55 million
shares, according to the prospectus. The broadcaster will also
issue 4.9 million shares to non-executive directors and another
1.1 million shares to employees. It will have a total of 931
million shares.  Sale Managers  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  and
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia  are among banks leading the share
sale, according to the prospectus.  Los Angeles-based Oaktree, the world’s biggest investor in
distressed debt, in September took control of Australia’s
 Billabong International Ltd. (BBG)  together with Centerbridge Partners
LP after the funds won approval for a plan to refinance the
surfwear maker’s debt.  Apollo, the private-equity firm run by  Leon Black , is on
track to raise $15 billion for a new buyout fund, the largest
since Blackstone Group LP raised $21.7 billion in 2007, people
with knowledge of the matter said Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
