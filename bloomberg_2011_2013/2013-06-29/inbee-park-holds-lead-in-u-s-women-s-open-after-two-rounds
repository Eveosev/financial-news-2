South Korea ’s Inbee Park holds a
two-stroke lead after finishing two rounds at the U.S. Women’s
Open before play was suspended because of heavy fog.  Park, the World No. 1 who started the round one stroke off
the lead, fired a 4-under 68 yesterday to end 36 holes at 9-under 135 at Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton,  New York .  “I gave myself a lot of good opportunities, a very good
ball-striking day,” Park told reporters. “The long putts
seemed to be going well today. I left a couple out there, but
very satisfied with today’s score.”  I.K. Kim is second at 7-under 137, while Lizette Salas is
tied for third place at 4-under 140 after carding an even-par 72
with Jodi Ewart Shadoff, who made it through 15 holes before
play was suspended.  Angela Stanford and Jessica Korda share fifth place at 3-under and So Yeon Ryu and Anna Nordqvist are a stroke behind in
seventh place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
