Pittsburgh Penguins coach Dan Bylsma
was named head coach of the U.S. men’s hockey team for the 2014
Olympic Games in Sochi,  Russia , USA Hockey said on its  website .  Bylsma, 42, has a 201-93-25 record in more than four
seasons with the Penguins. He led the team to the Stanley Cup
championship in 2009 and won the Jack Adams Award as the
National Hockey League’s top coach in 2011.  Pittsburgh had the best record in the NHL’s Eastern
Conference this past season and advanced to the conference
finals before being swept in four games by the Boston Bruins.  “I think as each moment passes, I’m more and more honored
about the opportunity to wear the red, white and blue and to be
the head coach of this hockey team and going over to Russia to
win a gold medal,” Bylsma, a native of Grand Rapids,  Michigan ,
said on the Penguins  website .  The U.S. won the silver medal at the 2010 Vancouver
Olympics, losing the final 3-2 to Canada on an overtime goal
from Pittsburgh’s Sidney Crosby.  To contact the reporter on this story:
