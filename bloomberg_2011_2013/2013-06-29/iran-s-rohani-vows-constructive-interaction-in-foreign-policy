Iranian President-elect Hassan Rohani said he’s committed to his campaign promise to pursue a
constructive foreign policy.  “Moderation in foreign policy doesn’t mean surrender or
conflict; it doesn’t mean passivity or confrontation; but rather
effective and constructive interaction with the world,” Rohani
said today on state television.  Rohani, who had criticized government intervention in
Iranian lives and pledged dialogue with the world, won the
presidency earlier this month with enough backing to avoid a
second-round vote.  The election “answered all the doubts” about the
legitimacy of  Iran ’s political system and was a “turning
point” in the country’s history, Rohani said today. “The
people chose a new path in this election and said we want change
and development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
