Poland ’s ruling  Civic Platform  party
backed a plan to start picking its chairman in direct elections
to combat an erosion in voter support.  Civic Platform agreed to amend its bylaws at its national
convention in Chorzow, Poland, today to allow all 43,000 members
to elect their leader, according to its website. Prior to the
decision, only regional representatives could pick the party’s
leadership.  Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has headed Civic Platform
since 2003 and whose term ends next year, said on May 24 that
early elections would “end internal campaigning within the
party and focus on the country’s problems.”  Approval ratings for Civic Platform last month dropped
behind those of the opposition party Law & Justice in CBOS polls
for the first time since September 2007. The gap widened further
this month as Civic Platform trailed its main opponent 23
percent to 27 percent.  Tusk, who is seeking reappointment as party chairman, will
compete against Jaroslaw Gowin, a former justice minister.  Civic Platform members will choose their leader in the next
two months and the result will be announced in late August. The
party has 206 deputies in the 460-seat lower chamber of
parliament and runs a majority government with the Peasant’s
Party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
