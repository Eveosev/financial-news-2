Egyptians massed by the tens of thousands to demand President Mohamed Mursi’s ouster while the Islamist leader’s backers gathered at a dueling rally, stoking fears of a conflagration of violence after days of deadly clashes.  In scenes reminiscent of the uprising that ousted  Hosni Mubarak  in 2011, thousands streamed into Cairo’s  Tahrir Square  and elsewhere across Egypt, saying they were determined to reclaim control of a revolution whose goals have been trampled to cement the power of Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood supporters. Fueling the anguish are economic woes that have sent Egypt’s growth plummeting to one of its lowest points in two decades.  Ihab Fahmy, a presidential spokesman, urged protesters to remain peaceful to avoid civil strife at a news conference. “The right to peaceful protest is guaranteed to all, but violence, killing and sabotage are highly condemned,” he said. “The state won’t treat law-breaking lightly.”  The demonstrations, on the first anniversary of Mursi’s election, may be the biggest challenge the president has faced. The military warned last week it would not let the polarized nation descend into chaos. At least eight people, including an American student, died in clashes between Mursi backers and opponents in the run-up to today’s rallies. One person was killed and 37 were wounded in an attack on anti-Mursi supporters in the city of Beni Suef, south of Cairo, state-run Middle Eastern News Agency said today. Three people died and eight were injured in clashes near the Freedom and Justice Party’s office in Assiut city, also south of the capital, the state-run Ahram Gate reported.  Markets Roil  In Cairo’s Moqattam neighbourhood, about 500 protesters attacked the  Muslim Brotherhood  headquarters with Molotov cocktails and set fire to the building, MENA reported. Police on site joined the assault, Gehad El-Haddad, a senior spokesperson for the Brotherhood, said on his Twitter account.  A total of 253 injuries were recorded today during clashes in seven governorates, according to the Ministry of Health.  The National Salvation Front, the main opposition bloc, called for protests to continue until the “fall of the last stronghold” of the Muslim Brotherhood. It also said Egyptians should strike and Mursi should leave.  Egypt’s financial markets are reflecting the ferment. The benchmark EGX 30 stocks index slumped 13 percent in June. The country’s default risk soared to a record 888 basis points last week, putting  Egypt  among the 10 biggest credit risks in the world, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The EGX 30 added 1.4 percent today, though the 148 million Egyptian pounds ($21 million) of shares traded equaled only 38 percent of the market’s one-year daily average, according to data complied by Bloomberg.  Demands Not Met  “None of the demands of the 2011 revolution have been met -- no social justice, no freedom, nothing,” Nagwa Adel, a 31-year-old protester wearing a T-shirt with an Egyptian flag, said in Tahrir. “I know there can be violence, the Muslim Brotherhood are violent people and Mursi is clinging to power and they won’t just leave power so simply, but we’re determined and we know there’s a price to be paid.”  Chants of “Down with the Murshid’s Rule,” a reference to the Brotherhood’s top official, morphed into cheers as two military helicopters flew overhead.  The protests, marred by clashes today between the opposing camps in Gharbiya province, cap weeks of surging anger amid an economic crisis that has sent unemployment soaring beyond 13 percent and foreign reserves dropping more than half since the uprising. Fuel shortages have sparked long lines and short tempers at gas stations.  Mursi Opponents  As Mursi’s opponents -- an amalgam of secularists, youth activists, former regime supporters and Egyptians frustrated with the stumbling economy -- converged in Tahrir and elsewhere in the country, Mursi’s supporters geared up for another show of force in the capital’s Nasr City district. They have been emphasizing that the 61-year-old president won a democratic election and any change must come through the ballot box.  “I’m here to say that he was elected and should serve a four-year term,” said Tarek Siyam, 51. “There is no legal or constitutional basis against this.”  Mursi has adopted that theme repeatedly to reject calls for an early presidential vote.  If Egypt were to replace someone elected “according to constitutional legitimacy -- well, there will be people or opponents opposing the new president too, and a week or a month later, they will ask him to step down,” he told Britain’s Guardian newspaper in an interview published today.  Mursi’s opponents, who have spurned his call for dialog, accuse Islamists of seeking to consolidate their power while failing to address Egyptians’ daily grievances.  “We want to return our revolution to the course it should have moved along,”  Mohamed ElBaradei , a Nobel peace laureate and a leading figure in the NSF, said in a video statement late yesterday. “We all feel we’re moving along a blocked road and the country will fall.”  22 Million Signatures  The opposition has been encouraged by the 22 million signatures the Tamarud, or Rebel, campaign maintains it has collected demanding Mursi’s ouster. His critics have also taken comfort in the defense minister’s warning last week to protect Egypt from chaos, interpreting that to mean the army would back the protesters against any violence. Mursi told the Guardian he was “very” confident the military would not intervene.  The tensions in Egypt resonated abroad, with U.S. President  Barack Obama  saying yesterday he’s monitoring the protests “with concern” and his “most immediate” priority is making sure U.S. embassies and consulates are protected. A U.S. citizen,  Kenyon College (78085MF)  student Andrew Pochter, was among at least three people killed in Alexandria June 28. In Gharbiya today, two people were injured.  The U.S. military put Marines stationed in southern  Europe  on alert in case the violence in Egypt intensifies and imperils American citizens,  CNN  reported, citing unidentified U.S. officials.  ‘For All’  Although Mursi casts himself as a president ’’for all’’ Egyptians, his detractors dismiss that as a hollow pledge.  Support for the president among Egyptians plummeted to 28 percent, compared with 57 percent when he took office, according to a poll by Washington-based Zogby Research Services released June 17. More than 90 percent said they have confidence in the army, more than any other institution. The military governed Egypt between Mubarak’s ouster and Mursi’s election, and many accused it of mismanaging the nation.  The president and his supporters blame the nation’s plight on near-daily protests and the opposition’s rejection of dialog. He re-extended the offer last week and was snubbed.  “If Mursi made mistakes then we should hold him to account,” Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Egyptian cleric with ties to the Brotherhood, said in a televised address. But if ’’we waited on Mubarak for 30 years, and waited another 30 years before that on the oppressors, why can’t we be patient with Mursi?’’  Mursi’s detractors says overtures came too late. “A year ago this man came with a mandate,” said Wael Khalil, a political activist who voted for Mursi. “When you fail miserably, you have to be confronted. Not a single thing was achieved. It’s too much.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Tarek El-Tablawy in Cairo at  teltablawy@bloomberg.net ; Salma El Wardany in Cairo at  selwardany@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew J.
