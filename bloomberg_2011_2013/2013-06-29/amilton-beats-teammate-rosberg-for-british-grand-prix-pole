Lewis Hamilton  beat Mercedes
teammate  Nico Rosberg  in qualifying for tomorrow’s British Grand
Prix, taking his second pole position of the Formula One season.  Hamilton posted a time of 1 minute, 29.607 seconds around
the Silverstone circuit near Milton Keynes, England, to defeat
Rosberg by  0.446 seconds . The Briton also started from the front
in China in April, where he finished third.  Hamilton is seeking to win his home Grand Prix for the
second time, having previously done so during his world
championship season of 2008.  Defending series champion Sebastian Vettel was third ahead
of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. Force India’s Paul di Resta,
STR’s Daniel Ricciardo, Force India’s Adrian Sutil, Lotus
teammates  Romain Grosjean  and Kimi Raikkonen and Ferrari’s
Fernando Alonso rounded out the top-10 qualifiers.  Di Resta was later excluded from qualifying after his car
was found to be underweight in the post-session check. He’ll now
start from the back of the grid, or Force India could opt for
him to start from the pit lane if changes are made to the car,
according to the Formula One website.  Vettel tops the standings with 132 points after seven of 19
races. Alonso is second with 96 points, followed by Raikkonen
with 88 and Hamilton with 77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
