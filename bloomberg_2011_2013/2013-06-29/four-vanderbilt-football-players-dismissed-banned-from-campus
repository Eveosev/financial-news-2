Four Vanderbilt University football
players were dismissed for violation of team rules and suspended
from the Nashville, Tennessee, campus, the school said
yesterday.  The action was taken after the university reported an
incident to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. Police
are investigating a sex crime, the Nashville Tennessean
reported, citing police spokesman Don Aaron.  The four players weren’t identified by the school, which
provided no details of the event.  “The well-being of our students is of paramount concern to
us, and we will not tolerate any actions that threaten student
safety and security,” said Beth Fortune, vice chancellor for
public affairs, in a statement on the school’s website.  Under terms of the interim suspension, the players are
banned from campus unless they receive permission to visit from
the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity.  The school reported an incident that occurred at a
Vanderbilt dormitory on June 26 and is under investigation by
the police department’s sex crimes unit, Aaron said, according
to the Nashville newspaper.  The police spokesman couldn’t be reached yesterday by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
