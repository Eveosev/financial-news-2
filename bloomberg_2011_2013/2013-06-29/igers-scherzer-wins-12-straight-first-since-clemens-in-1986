The Detroit Tigers’ Max Scherzer has
won 12 straight decisions since the start of the season, the
first pitcher to accomplish the feat since the Boston Red Sox’s
Roger Clemens in 1986.  The Tigers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 6-3 last night on
Scherzer’s pitching along with two home runs by Miguel Cabrera
and a third by Prince Fielder at Tropicana Field in St.
Petersburg,  Florida .  Scherzer allowed three runs on four hits, walked one and
struck out nine in seven innings. He is the first in Major
League Baseball to start the season with at least 12 straight
victories since Clemens, who went on to 14-0.  “It’s really nice to be 12-0,” Scherzer told reporters.
“I’m pitching well, but the reason I’m 12-0 is because of my
offense. You got to see firsthand today the best player in the
game hitting two home runs on three pitches and going 4 for 4.
And Prince hits a bomb. It’s the offense that set me up.”  The Tigers (43-35) lead the American League Central, 2 ½
games ahead of the Cleveland Indians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
