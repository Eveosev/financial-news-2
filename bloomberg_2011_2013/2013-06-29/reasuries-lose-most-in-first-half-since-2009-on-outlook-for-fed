Treasuries lost the most this year
since 2009 as investors fled  U.S. debt  after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled the world’s biggest economy may be strong enough to
allow the central bank to reduce its bond buying this year.  U.S. bonds fell for a third quarter, the longest losing
streak since 1999, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show. Ten-year note  yields  touched 2.66 percent this week, the highest
since August 2011, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June
19 policy makers may begin slowing purchases under quantitative
 easing  this year and end them in mid-2014. The  jobless rate  fell
in June to match the lowest since 2008, data next week may show.  “The move higher in rates is all about central-bank
action,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in  New York  of
government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “The move
looks to be overdone given the economy, but the Fed has
dominated the market with asset purchases. And if they are ready
to start pulling back, investors don’t want to be the last ones
out the door.”  Treasuries slid 2.57 percent this year through June 27, a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index showed. It was the biggest
drop since the first half of 2009.  U.S. government debt  fell
2.32 percent in the second quarter, after losing 0.3 percent
from January through March and slipping 0.1 percent in fourth-quarter 2012, Merrill Lynch indexes showed. It was the longest
stretch since the three quarters ended in June 1999.  Since 2003  Ten-year (USGG10YR)  note yields climbed the most in almost a decade
over the two past months, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices, surging 46 basis points, or 0.46 percentage point, in
May and 36 basis points in June. The 83 basis-point jump was the
biggest since the 95 basis-point increase in July and August
2003. The yields declined five basis points last week to 2.49
percent. The price of the 1.75 percent securities due in May
2023 gained 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 19/32.  The benchmark yields advanced from a 2013 intraday low of
1.61 percent on May 1 as bets rose that the Fed would reduce the
bond-buying it announced in December to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs, spur economic growth and combat unemployment.  The Fed purchases $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
bonds every month in the program, the third round of purchases
in its stimulus effort. Policy makers have also kept its
benchmark  interest-rate  target at zero to 0.25 percent since
2008 to support the economy.  Bernanke, in response to questions from lawmakers after
congressional testimony on May 22, said policy makers could cut
the pace of buying if the U.S. employment outlook showed a
sustainable improvement. He also said tightening policy too soon
would endanger the recovery.  Reduction Timetable  Treasury yields surged after the Fed chief said last week
following a two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting that
the purchases may begin to be tapered this year. Reductions
would depend on the economy achieving the central bank’s
objectives, he said. Policy makers projected growth of as much
as 2.6 percent in 2013 and 3.5 percent next year.  An interest-rate increase is “far in the future,” he said.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility MOVE Index climbed to 110.98 on June 24, the
highest level since November 2011. It slipped to 97.13 on June
27, still above the 62.9 average over the past year.  Yields dropped June 27 as Federal Reserve officials said
investors may have overreacted. New York Fed Bank President
William C. Dudley said policy makers may prolong the purchases.  Unintended Reaction  “It seems like the Fed did not intend for the market to
react the way it did about their plans for tapering,”  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams
Capital Group LP, a brokerage for institutional investors, said
that day. “You have yields flirting with two-year highs.”  U.S. employers added 165,000 jobs in June, after payrolls
swelled by 175,000 in May, and the unemployment  rate  fell to 7.5
percent, from 7.6 percent, economists in Bloomberg surveys
forecast before Labor Department data due July 5. The jobless
rate was 7.5 percent in April before rising in May.  “You’re starting to see some data that represents the view
the Fed has in their forecasts,” said Jason Rogan, director of
U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “If you continue
to see strong economic data, the assumption is that the Fed will
be closer to tapering.”  Reports this week showed durable-goods orders rose in May
and the Standard & Poor’s/Case Shiller index of property values
gained in April, while the  U.S. economy  grew 1.8 percent in the
first quarter, less than the 2.4 percent previously estimated.  ‘Data-Dependent’  “While the Fed debate continues to be influenced by
headlines from a variety of Fed speakers, the takeaway at this
point is that we are in a largely data-dependent mode with more
than a couple of months of inputs to come before it’s clear
whether tapering will begin,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  The Treasury Department sold $99 billion of notes this
week: $35 billion of two-year debt, an equal amount of five-year
securities and $29 billion of seven-year notes.  A measure of demand at U.S. debt auctions has fallen this
year to the lowest since 2009 amid the drop in bond prices.
Investors bid $2.94 for each $1 of the $1.077 billion of notes
and bonds sold by the Treasury this year, compared with a record
high bid-to-cover of $3.15 last year. It’s the first decline in
demand at the auctions since 2008, when the U.S. government
increased note and bond offerings 59 percent to $922 billion as
the recession and the financial crisis deepened.  The bid-to-cover was 2.84 in the second quarter on $539
billion of notes and bonds sold and 3.03 in the first quarter on
$538 billion of Treasuries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
