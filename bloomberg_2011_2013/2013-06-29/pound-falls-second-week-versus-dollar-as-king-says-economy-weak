The pound dropped for a second week
against the dollar as  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said
the economy was “too weak to be satisfactory,” underpinning
bets the central bank will keep monetary policy loose.  Sterling had its biggest weekly decline versus the euro in
a month as central bank policy maker  David Miles  renewed his
call for additional asset purchases that tend to devalue a
currency. U.S. policy makers this week also sought to ease
concern they are moving toward ending quantitative easing. U.K.
government bonds fell this week, pushing yields to the highest
since October 2011.  “Central bankers have been trying to calm markets after a
fairly volatile period,” said Kasper Kirkegaard, a senior
foreign-exchange analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “It
will be difficult for the market to price in expectations of
tighter policy in the U.K., which means that there should be
some downside risks for sterling against the dollar.”  The pound dropped 1.5 percent this week to $1.5187 as of
5:19 p.m.  London  time yesterday after sliding to $1.5166, the
lowest since May 31. The U.K. currency declined 0.6 percent to
85.61 pence per euro, the biggest weekly loss since the period
ended May 24.  Sterling will weaken to $1.46 in the next six months,
Danske Bank’s Kirkegaard predicted. The currency last traded at
that level in June 2010.  ‘Too Weak’  “There is a recovery, but my view is that it’s not
sufficiently rapid enough,” King, who will be replaced by
former Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  on July 1, told
lawmakers at the Treasury Select Committee in London on June 25.
“It’s too weak to be satisfactory.”  Miles told a conference in London the following day that
monetary policy needed to provide further support and a “slight
expansion” of the quantitative-easing program would be helpful.  Policy makers will maintain the asset-purchase  target  at
375 billion pounds and keep the benchmark  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent at Carney’s first meeting on July 3-4,
according to Bloomberg surveys of economists.  We expect Carney “will eventually incorporate more
 interest-rate  guidance into his policy making,” strategists led
by  Hans Redeker , head of global foreign-exchange strategy at
Morgan Stanley in London, wrote in a note to clients yesterday.
“With policy rates already very low, this gives the BOE an
additional tool for sending a dovish signal, and could weigh on
the pound.”  Sterling has weakened 1.1 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-market currencies. The dollar was the best performer, rising 6.6
percent, and the euro strengthened 4.9 percent.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield climbed three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, this week to 2.44 percent
after rising to 2.59 percent on June 24, the highest since Oct.
31, 2011. The 1.75 percent security due in September 2022 fell
0.21, or 2.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.33.  U.K. government securities handed investors a loss of 3.4
percent this year through June 27, according to Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 1.7 percent and Treasuries
declined 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
