A case of Chateau Petrus 1982
Pomerol fetched 40,950 euros ($53,300) at a Christie’s
International Plc sale in Paris amid demand for rare  Bordeaux 
and Burgundy wines, matching the auction house’s estimate.  A 12-bottle lot from the 2005 vintage of neighboring
Chateau Le Pin sold for 18,720 euros, while a case of Domaine de
la Romanee-Conti 1966 La Tache Burgundy fetched 25,740 euros,
according to results posted on Christie’s website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux vintages has
risen 5 percent this year, with a 3 percent decline since mid-March following a gain of 8 percent in the previous 10 weeks.
Price cuts on Bordeaux 2012 futures over the past three months
have weighed on the broader wine market.  The Bordeaux sales campaign “has been a factor in the
weaker indices,”  Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine
Investment Fund in London, said in his latest monthly market
report. “Merchants this year anticipated the lower levels of en
primeur business compared to previous years and focused on other
wines.” The fund, invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  The average price for Petrus 1982 at auctions last month
was $67,800, down from $71,000 at the end of last year,
according to data compiled by London-based Liv-ex on its Cellar
Watch website. A case fetched as much as $86,500, including
fees, at Christie’s in  Hong Kong  on May 25.  A half-case of Echezeaux 1989 Cote de Nuits Grand Cru from
producer Henri Jayer and a magnum of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
1945 each sold for 18,720 euros, within their estimated ranges.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
