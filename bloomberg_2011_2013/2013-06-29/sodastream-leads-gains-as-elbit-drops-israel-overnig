SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA)  posted
a record quarterly rally, leading Israeli companies’ gains in
New York, while a three-day drop in  Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT)  left it
at the biggest discount to the Tel Aviv stock since June 10.  Shares of SodaStream, a maker of home soda machines, surged
46 percent in the second quarter to $72.65 on sales prospects
and speculation the company might be a takeover target, while
the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index rose 0.9 percent. The
measure added 1.1 percent last week as  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) 
and  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  jumped. Elbit, an Israeli defense
developer, slumped to $42.07.  All eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg with a price
estimate for SodaStream raised their  forecasts  during the
quarter to an average of $78.63, which implies an 8.2 percent
jump from current levels. The Airport City, Israel-based company
has beaten analysts’ sales projections for eight straight
quarters, and the shares jumped to the highest in almost two
years on June 6 after reports in Israeli media that Coca-Cola
Co. or PepsiCo. Inc. were interested in buying SodaStream.  “It is an attractive asset,” Jim Chartier, an analyst at
Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. in  New York , who has a buy
recommendation on the stock, said in a telephone interview. “At
some point, SodaStream could be viewed as a takeout. The
company’s consistently beaten expectations.”  PepsiCo denied a report on business website Calcalist that
it’s in talks to buy SodaStream for more than $2 billion. Coca-Cola declined to comment on a report from newspaper Globes that
it may bid for the company.  The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge advanced to 91.21 last week.
Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  regained 0.2 percent at 9:56 a.m.
in Tel Aviv after it last week dropped 1.8 percent to the lowest
level since Jan. 31.  SodaStream, Allot  SodaStream rose 2.3 percent last week, after rallying for
four straight days.  Allot, which makes technology used to track wireless
traffic, surged 15 percent for the week to $13.71, or 0.1
percent below its  Tel Aviv  shares. The Hod Hasharon, Israel-based company said June 25 that it got orders from three of the
world’s top-10 telecommunications operators. The Tel Aviv shares
closed the gap this morning, slipping 0.3 percent to 49.8
shekels, or $13.69.  Mellanox, an Israeli maker of equipment that speeds data
transfers, gained 9.5 percent to $49.50 last week. The stock

three-month period ending Dec. 31, 2008. Its Tel Aviv shares
jumped 5.2 percent for the week to 179.60 shekels, or $49.37.  Elbit led the weekly declines in the Bloomberg Israel-US

high on June 13. The stock in  Israel  dropped 0.6 percent to
