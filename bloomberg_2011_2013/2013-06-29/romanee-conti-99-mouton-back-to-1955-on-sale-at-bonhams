Three bottles of Romanee-Conti 1999
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti carry a top estimate of 28,000
pounds ($42,700) at a Bonhams  London  sale alongside 30 vintages
of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild spanning years back to 1955.  A second three-bottle lot of Romanee-Conti from 1989 is
also included in the sale on July 11 with a top estimate of
18,000 pounds, while a case of Mouton 2005 is priced to fetch as
much as 4,000 pounds, according to a Bonhams statement. A two-bottle lot of Mouton 1959 has an upper estimate of 3,200 pounds.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux vintages has
risen 5 percent this year, with a 3 percent decline since mid-March following a gain of 8 percent in the previous 10 weeks.
Price cuts on Bordeaux 2012 futures over the past two months
have weighed on the broader wine market.  Mouton has been “the strongest of the first growths this
year,”  Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment
Fund in London, said in his latest monthly market report. The
fund, invested in Bordeaux, has about $50 million under
management.  A single bottle of Echezeaux 1985 Henri & Georges Jayer
Burgundy carries a top estimate of 3,000 pounds while four
vintages of Vouvray Moelleux Domaine Huet Cuvee Constance from
the Loire are on sale, with a case of 1989 priced at as much as
1,500 pounds.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
