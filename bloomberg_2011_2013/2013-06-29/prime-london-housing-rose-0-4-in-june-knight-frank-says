Prime central  London  property prices
increased in June and are almost 60 percent higher than the
market low in 2009, according to real-estate broker Knight Frank
LLP.  Residential prices rose by 0.4 percent this month and have
appreciated 3.7 percent so far in 2013, according to data
compiled by the London-based firm. The strongest price growth is
in the bracket below 1 million pounds ($1.5 million), where
prices are up by 6.6 percent in 2013.  The market for luxury homes in London is cooling at a time
when prices for less-expensive properties are picking up, helped
by a credit-boosting program by the  Bank of England  and the U.K.
Treasury. While demand for prime real estate remains strong,
higher taxes in that segment have been relatively beneficial for
lower-priced property, Knight Frank said.  “The higher stamp duty charge for two-million-pound-plus
properties, introduced at last year’s budget, remains a key
driver behind stronger growth from the lower price brackets,”
 Liam Bailey , global head of residential research at Knight
Frank, said in the report.  Over the past 12 months, price growth in prime central
London has totalled 6.9 percent. Prime central London rents fell
by 0.1 percent in June and 0.4 percent in the first half. They
stand 22 percent higher than in the second quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
