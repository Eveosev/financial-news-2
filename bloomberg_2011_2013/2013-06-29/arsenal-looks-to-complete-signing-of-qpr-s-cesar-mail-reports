Arsenal will look to complete the
signing of Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Julio Cesar after
tomorrow’s Confederations Cup final, the  Daily Mail  said.  Though negotiations were put on hold due to Cesar’s
commitment to the Brazil national team, the Gunners want to wrap
up a deal after Roma joined the race for the goalkeeper, the
newspaper said.  Financial issues could also be a stumbling block in
Arsenal’s pursuit of Swansea defender Ashley Williams and
Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini, the Mail said. The Gunners
are balking at Fellaini’s 24 million-pound ($37 million) release
clause and his 100,000 pounds-per-week salary demand, along with
Swansea’s 10 million-pound asking price for Williams, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
