McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton topped
qualifying for today’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to claim his sixth
pole position of the season and 25th of his career.  Hamilton posted a time of 1 minute, 40.630 seconds around
the Yas Marina circuit yesterday, 0.35 seconds faster than Red
Bull’s Mark Webber. Series leader Christian Vettel of Red Bull
qualified third, but later received a penalty for a fuel
irregularity which dropped in to the back of the grid.  Williams’s Pastor Maldonado, Lotus’s Kimi Raikkonen,
McLaren’s Jenson Button, Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso , Mercedes’s
Nico Rosberg, Ferrari’s  Felipe Massa  and Lotus’s Romain Grosjean
rounded out the top-10 qualifiers.  Two-time defending world champion Vettel has won the past
four races to take a 13-point lead over Alonso in the standings.
Tomorrow’s race is the 18th of 20 on the season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
