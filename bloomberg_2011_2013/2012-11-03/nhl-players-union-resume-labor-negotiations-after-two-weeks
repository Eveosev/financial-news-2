The  National Hockey League  and its
players’ union will resume talks on a collective bargaining
agreement after more than two weeks off.  NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and players’ union
special counsel Steve Fehr will meet today, league spokesman
John Dellapina said in an e-mail, without providing any further
information. The two sides last met on Oct. 18.  The league locked out its players on Sept. 16, the day
after the old collective bargaining agreement expired. A total
of 327 regular-season games through Nov. 30 have been canceled
so far, including the annual outdoor Winter Classic. That game,
between the  Detroit Red Wings  and the  Toronto Maple Leafs  and
scheduled for Jan. 1 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, was
called off yesterday.  The league’s most recent contract offer contained an even
revenue split between owners and players. None of the union’s
three counteroffers was accepted by owners.  The season was scheduled to begin Oct. 11. NHL Commissioner
Gary Bettman said last month it needed to start yesterday in
order for each team to play all 82 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
