China ’s Communist Party put Li Zhanshu in charge of supervising agencies that directly answer
to the central leadership ahead of the country’s power handover
this month.  Li replaces Ling Jihua as secretary of the body overseeing
departments under the party’s  Central Committee , according to a
 statement  posted on the  website  of the committee on Nov. 1.  Xi Jinping, China’s vice president who is forecast to
succeed  Hu Jintao  as Communist Party general secretary at the
party Congress that begins Nov. 8, has tasked Li’s work
committee with five priorities, including stepping up efforts to
fight corruption, according to the statement.  The committee met Oct. 23 to announce the appointment,
which came two months after Li took over from Ling as the head
of the party’s general office, the party said in the statement.  Local media, including Caixin magazine, reported the
personnel change today. It has been party tradition since 1985
that the head of the general office, which oversees security for
top leaders, also leads the work committee, Caixin reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Aipeng Soo in
