French President  Francois Hollande 
shouldn’t seek to create an economic “shock” with his effort
to improve competitiveness in the country, former  Renault SA (RNO) 
Chief Executive Officer  Louis Schweitzer  said.  “I don’t believe in a shock, I’d rather see gradual
action,” Schweitzer said today on  Europe  1 radio. Cutting
payroll taxes by between 20 billion euros ($25 billion) and 30
billion euros isn’t a “miracle response” to France’s
situation, he said.  The remarks lend support to Hollande as he seeks the
support of both unions and executives for an overhaul of the
French economy intended to reverse a surge in unemployment in
the wake of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  With growth stalled for three quarters and companies
including PSA Peugeot Citroen SA, Alcatel-Lucent and drug-maker
Sanofi cutting thousands of jobs, some executives have called
for Hollande to slash payroll taxes to reduce labor costs and
make French industry more competitive.  Cutting charges has to be “one element of a global policy
that needs to be implemented over time,” Schweitzer said. This
economy is very difficult and companies are “nervous,” he
said. “What’s needed is continuous dialog.”  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault will receive a report on
competitiveness from  Louis Gallois , former head of European
Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., on Nov. 5 and set out the
government’s plans the following day. Hollande has also asked
unions and companies to agree on a plan to increase labor
flexibility by year end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
