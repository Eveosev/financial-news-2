Mission West Properties Inc. (MSW) , a
California real estate investment trust that put itself up for
sale in December, agreed to sell certain property assets to a
venture of closely held DivcoWest and TPG Real Estate.  The joint venture will pay about $400 million in cash and
assume $398 million of debt and other obligations, Cupertino,
California-based Mission West said in a statement. Some of the
companyâ€™s operating partnerships will retain other assets and
liabilities with an approximate net value of $525 million.  Mission West said it plans to liquidate after it completes
these transactions by year-end. The company said shareholders
and owners of operating partnership units that choose to redeem
their stakes will receive a distribution of $9.20 to $9.28 a
share in cash, though the final amount might be less. The
distribution estimate includes the sales proceeds and the final
2012 dividend.  Mission West owns and manages 101 research and development
properties, most in Silicon Valley, totaling about 7.6 million
rentable square feet (706,000 square meters). The company began
exploring a sale late last year to take advantage of growing
investor interest in commercial real estate.  DivcoWest is a San Francisco-based real estate investment
firm founded in 1993. TPG Real Estate is a unit of the TPG
Capital private equity firm started by  David Bonderman  and  James Coulter .  To contact the reporter on this story:
