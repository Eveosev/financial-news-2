Colombian consumer prices rose
0.16 percent in October, the national statistics agency said.  Annual inflation was 3.06 percent, according to the report
posted on the agencyâ€™s website today. The median forecast of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.16 percent rise on
the month and a 3.06 percent increase from a year ago.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said this week the
Colombian economy will grow 4.8% this year and that long-term
inflation expectations are around the 3 percent target. Colombia
targets inflation of 3 percent, plus or minus one percentage
point.  The central bank held the benchmark  interest rate  at 4.75
percent at its October meeting, after policy makers judged that
bond-buying plans by the U.S. Federal Reserve and  European
Central Bank  will ease the risk of a global slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
