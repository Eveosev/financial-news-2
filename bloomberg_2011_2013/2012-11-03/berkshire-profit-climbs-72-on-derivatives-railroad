Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  said profit climbed 72 percent in the third quarter on
better results from its derivatives book and higher earnings at
railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe.  Net income  rose to $3.92 billion, or $2,373 a share, from
$2.28 billion, or $1,380, a year earlier, the Omaha, Nebraska-
based company said yesterday in a statement. Operating earnings,
which exclude some investment results, were $2,057 a share,
missing the $2,063 average  estimate  of three analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Buffett, 82, made the equity-derivatives bets in the last
decade to wager on long-term gains in stock-market indexes in
the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan . When the benchmarks fall, as they
did in last year’s third quarter, Berkshire’s liabilities on the
contracts can climb, pressuring earnings.  “The stock market has had a pretty good run year to
date,”  Cliff Gallant , an analyst at KBW Inc., said in an
interview before earnings were released. “I don’t know if I’d
count on it to continue.”  Berkshire’s  Class A shares  fell less than 1 percent to
$130,550 yesterday. The company has advanced 14 percent this
year, compared with the 12 percent gain in the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. (SPX)   Book Value  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, climbed
15 percent to $111,718 a share from a year earlier, the biggest
gain since 2010. Buffett highlights the metric on the first page
of his annual report and has said that it’s the best available
indicator of the company’s intrinsic value.  The loss on equity index put derivatives narrowed to $534
million from $2.09 billion a year earlier. Gains from credit-
default contracts, in which Buffett bets on the ability of
borrowers to repay debt, were $316 million compared with a loss
of $247 million a year earlier.  Buffett completed his biggest takeover, Burlington
Northern, in 2010 in a $26.5 billion transaction. The business
contributed $937 million to earnings, compared with $766 million
a year earlier on an increase in the volume of shipped consumer
products, coal and agricultural goods.  Berkshire has been making smaller acquisitions this year as
Buffett searches for larger takeovers. The billionaire said he
failed to reach an agreement on a deal valued at about $22
billion earlier this year, while his firm has agreed to buy a
newspaper in Waco, Texas, a building-insulation maker and food-
distributor Meadowbrook Meat Co.  Buffett’s firm agreed to pay about $500 million to buy
Omaha-based party-supply retailer Oriental Trading Co.,
according to a person familiar with the deal who declined to be
identified because the details are private. Berkshire announced
the deal yesterday without disclosing terms.  Berkshire’s Cash  Berkshire’s cash pile rose to $47.8 billion from $40.7
billion three months earlier.  Buffett and his deputies purchased $1.18 billion in
equities and $2.08 billion on bonds in the quarter, and sold
$3.18 billion in stocks and $1.2 billion in fixed-maturity
securities.  The insurance segment posted an underwriting profit of $392
million, compared with $1.09 billion a year earlier, when the
reinsurance group led by Ajit Jain benefitted from a reduction
in estimated liabilities on some contracts written in prior
periods. Underwriting profit at the Geico car insurer climbed to
$435 million from $114 million.  Buffett has used so-called float, or the insurance premiums
Berkshire holds before paying claims, to amass the largest
equity stakes in companies including  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  and
International Business Machines Corp. Berkshire’s stock
portfolio was valued at $88 billion on Sept. 30, up from $86.2
billion at the end of June as Wells Fargo & Co. gained 3.3
percent in the third quarter and IBM advanced 6.1 percent.  MidAmerican Energy  Utility unit MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. added $438
million to Berkshire’s profit, compared with $372 million in
last year’s third quarter. Earnings from manufacturing, service
and  retailing  units increased to $991 million in the three
months ended Sept. 30 from $836 million in the same period in
2011 on gains at manufacturers including Marmon Holdings, the
producer of construction materials.  The group of businesses includes engine-additive maker
Lubrizol, which was acquired by Berkshire at the end of last
year’s third quarter; Marmon; and Fruit of the Loom, which
produces underwear and other clothing. Berkshire doesn’t break
down results by each business.  To contact the reporters on this story:
