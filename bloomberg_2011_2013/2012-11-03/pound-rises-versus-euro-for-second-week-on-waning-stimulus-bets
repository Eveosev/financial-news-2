The pound strengthened against the
euro for a second week, touching a one-month high, as signs of
improvement in the U.K. economy damped expectations for more
monetary stimulus.  Sterling fell for the fifth week in six against the dollar
after a report yesterday showed the  U.S. economy  added more jobs
than expected last month. The  Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy
Committee meets on Nov. 7-8 to decide whether to extend its
asset-purchase program, known as quantitative easing, beyond 375
billion pounds ($601 billion). Gilts were little changed after a
report yesterday showed the  construction industry  unexpectedly
expanded last month.  “We’ve had more supportive news for the U.K. economy from
the U.K. construction survey,” said Audrey Childe-Freeman, head
of foreign-exchange strategy at  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  in London.
“Sterling should continue to benefit against the euro as long
as we see the economy hanging on. The market is not now
expecting more QE next week and that should come as a relief for
sterling.”  The pound rose 0.3 percent in the week to 80.12 pence per
euro at 5 p.m.  London  time yesterday, when it advanced to 79.97
pence, the most since Oct. 3. Sterling fell 0.5 percent to
$1.6031.  QE Bets  A gauge of construction activity rose to 50.9 last month
from 49.5 in September. That compares with the median forecast
of economists in a Bloomberg survey of 49. A reading above 50
indicates growth.  The U.K.  pulled out  of recession in the third quarter, when
gross domestic product expanded 1 percent, the fastest growth
since 2007.  The  Confederation of British Industry  revised upwards its
forecast for growth, saying the economy will stagnate this year
and expand 1.4 percent in 2013. In August, it predicted a 0.3
percent contraction and a 1.3 percent expansion, respectively.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays Plc, Citigroup
Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. all subsequently abandoned
previous forecasts for the Bank of England to increase stimulus
next week.  A gauge of services growth due on Nov. 5 was at 52 in
October, from 52.2 a month earlier, according to the median
forecast of 22 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The pound has advanced 0.9 percent in the past three months
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 3.2 percent and
the dollar dropped 2.7 percent.  Ten-year gilts yielded 1.86 percent from 1.87 percent on
Oct. 26. The 1.75 percent security maturing in September 2022
added 0.11, or 1.1 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.06.  Gilts returned 2.4 percent this year through Nov. 1,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.4 percent percent and Treasuries earned 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
