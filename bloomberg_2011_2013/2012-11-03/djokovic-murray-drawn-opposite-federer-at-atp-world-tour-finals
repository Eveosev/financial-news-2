Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic and U.S. Open winner  Andy Murray  were placed in the
same group at the ATP World Tour Finals today.  Serbia’s Djokovic and Murray of Britain were drawn in group
A, alongside former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych of the
 Czech Republic  and France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who made the
finals of the season-ending event at London’s O2 arena last
year.  Defending champion Roger Federer of Switzerland will start
his quest for a record-extending seventh ATP World Tour Finals
title in group B. Spain’s David Ferrer, former U.S. Open
champion Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina and Serbia’s Janko Tipsarevic were also drawn in group B.  The ATP Finals, which start Nov. 5, feature a round-robin
format, with the top eight singles and doubles players on the
ATP rankings divided into two groups. Each plays the three
others in the group, with the top two in each section moving
into the knockout semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
