Carmelo Anthony had 30 points and 10
rebounds as the Knicks defeated the reigning National Basketball
Association Miami Heat 104-84 in New York’s season opener.  The Knicks’ scheduled season opener against the Brooklyn
Nets at Barclays Center on Nov. 1 was postponed until Nov. 26
after  Hurricane Sandy  devastated the New York region.  “Over the last couple of days, we didn’t even know if this
game was going to be played,'' Anthony told reporters. ``Then 
before the game we look up and they say they canceled the Marathon, 
so it was like, we have to go out there and play. So today was
something to give New York a couple hours of some peace.”  The Heat (1-1) are favored to win back-to-back NBA titles,
with a successful $100 bet returning $225, according to
Pregame.com. The Los Angeles Lakers, who have lost their first
three games, are second followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder,
last season’s runner-up. A winning $100 bet on the Knicks would
return $4,000; one on the Nets $5,000.  The Knicks rushed to a 33-17 lead after the first quarter
and had a 55-44 advantage at halftime before a sold-out crowd at
Madison Square Garden in New York.  Anthony hit two 3-pointers in a 10-0 run that gave New York
an 11-point lead in the first quarter. J.R. Smith dropped in six
straight points before Anthony hit another 3-pointer to give the
Knicks a 30-12 lead with just over a minute left in the period.
At the buzzer, he sank another 3-pointer.  ‘Big Win’  The Knicks, who are playing without an injured Amar’e
Stoudemire, hit 19 of 36 three-pointers compared with seven of
20 for the Heat.  Steve Novak came off the bench to contribute 17 points for
the Knicks, and Raymond Felton added 14.  “I think this win meant a lot for us, for the city, fans,
you know, just everybody in New York,” Felton told reporters.
“This was a big win, so I’m happy we got it.”  LeBron James had 23 points and Rashard Lewis added 16 for
the Heat.  “Right from the get-go you could tell there was a
difference in energy, disposition, quickness to the ball both
ends of the court,” Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  told reporters.
“They played a very good basketball game. Got us on our heels
pretty much the whole game and we weren’t able to recover from
there. We have to move on. We’re clearly much better than
this.”  Elsewhere in the NBA, it was  Charlotte  Bobcats 90, Indiana
Pacers 89; Orlando Magic 102, Denver Nuggets 89; Milwaukee Bucks
