Shares in Saudi Arabia, the only Gulf
Arab stock open on Saturday, rose on the first day of trading
after a week-long halt for Islamic celebrations.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.1 percent to 6,800.82
at the close in Riyadh, the highest since Oct. 20. The 152-
member index has climbed 6 percent this year.  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , the telecommunications operator that
posted a 23 percent rise in third-quarter profit, advanced 1
percent, the highest since July 2, 2006.  Amana Cooperative
Insurance Co. (AMANA)  rose 7.8 percent.  Stocks of  National Shipping Co. (NSCSA)  of Saudi Arabia, known as
Bahri, gained 5 percent today. The company said it will sign on
Nov. 4 a fleet-merger pact with the state-owned Saudi Arabian
Oil company, or Aramco, according to a statement on the  Tadawul
exchange website today.  “The first day’s trading after a long break does not give
an accurate indication for the rest of the week,” Turki Fadaak,
 head of research at Albilad Investment Co. in  Riyadh .  The Saudi bourse was closed Oct. 27-31 for the Islamic Eid
al-Adha holiday, one of the holiest periods of the Muslim
calendar. The bourse’s index had declined for four of the five
days preceding the holiday.  Banks’ detailed reports showing provisions taken by lenders
which are expected to come out within the next two weeks, will
impact the shares’ performance, Fadaak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
