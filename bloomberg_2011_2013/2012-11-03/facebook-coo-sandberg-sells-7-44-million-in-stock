Facebook Inc. (FB)  Chief Operating Officer
 Sheryl Sandberg  sold $7.44 million in shares as the company
frees up more stock for trading following its initial public
offering in May.  Sandberg sold 339,512 shares at about $21.10 apiece on Oct.
31, the first trading day after the latest round of lock-up
restrictions ended, a regulatory filing showed yesterday. She
also sold 13,392 shares at $20.79 apiece, according to the
document.  The operator of the world’s largest social-networking
service unlocked 229 million shares for trading this past week,
the second of five insider-sale restrictions scheduled during
Facebook’s first year as a public company. Current and former
employees have seen the value of their equity compensation
decline as the stock fell 44 percent from the IPO price of $38.  Shares in Facebook, based in  Menlo Park , California, were
little changed yesterday at $21.18.  Two lockups will expire for an additional 960 million
shares by the end of the year, followed by one for 47.3 million
in May 2013.  Sandberg’s share sales were part of a trading plan adopted
in July. She has about 20 million available shares for trading,
part of her total holdings, Facebook said yesterday.  Theodore Ullyot, general counsel, also sold 149,075 shares,
raising $3.13 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
