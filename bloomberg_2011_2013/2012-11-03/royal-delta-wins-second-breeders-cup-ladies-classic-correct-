Bill Mott, the Hall of Fame trainer
of Breeders’ Cup Ladies Classic winner Royal Delta, has a chance
to sweep the top events of the two-day thoroughbred race meet
with three entries in the $5 million Classic.  The 15-race championship series with more than $25 million
paid out in purses ends today with nine races at Santa Anita
Park in Arcadia,  California .  Mott trained three of the 12 entries running in the 1 ¼-
mile Classic: Flat Out (5-1), Ron the Greek (6-1) and To Honor
and Serve (8-1). He won last year’s Classic with Drosselmeyer
and the Ladies’ Classic with Royal Delta.  “I’m not trying to do it just because we did it last
year,” Mott said. “I feel no pressure to do that. I just want
to do it because we’re in there. I’ve got three good horses in
the Classic and I think any one of them could win the race on
their big day.”  Game on Dude, who ran second to Drosselmeyer last year and
is co-owned by Major League Baseball executive Joe Torre, is the
early 9-5 favorite in the Classic. The thoroughbred is trained
by Bob Baffert.  Royal Delta, who left the gate with 8-5 odds in the $2
million Ladies Classic, was the only favorite to win on the six-
race card yesterday.  The 4-year-old, known for rallying to first from behind the
pack, shot off to an early lead to carry jockey Mike Smith to
his record 16th Breeders’ Cup victory.  ‘Just Brilliant’  “I literally caught a flyer leaving there which means she
broke well,” Smith said in a televised interview. “She’s never
really broken well. I just needed to catch a break. She’s just
brilliant.”  The filly covered the 1 1/8 miles in one minute, 48.8
seconds to win by 1 1/2 lengths over seven challengers. Royal
Delta returned $5.40, $3.60 and $2.60 on a $2 bet. My Miss
Aurelia paid $5.80 and $4, while Include Me Out paid $5.20.  “Our plan was not to get in her way,” Mott said of his
Horse of the Year contender. “We were going to let her go up
and tend the pace.”  Zagora, at 9-1 odds, won the $2 million Breeders’ Cup Filly
and Mare Turf, which makes her a top contender for the national
champion turf female.  Ridden by Javier Castellano and trained by Chad Brown,
Zagora caught leader Marketing Mix in the final furlong to win
by three-quarters of a length. The filly covered the 1 1/4 miles
in one minute, 49.70 seconds.  Zagora paid $20.40, $7.80 and $5 on a $2 bet. Marketing Mix
paid $6 and $3.80 and British entry The Fugue returned $2.80.  Wire-to-Wire  Beholder went wire-to-wire to stay ahead of 3-2 favorite
Executiveprivilege in the $2 million Juvenile Fillies. Beholder
paid $9.80, $4.60 and $3 on a $2 bet; Executiveprivilege
returned $3.40 and $2.40 and Dreaming of Julia was third for
$3.20.  Argentina ’s Calidoscopio, going off at 17-1, became the
first South American-trained runner and the oldest contender at
9 years old to win a Breeders’ Cup race by taking first in the 1
3/4 miles $500,000 Marathon. Calidoscopio closed from 20 lengths
back in a field of 14 to win by 4 1/4 lengths. He paid $36.40,
$16 and $9.60 on a $2 bet. Grassy was second, paying $12.40 and
$7.60 and the favorite Atigun returned $3.40.  Hightail, winless in his first eight races, beat the 1-2
favorite Merit Man by a nose in the $500,000 Juvenile Sprint.
Hightail, the first maiden to win a Breeders’ Cup race, gave
trainer Wayne D. Lukas his record 19th victory overall in the
Breeders’ Cup series.  The 2-year-old Hightail paid $32.80, $7.20 and $3.40, while
Merit Man returned $2.40 and $2.10. Sweet Shirley Mae was third
to return $2.40.  French mare Flotilla posted an 11-1 upset in the $1 million
Juvenile Fillies Turf to give jockey Christophe Lemaire and
trainer Mikel Delzangles their first Breeders’ Cup victories.  Flotilla paid $24.80, $10.80 and $7.80 on a $2 bet.
Watsdachances was second to return $6.40 and $5.40 and Summer of
Fun was third to pay $19.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
