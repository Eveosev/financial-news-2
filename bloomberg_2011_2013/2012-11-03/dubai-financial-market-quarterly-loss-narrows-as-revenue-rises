Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM) , the only
publicly traded Gulf Arab stock market, said its third-quarter
loss narrowed after revenue advanced and costs dropped.  The loss for the  three months ended Sept.  30 was 1.7
million dirhams ($462,837) after a loss of 9.3 million dirhams
in the year-earlier period, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Quarterly revenue  rose to 36.8 million dirhams
from 31.7 million dirhams in the same period of 2011 while
expenses dropped 6.1 percent to 38.5 million dirhams.  Dubai’s benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  is the best performer
in the Gulf Cooperation Council so far this year, with an
advance of 20 percent compared with a gain of 3.5 percent for
the region’s  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index. (BGCC200)   Trading value  on Dubai’s
bourse climbed 47 percent in the first nine months to 40.4
billion, the Dubai Financial Market said today. The figure
improved after three brokerages started  margin trading , Chairman
Abdul Jalil Yousef Darwish said in the statement.  The exchange plans to allow short selling, liquidity
providing, market making and share lending and borrowing as it
seeks to boost liquidity, the company said.  “We are confident that Dubai Financial Market is well
positioned for a new beginning given the various market
infrastructure enhancements implemented over the last two
years,” Darwish said.  Dubai Financial Market shares rose 2 percent, the most
since Oct. 7, to 1.03 dirhams on Nov. 1. The stock has gained 23
percent this year after a 44 percent decline in 2011.  The  United Arab Emirates , the second-biggest Arab economy,
has three bourses, Nasdaq Dubai, Dubai Financial Market and Abu
Dhabi Securities Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
