David Ortiz  and the Boston Red Sox
have agreed on a $26 million, two-year contract, the  Associated
Press  reported, citing a person familiar with the transaction.  Incentive bonuses could boost the dealâ€™s worth to as much as
$30 million during the next two Major League Baseball seasons,
the AP said yesterday.  An eight-time All-Star, Ortiz hit a team-record 54 home runs
in 2006. He was hitting .318 with 23 homers and 60 runs batted in
this season before injuring his right Achilles tendon and playing
in just one game after July 16.  Ortiz, 36, owns a career .285 batting average with 401
homers and 1,386 RBIs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
