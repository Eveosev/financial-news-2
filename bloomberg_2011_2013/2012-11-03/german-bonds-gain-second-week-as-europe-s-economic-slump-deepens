German  government bonds  rose for a
second week as reports showed  Europe ’s economic slump is
deepening and  Spain  delayed asking for a bailout that may help
reduce borrowing costs across the region.  Germany ’s two-year note yield dropped to the  lowest  in
eight weeks yesterday as data revealed manufacturing in Spain
and Italy contracted in October. Spanish bonds fell after the
nation said a debt sale next week will include the longest
maturity it has auctioned in 18 months. Bunds pared gains after
hiring in the U.S. jumped more than economists predicted last
month.  Greece ’s bonds slid as coalition government lawmakers
squabbled over austerity demanded by its creditors.  “The bund market is well supported given the prevarication
by the Spanish about the sovereign bailout,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The Greek negotiations are dragging on with
no sign of a solution at the moment. That’s keeping bunds pretty
well underpinned in the short term.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield dropped nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, this week to 1.45 percent at 5 p.m.
London time yesterday. The 1.5 percent security maturing in
September 2022 gained 0.79, or 7.90 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,284) face-amount, to 100.46.  Two-year yields fell five basis points from a week earlier
to zero, the least since Sept. 6.  Factory Output  An  index  of factory output in Spain was at 43.5 last month,
London-based Markit Economics said yesterday. The median
prediction of economists was 44.1.  Italy ’s gauge was at 45.5,
from 45.7 in September. For the 17-nation euro area, the index
fell to 45.4 from 46.1 in September. That compares with an
initial October estimate of 45.3 published on Oct. 24. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield rose seven basis points to 5.66
percent after rising 22 basis-points the previous week. The two-
year yield was at 3.07 percent yesterday, down from 3.06 percent
on Oct. 26.  The Iberian nation will sell a new benchmark 4.5 percent
bond maturing 2018 on Nov. 8, the Treasury said yesterday.
Yields on 20-year debt rose for the first time in four days
yesterday, jumping 10 basis points to 6.30 percent after the
government announced next week’s sales.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is hesitating over triggering
European Central Bank purchases of Spain’s bonds even as Moody’s
Investors Service said last month the nation risks being
downgraded to junk unless he requests aid. Spanish debt is rated
one step above non-investment grade with a negative outlook.  Greek Bid  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s bid to please
lenders from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund 
with a 13.5 billion-euro austerity package and unlock funds ran
into renewed obstacles this week from coalition partners. A law
on state asset sales scraped through parliament, raising
concerns on whether the government will be able to muster enough
support to pass the measures.  Greece’s 10-year yield jumped 90 basis points this week to
18.19 percent.  German bonds returned 3.4 percent this year through Nov. 1,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
also gained 3.4 percent, while Italy’s debt earned 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
