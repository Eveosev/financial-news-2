About 2.6 million homes and
businesses in the U.S. Northeast remain without power after
 Hurricane Sandy  struck Oct. 29, the Energy Department said in a
report today. About 900,000 had power restored overnight,
dropping the number of states with more than 1,000 blackouts to
seven from a previous peak of 21. New Jersey and New York
accounted for the majority of remaining power losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
