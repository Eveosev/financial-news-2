Lindsey Vonn ’s request to race
against the men this month at a  World Cup  event in Lake Louise,
Canada, has been turned down by the International Ski Federation
(FIS).  The FIS “respected Lindsey Vonn’s proposal to participate
in men’s World Cup races and confirmed that one gender is not
entitled to participate in races of the other and exceptions
will not be made to the FIS Rules,” it said in an emailed
statement today.  Olympic downhill champion Vonn of the U.S. is however free
to submit a request to the organizers of the Lake Louise event
to be a forerunner, the FIS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
