The union representing U.K. pilots is
considering legal action to stop airlines using pilots on
temporary contracts, it said.  So-called contract pilots are asked by airlines to set up
their own company so that they can be employed as contractors to
the business on “lower terms and conditions than permanent
employees,” the British Airline Pilots’ Association said in an
e-mailed statement today. Permanent employees from  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,
the U.K.’s biggest discount airline, have expressed their
support for their non-permanent colleagues, BALPA said.  “We will be considering all legal avenues to stop this
practice,” Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the union, said
in the statement. “This unfairness needs to be tackled across
the industry.”  The association said it plans to work “airline by
airline,” putting pressure on the industry regulator to crack
down on the practice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
