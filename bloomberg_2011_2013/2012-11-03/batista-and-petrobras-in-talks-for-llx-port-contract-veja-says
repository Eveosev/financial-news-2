Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista  is
negotiating a contract for oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) 
to use his Acu port,  Veja magazine  reported in its Radar column,
without saying how it got the information.  The port and industrial complex in Rio de Janeiro state,
controlled by Batistaâ€™s  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , is focusing
increasingly on the offshore oil industry, Veja said.  LLX declined to comment to  Bloomberg News  in an e-mailed
statement.  Batista has been struggling to reach his goal of luring $40
billion of investment to Acu after Nissan Motor Co. pulled out,
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  delayed a project and talks with  Ternium SA (TX) 
failed to produce a deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
