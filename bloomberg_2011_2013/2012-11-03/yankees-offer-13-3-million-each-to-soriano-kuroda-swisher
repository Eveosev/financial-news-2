The  New York Yankees  offered one-year
contracts of $13.3 million each to closer  Rafael Soriano ,
starting pitcher Hiroki Kuroda and rightfielder  Nick Swisher ,
the Major League Baseball club said.  By making the so-called qualifying offers, the Yankees
assure themselves of getting compensation in the form of draft
picks if the players turn down the deals to become free agents
and then sign with other clubs. The three have until Nov. 9 to
decide.  Soriano opted out of the final year of his contract after
saving 42 games last season in place of the injured  Mariano Rivera , MLB.com reported.  Soriano, 32, would have received $14 million in 2013, the
website reported without saying where it got the information.
The right-handed pitcher instead activated a $1.5 million buyout
from the team, according to the report.  Kuroda, 37, was 16-11 last season with a 3.32 earned-run
average in 33 regular-season starts.  Swisher, 31, ended the regular season with a .272 batting
average, 93 runs batted in and 24 home runs.  The latest Collective Bargaining Agreement established the
system of qualifying offers, with the $13.3 million representing
the average of the previous yearâ€™s top 125 free-agent salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
