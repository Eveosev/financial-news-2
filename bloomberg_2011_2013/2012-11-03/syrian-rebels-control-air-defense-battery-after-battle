Syrian rebels clashed with armed
forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad near Idlib’s Taftanaz
military airport after taking control of an air defense battery
in the city, an opposition group said.  Battles between the rebel Free Syrian forces and government
troops today involving the battery killed nine people, according
to the London-based Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights . At
least 200 people died in violence across  Syria  yesterday, the
group said.  Government forces loyal to al-Assad killed 4,532 civilians
in October, an average of 147 people a day, the Syrian Network
for Human Rights said in an e-mailed statement.  Russia , which continues to work with the Syrian regime,
said yesterday that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s
proposal for the opposition to search for new leaders to gain
wider support is encouraging an “uncompromising” struggle to
topple Assad. At least 35,000 people have been killed during the
19-month uprising, according to the U.K.-based group.  Syrian warplanes raided parts of the suburbs in the
capital, Damascus, early today and engaged with rebel forces in
Daraa and Homs, the Observatory group also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
