Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said he is concerned about the lack of openness by other
countries toward Canadian companies as his government prepares
new rules on foreign investment.  “The real issue is, are we going to get that reciprocal
openness in other countries? And that’s the real challenge,”
Harper told the National Post newspaper in an interview
published today. “You know, we could block a whole lot more
investments than we are and be still one of the most open
regimes in the world.”  Canada yesterday extended its review of Beijing-based  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) ’s $15.1 billion takeover of  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  for a second time,
re-setting the deadline to Dec. 10.  Harper’s government began its review of the bid for the
Calgary oil-and-gas producer under the country’s foreign-
takeover law after it was announced on July 23. On Oct. 11,
Industry Minister Christian Paradis said he extended the review
by 30 days.  Canada  has a “generally open policy, but we’re determined
to make sure that while we welcome foreign investment that we
make sure that it’s in the best interest of this country,”
Harper told the National Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
