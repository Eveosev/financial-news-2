Crystal Palace named Ian Holloway as
its new manager, the second-tier English soccer club said on its
website.  Holloway, 49, leaves fellow Championship club Blackpool to
sign a 4 1/2-year contract at Palace. He replaces Dougie
Freeman, who left the London club last month to take over at
Bolton.  Holloway spent 3 1/2 years at Blackpool, leading the club
to promotion to the Premier League in 2010. Blackpool was
relegated back to the Championship after one year and last
season reached the promotion playoff final before losing to West
Ham.  Crystal Palace is currently fourth in the Championship,
eight places and six points ahead of Blackpool.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
