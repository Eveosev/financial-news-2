PetroChina Co. (857) , a subsidiary of the
state-backed  China National Petroleum Corp ., may buy the 40
percent of Canada’s MacKay River oil sands project that it
doesn’t already own from  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. (ATH) ,  the Calgary
Herald said.  Athabasca said yesterday it’s close to receiving regulatory
approval for the deal, which would trigger a 31-day option for
the Calgary-based company to sell its stake or allow PetroChina
to buy it, the newspaper said.  PetroChina would pay about $664 million to take over
MacKay, which may produce 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day, the newspaper said.  PetroChina spokesman Mao Zefeng declined to comment when
contacted by phone. A spokesman for Athabasca couldn’t be
reached outside of office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
