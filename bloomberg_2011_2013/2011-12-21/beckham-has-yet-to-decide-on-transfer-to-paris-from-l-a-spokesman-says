David Beckham  hasn’t made a decision
on whether to stay in Los Angeles or return to Europe, a
spokesman for the former England national team soccer captain
said today.  A report in French daily newspaper Le Parisien said Beckham
has given a verbal agreement to sign a 18-month contract for
Qatar government-owned Paris Saint-Germain in return for a gross
monthly salary of 800,000 euros ($1.05 million).  “No agreement has been reached with any football club
yet,” a spokesman for his agent Simon Fuller’s XIX agency said
in a statement. “Any talk of a deal is premature. David is yet
to make a final decision.”  The  Los Angeles Galaxy  won Major League Soccer’s
championship last month in the final match of Beckham’s four-
year contract. The Galaxy have called on the former Manchester
United and Real Madrid player to remain in the U.S. where his
presence has helped to increase soccer’s visibility in a country
where sports like football, basketball and baseball dominate.  An investment arm of the Qatari government bought a
majority stake in PSG earlier this year and vowed to build the
team into one of  Europe ’s strongest. The team which counts
French president  Nicolas Sarkozy  as a fan won the last of its
two championships in 1994. Qatar was awarded staging rights to
the 2022  World Cup  last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
