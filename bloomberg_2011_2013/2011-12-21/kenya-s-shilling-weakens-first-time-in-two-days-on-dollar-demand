Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar for the first time in two days on increased demand
for the U.S currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent before paring its decline to 0.1 percent
at 83.55 at 2:06 p.m. in Nairobi. The shilling closed at 83.50
yesterday, the highest in almost eight months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The weakening is due to increase residual demand
following the strengthening of the shilling with businesses
seeking to buy at these new levels,” John Muli, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview
today.  The shilling depreciated 19 percent in the first ten
months, making it the world’s worst performer against the
dollar, reaching 106.75 on Oct. 11. It recouped all its losses
in the fourth quarter, appreciating 19 percent since Nov. 1 to
date, making it the best performing currency among more than 170
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Uganda ’s currency weakened against the dollar for the first
time in twelve trading days, depreciating 0.6 percent to
2,374.50 while the Tanzanian shilling weakened 0.1 percent to
trade 1,587 per dollar at 2:06 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam .  To contact the reporters on this story:
