HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  will look at
assets that come on the market after the merger of two U.S.
rivals,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing an interview
with Chief Executive Officer Bernd Scheifele.  HeidelbergCement is not planning a counter offer for  Vulcan
Materials Co. (VMC)  after  Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM)  bid for the
U.S. company, Scheifele said, according to the German newspaper.
The manager doesn’t expect any other big deals in the industry
as the leading companies lack the financial firepower and banks
aren’t lending that kind of money, FAZ said.  Earnings in Germany have not met the company’s expectations
because pricing pressure in the country has not abated, the
newspaper cited Scheifele as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
