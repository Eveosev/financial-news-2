INA Industrija Nafte d.d. (INARA) , Croatia’s
largest refiner controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , reduced crude
oil and natural gas production in Syria amid the European
Union’s embargo on oil from the Middle Eastern nation.  The company has reduced output by approximately 1,300
barrels a day in addition to an already announced September
crude oil production decrease of 1,500 thousand barrels a day,
the Zagreb-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  INA also said it’s “still experiencing difficulties” in
collecting payments from Syria.  The company also requested a suspension in trading on the
Zagreb stock exchange and the London stock exchange until Jan. 9
due to the “high unpredictability of the current developments
influencing INA’s Syrian activities.”  INA returned to profit last year following two years of
losses as production in the northern Adriatic and  Syria  boosted
revenue. The company’s plant in Hayan, Syria, is expected to
reach a production peak of 24,500 barrels a day in 2012 or 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
