Ethanol  output  in the U.S. increased
0.5 percent last week to 943,000 barrels a day, according to an
Energy Department report.  Stockpiles  swelled 3.5 percent to 17.7 million barrels, the
department said in a report today. Thatâ€™s 5.3 percent higher
than a year earlier. Output was 5.7 percent higher than a year
ago.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol 
rose 2.2 percent to 5.26 million barrels a day, the highest
level since Aug. 12. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for
every gallon of ethanol blended into the motor fuel, a measure
that expires Dec. 31.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 0.3 cent to
$2.143 a gallon at 10:44 a.m. New York time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have fallen 9.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
