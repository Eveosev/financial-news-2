Wereldhave NV (WHA) , a Dutch property
company with assets in  Paris and Dunkirk , agreed to pay about
138 million euros ($181 million) for an office building that
will be constructed in the French capital.  The NODA building in the district of Issy-Les-Moulineaux
will be developed by BNP Paribas Real Estate and is due to be
completed in the third quarter of 2014, Wereldhave said in a
statement today. The building will have 22,123 square meters
(238,000 square feet) of space and produce a net initial yield
of 7.3 percent, said the company, which is based in  The Hague .  “There is a healthy demand in the greater Parisian office
market from tenants for efficient, energy-conscious and well-
located office space larger than 10,000 square meters,”
Wereldhave Chief Executive Officer Hans Pars said in the
statement.  NODA is part of a project on the Seine river that also
includes the VEGA building. It will have seven floors and a
staff restaurant, Wereldhave said in the statement. Wereldhave
aims to increase the value of its French portfolio to at least
400 million euros, according to the Dutch company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
