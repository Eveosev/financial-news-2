WestLB AG , the state-owned German
lender being broken up, plans to shift about 1,000 workers to a
new unit called the SPM service company that will help other
lenders wind down bad loans and securities.  About 400 employees will join a separate restructuring unit
and another 400 will transfer to the so-called Verbundbank unit
that will serve regional savings banks and belong to Landesbank
Hessen-Thueringen, Chief Executive Officer Dietrich Voigtlaender
said today, spokesman Armin Kloss confirmed. The restructure
will mean job reductions for the 4,300 employees, Voigtlaender
said, without saying what the plans are for the remaining 2,500
workers.  The European Commission in Brussels yesterday authorized 11
billion euros ($14.4 billion) in state aid for the transfer of
assets to a bad bank after WestLB and its shareholders agreed to
a restructuring plan. The commission decision on WestLB ended
one of its longest-running banking state-aid cases. The lender
needed bailouts from its owners, including the German state of
North Rhine-Westphalia and the country’s federal government,
after running up losses in 2008.  WestLB won’t be able to sell large businesses in the
current market and therefore will aim to divest smaller assets,
Voigtlaender said at a press briefing in Dusseldorf. The goal is
to privatize the new SPM service unit, which belongs to the
state government, by 2016 at the latest, he said.  WestLB said last week that the planned sale of its real-
estate unit, Westdeutsche Immobilien Bank, to  Apollo Global
Management  failed because the price was “not acceptable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
