Detroit’s finances need a more
thorough review that may lead to state intervention or a
takeover,  Michigan  Treasurer Andy Dillon said.  The  city  of 714,000 is in “probable financial stress” and
may run out of cash by April, Dillon said today in a preliminary
state examination, citing more than $12 billion in long-term
liabilities.  The report gives Governor Rick Snyder grounds to appoint a
team to determine whether Detroit has a financial emergency,
Dillon said in a statement. Dillon and Snyder have urged Mayor
Dave Bing to agree to a deficit-reduction plan. One alternative
is for the state to appoint an emergency manager with sweeping
powers to fire employees and nullify union contracts.  “As we have noted on numerous occasions, the longer it
takes to address  Detroit ’s financial problems, the more painful
the potential solutions become,” Dillon said in the statement.  Bing said he expected the appointment of a state review
team and intends to cooperate. The mayor said the best remedy is
his cost-cutting plan, including proposed concessions by
employee unions, according to a statement.  The city has a $155 million deficit that would increase by
$44 million by June 2012 without spending cuts or more revenue,
according to an independent analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
