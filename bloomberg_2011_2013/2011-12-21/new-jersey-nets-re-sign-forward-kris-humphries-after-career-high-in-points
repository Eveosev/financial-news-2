The  New Jersey Nets  re-signed
forward  Kris Humphries , who averaged a career-high 10 points and
10.4 rebounds for the team last season.  Humphries, 26, joined the Nets in a trade during the 2009-
10 season and is entering his eighth year in the National
Basketball Association. Nets General Manager Billy King
announced the signing in a statement, without disclosing terms
of the contract.  In 118 NBA games with the Nets, Humphries has averaged 9.3
points and 8.9 rebounds.  Humphries made headlines during the five-month NBA lockout
when he married reality-television star Kim Kardashian in a
widely publicized and broadcast ceremony. Kardashian divorced
him after 72 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
