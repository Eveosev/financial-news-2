HSH Nordbank AG will miss its target
for new property loans at its real-estate unit after the
European Commission decided that the bank can’t give loans to
German clients abroad,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported
today, citing Peter Axmann, head of HSH’s real-estate financing.  New property loans at the division will total around 1.1
billion euros ($1.4 billion) this year compared with a target of
2 billion euros, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
