Swiss stocks (SMI)  were little changed,
after swinging between gains and losses, as euro-area lenders
sought more funds from the  European Central Bank  than economists
had predicted.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s largest watchmaker, gained 1
percent after  Societe Generale  SA recommended buying the shares.
 Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-biggest cement maker, dropped
1.7 percent.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, gained less than 0.1 percent to
5,804.77 at the close in Zurich, after fluctuating between an
increase of 0.7 percent and a loss of 0.3 percent. The gauge has
rebounded 21 percent from this year’s low on Aug. 10 as policy
makers intensified their efforts to resolve the debt crisis. The
broader Swiss Performance Index was also little changed today.  The Frankfurt-based ECB awarded 489 billion euros ($645
billion) in 1,134-day loans, more than median estimate of 293
billion euros by economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The ECB
said 523 banks asked for the funds, which will be lent at the
average of its benchmark rate -- currently 1 percent -- over the
period of the loans. The ECB also lent banks $33 billion for 14
days in a regular dollar offering, up from $5.1 billion a week
ago.  European Union leaders will hold a summit on Jan. 30 to
discuss jobs and economic growth, EU President  Herman Van Rompuy 
said.  Euro Support  Euro-area governments yesterday pledged to channel 150
billion euros to the  International Monetary Fund . British
wariness of the IMF program undermined the euro region’s goal of
drawing an additional 50 billion euros from the rest of the EU.  The head of the world’s biggest bond fund said he sees a
more than one-in-three chance that the euro area will break
apart and trigger a financial crisis akin to the one that
devastated the global economy in 2008.  “It would be the equivalent of a sudden stop” in which
financial markets seized up, Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,
California, said. “It would be really, really messy.”  Swatch increased 1 percent to 341.40 francs. Societe
Generale raised its recommendation on the stock to “buy” from
“hold.” Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, advanced 1.4 percent to 46.98 francs.  Holcim declined 1.7 percent to 49.80 francs and  Geberit AG (GEBN) ,
Europe’s biggest maker of toilet-flushing systems, lost 1.2
percent to 180 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
