An expert group set up by Russian
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  proposed a 30 percent cut in the
number of bureaucrats in the country, to boost economic
productivity,  Vedomosti  reported.  The number of officials has risen more than 40 percent, to
1.65 million, since 2000, when Putin was elected for his first
presidential term, while the overall population has declined,
the newspaper said, citing an amended 2020 strategy prepared by
the expert group.  The group is led by professors at the Moscow-based Higher
School of Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
