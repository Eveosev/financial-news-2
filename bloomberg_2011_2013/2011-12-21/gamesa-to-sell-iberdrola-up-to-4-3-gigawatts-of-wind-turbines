Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA (GAM) ,
Europe’s second-largest wind-turbine maker, will sell as much as
4,300 megawatts of the machines to  Iberdrola (IBE)  SA, the biggest
producer of renewable energy and its main shareholder.  Iberdrola will buy 502 megawatts of Gamesa onshore  wind
turbines  next year, plus half the systems it needs in the decade
following, or until further purchases reach 3,800 megawatts, the
Bilbao, Spain-based power producer said in a filing yesterday.
It will also work with Gamesa to develop offshore equipment.  “This gives visibility to Gamesa going forward,” with
guaranteed sales and a partner in the offshore wind market,
Gerard Reid, a renewable energy analyst at Jefferies
International Ltd., said in a phone interview. “Offshore is the
most important thing because that will be the growth market.”  The shares rose as much as 5.6 percent in Madrid and traded
5.2 percent higher at 3.20 euros by 9:22 a.m. local time.  Gamesa, still trading down 44 percent this year as  Europe ’s
debt crisis curbs demand, opened a design center near Glasgow,
 Scotland , in September to develop a 7-megawatt sea-based turbine
to generate power at sea. It plans a 5-megawatt prototype next
year with blades sweeping an area 128 meters wide.  The company, held 20 percent by Iberdrola, plans to invest
more than 150 million euros ($196 million) through 2014
developing offshore turbines to grab at least 10 percent of the
market by 2020. The latest deal with Iberdrola replaces a 2008
accord under which the utility agreed to buy 4,500 megawatts of
turbines. That was partly fulfilled, according to Gamesa.  The company expects to sell as much as 3,500 megawatts of
its turbines in 2012, up from an estimated 2,800 megawatts to
3,100 megawatts this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
