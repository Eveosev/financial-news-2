Mexico ’s peso weakened the most in a
week as demand for higher-yielding assets declined amid waning
optimism about a European Central Bank plan to fight the
region’s debt crisis.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 13.8272 per  U.S. dollar 
today, from 13.7845 yesterday. The peso has weakened 11 percent
this year, the worst performance among  Latin America ’s major
currencies.  Mexico’s currency dropped after the ECB’s announcement that
it awarded a bigger-than-forecast amount of three-year loans to
euro-area banks failed to squelch concern about the region’s
debt crisis. The banks borrowed enough cash to refinance almost
two-thirds of the debt they have maturing next year amid concern
that markets will remain frozen.  “There was optimism initially, and afterward everything
fell,”  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Base Internacional
Casa de Bolsa in Monterrey, Mexico, said by phone. “The peso is
following. We’re almost at the holidays, so volumes decrease and
movements appear very volatile.”  Yesterday the peso advanced the most in a week as better-
than-forecast U.S. housing data improved the outlook for Mexican
exports to its biggest trading partner.  The central bank said it didn’t sell dollars or receive
offers in the three auctions it held today.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to
6.59 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
of the security rose 0.76 centavo to 129.68 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
