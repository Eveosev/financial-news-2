Ukrainian  inflation , which will
probably be the slowest since 2002 this year, may accelerate
through 2013 as the hryvnia declines and state spending rises
before elections, BNP Paribas’s Ukrainian unit UkrSibbank said.  Consumer prices may increase 9.9 percent in 2012 and 15
percent in 2013, Alexander Belozyorov, head of macro and fixed-
income research at UkrSibbank in Kiev, said today in an e-mailed
note. Growth will probably slow to less than 5 percent this year
from 9.1 percent in 2010, he said.  “Inflation will significantly accelerate next year,
because of pre-election budgetary spending and the expected
‘quantitative easing’ by the central bank,” Belozyorov said. A
hryvnia “devaluation is getting very likely in 2013 as it would
substantially improve profit margins of exporting industries.”  The inflation rate was 5.2 percent in November, its lowest
level since May 2003 as a record grain harvest helped ease food
costs. Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov ’s government, which faces a
parliamentary vote in October, is targeting a rate of less than
8 percent in 2012. His party’s support fell to 17.8 percent this
month, compared with 18.8 percent for former Premier Yulia Tymoshenko’s party, a poll by the Democratic Initiatives
Foundation in Kiev showed.  In 2012, Ukrainian government policy “will likely be
focused on securing the victory of the ruling party at the
parliamentary elections,” said Belozyorov. After the vote, the
authorities “will have much more leeway in managing the
 exchange rate  and, most likely, will allow the hryvnia to
devalue with the aim of increasing exporters’ profitability and
saving the central bank’s reserves.”  The hryvnia may decline to 8.40 per dollar by the end of
2012 and to 9.80 by the end of 2013, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
