Demand for  oil tankers  to load 2
million-barrel cargoes of crude from Persian Gulf ports may
accelerate before Christmas, commodities broker Marex Spectron
Group Ltd. said.  Oil companies  will probably seek ships for all cargoes they
need to load in the first 10 days of January before Dec. 25,
Marexâ€™s Singapore-based freight derivatives unit said in an e-
mailed note today. The pace of chartering is slower than it was
at this time in November, implying there should be an
acceleration in bookings, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
