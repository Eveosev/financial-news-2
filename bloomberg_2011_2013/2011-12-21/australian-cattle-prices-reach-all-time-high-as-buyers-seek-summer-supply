Cattle prices in  Australia , the
second-biggest beef exporter, jumped to a record as processors
and feeders sought to secure supply over the summer months and
after heavy rains caused delays.  The Eastern Young  Cattle  Indicator, which measures prices
at sales in the nation’s east, rose 1.7 percent to A$4.28 ($4.31)
per kilogram yesterday. The previous all-time high was A$4.2425
per kilogram reached on March 28, according to Sydney-based
industry group  Meat & Livestock Australia .  Heavy rains in the north of New South Wales state have
slowed meat processing after floods inundated saleyards,
isolated farms and delayed the transport of cattle. The state
had its seventh- wettest  November on record, according to the
Bureau of Meteorology. Prices have gained 3.5 percent this week
and are set to advance 9.7 percent this year.  “Recent widespread rain has sustained buying demand from
restockers and feeders, keen to secure cattle over the summer
months,” MLA said in a  report  on its website. “Demand from
processors has been notably higher in recent days, with buyers
willing to purchase any suitable cattle to be processed before
the annual holiday closures.”  Cattle for delivery in February dropped 0.7 percent to
$1.2065 a pound yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Dec. 9. Prices
climbed by the 3-cent exchange limit on Dec. 19 and are up 11
percent this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
