Iceland’s annual inflation rate
accelerated this month, adding pressure on the central bank to
raise  interest rates .  The inflation rate rose to 5.3 percent from 5,2 percent in
November, Reykjavik-based Statistics Iceland said in a statement
on its website today. Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent on the
month.  The  central bank  this month kept rates unchanged after
having raised twice this year, as the country emerged from its
financial collapse in 2008. Policy makers lifted the rate a
quarter point to 4.75 percent on Nov. 2 as they tried to shield
the krona from market turbulence fueled by  Europe ’s deepening
debt crisis.  The bank targets annual price growth of 2.5 percent.
Iceland’s economy grew at the fastest pace since the second
quarter of 2007 in the three months through September, the
statistics office said on Dec. 7. Gross domestic product
expanded a quarterly 4.7 percent, after shrinking 3.6 percent in
the previous period, the office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
