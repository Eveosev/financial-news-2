Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the health-care
company beset by product recalls the last two years, said it was
asking retailers to return about 12 million bottles of Motrin
over concerns the painkiller may dissolve too slowly.  Tests of product samples showed some caplets may not
dissolve as quickly as intended when near their expiration date,
J&J’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit said in a  statement  on its
website today. While consumers don’t have to return any bottles,
it’s possible there may be “a delay in relief” after taking
the drug, Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview. J&J is based in  New Brunswick ,  New Jersey .  McNeil agreed in March to give U.S. regulators stepped-up
oversight at three manufacturing plants, after the division had
to pull tens of millions of packages of over-the-counter drugs
for quality concerns. Today’s recall covers Motrin distributed
in the U.S.,  Puerto Rico , Fiji, Belize, the Bahamas, St. Lucia
and  Jamaica , according to the statement.  “Out of an abundance of caution, we are recalling all the
listed products since there is a chance they could experience a
similar problem as they approach expiration,” the company said.  The recall covers lots of Motrin IB 24-count coated
caplets,  Motrin IB 24-count coated tablets and Motrin IB 24+6
count coated caplets. Jacobs said the cause of the problem is
under investigation. There’s no sign other Motrin products have
been affected, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
