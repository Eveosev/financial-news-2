Canadian natural gas rose on
speculation that a reduction in drilling will help stem a glut
of the home-heating fuel.  Alberta  gas rose 1.1 percent. The number of U.S. rigs
drilling for gas was down to 818 last week, the lowest since
January 2010, according to data compiled by Baker Hughes Inc.
New York gas futures have declined 28 percent this year as
stockpiles of the fuel have increased.  “The producing region continues to bleed rigs,” Eric Bickel, a natural gas analyst with Summit Energy Services in
Louisville,  Kentucky , said in a note today.  Alberta gas for January delivery rose 3 cents to C$2.82 a
gigajoule ($2.60 per million British thermal units) at the close
of trading at 5 p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.
NGX Alberta gas has fallen 22 percent this year.  Gas for January delivery rose 2.7 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $3.155 per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 94 million above its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.78 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.16 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 419 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.02 billion cubic feet today, about 83 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.88
billion cubic feet at 4:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
