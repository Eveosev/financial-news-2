percent. The shares rose for the first time in 10 days. The

Management Co., its third-biggest shareholder, to remove

statement.  Pang Da Automobile Trade Co.  (601258 CH), China’s biggest

close since it began trading in Shanghai in April. The company

biggest insurer, slumped 5.2 percent to 34.43 yuan, its biggest
loss since Sept. 26. Ping An said it plans to sell as much as 26
billion yuan ($4.1 billion) of convertible bonds to boost
working capital.  The sale will erode liquidity in the  capital markets  and
will boost Ping An’s equity base by about 9 percent if the bonds
are converted into stocks, Sun Ting, an analyst at Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co., wrote in a report today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
