Qatar’s shares headed for the
highest close in more than a week, led by  Doha Bank QSC (DHBK) , after
improved U.S. economic data boosted investor appetite for
riskier assets and as crude oil advanced for a third day.  Doha Bank, Qatar’s fifth-largest lender by market value,
rose a second day and  Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the Middle East’s
second-biggest petrochemicals company, increased as much as 0.8
percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  added 0.2 percent to 8,800.26 at 10:59
a.m. in Doha, headed for the highest close since Dec. 11. The
measure has gained 1.4 percent this year. The  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index (BGCC200) , down 10 percent in 2011, decreased 0.2 percent.  “The housing start figures from the U.S. came in
surprisingly strong with the retail sales also positive,”
boosting investor sentiment, said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “Qatar will have a positive
2012 because the monetary policy and the government fiscal
policies are expansionary, and that is why the stock market is
the best performing in the Gulf Cooperation Council.”  The  Standard and Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  surged 3 percent
yesterday, the biggest gain this month, after better-than-
estimated housing starts added to expectations the world’s
largest economy will weather Europe’s debt crisis. The  STOXX
Europe 600 Index  increased 2 percent yesterday and the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 2.1 percent today. Concern about
Europe’s debt crisis eased as German business confidence
unexpectedly grew and Spain sold 5.64 billion euros ($7.36
billion) of bills, more than the maximum target.  Crude for February delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent to
$98.44 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates, supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Qatar, which plans to spend $88 billion on infrastructure
to host the 2022 soccer World Cup, forecasts its economy to
expand about 16 percent this year. The  International Monetary
Fund  expects the nation to have the world’s fastest-growing
economy for a second year.  Doha Bank advanced 0.8 percent to 64.5 riyals and
Industries Qatar increased to 134 riyals before trading at 133
riyals.  Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  gained 0.1 percent, while Kuwait’s
 gauge (DFMGI)  declined 0.2 percent. Dubai’s DFM General Index fell 0.5
percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  decreased 0.7 percent,
its eighth day of losses. Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  was
little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
