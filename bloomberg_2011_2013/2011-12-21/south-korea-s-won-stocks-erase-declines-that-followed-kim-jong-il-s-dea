South Korea’s won and stocks rose
the most in three weeks as concerns over possible political
upheaval in North Korea eased and as U.S. housing data boosted
the outlook for the Asian nation’s exporters.  South Korea’s benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  index rallied 3.1 percent to
1,848.41 as of the close in Seoul, the most since Dec. 1 and
adding to yesterday’s 0.9 percent gain. The index has wiped out
the 3.4 percent slump from Dec. 19 when the death of North
Korea’s leader Kim Jong Il was reported. The won gained for a
second day, jumping 1.3 percent to 1,147.60 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency was 1
percent higher than its closing price on Dec. 16.  South Korean Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today
financial markets have been stabilizing quickly after Kim’s
death. Housing starts in the U.S. increased 9.3 percent to a
685,000 annual rate in November, exceeding the highest estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the most since
April 2010, government figures showed yesterday.  “Investors were relieved as issues surrounding North Korea
didn’t deteriorate as much as expected, and this sentiment
supported the won,” said Ryoo Hyun Jung, chief currency dealer
at Citibank Inc. in Seoul. “U.S. economic data and exporters’
selling dollars to convert income also boosted the currency.”  Foreign Investors  Overseas investors bought a net 286.3 billion won ($249
million) of Kospi index stocks today, according to data from
Korea Exchange Inc. They had sold a net 564.9 billion the
previous two days, the data show.  Exporters and financial stocks led gains in the Kospi
index.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest exporter
of consumer electronics, rallied 4.4 percent, its steepest gain
since Dec. 1.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s third-largest
mobile-phone maker, gained 4.8 percent, while  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,
South Korea’s largest automaker, gained 2.2 percent.  Financial stocks rallied following gains by peers in Europe
yesterday.  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) ,  Woori Finance Holdings Co. (053000) 
and  Industrial Bank of Korea (024110)  rose more than 5 percent. Shinhan
Financial Group Co. added 6.3 percent, leading gains among
banks, after SK Securities Co. said the stock’s valuation is
attractive.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due September
2016 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.51
percent, according to  Korea  Exchange Inc. prices. The rate
reached 3.57 percent on Dec. 19, the highest since Nov. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
