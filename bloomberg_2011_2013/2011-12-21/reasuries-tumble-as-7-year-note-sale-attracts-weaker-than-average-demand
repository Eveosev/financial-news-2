Treasuries  fell for a second day as
the U.S. sold $29 billion in seven-year securities to lower-
than-average demand in the final of seven auctions of $177
billion of notes, bonds and inflation-indexed debt over the past
two weeks, the most ever.  Thirty-year bond yields reached a  one-week high  as the
 Federal Reserve  prepared to make its final 2011 purchase of
long-term Treasuries tomorrow and sales of existing homes rose.
The seven-year auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing total bids with the amount offered, was 2.68,
versus 3.2 last month and an average 2.83 at the past 10 sales.  “It was a pretty weak auction; it’s setting a bad tone for
the balance of the year,” said  George Goncalves , head of
interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of 21
primary dealers that are obliged to bid in U.S. debt sales.
“The Fed buybacks have been supporting the bond market of late.
Given that the Fed isn’t buying anymore this year it makes for a
weak outlook to end the year.”  Yields on  30-year bonds  climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 3 percent at 5:08 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 3.01
percent, the highest level since Dec. 14, after falling earlier
to as low as 2.90 percent. The 3.125 percent securities maturing
in November 2041 dropped 1 1/2, or $15 per $1,000 face amount,
to 102 14/32.  Current  seven-year note  yields rose three basis points to
1.41 percent.  Ten-year  yields increased four basis points to
1.97 percent and touched 1.98 percent, also the highest since
Dec. 14. They fell earlier to as low as 1.89 percent.  Purchase Tomorrow  The Fed is scheduled to purchase as much as $5 billion
tomorrow of Treasuries due in 2020 and 2021 in its last buy of
the year in a program to lower borrowing costs. It is replacing
$400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term securities through June.  The central bank sold $8.12 billion of Treasuries due in
2013 and 2014 in the first of two offerings today. It sold $8.62
billion of debt due in 2013 in the second sale.  The seven-year notes sold today drew a  yield  of 1.430
percent, compared with a forecast of 1.423 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight primary dealers. The last
offering of the maturity, on Nov.23, drew a record low yield of
1.415 percent, and notes at the October sale yielded 1.791
percent.  Foreign Central Banks  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42 percent of the notes, compared with
an average of 42.5 percent for the past 10 offerings. Direct
bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.9 percent, versus an
average of 10.8 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Seven-year Treasuries have returned 13.2 percent this year,
compared with a 9.6 percent gain by the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.  The U.S. sold $35 billion yesterday of five-year debt at a
record low yield of 0.88 percent. It auctioned an equal amount
of two-year notes the previous day at a yield of 0.24 percent,
up from a record low 0.222 percent in August.  The government last week auctioned $78 billion in notes,
bonds and inflation-linked debt. It sold $12 billion in five-
year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities Dec. 15 at a record
low yield of negative 0.877 percent. A $13 billion sale of 30-
year bonds Dec. 14 drew a record low yield of 2.925 percent and
a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.05, the highest in 11 years. Auctions
of 10- and three-year notes also drew higher-than-average demand
as investors sought refuge.  Existing-Home Sales  Treasury 30-year bond yields rose earlier today as data
showed sales of  existing homes  in the U.S. increased more than
forecast. The National Association of Realtors reported the
sales were up 4 percent to a 4.42 million annual pace, versus a
2.2 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Ten- and 30-year yields briefly dropped amid fading
optimism that a European Central Bank loan program to euro-area
banks would restore confidence in sovereign borrowers and help
stem the euro region’s debt crisis. The ECB awarded 489 billion
euros ($638 billion) in 1,134-day loans in its longer-term
refinancing operation, the most ever in a single operation and
more than the median estimate of 293 billion euros in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Ten-year note yields reached 1.80 percent on Dec. 19, the
lowest level since Oct. 4, as investors sought safety amid
European debt turmoil.  Rejection of Lows  “We’ve seen a rejection of the lows in yield as the market
is stabilizing around these levels,” said  Richard Gilhooly , an
interest-rate strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD
Securities unit. in New York. “U.S. data continues to come out
better, which has taken Treasuries off of their lows. And  Europe 
blowing up has kept yields low in the U.S., which has ultimately
been good for the  U.S. economy .”  U.S. consumer spending rose in November for a fifth month,
a Bloomberg News survey forecast before a government report due
Dec. 23.  The U.S.’s AAA rating will probably be cut by  Fitch Ratings 
by the end of 2013 unless lawmakers are able to formulate a plan
to reduce the  budget deficit  after next year’s congressional and
presidential elections.  “Without such a strategy, the sovereign rating will likely
be lowered,” New York-based Fitch said in a statement today.
“Agreement will also have to be reached on raising the federal
debt ceiling, which is expected to become binding in the first
half of 2013.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
