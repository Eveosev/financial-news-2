The cost of insuring against default
on financial debt fell to the lowest in two weeks after the
 European Central Bank  said the region’s banks took 489 billion
euros ($645 billion) in three-year loans.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 European banks and insurers decreased
for a third day, falling 11 basis points to 287 and the
subordinated index dropped for a fifth day, down 17 to 523,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 2:30 p.m. in London. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Frankfurt-based ECB flooded euro-area lenders with
almost double the amount of cash forecast by economists as part
of its latest attempt to keep credit flowing during the
sovereign debt crisis. Policy makers are hoping the ECB’s
longer-term refinancing operation will spur demand for
 government bonds .  “We had a big rally this morning and a big rally
yesterday,” said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho
International in London. “It’s still a very constructive
result.”  Swaps on  Barclays Plc (BARC)  tumbled 17.5 basis points to 210,
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  dropped 18 to 305 and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  fell 12 to
203, all two-week lows, CMA prices show.  The cost of insuring sovereign debt fluctuated, with the
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index linked to 15 governments
falling two basis points to 359.5 basis points, after earlier
falling further and then increasing.  Italian Swaps  Default swaps on Italy rose eight basis points to 506 and
Spain increased 11 to 399, reversing earlier declines, according
to CMA. Contracts on  Belgium  fell two basis points to 313,
France decreased four to 216 and Germany was unchanged at 104.  Swaps on the U.K. rose one basis point to 98 after Moody’s
Investors Service said the nation’s “strengths” aren’t enough
to completely shield its credit rating from the euro-area debt
crisis and the government must stick to its deficit-reduction
program.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased six
basis points to 766.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings fell 4.25 basis points
to 175 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
