Chicago Bears  quarterback Josh McCown will make his first National Football League start in
four years when the team plays the division-rival  Green Bay
Packers  on Dec. 25.  McCown, 32, will replace Caleb Hanie, the loser of all four
of his starts in place of  Jay Cutler , who fractured his thumb in
a game last month, the team said today. McCown has thrown two
passes with one completion and one interception this season, and
hasn’t started since Week 16 of the 2007 season when he was with
the  Oakland Raiders .  The Bears (7-7) play the Packers (13-1) on Christmas at
8:20 p.m. New York time.  “It’s a cool story and a cool moment, but at the same time
I’m a competitor,” McCown told reporters in a televised
interview. “I want to win the game -- I want to do right by the
coaches and by the other 52 guys in the locker room.”  McCown signed with the Bears on Nov. 23, three days after
Cutler’s injury. He started nine games for the Raiders in 2007,
going 2-7 with 10 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He has thrown
eight passes in four games since.  The Bears were 7-3, in line for a playoff spot, when Hanie
took over for Cutler. The 26-year-old quarterback threw three
touchdowns and nine interceptions in his four starts before
being benched.  To contact the reporter on this story:
