Brazilian  inflation  accelerated for
a second month through mid-December, led by a jump in food and
beverage prices, reinforcing bets that inflation will breach the
central bank’s annual target for the first time in 8 years.  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA-15 index, rose
0.56 percent in the month, compared with an increase of 0.46
percent in mid-November, the national statistics agency said
today. The increase was in line with the  median  estimate of 43
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual inflation slowed to 6.56
percent, still above the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range.  “Everything is pointing to having inflation above the
target this year,” said Mauricio Nakahodo, senior economist at
CM Capital Markets. “To not breach the target depends on the
possibility of food prices decelerating quickly.”  President  Dilma Rousseff  is trying to revive growth in the
world’s sixth-biggest economy as  Europe ’s debt crisis deepens,
using a mix of tax cuts, interest rate reductions and looser
bank lending requirements. Policy makers have cut the benchmark
interest rate three times since August, pushing it to 11
percent, even as inflation ran above its target.  Food and beverage prices advanced 1.28 percent in the month
through mid-December, after rising 0.77 percent in the previous
period, paced by a 4.36 percent jump in meat prices, the report
showed. Clothing prices gained 1.1 percent in the month,
compared with 0.87 percent in the previous period.  Analyst Survey  Brazil ’s inflation will exceed the upper limit of its
target range in 2011 for the first time since 2003, a Dec. 16
central bank survey of about 100 economists showed. A week
earlier, the forecast was 6.5 percent.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini will also fail to
meet the bank’s goal of bringing inflation back to the 4.5
percent midpoint of the target next year, the survey shows.
Economists forecast inflation to ease to 5.39 percent next year,
compared with the previous estimate of 5.42 percent.  Economic growth will quicken in 2012, especially in the
second half, fueled by the delayed and cumulative effect of
policy makers’  interest rate  cuts, Tombini told senators
yesterday in Brasilia.  Tombini reiterated that inflation will continue to
decelerate in the months ahead and meet the central bank’s 4.5
percent target next year.  The central banker’s comments yesterday may have eased
medium-term inflation expectations, said Nakahodo. Traders in
the interest rate futures market raised bets for lower borrowing
costs, pushing yields for contracts maturing in January 2013
down 6 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.82 percent
at 10:13 a.m. Brasilia time. The real fell 0.4 percent to 1.8528
per dollar.  Gross domestic product shrank 0.04 percent in the third
quarter from the previous three months, the first such
contraction since the first quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
