The Italian economy contracted in
the third quarter, signaling the country may have entered its
fifth recession since 2001 as the government adopts new
austerity measures that will further weigh on growth.  Gross domestic product  dropped 0.2 percent from the second
quarter, when it grew 0.3 percent, Rome-based national
statistics institute Istat said in its final GDP report today.
It was the first contraction since the final three months of
2009 and matched the median forecast for a 0.2 percent
contraction in a survey of 23 economists by Bloomberg News. The
economy expanded 0.2 percent from a year earlier, Istat said.  Consumer spending  declined 0.2 percent from the second
quarter, with investment declining 0.6 percent. Exports grew 1.6
percent in the quarter, while imports fell 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
