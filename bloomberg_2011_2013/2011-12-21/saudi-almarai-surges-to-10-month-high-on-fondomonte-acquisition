  Almarai Co. (ALMARAI)  rallied to a 10-month
high after  Saudi Arabia ’s largest food producer by market value
acquired Fondomonte SA for 312 million riyals ($83 million).  The shares climbed 3.4 percent to 100 riyals, the highest
intraday level since Feb. 23, at 1:08 p.m. in  Riyadh . The stock
is down 11 percent this year.  Riyadh-based Almarai financed the acquisition of
Fondomonte, which owns and operates three farms in Argentina,
with its cashflow and Islamic banking facilities, the company
said.  Almarai is expanding its supply chain and access to feed
for its dairy herd and poultry business “in line with the Saudi
government’s trend to secure supplies and preserve local
resources,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
