Members of the Mercosur trade bloc
agreed to work together to block ships flying the flag of the
Falkland Islands from their ports in a bid to pressure the U.K.
to join  Argentina  in talks over archipelago’s political future.  Mercosur countries, which include Argentina, Brazil and
Uruguay, will work together to ensure that boats rejected from
entering one port for flying the Falklands flag won’t be allowed
to dock elsewhere in the region, the Argentine Foreign Ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
