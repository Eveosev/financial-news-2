Cotton futures were little changed
as demand ebbed and the dollar rebounded.  Orange juice  also
dropped.  The greenback rose against a basket of major currencies,
eroding the appeal of U.S. exports. The dollar dropped in the
previous four sessions. Estimated cotton-futures volume
yesterday in New York was 8,587 contracts, compared with a daily
average of 64,519 in the previous three months.  “Demand is still abysmal, and trading volumes are very
light” before the holidays,  Chris Kramedjian, a senior risk-
 management consultant  at INTL FCStone in Nashville,  Tennessee ,
said in a telephone interview. “With the dollar higher, people
looking at the macroeconomic environment would sell this
market.”  Cotton for March delivery rose 0.04 cent to 86.84 cents a
pound at 10:28 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier,
the commodity dropped as much as 0.5 percent. The price dropped
0.3 percent yesterday. Before today, the fiber plunged 40
percent this year amid rising supplies and dwindling demand.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery declined 1.1
percent to $1.63 a pound. Before today, the price dropped 6.6
percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
