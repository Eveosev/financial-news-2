What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain in the next four
days in parts of Brazil and Argentina aids crops after dry
weather reduced soil moisture this month, Chad Henderson, a
market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that rain may improve conditions for developing
crops in  South America , Henderson said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open steady to 0.05 cent a pound lower, and soybean-
meal futures may open $2 to $3 lower per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that rain and snow this week
improved yield potential in the U.S. Great Plains after farmers
planted crops in dry soils from September to November, Henderson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
