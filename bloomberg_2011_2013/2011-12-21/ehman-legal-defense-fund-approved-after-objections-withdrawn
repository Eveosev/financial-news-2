Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
creditors committee withdrew their objections to a plan by the
defunct firm to put $2 million in a legal defense fund to help
the firm’s previous directors fight lawsuits, and a judge
approved the plan.  Lehman last week named a new board to oversee a $65 billion
liquidation plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
