Spectra Energy Corp. (SE)  plans to spend
about $500 million in Ohio to expand shipping capacity on its
Texas Eastern pipeline system to handle rising natural-gas
production from the Utica and Marcellus shale formations.  American Electric Power Co. (AEP)  and  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) ,
the largest holder of Utica Shale leases, signed an agreement to
develop 70 miles (113 kilometers) of new lines, Houston-based
Spectra said today in a statement. The addition in Ohio will
raise shipping capacity by 1 billion cubic feet a day, or about
18 percent, Wendy Olson, a Spectra spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail today.  Production from U.S. shale deposits, where water and
chemicals are pumped underground at high pressure to break apart
dense rock and release gas, more than doubled from 2007 to 2009,
according to Energy Department  data .  American Electric, the largest U.S. coal burner, is
pursuing pipeline capacity for gas-fired  power plants , Spectra
said. The utility owner, based in Columbus, Ohio, has  estimated 
that tighter U.S. air-pollution restrictions may force it to
close some coal-burning plants.  “We do anticipate more than one plant will attach” to the
new gas lines, Olson said.  Chesapeake is pursuing additional shipping capacity for its
production, Spectra said. The Oklahoma City-based company is the
largest oil and gas leaseholder in the Utica shale with 1.4
million  net acres .  Spectra rose 1.6 percent to close at $30.50 in New York,
the highest since it was spun off by  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  in
January 2007. American Electric shares rose 2.3 percent to
$40.85, its highest since July 9, 2008. Chesapeake shares rose
to $22.99.  The project is slated to begin operating in November 2014,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
