Russian billionaires  Mikhail Fridman 
and  Viktor Vekselberg  are among potential bidders for Moscowâ€™s
Domodedovo Airport, the largest in Eastern Europe, Vedomosti

$5 billion, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  Summa Group, a co-owner of OAO Novorossiysk Commercial
Seaport, is also interested in the company, as are billionaires
