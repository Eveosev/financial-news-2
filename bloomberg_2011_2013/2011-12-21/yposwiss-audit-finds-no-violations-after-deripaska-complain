An audit of Hyposwiss Private Bank
AG found no evidence of money laundering, following allegations
by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska against a former member of
the Zurich-based bank’s board.  Hyposwiss asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine its books
after Deripaska filed a legal complaint in  Switzerland  saying
that Hans Bodmer, a Swiss lawyer who resigned from the bank’s
board last month, helped loot  MMC Norilsk Nickel OJSC. (GMKN)  According
to the complaint, Bodmer did work in 2010 for billionaire
 Vladimir Potanin  and his Interros Holding Co., which holds about
30 percent of Norilsk. Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal, the world’s
largest aluminum producer, owns 25 percent of Norilsk. The two
are fighting over control.  “PwC examined the bank’s compliance with criminal law
standards concerning money laundering for the period from 1 July
2010 to 31 October 2011,” St. Galler Kantonal Bank AG, which
owns Hyposwiss, said today in a  statement . “They confirmed that
the bank had not violated criminal  money laundering 
provisions.”  Swiss prosecutors have rejected Deripaska’s complaint that
Potanin and Bodmer stole $1 billion from Norilsk. Deripaska
subsequently brought the complaint to the Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
