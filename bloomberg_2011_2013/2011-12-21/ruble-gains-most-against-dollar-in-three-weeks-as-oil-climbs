The ruble appreciated against the
dollar for a second day, strengthening the most this month,
after the price of crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export, advanced
for a third day.  The Russian currency rose 0.6 percent to 31.7525 by 11:45
a.m. in Moscow, heading for its biggest daily gain since Nov.
30. The ruble edged up 0.6 percent to 41.6375 versus the euro,
leaving it 0.6 percent stronger at 36.1984 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Oil futures increased for a third day in  New York ,
advancing as much as 1.2 percent to $98.44 a barrel, after data
from the  American Petroleum Institute  showed crude inventories
dropped to the lowest in almost two years. Brent oil for
February settlement on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange rose as much as 84 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $107.57 a
barrel.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
32.1984 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 32.4518 per dollar yesterday. The contracts are a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow foreign
investors and companies to fix the  exchange rate  at a particular
level in the future.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 fell,
pushing the yield eight basis points higher to 4.783 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
