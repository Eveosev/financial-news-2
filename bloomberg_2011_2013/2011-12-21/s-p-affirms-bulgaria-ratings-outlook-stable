Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service
confirmed its long- and short-term foreign and local currency
sovereign credit ratings on  Bulgaria  at ‘BBB/A-3’ with a stable
outlook.  The ratings reflect “the government’s strong track record
of appropriate fiscal policy and low gross and net general
government debt,” the ratings company said today in a
statement. S&P expects Bulgaria’s economic recovery “to lose
steam in 2012, and growth to decline to 1.5 percent, from around
2.0 percent in 2011,” reflecting an economic slowdown in
Bulgaria’s main trading partners in the European Union.  S&P rates Bulgaria’s long-term sovereign debt level with
Russia and  Lithuania . Bulgaria’s sovereign debt is rated Baa2 by
Moody’s and BBB- by  Fitch Ratings .  Bulgaria, the EU’s poorest country in terms of economic
output per capita, withstood the global recession in 2009
without an international bailout. Its economic growth slowed to
1.6 percent from a year earlier in the third quarter, the
weakest in five quarters, as demand for exports among the
country’s main trading partners dwindled. Bulgaria ships 60
percent of its exports to the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
