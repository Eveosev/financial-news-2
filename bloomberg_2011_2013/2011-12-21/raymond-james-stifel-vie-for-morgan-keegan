Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF)  resumed
talks to buy  Regions Financial Corp. (RF) ’s Morgan Keegan brokerage
unit, setting up a bidding contest with Stifel Financial Corp.,
said three people with knowledge of the matter.  A period of exclusive negotiations with Stifel, based in
St. Louis, has expired, allowing Raymond James to revive
discussions, said two of the people, who spoke on condition of
anonymity as the matter is private. Neither is likely to reach a
deal for Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan before the end
of the year, the people said.  Jana Strange, a spokeswoman for St. Petersburg, Florida-
based Raymond James, declined to comment, as did Evelyn Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions. A
spokeswoman for  Stifel (SF)  didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
