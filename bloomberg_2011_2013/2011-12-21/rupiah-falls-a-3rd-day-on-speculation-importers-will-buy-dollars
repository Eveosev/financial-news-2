Indonesia’s rupiah dropped for a
third day on speculation importers will step up dollar purchases
before the Christmas holiday to pay month-end bills.  The currency declined 0.8 percent this week as concern
about  Europe ’s debt crisis offset Fitch Ratings’ upgrade of the
Southeast Asian nation’s long-term foreign- and local-currency
debt to BBB-, the lowest investment grade. The rupiah fell 1
percent this year, headed for its first annual loss since 2008.  “There tends to be growing dollar demand as the month-end
approaches,” said Minori Uchida, senior analyst in  Tokyo  at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “The credit upgrading is a
supportive factor but sentiment isn’t strong for emerging-market
assets like Indonesia due to lingering European debt concerns.”  The rupiah dropped 0.3 percent to 9,106 per dollar as of
9:31 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may trade in a range of
9,050 to 9,200 through to the year-end, Uchida said.  Foreign ownership  of  Indonesia ’s government debt stood at
221.5 trillion rupiah ($24.3 billion) as of Dec. 19, down from
223.9 trillion rupiah a week earlier, according to data from the
ministry of finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
