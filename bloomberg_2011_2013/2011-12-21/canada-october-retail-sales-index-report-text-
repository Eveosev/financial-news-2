The following is the text of
 Canada 's retail sales report for October as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales rose 1.0% to $38.6 billion in October, a
third consecutive monthly increase. Gains were reported in
7 of 11 subsectors, representing 76% of retail sales. The
increase was led by higher sales at motor vehicle and
parts dealers and gasoline stations.  In volume terms, sales were also up for a third month
in a row, rising 0.6% in October.  Retail sales increase in October  Motor vehicle and parts dealers saw a 2.0% increase in
sales in October. This gain was mainly accounted for by
higher sales at new car dealers (+2.4%), which rose for a
third straight month. Sales increases were also reported
in the "other motor vehicle dealers" industry (+2.4%) and
at automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (+1.6%).
Used car dealers reported a 2.9% decline.  Gasoline station sales rose 1.8%, mainly reflecting
higher prices at the pump. Sales in this subsector have
been on an upward trend since the middle of 2010.  Sales at food and beverage stores increased for a fifth
consecutive month, rising 0.6% in October. Gains were
reported by all store types in this subsector.  Clothing and clothing accessories stores sales went up
1.9%. The largest contributor to the increase was clothing
stores (+1.6%). Jewellery, luggage and leather store sales
rose 3.5%, continuing a strong upward trend that began in
spring 2011.  Sales advanced 1.7% at sporting goods, hobby, book and
music stores. Sales at these stores have grown 5.0% since
July.  General merchandise store sales, which account for 12%
of total retail sales, decreased 0.5%.  Sales at furniture and home furnishings stores
decreased for a second consecutive month, declining 0.8%
in October. Lower sales at furniture stores (-1.5%) were
partially offset by a 0.3% gain in sales at home
furnishings stores.  Highest growth in Western provinces  Retail sales rose in eight provinces in October, with
the Western provinces reporting the highest growth.  Alberta (+3.0%) registered the largest sales gain, in
part reflecting strong sales of new motor vehicles.  Sales in British Columbia rose 1.7% in October
following an upward trend that started at the end of 2010.  Sales in both Manitoba and Saskatchewan rose 1.9%.  After two consecutive monthly gains, sales in Ontario
edged down 0.1% in October.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted
