Tim Tebow  has had the magic touch in
leading the  Denver Broncos  to fourth-quarter comeback victories
this season and becoming one of the National Football League’s
most talked-about players.  Even he couldn’t help the  Buffalo Bills  sell out their
Christmas Eve home game. Not even close.  There are 24,000 unsold tickets for the Bills’ Dec. 24 game
against Tebow and the Broncos at 73,000-seat Ralph Wilson
Stadium in Orchard Park,  New York , where the temperature is
forecast to reach a high of 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees
Celsius). The Bills are averaging 65,625 fans for each home game
this year, 18th out of 32 teams.  Because the game isn’t a sellout, it will be blacked out on
local television, the Bills said. It’s the third straight
blackout for the Bills, who have spiraled out of playoff
contention with seven consecutive losses since starting the
season 5-2.  The Broncos have gone the other direction, winning seven of
nine games since Tebow took over as the starting quarterback. At
8-6, Denver has overcome a 1-4 start and sits atop the American
Football Conference’s West division as it seeks a playoff berth.  Buffalo isn’t the only NFL market with a local TV blackout
on Christmas Eve. The  Cincinnati Bengals , who rank last in the
league in attendance at 48,216, failed to sell out this week’s
game against the Arizona Cardinals even though they have an 8-6
record and are challenging for an AFC wild-card playoff berth,
which goes to one of the two teams with the best record among
non-division champions in each conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
