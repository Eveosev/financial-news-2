  South Africa ’s  Crop Estimates
Committee  will probably leave its forecast for the country’s
winter-wheat harvest unchanged, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The committee may say that farmers will reap 1.8 million
metric tons of the grain, the same as projected last month,
according to the median estimate of three traders surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The committee, which consists of representatives from the
Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural Research Council,
Statistics South Africa and the National Agricultural Marketing
Council, is scheduled to release its fifth forecast for the
winter crop today at 3:30 p.m. Johannesburg time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
