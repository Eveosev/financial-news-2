The Limpopo province branch of  South
Africa ’s ruling African National Congress adopted a resolution
calling for the nationalization of mines and the seizure of land
without compensation, the South African Press Association said.  Ending private ownership of South Africa’s economic
resources will help achieve “economic emancipation” in the
continent’s largest economy, the Johannesburg-based  news agency 
said, citing a declaration adopted at the party’s conference.  The ANC’s youth wing, led by Julius Malema, has led calls
for the nationalization of mines and the seizure of land in
South Africa, where more than a quarter of the population is
unemployed. The ANC, led by Jacob Zuma, have said that mine
nationalization isn’t government policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
