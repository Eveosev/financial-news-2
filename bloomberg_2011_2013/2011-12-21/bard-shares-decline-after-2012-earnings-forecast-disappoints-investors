C.R. Bard Inc. (BCR) , maker of catheters
and surgical devices, dropped as much as 6.3 percent in  New York 
trading after its 2012 profit forecast missed analyst estimates.  Bard fell 5.2 percent to $83.24 at 10:37 a.m. New York
time, after declining to $82.22. Earnings excluding some items
will rise 3 percent to 4 percent, weighed down by the cost of
acquiring Lutonix Inc.,  Murray Hill , New Jersey-based Bard said
on a conference call yesterday.  Lutonix received $225 million upfront and is eligible for
an additional $100 million if it gets U.S. approval for a drug-
coated balloon to clear clogged leg arteries, Bard said
yesterday. The acquisition cost will cut 2012 profit by 25 cents
a share, Bard said. The forecast implies earnings of $6.57 to
$6.64, less than the $6.98 analysts expected, said  Joanne Wuensch , an analyst with BMO Capital Markets in New York.  The guidance “may be somewhat disappointing to investors,
as it is below consensus, even before the Lutonix dilution,”
Wuensch wrote in a note to investors today.  Bard’s shares had fallen 6.6 percent in the 12 months
before today.  Lutonix, which is based in  Minneapolis  and had been closely
held, is studying its balloon technology for peripheral arterial
disease, a narrowing of the leg arteries that can lead to
amputation. The malady afflicts 8 million to 12 million
Americans.  The market for drug-coated balloons may reach $1 billion
within 10 years, Bard said a statement yesterday. None of the
balloons are approved in the U.S.  The study will enroll 476 patients, who will be tracked for
five years after treatment. The company plans to file for Food
and Drug Administration clearance of the balloon after patients
have been followed for one year. The device is already approved
in  Europe , and Bard said it expects to begin selling it there in
the second half of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
