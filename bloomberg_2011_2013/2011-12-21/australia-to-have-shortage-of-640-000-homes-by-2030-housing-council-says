Australia  is facing a shortage of
more than 640,000 homes over the next 20 years as demand
outstrips supply, the National Housing Supply Council predicts.  The gap between demand for housing and supply increased by
28,200 in the year to June 30, 2010, to a total of 186,800 since
2001, the council, established by the Australian Treasurer and
the Minister for Housing three years ago, said in its  State of
Supply Report  released today. It will rise to 328,800 by 2015,
the council forecasts.  “Supply is likely to fall short of the medium-growth
projections in the short term,” it said in the report. “This
growing gap indicates that housing production needs to lift well
above trend to reduce the likelihood that housing shortages and
poor affordability impact adversely on economic growth and
standards of living.”  Home building approvals in Australia slumped 29.8 percent
in October from a year earlier, the steepest drop since January
2009, as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighed on consumer sentiment.
 Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  cut the
benchmark  interest rate  by a quarter percentage point on Nov. 1
and again this month to 4.25 percent, to help the economy ride
out global economic uncertainty.  Underlying demand for housing grew by about 159,200
dwellings in the year to June 30, 2010, higher than the 156,500
forecast in the previous report, while supply increased by
131,000 homes, less than the 140,700 projected, the council said
in today’s report.  Shortage Myth?  The biggest shortfalls were in New South Wales and
Queensland states, the council said.  “There still isn’t a single item of proof to support that
a housing shortage exists today, let alone in 20 years,” Kris
Sayce, editor of Melbourne-based online newsletter  Money Morning
Australia , who argues the housing shortage is a myth, said in an
e-mail. “The report simply takes 2001 as a base year and
extrapolates data from that point assuming a perfect balance --
which even the council admits may not have been the case.”  The report calculates the gap between demand and supply
based on changes since June 2001, when the market was close to
“equilibrium” the council said. It doesn’t take into account
the extent to which underlying demand and supply were out of
balance at that time, it said.  Not Enough Dwellings  “We are simply not producing enough dwellings for the
current and projected future number of households in
Australia,” Urban Development Institute of Australia’s National
President Julie Katz said in an e-mailed statement. “Without
action from all levels of government to curb this lack of supply,
Australia’s housing affordability problem will go from bad to
worse.”  Australia has the most unaffordable homes in the English-
speaking world, with dwellings costing 6.1 times the gross
annual median household income, compared with 3 times in the U.S.
and 5.2 times in the U.K., according to a January report by
Belleville, Illinois-based consulting company Demographia.  The median  price  for houses and apartments across all
regions in Australia was A$316,000 as of Oct. 31, according to
real estate researcher RP Data. That compares with a median of
$171,475 in the U.S., based on figures from property website
 Zillow.com.   While the housing market has slowed since the middle of
2010, the gap between supply and demand has continued to widen,
the report said.  Softening Demand  “While a softening of demand and prices and a projected
widening gap between supply and underlying demand might seem
contradictory, the council does not believe these phenomena are
inconsistent in the short term,” according to the report. “The
supply gap means that housing costs are higher than they would
otherwise be, but there can still be volatility around these
higher levels.”  Home prices  fell 4 percent in the year to Oct. 31,
according to real estate researcher RP Data, after rising 4.7
percent in 2010 and 13.6 percent in 2009.  Lack of finance for apartment projects has contributed to a
significant decline in supply, even as the nation’s ageing
population and an increase in single-person households and those
without children push demand for higher-density developments
higher, the council said.  The number of households is Australia is expected to
increase to 12 million in 2030 from 8.7 million as of June 2010,
the report estimates. The rising demand help eased the decline
in prices of apartments, which slid 1.7 percent in October from
a year ago, compared with a 4.7 percent drop in  house prices ,
according to RP Data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
