Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
mobile phone operator, said service on its 4G data network has
been restored after the second disruption this month.  The service was “restored for all 4G customers” after an
issue this morning, the company said in an e-mailed statement.
Earlier today, Verizon Wireless said 4G LTE service was
“returning to normal” after engineers worked to resolve the
disruption. The Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based carrier didn’t
disclose the cause or the nature of the repairs.  Users began reporting a lack of 4G data connections on
their phones and sporadic 3G service early today, on the
company’s 4G LTE Community forum. Users in Michigan, Virginia,
Pennsylvania, Nevada and New York said they lost service.  The company, a joint venture between  Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ)  and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , had a 4G LTE service disruption of
almost 24 hours starting on Dec. 7. Verizon Wireless said that
by the evening of Dec. 8 service was fully restored after a
“network operations team resolved a technical issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
