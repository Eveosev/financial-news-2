Emerson Electric Co. (EMR)  declined the
most since Sept. 30 after reporting November orders that were
lower than analysts’ estimates.  Emerson fell 5.4 percent to $46.97 at 4 p.m. in New York
trading. The shares have dropped 18 percent this year.  The St. Louis-based company’s trailing three-month orders
for November, excluding foreign exchange, rose 4 to 5 percent
compared with 8 percent in October and below the guidance range
of 5 to 7 percent, Julian Mitchell, a New York-based analyst
with Credit Suisse, said in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
