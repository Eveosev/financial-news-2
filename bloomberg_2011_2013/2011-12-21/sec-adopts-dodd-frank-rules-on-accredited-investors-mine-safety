The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission adopted a pair of final Dodd-Frank Act rules that set
asset requirements for “accredited investors” and require
mining companies to disclose safety information, according to
statements released today by the agency.  The new standard for accredited investors, who are allowed
to make higher-risk investments not available to the general
public, requires individuals to have at least $1 million in net
worth, not including their primary residence. The agency must
review the standard regularly to decide whether it needs further
adjustments.  The second rule calls for mining companies to include
“mine-by-mine” safety and health information in routine public
disclosures.  Dodd-Frank directed the SEC to write about a hundred rules
in an effort to overhaul the U.S. financial system in the wake
of the 2008 credit crisis.  The mine safety regulation is one of three Dodd-Frank
disclosure rules -- along with one on companies’ use of so-
called conflict minerals from Central Africa and another on
reporting payments from oil and gas companies to foreign
governments -- that fell outside of the agency’s usual
financial-system expertise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
