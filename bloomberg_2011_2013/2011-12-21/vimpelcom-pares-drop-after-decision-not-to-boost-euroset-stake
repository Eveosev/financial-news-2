VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  pared its decline in
New York trading after the company said it won’t exercise a  call
option  to boost its stake in mobile-phone retailer Euroset
Holding NV, operator of Russia’s biggest mobile-phone retailer.  American depositary receipts of VimpelCom fell 0.9 percent
to $9.49 by 2:37 p.m. in New York, after earlier dropping as
much as 2.3 percent, the most since Dec. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  VimpelCom, which has owned 49.9 percent of Euroset since
2008, has decided against acquiring an additional 24.95 percent
of the company, according to a statement issued by PR Newswire
today. VimpelCom had until January to consider whether to take
up the call option.  Amsterdam-based VimpelCom sold $3.7 billion of debt this
year, the biggest Russian corporate bond issuer, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
