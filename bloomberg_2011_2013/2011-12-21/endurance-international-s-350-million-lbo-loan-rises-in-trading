Endurance International Group Inc.’s
$350 million  term loan , which backs the acquisition of the
company from Accel-KKR Co. by Warburg Pincus LLC and GS Capital
Partners, rose in initial trading.  The six-year debt began trading at 99.5 cents on the
dollar, according to data provider Markit Ltd. The financing was
sold to investors at 98 cents, Bloomberg data show.  Credit Suisse Group AG arranged the deal for Burlington,
Massachusetts-based Endurance, Bloomberg data show. The loan
pays interest at 6.25 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, with a 1.5 percent floor.  Warburg and GS Capital, a private-equity investment arm of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are buying Endurance International for
an undisclosed amount from Accel-KKR, according to a Nov. 7
statement distributed by PRNewswire. Endurance’s current
management team and Accel-KKR will maintain an interest in the
company, the statement said.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
