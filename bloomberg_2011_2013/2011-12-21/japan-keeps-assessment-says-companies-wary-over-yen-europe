Japan’s government said the economy
is still picking up slowly from the country’s March disaster,
with companies exercising caution because of the yen’s
appreciation and the euro region debt crisis.  “Firms’ judgment on current business conditions shows a
small improvement, although that for large manufacturers is
deteriorating,” the Cabinet Office said in a monthly report in
 Tokyo  today. The government left its assessment unchanged for
the second straight month.  The report again cited the situation in  Europe  as a threat
to Japan’s prospects.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
last month signaled the central bank is prepared to increase
stimulus to counter the impact of Europe’s deepening crisis.
Global economic uncertainty and a yen close to a postwar high
against the dollar has prompted companies to postpone
investments, with  capital spending  in the third quarter falling
9.8 percent from the previous quarter.  The BOJ’s Tankan large manufacturer index of sentiment fell
to minus 4 in December from positive 2 in September, indicating
there are more pessimists than optimists. Small enterprise
sentiment improved to minus 8 from minus 11.  The government said a comprehensive package to counter the
strong yen and the third supplementary budget of the fiscal year
are being swiftly implemented. It dropped any mention of the
record flooding in  Thailand , indicating that its impact on the
Japanese economy has subsided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
