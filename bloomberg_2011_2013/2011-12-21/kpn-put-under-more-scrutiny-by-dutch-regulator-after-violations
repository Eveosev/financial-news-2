Royal KPN NV (KPN) , the biggest Dutch
telephone company, was put under increased supervision by
the country’s telecommunications regulator because of
undisclosed violations.  “OPTA has taken action against this violation,”
Cynthia Heijne, a spokeswoman for the regulator in  The Hague ,
said by telephone today. KPN has appealed the ruling and the
regulator may give further details in January.  “Because of the pending proceedings, OPTA can’t comment on
the nature and size of the violations,” the regulator said
today in a  statement . KPN expects to make a statement later
today, Marianne Zwart, a company spokeswoman, said by telephone.  OPTA put KPN under increased supervision in 2005 after the
phone company gave illegal discounts to corporate customers, for
which it was fined 17 million euros ($22 million). Dutch
competition regulator NMa is separately investigating KPN and
other telephone companies for possible antitrust violations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
