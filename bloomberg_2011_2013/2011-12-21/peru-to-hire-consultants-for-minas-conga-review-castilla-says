Peru’s government will proceed with
an international environmental review of  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s
stalled $4.8 billion gold deposit amid opposition from
protesters, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said.  Peru seeks to bring online $50 billion in mining projects
including Newmont’s Minas Conga mine after talks collapsed this
week, Castilla said.  “Peru doesn’t have the luxury of going without mining
investment, especially at a time when the external situation
looks unfavorable,” Castilla said today at a news conference in
Lima. “We’re trying to ensure investment projects go ahead
while respecting the environment and the community.”  Newmont, based in Greenwood Village, Colorado, suspended
work last month at Minas Conga, Peru’s biggest venture, after
villagers in the northern Andes protested that the mine will dry
up water supplies. Companies including  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and
 Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  have cut back investment in Peru because of the
protests, central bank President Julio Velarde said Dec. 16.  Newmont fell less than 1 percent to close at $62.88 in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
