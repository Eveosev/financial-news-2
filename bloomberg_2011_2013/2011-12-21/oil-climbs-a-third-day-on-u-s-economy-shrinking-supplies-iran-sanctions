Oil traded near its highest in a
week in  New York  on signs that the  U.S. economy  will be spared a
recession and amid growing pressure on Iran to curtail its
nuclear program.  Futures were little changed after rising as much as 1.3
percent. The  American Petroleum Institute  showed  crude
inventories  dropped to the lowest in almost two years. Analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey predicted the  Energy Department  will
say today supplies fell 2.13 million barrels. The February
contract surged 3.4 percent yesterday on U.S. housing data that
beat estimates, unexpected growth in German business confidence
and concern that shipments from Iran may be curbed.  “Oil has been strengthening as we get more positive U.S.
economic data, such as housing starts, along with a recovery in
the euro and the possibility of Iranian reprisals,” said  Robert Montefusco , senior broker at Sucden Financial Ltd. in  London .  Crude for February delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was at $97.28 a barrel at 1:32 p.m. London time, up 4
cents, after rising as much as $1.26 to $98.50, the highest
since Dec. 14. The contract yesterday climbed $3.19 to $97.24.
Front-month futures have risen 6.5 percent this year after
gaining 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for February settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was down 23 cents at $106.50 a barrel
after rising $1.03, or 1 percent, to $107.76 a barrel. The
European benchmark contract was at a premium of $9.27 to New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade. The spread widened to
a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Pressure on  Iran   The Obama administration and European Union governments are
seeking help from Arab and Asian allies to reduce Iran’s oil
revenues. EU nations, the U.S. and Asia-Pacific allies discussed
possible measures in  Rome  yesterday and agreed to increase
pressure on Iran, the world’s No. 3 crude exporter in 2010, to
abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program, according to an
Italian Foreign Ministry statement.  U.S. crude inventories fell to 330 million barrels last
week, the lowest since the period ended Jan. 22 last year, the
industry-funded API said yesterday.  Gasoline stockpiles decreased 394,000 barrels to 213.9
million, based on the API data. The Energy Department report may
show supplies probably climbed 1.5 million barrels, according to
the  median estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Distillate-fuel stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel,
are expected to have declined 750,000 barrels.  The Energy Department will release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. in  Washington  today.  Oil in New York has technical resistance along the middle
Bollinger Band, around $98.20 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sell orders tend to be clustered near
chart-resistance levels.  U.S. Housing Market  Home builders in the U.S. broke ground in November on more
houses than at any time in the past 19 months.  Housing starts 
increased 9.3 percent to an annual rate of 685,000, the highest
since April 2010, a Commerce Department report showed yesterday.
A median 635,000 gain was forecast by 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. A report today may show sales of existing homes
in the U.S. increased last month.  “Economic data is painting a better global growth
scenario, and that’s clearly feeding into firmer  oil prices ,”
said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market strategist at CMC Markets
Asia Pacific Pty in Sydney who predicts New York futures will
settle between $99 and $102 a barrel at the end of the year.
“We’ll be watching the inventory data tonight following the
API.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
