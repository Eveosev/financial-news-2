German stocks (DAX)  retreated as borrowing
costs increased for Italy and  Spain  amid fading optimism that
the  European Central Bank ’s loans to euro-area lenders will stem
the sovereign-debt crisis.  SAP AG (SAP)  and Software AG led declines after Oracle Corp., the
world’s second-biggest maker of business-management software,
missed analysts’ estimates.  The DAX Index dropped 1 percent to 5,791.53 at the close in
 Frankfurt  after earlier advancing as much as 2 percent and
retreating as much as 1.3 percent. The benchmark measure has
fallen 16 percent this year amid concern that policy makers are
struggling to contain the region’s debt crisis. The broader HDAX
Index lost 0.9 percent today.  “It could continue to be a very difficult and volatile
environment,” said Tristan Hanson, head of  asset allocation  at
Ashburton Ltd. in  Jersey , the  Channel Islands . “That doesn’t
mean that equities will not rise over the year, but I don’t
expect it to be an easy ride.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB awarded 489 billion euros ($638
billion) in three-year loans, more than the median estimate of
293 billion euros by economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
ECB said 523 banks asked for the funds, which it will lend at
the average of its benchmark rate over the term of the loans.  Yields on  Spain’s two-year notes  advanced 29 basis points
to 3.64 percent. They earlier fell as much as 11 basis points.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds  rose 21 basis points to 5.27
percent, trimming a six-day decline.  Italy’s two-year yields 
added 11 basis points to 5.09 percent.  SAP, the world’s biggest maker of  business software ,
declined 6.1 percent to 39.92 euros after Oracle Corp. posted
fiscal second-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ estimates,
hurt by slower demand for databases, applications and computer
servers.  Software AG (SOW)  slid 4.9 percent to 27.25 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
