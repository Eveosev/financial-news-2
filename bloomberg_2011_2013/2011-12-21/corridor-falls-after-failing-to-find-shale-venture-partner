Corridor Resources Inc. (CDH)  shares fell
to their lowest in almost seven years after the Halifax-based
petroleum explorer said it hasn’t attracted a joint-venture
partner for a shale-gas prospect in  New Brunswick .  Corridor fell as much as 46 percent to 97 cents, the lowest
intraday price since Jan. 4, 2005. The shares were down 62 cents
at C$1.20 as of 12:31 p.m. in Toronto.  Low prices for natural gas and the “current economic
environment” are the reasons it failed to find a partner for
its resources near Elgin, New Brunswick, Corridor said in a
statement. The company will continue to look for a partner next
year.  The explorer expects to end 2011 with C$6 million ($5.8
million) of working capital and no debt, it said in the
statement. The company focuses on exploration in  Canada ’s
eastern provinces.  To contact the reporters on this story:
