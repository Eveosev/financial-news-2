Taiwan’s government bonds fell for a
fourth day and the local dollar strengthened after U.S. housing
starts rose more than economists forecast, brightening the
outlook for the island’s exporters.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose by the most in
almost three weeks after official data yesterday showed housing
starts increased 9 percent to 685,000 in November, exceeding the
highest estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission said yesterday it will
let Chinese banks buy stakes in local lenders and financial
holding companies, starting Jan. 2.  “Yields are up today as there’s some strong and positive
news out there supporting stocks,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-
based fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “Yields
have room to go up before the end of the year as investors scale
back their rate-cut speculation.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due September 2021,
the most-traded  government securities , increased one basis point
to 1.28 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.
Benchmark 10-year rates may rise to 1.3 percent by the end of
the year, Lee forecast.  Taiwan will announce its 2012 debt issuance plan on Dec. 23.
Eight of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict central
bank Governor Perng Fain-nan and his board will leave  interest
rates  unchanged at 1.875 percent when they review borrowing
costs on Dec. 29. Two expect a cut to 1.750 percent.  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.2 percent to NT$30.285 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$30.210 earlier, the strongest level in a week.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.398 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
