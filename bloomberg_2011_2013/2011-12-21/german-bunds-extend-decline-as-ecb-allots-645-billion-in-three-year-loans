German  government bonds  extended
their drop as the  European Central Bank  said it allotted 489
billion euros ($644 billion) in three-year loans to banks.  Ten-year German yields advanced seven basis points to 2.03
percent at 10:26 a.m. London time. Two-year note yields rose two
basis points to 0.24 percent.  French 10-year bonds rose, pushing the yield down three
basis points to 3.08 percent.  The Frankfurt-based ECB awarded 489 billion euros in 1,134-
day loans, more than economistsâ€™ median estimate of 293 billion
euros in a Bloomberg News survey. The ECB said 523 banks asked
for the funds, which will be lent at the average of its
benchmark rate, currently 1 percent, over the period of the
loans. They start tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
