Serbia’s government will limit by
decree retailers’ margins on staple foods to 10 percent,  Blic 
newspaper reported, citing a government source it didn’t name.  The move is expected to take effect by the end of the month
after Trade and Agriculture Minister Dusan Petrovic failed last
week to persuade leading retailers to reduce the margins, which
are now between 23 percent and 40 percent, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
