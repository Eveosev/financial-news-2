Bulgaria sold most of the state’s
33 percent stakes in the two Bulgarian units of Austrian power
utility  EVN AG (EVN)  for a total of 92.97 million lev ($63 million) on
the Bulgarian Stock Exchange.  Bulgaria sold 98.8 percent and 99.4 percent of its minority
stakes in EVN Bulgaria and EVN Bulgaria Electrosnabdiavane,
respectively, EVN’s two Bulgarian power units in charge of
distribution and grid operation, the Sofia-based bourse said in
an e-mail today.  The stock was sold on the first day of a 30-day mixed
closed auction at around 1,633 lev per share in
Electrorazpredelenie, EVN’s power distributor, and 156.6 lev per
share in Electrosnabdiavane, the EVN’s grid operation unit. The
stocks rose 18.8 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from the
minimum prices set by the asset-selling agency.  “The main buyers are most likely the majority owner and
the local pension funds,” Ilian Scarlatov, executive manager of
KBC Securities Bulgaria, said today.  The government is selling its minority stakes in all seven
power distributors, which were sold in 2005 to  Germany ’s  E.ON (EOAN) 
AG,  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and EVN in the run-up to joining the European Union.
E.ON has signed an agreement with Czech utility Energo-Pro to
sell its 100 percent subsidiary in Bulgaria in a deal worth 133
million euros ($174.1 million), the company said on Dec. 3.  EVN has 1.5 million customers in Plovdiv and Stara Zagora
in southern Bulgaria.  The Austrian utility has invested 900 million lev in the
Balkan country since 2005, to modernize the  power grid , build
two solar parks and a co-generation power plant, Jörg
Sollfellner, EVN Bulgaria regional manager, said in the bourse
in Sofia today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
