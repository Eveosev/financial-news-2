Azerbaijan  will sidestep the kind of
anti-government protests that have gripped Russia and Kazakhstan
because the population backs the government in the Caspian Sea
nation, APA reported.  “The policies of the current government are supported by
the people,” said Ali Hasanov, head of the political department
of President Ilham Aliyev’s office, according to the private
news service. “Therefore, there is no ground for such
developments to take place in Azerbaijan.”  Emboldened by popular movements that have toppled leaders
in the  Middle East , secular opposition parties in Azerbaijan,
the third-biggest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union ,
staged several protests in the capital, Baku, earlier this year
to demand Aliyev’s resignation.  Police have detained hundreds of protesters, some of whom
were later imprisoned for disrupting public order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
