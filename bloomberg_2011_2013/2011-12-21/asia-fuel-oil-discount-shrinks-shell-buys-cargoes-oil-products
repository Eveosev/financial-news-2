Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
narrowed. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought gasoline and naphtha
cargoes for a second day in  Singapore , the region’s largest oil-
trading center.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil was at a  discount  of $3.10 a barrel to Asian
marker Dubai crude at 4:46 p.m. Singapore time, down from $3.58
yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
difference shrank for the third time in four days, signaling
reduced losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke  fuel oil to  380-centistoke 
grade declined 50 cents to $11.75 a metric ton, PVM data showed.
This  viscosity spread  is the narrowest since Nov. 21, meaning
bunker, or marine fuel, has climbed less than higher-quality
fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Shell purchased two gasoline cargoes from Gunvor Group Ltd.,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window.  Europe ’s biggest oil company
paid $116.20 a barrel to load  97-RON  grade from Jan. 13 to Jan.
17 and $114.50 for a  95-RON  shipment for Jan. 14 to Jan. 18.  Shell also bought an open-specification forward  naphtha 
contract for second-half February delivery from Vitol Group,
paying $915 a ton, the survey showed.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
rebounded $6.08 to $99.23 a ton at 5:46 p.m. Singapore time,
based on Bloomberg data. This crack spread, a measure of profit
from making the petrochemical feedstock, is the widest in four
days.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 250,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur to Total SA, according to the Bloomberg survey.
The cargo, for loading between Jan. 11 and Jan. 15, changed
hands at 60 cents a barrel above January prices. Shell has sold
at least 1.4 million barrels of this grade so far this month,
more than any company in Singapore.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude fell 63 cents to $17.44 a
barrel at 4:46 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This  crack
spread  is the smallest in four days.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after dropping
to 40 cents a barrel, the lowest since April, PVM said. A
narrower  regrade  shows it is less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
