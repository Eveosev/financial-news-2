Thorntons Plc (THT) , a U.K. chocolate
maker, said full-year profit will fall short of forecasts
because people are spending less and supermarket promotions are
affecting margins.  The stock fell as much as 13.5 pence, or 36 percent, to
24.5 pence, in London trading, the lowest since 1989. It was
down 30 percent, at 26.5 pence, at 8.25 a.m. It has fallen 75
percent this year.  The company will break even at the pretax level when
exceptional items, impairment and lease charges are taken into
account, it said in a Regulatory News Service statement.  “What’s hurt Thorntons this year has been the fact there’s
a lot more promotion in supermarkets and suppliers are invited
to share some of that pain,”  David Jeary , an analyst at
Investec Securities, who has a “hold” recommendation, said by
phone. “On a 12-month view the outlook could remain
challenging.”  U.K. consumer confidence fell this month to its lowest
level since February 2009 as pessimism about the economy
increased amid continuing turmoil in the euro area, GfK NOP
Ltd., a London-based research group, said today. An index of
sentiment dropped two points from November to minus 33.  Thorntons, based in Alfreton, central  England , said in
October that 14-week total sales declined 7.6 percent to 46.5
million pounds ($73 million), in line with management forecasts.
Own-store sales declined 10.1 percent to 23.4 million pounds in
a “tough retail market.”  A further trading update will be issued on Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
