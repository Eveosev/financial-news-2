Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the U.S.
electric- car maker that plans to build a rechargeable sedan in
California, said a top-of-the-line version of the Model S will
cost as much as $92,400 when it goes on sale in 2012.  Tesla released detailed prices, features and options for
the Model S sedan today  on its website . The car will be built in
Fremont, California, with deliveries beginning in mid-2012.
Extended-range versions will have enough lithium-ion battery
capacity to travel as far as 300 miles per charge, Tesla said.  A base version with a 40-kilowatt-hour battery pack, able
to travel as far as 160 miles per charge, will cost $57,400
without accessories, according to Palo Alto, California-based
Tesla. A mid-grade version that can go 230 miles per charge will
have a base price of $67,400. All grades of the car qualify for
a $7,500 federal tax credit.  Tesla, which counts  Daimler AG (DAI) ,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
 Panasonic Corp. (6752)  as investors, wants to be the first profitable
maker of battery-powered autos. While it hasn’t yet reported an
annual profit, that may happen as early as 2013, Chief Executive
Officer Elon Musk said in an October interview.  Musk, who is also Tesla’s main shareholder, has said the
company has sold out next year’s production. It has orders for
more than 7,000 units of the vehicle, according to Ricardo Reyes, a company spokesman.  Tesla was little changed in extended trading after the
announcement. The shares rose 0.5 percent to $27.90 at the New
York close.  To contact the reporters on this story:
