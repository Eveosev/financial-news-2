Actor  Christian Bale , who  CNN 
reported jostled with guards when he tried to visit an activist
in China, isn’t welcome to “make news” in the country, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said today.  Bale “should be embarrassed” Liu said at a daily briefing
today, after CNN posted footage last week that it said showed
Bale scuffling with plainclothes guards when he tried to visit
Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer who is confined to his home in
the eastern province of Shandong.  Bale was in China to promote “The Flowers of War,” the
Chinese-made film in which he stars, when he went to visit Chen,
CNN said. The activist was released from prison last year after
serving a four year sentence for organizing couples who accused
officials of forcing them to have abortions.  “I understand that the actor was invited by the director
Zhang Yimou to attend the opening ceremony of the film but he
was not invited to fabricate news or shoot films in a certain
village in Shandong province,” Liu said. “The Chinese side
will not welcome him to make news in  China .”  Bale will star in the third film of director  Christopher
Nolan ’s Batman franchise in 2012. He won a best-supporting actor
Oscar this year for his role in the film “The Fighter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
