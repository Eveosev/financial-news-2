GMZ Energy Inc. , a nanotechnology
startup, received $14 million in venture capital funding to
develop a system that converts heat into electricity.  Mitsui & Co. (8031) ’s venture unit led the Series C funding round,
Waltham, Massachusetts-based GMZ said today in a statement.
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, I2BF Global Ventures, Energy
Technology Ventures and  BP Plc (BP/)  unit BP  Alternative Energy  also
participated.  GMZ uses nanotechnology to create thermoelectric materials,
which generate a charge when each side of the material is a
different temperature. The company plans to use the technology
to convert waste heat from industrial processes, solar heating
systems and cars into electricity.  “This investment will allow us to commercialize this
breakthrough and expand our product line more quickly and
efficiently,” GMZ Chief Executive Officer Aaron Bent said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
