Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO) 
sold a 40-story building in Boston for $610 million as it seeks
to reinvest capital in properties with growth potential.  UBS AG (UBSN)  purchased the office tower, located at 53 State St.
in the city’s financial district, said  Peter McKillop , a New
York-based spokesman for the Zurich-based bank. Brookfield
didn’t identify the buyer in its statement today.  “This disposition continues our active capital recycling
program in which we have sold $682 million of net assets over
the last 12-plus months,” Dennis Friedrich, the New York-based
company’s president and global chief investment officer, said in
the statement.  Brookfield, which had stakes in 111 properties at the end
of the third quarter, has been both buying and selling as it
seeks to move capital to buildings with the potential for
increases in rental income. It acquired a stake in 1801
California St., Denver’s second-tallest building, earlier this
month, and sold Newport Tower in  Jersey City , New Jersey, in
October for $377.5 million. That was the most ever paid for a
single New Jersey office property, according to Brookfield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
