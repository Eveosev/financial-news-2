Shakeel Ahmed, chairman of  Hindustan
Copper Ltd. (HCP) ,  India ’s monopoly miner of the ore, comments on the
outlook for copper prices in London and borrowing plans.  The company plans to raise overseas loans to fund a 40-
billion-rupee ($759 million) plan to expand mining capacity
fourfold to 12.4 million metric tons by March 2017 and won’t
sell new shares because of poor market conditions. Ahmed spoke
at his office in Kolkata, where the company is based.  On copper prices:  “Copper prices should remain between $7,000 and $8,500 per
ton. It has corrected to $7,300 per ton now from $10,000 per ton
in February. Our savior has been the 20 percent depreciation in
the rupee in the same period. So far, there hasn’t been any
significant impact on our revenue.  ‘‘The global economic outlook is not certain. The
uncertainty in the euro debt zone continues and there is some
slowing in the Chinese economy. These three factors will decide
the future direction of copper prices.’’  On borrowing plans:  ‘‘We will face a shortfall of about 2.07 billion rupees
between our revenue generation and investment requirement in the
financial year ending March 2014. External commercial borrowing
is our preferred option for raising the money.  ‘‘There is a natural hedge in our revenue model as our
copper prices are linked to global copper prices on  London  Metal
Exchange. So we don’t have to hedge our overseas borrowings.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
