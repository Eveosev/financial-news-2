Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s patent lawsuit
against Google Inc. over Android software may start as early as
April or as late as September, a federal judge said.  “I am reserving my right to put the trial on in April or
May, but as a practical matter mid-September may be the first
time we will be able to try the case,” U.S. District Judge
William Alsup in  San Francisco  told lawyers today during a
hearing. He also told the attorneys to keep October and November
open to avoid scheduling conflicts.  Oracle is seeking at least $1 billion in damages from the
operator of the world’s largest search engine. Oracle, based in
Redwood City,  California , accuses Google of infringing its Java
patents and copyrights in the Android operating system, now
running on more than 150 million mobile devices.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the
claims.  “I can’t see this case going to trial before the first day
of spring,” Alsup said in court today after the lawyers updated
him on the status of pre-trial evidence gathering and other
matters.  The case is Oracle America Inc. v.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
