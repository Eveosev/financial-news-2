EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) 
sold its Polish assets back to  Electricite de France SA (EDF)  as
 Germany ’s third-largest utility gears up for a 10 billion-euro
($13 billion) expansion of its renewable energy portfolio.  EnBW sold minority stakes in the assets for 301 million
euros, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The move seeks to open “important financial freedoms” as
the utility seeks to almost double its renewable energy capacity
to about 6,000 megawatts by 2020, Chief Executive Officer Hans-
Peter Villis said. The plan may require investments of 8 billion
euros to 10 billion euros, according to the statement.  EnBW and peers  EON AG ,  RWE AG (RWE)  and Vattenfall AB have
extended cost-cutting and asset-sale programs to curb losses
from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s decision to close the country’s
eight oldest nuclear reactors. EnBW reported a first-half net
loss of 590 million euros after having to mothball two of its
four reactors.  Seventeen percent of the company’s investments in the first
nine months were channeled into renewable energy projects,
including two planned offshore wind parks in the  Baltic Sea .
EnBW’s total investments were 926 million euros, a 43 percent-
drop compared with the year-earlier period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
