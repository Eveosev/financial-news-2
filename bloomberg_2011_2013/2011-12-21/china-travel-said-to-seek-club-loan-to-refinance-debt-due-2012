China Travel Service Holdings Ltd .
is seeking a club loan to refinance debt maturing in the first
half of next year, said two people familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be identified as the details are private.  China Travel signed a HK$2.2 billion five-year loan in 2007
to mature in May 2012 that pays a margin of 36 basis points over
the  Hong Kong  interbank offered rate, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A club loan is not marketed to additional lenders
in syndication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
