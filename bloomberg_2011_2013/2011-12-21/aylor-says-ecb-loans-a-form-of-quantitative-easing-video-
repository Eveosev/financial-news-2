John Taylor , founder of 
currency-hedge fund FX Concepts LLC, talks about the European 
Central Bank's refinancing operations and the consequences for 
the euro.  The ECB will lend euro-area banks a record amount for 
three years in its latest attempt to keep credit flowing to the 
economy during the sovereign debt crisis. Taylor, speaking with 
Sara Eisen on Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack,” also 
discusses the prospects for a U.S recession in 2012.(Source:
