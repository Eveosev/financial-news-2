Holger Schmieding, chief economist
at Joh. Berenberg Gossler & Co in  London , urged the  European
Central Bank  to set a target for euro-area bond spreads that
would trigger unlimited ECB bond-buying in secondary markets,
the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing an interview.  Such a move would help counter the risk of deflation amid a
German-led drive for the entire region to cut debt and deficits,
Schmieding was quoted as saying in the newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
