U.S. stocks rose for a second day as
higher  oil prices  lifted energy shares and  Bank of America (BAC)  Corp.
paced a rebound in lenders, helping the equity market recover
from an early slump. Treasuries slid after lower-than-average
demand at an auction.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,243.72 at 4 p.m. in New York and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed 4.16 points to 12,107.74. Ten-year Treasury
yields added five basis points to 1.97 percent. Oil surged as
U.S. supplies dropped the most in a decade. The euro lost 0.3
percent to $1.3044 and Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields
climbed at least 18 basis points as stronger-than-forecast
demand for European Central Bank loans fueled concern the
region’s lenders were struggling to meet funding needs.  The  S&P 500   recovered (SPX)  from an early 1 percent loss
triggered by lower-than-forecast results at Oracle Corp., which
tumbled the most in more than nine years. Bank of America
climbed after agreeing to a $335 million settlement of a U.S.
probe into lending practices at its Countrywide Financial Corp.
mortgage unit. Investors also turned their attention to jobless
claims data tomorrow after last week’s report showed the fewest
applications for  unemployment benefits  since May 2008.  “It seems to be timed with the Bank of America,
Countrywide settlement,” said  Timothy Ghriskey , who oversees $2
billion as chief investment officer of Solaris Group LLC in
 Bedford Hills , New York, referring to the stock market’s
rebound. “It certainly takes away one bit of uncertainty in the
news,” he said. “It seems to us that the settlement with
Justice was not excessive at all.”  Bank of America Gains  Bank of America advanced 1.2 percent, erasing an earlier
1.4 percent drop. Countrywide discriminated from 2004 to 2008,
before Bank of America acquired the lender, by charging higher
fees and interest rates to more than 200,000 black and Hispanic
borrowers and steered minority borrowers into subprime
mortgages, the DOJ said. Bank of America has committed about $40
billion for mortgage refunds, lawsuits and foreclosures since
2007, with most tied to alleged defects in the loans that
affected investors.  The KBW Bank Index of  24 lenders (BKX)  advanced 1 percent, adding
to yesterday’s 4.1 percent rally.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. climbed more than 1.3
percent to pace an advance in 34 of 42 energy companies in the
S&P 500. Oil rose 1.5 percent to $98.67 a barrel. Supplies fell
10.6 million barrels to 323.6 million last week, the U.S. Energy
Department said. Inventories were forecast to decline 2.13
million barrels, according to the median of 12 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey. Supplies typically fall in December
as refiners seek to avoid end-of-year tax liabilities.  Technology Shares  Technology companies, which account for 19 percent of the
S&P 500 and are the  largest group (SPXL1) , sank 2 percent to lead
declines among 10 industries.  Oracle dropped 12 percent, the most since 2002, after the
second-largest software maker’s results were hurt by slower
demand for databases, applications and computer servers.  Research In Motion Ltd. advanced 10 percent after the Wall
Street Journal said that Microsoft Corp. and Nokia Oyj
considered a joint bid for the maker of the BlackBerry smart
phone, while Reuters reported that Amazon.com Inc. also
considered buying the company.  The S&P 500 is down about 1.1 percent in 2011, having
rallied as much as 8.4 percent and lost as much as 13 percent on
a year-to-date basis during the year. Financial  shares (S5ENRS)  have lost
20 percent this year to lead declines.  The S&P GSCI Index of raw materials advanced 1 percent, as
energy products and cocoa led gains in 15 of 24 commodities. The
Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against those of
six trading partners, rose 0.1 percent after dropping as much as
0.8 percent earlier.  European Concerns  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 0.5 percent, erasing a
gain of as much as 1.4 percent, as technology shares led losses,
with SAP AG tumbling 6.1 percent and Cap Gemini SA losing 4.9
percent. Banks lost 0.7 percent as a group, with BNP Paribas
down 3 percent and Banco Santander SA falling 1.4 percent.  The ECB awarded 489 billion euros ($645 billion) in loans
to the region’s banks in the latest attempt to tame the debt
crisis, compared with a median forecast for 293 billion euros in
a Bloomberg survey of economists.  ‘Disorderly Deleveraging’  “What the ECB is doing is just trying to prevent a
disorderly deleveraging of European bank assets,” Barry Knapp,
the New York-based head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays Plc,
said in a telephone interview. “By no means it solves the
financing problem for  Italy  or  Spain  or for the banks.”  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed 1.6 percent.
Taiwan’s  Taiex Index  rallied 4.6 percent, the most since May
2009, after the government said it would allow a state-run fund
to buy stocks.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index advanced 3.1 percent
and the won strengthened 0.6 percent against the dollar, erasing
losses earlier in the week sparked by the death of North Korean
leader Kim Jong-Il.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index retreated 1.1 percent, its
third consecutive decline and extending its year-to-date decline
to 22 percent, as a gauge of funding availability in the
financial system rose, signaling banks were hoarding cash.  To contact the reporters on this story:
