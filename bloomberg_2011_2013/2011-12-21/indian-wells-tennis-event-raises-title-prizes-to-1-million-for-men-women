The men’s and women’s singles
champions in  Indian Wells  next year will each receive $1
million, making the California tennis tournament the first
combined event outside the Grand Slams to offer such a prize.  The  BNP Paribas Open , where Novak Djokovic and  Caroline Wozniacki  won this year, increased its total prize money to more
than $11 million, tournament director Steve Simon said yesterday
in a news release. The 2012 edition is scheduled for March 7-18.  “The BNP Paribas Open has been raising the bar for the
sport over the course of the past four decades, and today’s $1
million winners’ prize money announcement represents yet another
historic milestone,” Stacey Allaster, chairman and chief
executive officer of the WTA, said in the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
