Taiwan ’s  stocks (TWSE)  posted the biggest
gain in more than 2 years, driving the benchmark index up by the
most in  Asia , after the government said it will let its National
Stabilization Fund buy equities to support domestic markets.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317)  and Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. climbed more than 4 percent, pacing gains by
the island’s largest companies.  Cathay Financial Holding Co. (2882) 
surged 7 percent after the Financial Supervisory Commission said
it will let Chinese banks buy stakes in local banks and
financial holding companies starting Jan. 2.  “Stocks with high cash yields or low price-to-earnings
ratios would be the major beneficiaries” from stabilization
fund purchases, Tu Jin-lung, chairman at Taipei-based Grand
Cathay Investment Services Corp., said by phone. “News that the
government will allow Chinese banks to buy stakes in local
counterparts fueled interest in potential investment targets.”  The Taiex Index rose 4.6 percent to 6,966.48 at the close
in Taipei, the biggest gain since May 2009. The government is
taking action to curb a slump that has dragged the stock gauge
down by 22 percent this year. The Taiex is set for its biggest
annual decline since 2008, the year the credit crisis
intensified and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed.  Hon Hai, the world’s largest contract manufacturer of
electronics, advanced 5.8 percent to NT$82.50, while  Taiwan
Semiconductor (2330) , the world’s largest contract manufacturer of
chips, rose 4.4 percent to NT$76.00. The stock trades at 14.8
times estimated earnings, compared with a four-year average of
16.2. The government will let its fund buy stocks when
necessary, Vice Premier Sean Chen said in a statement yesterday.

created to help protect Taiwan’s markets from “significant
occurrences at home and abroad,” according to the finance
ministry’s website.  The government bought stocks on Aug. 8 and Aug. 9 through
four funds it controls to stem a six-day slump. Philip Yang, a
Cabinet spokesman, declined at the time to comment on whether
the government had used the National Stabilization Fund.  Cathay Financial surged 7 percent to NT$29.95, the biggest
jump since Oct. 31, 2008.  Fubon Financial Holding Co. (2881)  soared 7
percent to NT$29.95, the largest rally since May 6, 2009.  The
TWSE Financial and Insurance Industry Index  advanced 6.7
percent, the most since May 4, 2009.  A single Chinese investor can take up to a five percent
stake in a Taiwanese bank, and total investment is capped at 10
percent, according to a statement yesterday from the financial
regulator. Chinese investors need FSC approval to appoint a
board director or to sell their stakes, it said. The rules,
announced two years ago, would take effect starting Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
