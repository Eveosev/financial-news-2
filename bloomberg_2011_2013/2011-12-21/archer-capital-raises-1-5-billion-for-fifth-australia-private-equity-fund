Archer Capital , the Australian
private-equity firm formed in 1996, raised A$1.5 billion ($1.5
billion) from local and international investors for its fifth
fund.  Archer, which has invested more than A$600 million this
year, announced plans to raise the money in September, the
company said today in an emailed statement.  Sydney-based Archer this year made investments in companies
including private hospital operator Healthe Care  Australia , the
Red Rooster and Oporto fast-food chains, and bought a
controlling stake in V8 Supercars.  The firm also sold assets, including the sale of financial
software company MYOB Pty Ltd. to Bain Capital LLC and iNova
Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty to Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. of the U.S. This yearâ€™s divestitures totaled
more than A$2.5 billion and returned 3.2 times the initial
investment, Archer said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
