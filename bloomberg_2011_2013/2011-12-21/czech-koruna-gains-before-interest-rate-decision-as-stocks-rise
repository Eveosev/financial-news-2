The koruna gained against the euro,
snapping a two-day rout, as Czech policy makers are expected to
leave interest rates unchanged today and optimism about global
economic growth boosted investor demand for riskier assets.  The Czech currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 25.477 per
euro by 9:42 a.m. in Prague, paring this yearâ€™s declines to 1.8
percent. The  PX (PX)  equity gauge jumped 1.9 percent, led by gains at
 Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Komercni Banka AS. (KOMB)   To contact the reporter on this story:
