     Dec. 21 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose for a second
day after U.S. housing starts rose more than economists expected
and hiring increased in the world’s largest economy, brightening
the earnings outlook for Asia’s exporters.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. rose at
least 1.4 percent.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  and Nippon Yusen K.K.
advanced after agreeing to an alliance with other shipping lines
to curb falling cargo rates. Tokyo Electric Power Co. slumped
9.8 on a report the utility at the center of the worst nuclear
accident in 25 years may be taken over by the government.  “The good housing data was a surprise given the housing
sector is considered the worst in the U.S.,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $29.6 billion. “The data
is prompting  stocks (TPX)  to be bought. The move seems rather big in
the thin market.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.5 percent to 8,459.98
at the 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo. The broader Topix Index
gained 1 percent to 725.68. All of the gauge’s 33 industry
groups gained, with  shipping companies (TPMART)  rising the most. The
number of shares trading hands on the Topix was about 28 percent
less than the average over the last 100 days.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The index advanced 3 percent in  New York  yesterday after
reports showed U.S. payrolls increased in 29 states last month
and the number of U.S. housing starts rose to the highest level
since April 2010. Concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis eased after
German business confidence unexpectedly grew.  ‘Brighter U.S. Outlook’  “The U.S. economic outlook is getting brighter,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “The improvement in the German economy is also
a positive contrast to the bleak situation in Europe.”  Exporters gained, with makers of electronics and cars
contributing the most to the Topix’s  advance . Sony, which
depends on overseas markets for 70 percent of its sales, rose
3.4 percent to 1,361 yen. Toyota, Japan’s largest carmaker by
market value, added 1.4 percent to 2,511 yen. Honda, No. 2,
advanced 2.4 percent to 2,325 yen.  Shares pared gains briefly after the  Bank of Japan  lowered
its assessment for the nation’s economy for a second month while
refraining from boosting monetary stimulus, citing easy domestic
financial conditions.  Makers of building equipment rose after Chinese Premier  Wen
Jiabao  said the government will offer funding for small
companies to boost economic growth in the mainland, Japan’s
biggest overseas market. The statement was posted on the central
government’s website today.  Komatsu Gains  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a maker of construction machinery that gets
23 percent of its sales in  China , rose 2.6 percent to 1,855 yen.
Smaller  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305)  gained 2.9 percent
1,310 yen.  The Topix has fallen 19 percent this year, the worst
performance since 2008, matching the decline on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Shipping companies, the worst performing group this year on
the Topix, rose after Nippon Yusen and Mitsui O.S.K. joined an
alliance of shipping companies to curb sliding rates amid
slowing demand and overcapacity. Nippon Yusen, Japan’s biggest
shipping line by sales, jumped 3.7 percent to 199 yen. Mitsui
O.S.K., ranked No. 2, added 1.7 percent to 288 yen.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  reversed gains of as much as 12 percent after
the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission confirmed a
report it will raid the scandal-hit company today. The maker of
optical equipment faces criminal probes after revelations it
falsified accounts to hide investment losses for more than a
decade. The stock, which has lost more than half its value in
the last two months, fell 1.4 percent to 1,050 yen.  Among stocks that fell, Tokyo Electric slumped 9.8 percent
to 211 yen. The utility may be effectively nationalized, the
Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the plan. The utility denied the report.  Tokyo Electric, owner of the Fukushima nuclear power plant
wrecked by  Japan ’s March tsunami, is the worst performing stock
on the Topix this year. Shares have plunged 89 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
