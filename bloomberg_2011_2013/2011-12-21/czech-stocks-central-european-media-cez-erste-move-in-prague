The Czech Republicâ€™s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 1.4 percent to 879.8, its highest close in two weeks.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   rose 2.6
percent to 129 koruna. The broadcaster yesterday slumped to its
lowest intraday level in 33 months, pushing the 14-day relative
strength index for the stock to 26 at the close. Readings lower
than 30 suggest to some technical analysts a security or an
index may rise. The RSI increased to 30 today.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the biggest Czech power producer, dropped
from the highest in almost four months, sliding 1 percent to 777
koruna. Electricity contracts for next-year delivery in  Germany ,
where CEZ exports part of its output, declined 0.7 percent to
52.15 euros per megawatt-hour.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of Austria jumped 4.6 percent
to 330.3 koruna, paring 2011 losses to 63 percent. The  European
Central Bank  said today it will lend euro-area banks more than
expected for three years to keep credit flowing during the
sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
