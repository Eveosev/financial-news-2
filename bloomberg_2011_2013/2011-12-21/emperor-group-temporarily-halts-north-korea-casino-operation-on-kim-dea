Emperor Group, a Hong Kong-based
company with investments in hotels and financial services, has
halted its North Korea casino operation following the death of
 Kim Jong Il .  “Our hotel in North Korea is operating as usual while the
casino is temporarily suspended,” Sherman Wu, a spokeswoman at
Emperor Group, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
group doesn’t “have any contingency plan at the moment” for
the hotel.  North Korea’s leadership is undergoing a transition after
Kim died Dec. 17, the official Korean Central News Agency said
on Dec. 19. His son, Kim Jong Un, is the designated successor.
