The  International Monetary Fund 
agreed to make about 638 million euros ($832 million) available
to Latvia after assessing the country’s implementation of
policies attached to a 2008 loan.  The Latvian government doesn’t plan to draw on the money,
the Washington-based IMF said in a statement today. The review
of the Baltic country’s economy marks the end of the 1.7
billion-euro loan, which was part of an international bailout
package.  “Latvia’s strong performance under the Fund-supported
program has helped overcome the crisis, facilitated a return to
market financing, and contributed to economic recovery,” IMF
First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton said. Now, “the
focus should be on structural reforms to improve
competitiveness, and preventing vulnerabilities from re-
emerging.”  Latvia  turned to a group led by the IMF and the European
Union in late 2008 after its second-biggest bank needed a state
rescue and a real-estate bubble burst. Growth this year should
reach between 4.5 percent and 5 percent, the IMF said.  Still, the IMF said the country faces challenges.  “Output remains well below its pre-crisis level and
Latvia’s unemployment rate, while decreasing, is still high at
14.6 percent,” the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
