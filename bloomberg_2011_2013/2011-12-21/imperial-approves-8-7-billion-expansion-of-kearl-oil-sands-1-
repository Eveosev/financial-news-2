Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the Canadian
company that’s 70 percent owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , said its
board has approved a plan to boost production at its C$8.9
billion ($8.67 billion) Kearl oil-sands project in Alberta.  The expansion is expected to add 110,000 barrels a day of
crude production by late 2015, the Calgary-based company said in
a statement today. The project may have output of as much as
345,000 barrels a day by about 2020, more than double the
company’s total 2010 production of 246,000 barrels.  Imperial and Exxon own Kearl, located 70 kilometers (44
miles) north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The decision to invest
in the expansion will allow the companies to book additional
reserves this year from the project. Exxon more than doubled its
Canadian oil-sands reserves in 2008 after approving the
project’s initial investment.  The expansion will develop 3.2 billion barrels at a cost of
about $6.20 each, Imperial said. The area is estimated to hold
4.6 billion barrels.  Imperial gained 1.5 percent to C$43.73 at the close in
Toronto. Exxon, based in Irving,  Texas , rose 1.4 percent to
$83.12 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
