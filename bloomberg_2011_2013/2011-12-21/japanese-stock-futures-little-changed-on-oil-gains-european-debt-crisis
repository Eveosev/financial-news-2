Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  were little
changed as lenders secured more cash from the  European Central
Bank  than economists had expected while oil and commodities
rose, making investors hesitant to take risks before a Christmas
holiday. Australian equities fell.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, fell 1.7 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
No. 1 camera maker whose largest market is Europe, rose 0.2
percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s biggest oil producer,
lost 0.7 percent.  Futures (TPX)  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 8,455 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 8,440
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,450 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index (CRY) 
fell 0.9 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.2
percent in Wellington even after a report showed the nation’s
economy expanded in the third quarter.  “The ECB doesn’t seem to have stepped up to the plate for
bond buying, which I think is negative, but at least they are
acting as a lender of last resort for banks,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under management.
“As we are heading closer to a holiday period, volumes
decline.”  European Banks  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index added 0.2 percent in New York yesterday
after gains in energy and consumer shares helped the market
recover from an early drop.  U.S. equities at first followed Europe’s shares lower as
banks sought more funds from the ECB than economists predicted,
reducing optimism that the debt crisis will be contained.  Crude oil for February delivery increased $1.43 to settle
at $98.67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index  of raw materials rose 0.7
percent yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 18 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 1.1 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 14 percent drop by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500
and 10.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. fell, pulling the
benchmark index down from a one-week high, on concern growth in
the world’s second-largest economy may slow as the European debt
crisis hurts its exports.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the most-traded Chinese
equities fell 2 percent to 93.20 as of 1:06 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
