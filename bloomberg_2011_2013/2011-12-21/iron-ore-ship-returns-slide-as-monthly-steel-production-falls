Charter rates for capesize vessels
that haul steelmaking raw materials including  iron ore  and coal
fell to a two-week low as November steel output declined.  Daily returns for capesize ships retreated 1.4 percent to
$30,926, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London  today.
That’s the third straight decline and the lowest since Dec 7,
data from the exchange show.  Global steel production in November was the lowest this
year, said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Oslo-based
Arctic Securities. Two capesizes were booked for spot, or
single-voyage, loadings of iron ore to China from Australia at
rates between $11.20 to $11.25 a metric ton,  Omar Nokta , an
analyst at investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co., wrote in an e-
mailed report today. That compares with $14.30 a ton yesterday.  “Given the macroeconomic headwinds and signs of European
 steel mills  reducing production in 2012, we are not surprised by
the decline,” said Stavseth. Lower production is an “obvious
threat” to the dry bulk market, Stavseth said in the report.  Capesizes are the biggest vessels tracked by the  Baltic Dry
Index , a broader gauge of commodity-shipping rates, which fell
1.2 percent to 1,856.  Daily rents for panamax ships, the largest that can
navigate the Panama Canal, declined 2.1 percent to $13,742.
Supramaxes, about 25 percent smaller than the Panamax class,
were little changed at $12,408.  Handysize  ships, the smallest
tracked by the index, decreased 0.3 percent to $8,363.  To contact the reporter on this story:
