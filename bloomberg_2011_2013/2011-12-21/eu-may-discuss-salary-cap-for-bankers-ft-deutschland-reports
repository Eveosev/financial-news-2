The European Union may discuss the
idea of setting a salary cap for bankers, Financial Times
Deutschland said, citing a report from Othmar Karas, an Austrian
lawmaker who guides work on Basel III financial regulation in
the European Parliament.  Karas wrote that the idea of a pay limit “is worth
discussing,” without naming an amount, the newspaper said,
citing a copy of the report it obtained. In the report, the
lawmaker refers to the idea of setting an absolute maximum for
top salaries in relation to the average pay at an individual
financial firm, FTD says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
