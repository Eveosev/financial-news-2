Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NCSP) ,
 Russia ’s largest by volume, completed a fuel oil terminal with
capacity of 4 million metric tons a year and plans to open it
soon, said an executive at one of the port’s shareholders.  “We will push to increase the volume of oil products
there,” Alexander Vinokurov, first vice president of Summa
Group, said in a Dec. 16 interview in Moscow.  Summa and OAO Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline operator,
have joint control over a 50.1 percent stake in Novorossiysk, on
Russia’s Black Sea coast. Summa, which is controlled by
businessman Ziyavudin Magomedov, also has assets in gas
production, mining, telecommunications.  In May 2010, Novorossiysk said the terminal would cost 5
billion rubles ($156 million) to build.  To contact the reporters on this story:
