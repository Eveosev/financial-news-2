Sumitomo Corp. (8053) , the third-largest
Japanese trading house, expects crude oil to trade between $90
per barrel and $100 next year, chief economist Soichi Okuda
said.  “That will be the core range unless a temporary halt in
supplies from the  Middle East  occurs, which could push prices to
$120,” Okuda told reporters in  Tokyo  today. New York-traded
crude oil futures have averaged $94.98 this year.  The following table shows Sumitomo’s forecasts for the
first and second halves of 2012, according to a research report
distributed by the company today. Sumitomo trades commodities
including coal, copper and oil products.  All prices are given in U.S. dollars.
