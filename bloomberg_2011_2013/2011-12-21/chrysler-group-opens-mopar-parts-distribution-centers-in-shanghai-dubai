Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker majority-owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , has opened Mopar parts-
distribution centers in Shanghai and Dubai to help the company’s
expansion plans in Asia and the Middle East.  “These are key strategic moves that are completing the
final separation from Daimler,” Pietro Gorlier, chief executive
officer of the Mopar parts brand, said in an interview prior to
today’s announcement.  Chrysler, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, was previously
owned by then-DaimlerChrysler AG, and  Daimler AG (DAI)  has continued
to provide some logistics services to Chrysler, he said.  The  China  facility will distribute more than 35,000 parts
to more than 130 dealers in China and to third-party
distributors and partners throughout the Asia-Pacific region,
Chrysler said in a statement today.  The United Arab Emirates facility will distribute more than
30,000 parts to the  Middle East  and Africa, Chrysler said.  “We are expanding significantly, for example, in the
Middle East,” Gorlier said.  Fiat, based in Turin, Italy, obtained control of Chrysler
as part of the U.S. automaker’s bankruptcy reorganization in
2009. Fiat will also use the centers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
