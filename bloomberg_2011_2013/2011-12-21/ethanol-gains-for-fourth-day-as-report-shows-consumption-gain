Ethanol rose for a fourth day in
 Chicago  after a government report showed increased demand for
the biofuel to be used in gasoline.  Futures extended the longest set of gains since November
after the Energy Department said  production of conventional
gasoline blended with ethanol  climbed 2.2 percent to 5.26
million barrels a day last week, the highest level since Aug.

ethanol mixed into the motor fuel, an incentive that expires

oil, is blended with gasoline to stretch supply. The report
showed oil inventories fell 10.6 million barrels to 323.6
million, the largest decline since Feb. 16, 2001. Gasoline
stockpiles dropped 412,000 barrels to 218.4 million.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 1.7 cents, or
0.8 percent, to settle at $2.157 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have fallen 9.3 percent this year and are
headed for the first yearly decline since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast sank 11
cents, or 4.8 percent, to $2.205 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive decreased 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.275,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago declined 0.5 cent to $2.20 a gallon and
the fuel was unchanged in the U.S. Gulf at $2.325.  Crude oil for February delivery increased $1.43, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $98.67 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Gasoline for January delivery jumped 4.12 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.6199 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
