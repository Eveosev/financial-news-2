The naira headed for its weakest in
about 10 weeks as dollar demand shot up on bets the Nigerian
currency may further decline with the end of central bank
auctions for the year.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 2.2
percent in interbank trading to 162.97 per dollar at 12:06 p.m.
in Lagos, its weakest since Oct. 10, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  There are speculations the central bank may also stop
direct dollar sales to lenders after today’s end of the twice-
weekly auctions, “so there is a rush to buy the foreign
currency by dealers,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., which trades currencies,
said by phone today. “The central bank has slowed its
intervention since last week, with the market sustained mainly
by the year-end dollar sales of  oil companies .”  Nigeria lowered the midpoint of its exchange-rate band at
the auctions on Nov. 21 to 155 naira per dollar from 150 naira
as rising imports and weakening oil prices increased pressure on
the currency. Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of foreign
income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  The official currency auctions will close for the year
after the Dec. 21 sale and will reopen in January, Muhammed
Abdullahi, a spokesman for the central bank in Abuja, said on
Dec. 19.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated for the second day by 0.1 percent
to 1.6375 per dollar as of 11:50 a.m. in Accra, the nation’s
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
