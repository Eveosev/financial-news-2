TMX Group Inc. (X) , the Toronto Stock
Exchange owner that’s the target of a takeover by a group of
Canadian banks and pension funds, said it bought a 16 percent
stake in the Bermuda Stock Exchange.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed. TMX Chief Executive
Officer  Thomas Kloet  will join the Bermuda Stock Exchange board,
Toronto-based TMX said today in a statement.  “This investment represents TMX Group’s commitment to
looking beyond Canada for opportunities,” Kloet said in the
statement.  Canada and Bermuda have increased business activity with
each other, including a tax information pact that was signed in
July, TMX said.  TMX shares rose less than 1 percent to C$41.85 yesterday in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  The shares plunged 6 percent
this month after  Canada ’s competition regulator said it had
“serious” concerns about the bid by Maple Group Acquisition
Corp. for TMX.  To contact the reporter on this story:
