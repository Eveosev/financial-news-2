Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the U.S. electric
carmaker that plans to build a rechargeable sedan in California,
is on schedule to begin delivering the battery-powered Model S
starting in mid-2012.  Initial production at Tesla’s Fremont, California, plant
will be of 1,000 units of high-end “Signature” Model S sedans,
said Ricardo Reyes, a company spokesman. That version will cost
as much as $92,400, prior to a $7,500 federal tax credit, and
have enough lithium-ion battery capacity to travel 300 miles per
charge, Tesla said yesterday.  Deliveries of other Model S grades, including a base
version priced at $57,400 before the tax credit and with 160
miles of range per charge, begin in “Fall 2012,” Tesla said  on
its website . The company, based in  Palo Alto , California, is
concluding contract assembly of its first electric car, the
$109,000 Roadster, with Lotus Cars Ltd. and readying its
California plant to build Model S and future models derived from
the car’s platform.  Tesla counts  Daimler AG (DAI) , Toyota Motor Corp. and  Panasonic
Corp. (6752)  as investors. While it hasn’t yet reported an annual
profit, that may happen as early as 2013, Chief Executive
Officer Elon Musk said in an October interview.  Musk, who is also Tesla’s main shareholder, has said the
company has sold out next year’s production. It has orders for
more than 7,000 units of the vehicle, Reyes said.  Tesla slid 1.2 percent to $27.57 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
