Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s third-
biggest carmaker, denied a report by the Wall Street Journal
that the company will increase production capacity in  North
America  by as much as 40 percent.  The Journal reported earlier today that Honda will shift a
major share of its manufacturing to North America over the next
two years because Japan-made cars had become too expensive to
ship overseas due to the gains in the yen, citing Tetsuo Iwamura, Honda’s top executive in North America.  Iwamura “didn’t say 40 percent increase at all,” Tomoko Uchida, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based carmaker, said today.  “We stand by the story,”  Bethany Sherman, a spokeswoman
for the Journal, said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
