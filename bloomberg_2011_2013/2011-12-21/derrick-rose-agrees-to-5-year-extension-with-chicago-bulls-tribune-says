Derrick Rose , the reigning National
Basketball Association Most Valuable Player, signed a five-year
contract extension with the  Chicago Bulls  through the 2016-17
season.  The contract’s value is the maximum Rose could have
received from the Bulls under the league’s new collective
bargaining agreement with its players, the team said in a  news
release  on its website without disclosing figures. It’s worth
about $95 million, according to the  Chicago Tribune .  “ I want all of our fans out there to know that I am
committed to one goal and that is winning an NBA championship
for  Chicago ,” Rose said in a statement.  Rose was able to re-sign for the maximum salary because,
under the terms of the new labor deal, he has been a “high-
performing rookie scale player,” having won league MVP honors
last season. That allows him to earn a salary of 30 percent of
the team salary limit or cap. The cap for the first year of the
leaguewide agreement remains unchanged from last season at about
$58 million, with players’ salaries prorated for the shortened
66-game campaign.  The 23-year-old Rose became the NBA’s youngest MVP when he
led the Bulls to a league-best 62-20 Record last season, his
third as a pro. He was the first player taken in the 2008 NBA
draft and won Rookie of the Year honors for 2008-09.  Rose averaged 25 points, 7.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds per
game last season, becoming the fifth player in NBA history to
total at least 2,000 points, 600 assists and 300 rebounds in one
campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
