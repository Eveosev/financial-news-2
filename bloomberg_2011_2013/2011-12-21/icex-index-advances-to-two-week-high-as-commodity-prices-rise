Russian stocks fell the most in over
a week after reaching a two-week high in earlier trading as the
 European Central Bank  provided more funds than expected to the
region’s lenders.  The Micex Index of 30 shares fell as much as 2 percent and
was 1.75 percent lower at 1385.10 at the close in Moscow, its
biggest decline since Dec. 12. The index rose as high as 0.8
percent in earlier trading. The RTS Index of dollar-measured
trading lost one percent to 1,382.5 after gaining 1.5 percent.  The Frankfurt-based ECB awarded 489 billion euros ($640
billion) in 1,134-day loans, more than economists’ median
estimate of 293 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey,
sending European stocks lower.  “The general mood soured after news on ECB loans. The
market remains very nervous,” Alexander Zakharov, head of
international equity sales at Finam Investment Co. in Moscow,
said by e-mail. “In the current environment,  Russian stocks (INDEXCF)  are
completely driven by external news.”  OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas supplier and owner of
 Russia ’s fifth-biggest oil producer, fell 1.6 percent to 169.71
rubles. The shares jumped 3.9 percent yesterday after the
company said yesterday it plans to cut spending and boost
dividends next year. OAO Rosneft and OAO Lukoil, the largest  oil
companies , declined 1.1 percent and 1 percent, respectively.  Oil extended gains after a U.S. government report showed a
decline in inventories almost five times as large as expected.
Crude for February delivery rose $1.64, or 1.7 percent, to
$98.88 a barrel at 10:37 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Rusal, Magnitogorsk  United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer,
declined 0.8 percent to 198.57 rubles after earlier leading
gains in the Micex with a 2.3 percent increase.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , the largest supplier of coal to steelmakers,
fell as much as 2.8 percent to 268.20 rubles and closed 2.4
percent lower at 269.2 rubles. OAO Magnitogorsk, Russian
billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s steel producer, fell 1.2 percent
to 12.69 rubles, its biggest drop in a week.  The Micex, which has lost 18 percent this year, trades at
about 4.7 times estimated earnings compared with about 10 times
for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index, 10.5 times for the  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  and 13.7 times for the BSE India Sensitive
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
