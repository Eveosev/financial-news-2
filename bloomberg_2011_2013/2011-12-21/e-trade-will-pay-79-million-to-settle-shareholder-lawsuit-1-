E*Trade Financial Corp ., the New
York-based online brokerage, will pay $79 million to settle a
shareholder lawsuit over losses from mortgages and home-equity
loans.  E*Trade announced the settlement in a regulatory filing
today. The agreement requires the company to pay $10.75 million,
which will be reflected as an expense in the fourth quarter of
this year, with the balance paid by insurance carriers,
according to the filing.  The lawsuit and other similar class actions were filed in
2007 based on claims that company officers violated their
fiduciary duties to shareholders concerning losses in E*Tradeâ€™s
portfolio of mortgages and home equity loans, according to the
filing. As part of the settlement E*Trade officials deny any
wrongdoing.  The case is Freudenberg v.  E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) , U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Foley Square).  To contact the reporter on this story:
