The franc fell against the euro and
the dollar after Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said a
panel is considering measures, including  capital controls  and
negative interest rates, to weaken the Swiss currency.  The franc fell against the majority of its 16 major peers
tracked by Bloomberg after Widmer-Schlumpf said the panel is
considering negative interest rates, a levy on transactions and
restrictions on the movement of Swiss and foreign currencies, at
a hearing in the Swiss parliament’s lower house today. The  Swiss
National Bank  resisted pressure from exporters to further curb
the strength of the currency at its quarterly policy meeting on
Dec. 15.  “The government and the central bank there are still very
much focused on limiting Swiss franc strength and they clearly
want to see a weaker” currency, said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at FOREX.com, a unit of online currency
trading firm Gain Capital in Bedminster,  New Jersey .  The franc fell 0.2 percent to 1.2208 per euro at 5:53 p.m.
London time, and 0.2 percent to 93.39 centimes per dollar.  The finance minister has made similar statements in the
past. On Dec. 7, she said at a hearing in the parliament’s upper
house that capital controls and negative interest rates “are
issues which are being examined.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
