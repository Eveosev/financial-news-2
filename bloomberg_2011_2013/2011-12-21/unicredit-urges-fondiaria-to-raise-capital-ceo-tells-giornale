UniCredit SpA (UCG)  Chief Executive
Officer Federico Ghizzoni urged Italian insurer  Fondiaria-SAI
SpA (FSA)  to boost its capital, il Giornale reported, citing an
interview.  Ghizzoni said that a capital increase would be “more
logical” for the insurer, according to the Italian newspaper.
The bank, which owns a 7 percent stake in Fondiaria, is waiting
for a report from the insurer’s adviser, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., before deciding whether to participate in any capital
increase, the CEO was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
