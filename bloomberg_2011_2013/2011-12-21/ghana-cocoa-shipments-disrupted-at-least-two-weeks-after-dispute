Cocoa shipments from  Ghana , the
world’s second-largest producer, have been disrupted for at
least two weeks at Safmarine Container Lines NV and  A.P. Moller-
Maersk S/A  after a dispute about who is responsible to pay a fee
to the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority.  Safmarine said on Dec. 9 it hadn’t shipped cocoa for the
past week and Maersk wasn’t moving cocoa at least by Dec. 8. The
Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority charges a fee to carry cocoa
from warehouses to ports and ships. Safmarine still isn’t moving
cocoa from Ghana, Didier Willemse, head of commodity sales, said
by phone from Antwerp,  Belgium , today. Maersk wasn’t shipping as
of Dec. 19, according to Sonny Dahl, director of West Africa
services for Copenhagen-based Maersk.  The Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority wants about 78 cedis
($47.58) for every 20-foot container to carry cocoa from
warehouses into ports and load on ships, Nester Percy Galley,
director-general of the port authority, said on Dec. 12. Some
shippers have agreed to pay the fee, he said.  Galley referred questions on the issue to the Cocoa
Marketing Co. in a phone interview today. Noah Amenyah,
spokesman for the Ghana Cocoa Board which oversees the  marketing
company , didn’t answer calls made to his mobile phone.  Output in Ghana will be 850,000 to 900,000 metric tons this
season, down from 1.024 million tons a year earlier, according
to Ecobank Transnational Inc., a Lome, Togo-based bank. The
cocoa season runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.  Ivory Coast  is the
biggest grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
