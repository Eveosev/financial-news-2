The European Union’s highest court
said EU countries can’t transfer an asylum seeker to another
nation “where he risks being subjected to inhuman treatment.”  In two cases before the EU court, asylum seekers had
entered  Greece  and were arrested for illegal entry before
continuing toward the U.K. or Ireland. Under EU laws, the
country of first entrance has responsibility for those entering,
unless the person’s human rights are at risk there. Tribunals in
Ireland and England sought the court’s guidance on EU rules and
at what point a country becomes responsible for a refugee
entering via another EU nation.  National courts or officials in the 27-nation region can’t
transfer an asylum seeker to the country where they first
arrived if they are aware of “systemic deficiencies in the
asylum procedure and in the reception conditions” that would
result in “a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or
degrading treatment,” the  EU Court of Justice  in Luxembourg
ruled today.  Illegal immigration through Greece has swelled in recent
years, as people fleeing countries including Iraq and
 Afghanistan  seek entry to the EU over Greece’s borders. Citizen
Protection Minister Christos Papoutsis appealed for assistance
from the EU last year to stem the wave and said one option was
to build a fence along the Turkish border.  The cases are:  C-411/10 , NS v Secretary of State for the
Home Department, M. E. and others v  C-493/10 , Refugee
Applications Commissioner, Minister for Justice, Equality and
Law Reform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
