(Corrects  London  price in sixth paragraph of story that
ran on Dec. 21.)  Refined-copper  imports  by China, the
world’s largest user, climbed to the highest level since June
2009 as lower prices in London prompted arbitrage trade.  Inbound shipments climbed 16 percent to 343,926 metric tons
last month from 295,341 tons in October, according to the
General Administration of Customs. The arrivals were 48 percent
higher than a year earlier.  Imports rose for a sixth month after domestic stockpiles
were depleted earlier this year, with the cash premium in
Shanghai surging to 700 yuan ($110) in November, prompting
arbitrage trade by buying the metal in London and selling in
Shanghai. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange
tumbled 22 percent this year.  “The increase of imports in recent months has started to
weigh on the domestic market while demand isn’t particularly
good, erasing the spot premiums,” said Pang Ying, an analyst at
Shenzhen Rongtuo Trading Co.  The metal for immediate delivery in  Shanghai ’s Changjiang
Nonferrous Metals Market was quoted at about the same level
today as the front-month futures contract on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange.  Stockpiles  monitored by the exchange rose to a
one-month high of 79,570 tons last week, bourse data showed.  Copper in London traded at $7,476 a ton at 4 p.m. in
Shanghai, while the March-delivery contract on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange gained 1.6 percent to 54,620 yuan ($8,615) a
ton.  Inventories of refined copper at smelters increased for a
third-consecutive month and recent discounts have kept producers
from selling much amid ample supply, data provider SMM
Information & Technology Co. said in a report.  Fewer Orders  Canceled warrants on the LME, or orders to draw copper from
the warehouses, tumbled to 2,100 tons in  Asia  yesterday from
61,900 tons on Oct. 25, bourse data showed.  China’s manufacturing may contract for a second month in
December, indicated by a reading of 49 for a purchasing
managers’ index reported by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics on Dec. 15. The dividing line between contraction and
expansion is 50.  Copper concentrate  imports  rose for the first time in three
months to 672,644 tons from 517,097 tons in October, today’s
customs data showed.  Treatment charges on the  spot market  had tumbled to $20-$30
per ton, and refining charges at 2-3 cents a pound, according to
SMM. This compares with a deal of $63.5 a ton and 6.35 cents a
pound between Jiangxi Copper Co. and Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. in November for 2012.  China  also imported 433,476 tons of  scrap copper  in
November, customs data showed today. The arrivals were the
highest in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
