Sudanese police fired into the air
and used tear gas and batons to disperse 2,000 students
protesting fraud in elections at a university campus in the
eastern city of Kassala, a witness said.  “Students were able to seize the ballot boxes to undo
these rigged elections,” Muhammad Adam, a second-year economics
student, said today by phone from Kassala, the state capital.
“Now the police forces have fully deployed on the campus and
cordoned off the whole area.”  Students at the  University of Kassala  protested for more
than three weeks in October against high education fees and the
rising cost of living.  Sudanese Police spokesman al-Ser Ahmed Omar didn’t answer
phone calls in Khartoum, the capital, seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
