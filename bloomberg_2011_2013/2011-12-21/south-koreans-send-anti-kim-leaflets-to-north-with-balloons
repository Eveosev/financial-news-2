South Korean civic groups and North
Korean defectors launched balloons carrying propaganda leaflets
into the North today, two days after the totalitarian regime
announced the death of its leader,  Kim Jong Il .  The ten balloons were sent, carrying 200,000 leaflets
criticizing  North Korea  for naming Kim Jong Un to succeed his
father as leader, said Park Sang Hak, a leader of the  Fighters
For Free North Korea . His Seoul-based group and others released
the balloons in two batches today in Imjingak, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of the South Korean capital, Park
said by telephone.  The government in Pyongyang has previously characterized
the leaflets drops as an attempt to topple its communist regime
and said the provocations could ignite a war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
