The euro extended gains against the
dollar and the yen after the  European Central Bank  awarded 489
billion euros ($645 billion) in 1,134-day loans to banks, more
than the 293 billion euros forecast by economists.  The euro strengthened 0.8 percent to $1.3182 at 10:30 a.m.
London time, and rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 102.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
