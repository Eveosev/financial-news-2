Rambus Inc. (RMBS)  said it will pay
$10.8 million to settle one of two remaining lawsuits over
claims the company backdated stock option grants before 2006.  The settlement resolves a lawsuit brought by investor
Stuart Steele in 2008 and related to grants that were
incorrectly dated or accounted for prior to 2006. The majority
of the grants in dispute occurred between 1998 and 2001, the
company said today in a statement. The case was scheduled to go
to trial in March, Rambus said.  Former Rambus Chairman Geoff Tate quit the board in 2006
after an internal investigation uncovered option backdating, a
practice that can enrich recipients by setting grant dates to
times when the stock traded lower, building in extra profit. The
practice is illegal unless disclosed and recorded as expenses.  In September 2007, the company paid $18 million to settle a
suit brought by shareholders who claimed executives misled them
about Rambusâ€™s financial performance and its options backdating.  The case is Steele v. Rambus, 08-cv-113682, Superior Court
of  California , Santa Clara County ( San Jose ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
