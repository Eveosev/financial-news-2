Gold dropped from a one-week high as
a rebound by the dollar curbed demand for the precious metal as
alternative asset.  The euro fell as much as 0.4 percent against the greenback
on concern that  European Central Bank  measures to support its
banking sector won’t be enough to stem the region’s debt crisis.
Gold headed for the first quarterly decline in more than three
years as  Europe ’s fiscal woes eroded prospects for the global
economy and commodity demand.  “As people take a closer look, they see that maybe things
aren’t as good as they thought” in the European rescue effort,
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for February delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,613.60 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached $1,643.70, the highest for a
most-active contract since Dec. 14. The metal, down 0.5 percent
this quarter, has climbed 14 percent in 2011.  The ECB awarded 489 billion euros ($640 billion) in three-
year loans to the region’s banks in the latest attempt to tame
the debt crisis.  “It’s being viewed as a Band-Aid solution,” McGhee said.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 1 percent to $29.249
an ounce on the Comex. The metal has declined 5.5 percent this
year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1,431.70 an ounce. The
price has dropped 19 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery gained 0.9 percent to
$634.10 an ounce. The metal has declined 21 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
