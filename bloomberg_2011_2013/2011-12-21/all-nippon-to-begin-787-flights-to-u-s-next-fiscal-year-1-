All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  plans to
begin operating flights on  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner to the
U.S. starting next fiscal year as it seeks to meet rising travel
demand with the fuel-efficient jet.  Asia’s largest listed airline by sales will make the
flights from Tokyo’s Narita International airport to Seattle,
 Washington  and San Jose, California, starting in the year from
April 1, it said in a statement today.  All Nippon, the first to operate Boeing’s composite-plastic
plane commercially, announced the new flights after saying last
week postponed delivery of a third Dreamliner would delay the
start of 787 services to Beijing by a month. The airline is
counting on the plane to cut fuel costs.  “There is strong demand for flights to  San Francisco  now,
so we are expecting solid demand for our Seattle and San Jose
flights, too,” President Shinichiro Ito told reporters today in
Tokyo.  ANA rose 0.45 percent to 221 yen at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo, while the Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.5 percent.  Boeing rolled out the first 787 painted in ANA’s livery on
Aug. 6 at its plant in Everett, Washington following more than
three years of delays. The planes may allow ANA to add new
routes in Europe and North America as they can fly further than
aircraft of a similar size and are about  20 percent  more fuel
efficient.  To contact the reporters on this story:
