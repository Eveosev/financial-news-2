Jorge Queiroz de Moraes Jr., the
controlling shareholder and chairman of  Rede Energia SA (REDE4) , said
he’s seeking a “strategic partner” for the Brazilian energy
distributor.  The plan is to sell a minority or controlling stake, Moraes
said yesterday in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo . “We are
trying to capitalize the company to improve the debt conditions
and to find a continuity solution for the business,” he said.  An investment fund of FGTS, Brazil’s workers’ compensation
fund, and BNDES Participacoes SA, the investment arm of the
state development bank, are also shareholders in the Sao Paulo-
based company that distributes electricity in seven Brazilian
states, he said.  Moraes said that he didn’t know the company’s total value.
He said a “good guess” would be 9 billion reais ($4.84
billion), or six times the 1.5 billion Ebitda, earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of
operational  cash flow , in the 12 months through September.  Rede Energia has hired  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  to advise on the
sale, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
