Kubota Corp. (6326) , the Japanese maker of
industrial machinery, raised its offer for Kverneland ASA to
1.62 billion kroner ($276 million), trumping counter bids from
 CNH Global NV (CNH)  and Chery Heavy Industries Co. Ltd.  Kubota increased the offer to 10.5 kroner a share and
secured an irrevocable agreement for the 31.8 percent stake held
by Umoe AS, the Kvernaland, Norway-based company’s largest
shareholder, Kverneland said in a statement.  The Japanese manufacturer’s bid of 8.5 kroner a share on
Dec. 16 for western  Europe ’s fifth-largest maker of farm
machinery and equipment by sales sparked counter offers of 9.5
kroner a share on Dec. 19 from Wuhu, China-based Chery and Fiat
Industrial SpA-controlled CNH.  Kverneland Chairman Jens Ulltveit-Moe, who with family
members owns Umoe AS, also said he will sell 100,000 shares
owned by Kagra Gruppen AS through the offer, the company said.  Kverneland  rose (KVE)  as much as 3 percent to 10.45 kroner at
9:27 a.m. in Oslo. The stock has jumped 61 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
