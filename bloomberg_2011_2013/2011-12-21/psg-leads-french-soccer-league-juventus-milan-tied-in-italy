Paris Saint-Germain beat Saint
Etienne 1-0 to move into first place in French soccer’s Ligue 1,
as Juventus missed a chance to take the outright lead in Italy’s
Serie A.  Mathieu Bodmer scored in the first half as PSG moved three
points ahead of Montpellier, which lost 4-2 at Evian. Defending
champion Lille remained third after a 4-4 draw with Nice, one
point ahead of Lyon, which lost 1-0 at Valenciennes heading to
the league’s 2 1/2-week midseason break.  Juventus could have regained the top spot in Serie A. A 0-0
draw at Udinese left it tied with defending champion AC Milan
with 34 points. Milan beat Cagliari 2-0 last night.  Udinese remains third with 32 points as the league goes
into its winter break until Jan. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
