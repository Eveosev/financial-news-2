India ’s 10-year bonds halted a rally
as  yields  at the lowest level in four months reduced demand for
fixed-income securities.  Yields have dropped 70 basis points from a three-year high
of 9 percent reached last month on optimism slowing economic
growth will prompt the central bank to cut interest  rates . The
 Reserve Bank  of India said yesterday it will buy as much as 100
billion rupees ($1.9 billion) of debt this week as a shortage of
cash in the banking system may crimp demand.  “Some investors may be booking profits as bonds have
rallied quite a bit,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income
trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “The cash crunch
may also be reducing appetite.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.30 percent as
of 9:42 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate was 8.28 percent yesterday, the lowest level
for a benchmark 10-year note since Aug. 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Factory  output  fell 5.1 percent in October from a year
earlier, the first contraction since June 2009, government data
showed last week. The Reserve Bank refrained from increasing its
repurchase rate at a policy review on Dec. 16, after raising it
13 times since the start of 2010 to cool inflation. It will next
review  interest rates  on Jan. 24.  Lenders  borrowed  1.7 trillion rupees from the central bank
overnight on Dec. 19, the most this year, as Indian companies
withdrew funds from banks to pay taxes, according to Bloomberg
data. They borrowed 1.6 trillion rupees yesterday.  The Reserve Bank resumed open-market bond purchases last
month for the first time since January. The monetary authority
has bought 243 billion rupees of government debt in auctions
over the past month, central bank data show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose three basis points to 7.76 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
