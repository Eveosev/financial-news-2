Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA)  said it
signed a power purchase agreement allowing it to sell
electricity from a 10-megawatt solar facility in California, its
first photovoltaic project in the U.S.  The plant will be located near the Heber geothermal complex
in Imperial Valley and will sell the power for 20 years to the
Imperial Irrigation District. Construction will start within 18
months, according to a statement from Ormat on PRNewswire.  The geothermal power provider said it’s boosting its focus
on solar energy because it’s able to generate electricity from
PV projects without many tax incentives.  “While Ormat’s roots in solar energy go back more than 40
years, we have recently reinitiated our development efforts in
solar projects,” said Yoram Bronicki, president and chief
operating officer of Ormat Technologies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
