The 59 creditor banks of  Reyal Urbis
SA (REY) , a Spanish real-estate company with 3.7 billion euros of debt
($4.85 billion), decided not to continue refinancing the
companyâ€™s loans,  El Confidencial  reported, citing unidentified
people at some of the banks.  The lenders may take over real-estate assets from Reyal
Urbis and debt or carry out debt-for-equity swaps, the newspaper
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
