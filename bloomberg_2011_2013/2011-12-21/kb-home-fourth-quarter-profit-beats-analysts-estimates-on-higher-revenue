KB Home (KBH) , the Los Angeles-based
homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, fell the most in six
weeks after reporting a decline in quarterly profit and weaker
gross margins.  Net income for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 dropped to
$13.9 million, or 18 cents a share, from $17.4 million, or 23
cents, a year earlier, the company said in a statement today.
The results included a $19.8 million gain related to the wind-
down of a mortgage-banking joint venture and a $6.6 million gain
from a loan guarantee.  “KB turned in very strong orders, ahead of our optimistic
forecast, setting up the company for good growth in 2012,”
Stephen East and Truman Patterson, analysts with New York-based
Ticonderoga Securities LLC, wrote in a note to clients today.
“Unfortunately, the rest of the results were disappointing as
one-time gains accounted for nearly double the reported
income.”  Gross margins fell short of the company’s earlier forecast.
The housing gross margin, excluding inventory-related charges,
was 15 percent in the fourth quarter compared to 17 percent in
the previous three months. KB Home said in September that
margins would improve in the fourth quarter. Net orders rose 38
percent to 1,494.  The builder dropped 6.7 percent to $7.22 at the close of
trading in New York, the biggest decline since Nov. 9. The
shares have lost 46 percent this year, compared with a 5.3
percent decline in the Standard & Poor’s 1500 Homebuilding
Index.  Housing Demand  The company has cut costs and added communities in
California and  Texas , which the builder is betting will recover
more quickly from the real estate slump. U.S. housing demand,
weighed down by sluggish  job growth , tight credit and a looming
supply of foreclosures, is showing signs of improvement.  Housing starts rose 9.3 percent in November from the
previous month to a 685,000 annual rate, the most since April
2010, the Commerce Department said yesterday. While multifamily
construction accounted for much of the increase, single-family
home starts jumped 2.3 percent, the most since June.  KB Home’s earnings beat the 3-cent average estimate of 16
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 6 percent from
a year earlier to $479.9 million, and deliveries rose 4 percent
to 1,995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
