U.S. stocks pared losses as gains in
utilities, consumer-staples and energy companies helped offset
declines in technology shares following lower-than-estimated
results at Oracle Corp.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,239.6 at 2:50 p.m. in  New York  after losing as much as 1
percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
