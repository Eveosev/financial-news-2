The  Bank of Japan (8301)  left its asset-
purchase program unchanged while lowering its assessment of the
economy, saying that the nation’s pick-up has paused.  The central bank’s asset-buying fund was left at 20
trillion yen, and its credit-lending program at 35 trillion yen,
it said in a statement in Tokyo today. The benchmark interest
rate was held at a range of zero to 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
