Arizona  had its credit outlook
raised by  Standard & Poor’s  because of improving finances,
removing the risk the state’s bond rating may be cut.  S&P revised the outlook to stable from negative today,
indicating the company has no imminent plans to change the
state’s AA- rating, the fourth-highest. The revision affects
about $3.1 billion of debt backed by annual appropriations, said
David Hitchcock, an S&P analyst in  New York .  “We base the outlook revision on what we view as  Arizona ’s
improving fiscal outlook,” Hitchcock said in a statement.  The state finished its 2011 budget year that ended in June
with a balance of $3.2 million, compared with a $332 million
deficit previously forecast, according to  a report  by the Joint
Legislative Budget Committee. Tax collections have exceeded
estimates during the current year as well, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
