The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars swung between gains and losses, tracking stocks on
concern  European Central Bank  measures to boost liquidity may
not stem the region’s debt crisis.  The Aussie rose to a record versus the euro before trimming
the gain after the ECB said it had awarded 489 billion euros
($637 billion) in 1,134-day loans to banks, more than the 293
billion euros forecast by economists. A report showed the New
Zealand’s current-account deficit widened.  “What began as a risk-on day is ending up to be a risk-off
day,” said  Marc Chandler , global head of currency strategy in
New York at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., in a phone interview.
“The buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact on the euro helped drag down
the other currencies and the stock market.”  The Australian dollar rose as much as 0.9 percent to 77.73
euro cents, a record, before trading at 77.11, up 0.1 percent at
12:38 p.m. in  New York . It touched $1.0219, the most since Dec.
12, before trading little changed at $1.0075. The Aussie was
little changed at 78.55 yen after earlier reaching 79.37, the
highest since Dec. 8.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 76.78 U.S.
cents, after rising to 77.76 U.S. cents, the strongest since
Dec. 8. The so-called kiwi held steady at 59.88 yen.  Gains in the New Zealand dollar were limited after a report
showed the country’s current-account deficit widened by more
than economists had forecast.  The shortfall was 4.3 percent of gross domestic product in
the year ended Sept. 30, from 3.7 percent in the 12 months
through June,  Statistics New Zealand  said in Wellington today.
Economists predicted a 3.9 percent gap, according to the median
of 11 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  UBS AG expects the Australian dollar to rise to $1.04 in
one month and New Zealand’s currency to advance to 80 U.S. cents
in the same time period.  The Australian dollar has fallen 1.6 percent against its
U.S. counterpart this year, and so has the kiwi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
