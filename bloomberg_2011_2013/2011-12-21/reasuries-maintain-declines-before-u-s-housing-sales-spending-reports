Treasury  notes fluctuated before the
U.S. sells $29 billion of seven-year notes today in the last of
seven note, bond and inflation-indexed debt auctions totaling
$177 billion over the past two weeks, the most ever.  Thirty-year bond yields touched a one-week high after the
number of existing homes sold last month in the U.S. increased.
Treasuries fell earlier on speculation that stronger-than-
forecast lending in a European Central Bank program will help
stem the euro region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “The market is in a wait-and-see mode with respect to
 Europe , and the only thing that has kept the market from going
lower in yield has been better U.S. data,” said  Dan Greenhaus ,
chief global strategist at BTIG LLC in  New York . “Still, we’ve
seen pretty decent auctions overall suggesting that there is
still robust demand for Treasuries, even at lower yield levels,
given the persistent concerns from overseas.”  Ten-year note  yields rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.94 percent at 12:38 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities due in November 2021 declined 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 1/2. The yields touched 1.96 percent
earlier and fell to as low as 1.89 percent. They increased 11
basis points yesterday, the steepest climb since Oct. 27.  Thirty-year bond  yields increased five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.97 percent, the most since Dec. 14,
after falling earlier to 2.90 percent.  The yield on benchmark 10-year debt has fallen 135 basis
points in 2011, set for the biggest annual decline in three
years, as concern the European debt crisis will spread prompted
investors to seek a refuge. The yield sank to a record low 1.67
percent on Sept. 23.  Seven-Year Auction  The Fed sold $8.12 billion of Treasuries due from November
2013 to March 2014 in the first of two sales today. It will sell
as much as $8.75 billion of debt due in 2013 in the second
offering. The central bank is replacing $400 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term securities in a
program to lower borrowing costs.  Thirty-year yields rose after the National Association of
Realtors reported existing-home sales increased 4 percent to a
4.42 million annual pace, beating the 2.2 percent forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey, from a revised 4.25 million rate the
prior month.  The number of existing homes sold in the U.S. was revised
down by an average 14 percent since 2007, magnifying the depth
of the slump that contributed to the last recession.  Data Revisions  Purchases were revised to 4.19 million for 2010, down 15
percent from a prior estimate of 4.91 million, the real estate
agents’ group said in  Washington . There was a comparable
downward revision to inventory, and median prices were little
changed from prior estimates.  “The market seems to be taking it as a positive,” Michael Pond, co-head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Barclays
Plc, said. The firm is one of 21 primary dealers that trade with
the Fed. “Data has been coming in stronger, but there are
plenty of uncertainties that remain, so it’s been tough to sell
off or rally with any conviction.”  U.S. consumer spending rose for a Bloomberg News survey
forecast before a government report due Dec. 23.  Seven-year notes being offered today yielded 1.422 in pre-
auction trading. The securities drew a record low yield of 1.415
percent at the last offering of the maturity on Nov. 23 as
investors sought safety amid concern the European debt crisis
would spread.  Record Low Yield  The U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year notes yesterday at a
record low yield of 0.88 percent as demand fell relative to the
last auction of securities with the same maturity. The  bid-to-
cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of debt offered, was 2.86, versus 3.15 at the
November offering. The government’s sale of $30 billion of four-
week bills yesterday had a bid-to-cover of 9.07, a record high.  The government has sold $2.135 trillion of notes, bonds and
inflation-indexed debt this year, including today’s offering. It
auctioned $2.249 trillion in 2010 and $2.109 trillion in 2009.  Treasuries have returned 9.6 percent return this year, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes showed. German  government bonds 
have gained 9 percent, and Japanese bonds have advanced 2.1
percent.  ECB Financing  Investor appetite for higher-yielding assets shrank amid
fading optimism the ECB’s three-year loans to euro-area banks
will restore confidence in sovereign borrowers. The central bank
awarded 489 billion euros ($645 billion) in 1,134-day loans in
its longer-term refinancing operation, the most ever in a single
operation and more than the median estimate of 293 billion euros
in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The result of the LTRO was pretty good, but now people are
saying that some of that extra demand was from people moving out
of the one-year into the three-year program,” said Thomas Roth,
senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
USA Inc.  Stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declining
0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
