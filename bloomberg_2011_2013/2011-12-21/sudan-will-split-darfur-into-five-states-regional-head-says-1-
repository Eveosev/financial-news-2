Sudan plans to increase the number
of states in the western region of  Darfur , where government
forces are battling rebels, to five from three, the head of the
transitional regional authority said.  “The government vision behind the split is empowering the
people of Darfur, giving them a chance to get involved in
political decisions,” Al-Tijani al-Sissi, the head of Darfur’s
Transitional Regional Authority, said today by phone from El
Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.  Under the plan, the states of West and South Darfur will be
split into West, East, Central and South Darfur, while North
Darfur will remain as one state, he said.  Insurgents took up arms in 2003, accusing the government of
neglecting the region and favoring Darfur’s largely nomadic
Arabs over African ethnic groups. The conflict has led to the
deaths of as many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and
starvation, and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes,
according to  United Nations  estimates. The Sudanese government
has put the death toll at about 10,000.  Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir has been indicted by the
 International Criminal Court  on charges of responsibility for
genocide and war crimes in Darfur.  Dividing Darfur into smaller states is part of the
government’s “well-know tactic of divide and rule,” said
Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, founder and chairman of the  Sudan  Social
Development Organization, a rights group in Darfur.  “The division actually means more marginalization for the
people as the allocated budget will be spent on salaries for
officials rather than on development,” he said today by phone
from Khartoum, Sudan’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
