New York  gasoline rose to its
largest premium in more than a month after the government
reported crude inventories fell the most in a decade last week.  The Energy Department reported  supplies  fell 10.6 million
barrels to 323.6 million last week. It was the largest decline
in barrels since Feb. 16, 2001, and almost five times the size
of the 2.13 million-barrel drop predicted by the median of 12
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in  New York  rose
0.25 cent to a premium of 1.63 cent a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:59 a.m., the
biggest premium since Nov. 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 2.55 cents a gallon to $2.618.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel versus heating
oil futures fell 0.62 cent to 3.38 cents a gallon in New York.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.25 cent to 6 cents a gallon as of 11:25
a.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
