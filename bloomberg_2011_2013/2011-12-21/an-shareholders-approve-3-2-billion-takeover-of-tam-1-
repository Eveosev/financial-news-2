Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ’s shareholders
approved the takeover of  Brazil ’s  Tam SA (TAMM4)  in a deal that will
create the world’s second-largest airline by market value.  The combined company will have a total market value of $11
billion, the second-biggest after Air China Ltd’s $11.3 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil antitrust
regulators approved the takeover on Dec. 14, after Chile’s
antitrust court approved the deal in September with conditions.  “We are setting the foundations for an airline that will
definitely have a major presence in the world’s skies,”
Chairman Jorge Awad told reporters after the shareholder vote
today. “We will attend more than 60 million passengers per
year, reach 26 countries and have more than 100 destinations.”  Tam shareholders will receive 0.9 Lan shares for each share
they own in Tam, the companies said in August 2010, when they
announced the $3.2 billion deal. Shareholders today also
approved issuing 147 million new shares that will be used for
the swap.  Lan has asked Chile’s  Supreme Court  to discard the
antitrust court’s conditions on the tie-up, which include giving
up flights between Santiago and Lima that are used to connect to
the U.S. The airline expects a ruling from the Supreme Court in
January, Awad said at the meeting.  Lan shares gained 0.7 percent to 12,420 pesos at 4:21 p.m.
in Santiago, while Tam rose 0.9 percent to 37.25 reais in  Sao
Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
