Serbia plans to sign a new 10-year
contract with OAO Gazprom for natural gas from Russia that will
eventually more than double imports to 5 billion cubic meters a
year, state-run Srbijagas said.  The Balkan nation currently imports about 2 billion cubic
meters a year and the increase is based on an anticipated rise
in demand because of investments in the  chemical industry  and
gas-fired  power plants , Srbijagas said today in a  statement  on
its website.  The new arrangement may take effect next year, Director
General Dusan Bajatovic was quoted in the statement as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
