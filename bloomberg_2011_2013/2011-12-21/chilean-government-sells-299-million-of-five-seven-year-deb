Chile sold $299 million of five- and
seven-year bonds denominated in pesos and the countryâ€™s
inflation-linked accounting unit after receiving bids for $700
million of the securities, according to a statement on the
website of the central bank.  The government sold 39.4 billion pesos ($75.4 million) of
seven-year peso bonds at a yield of 5.2 percent, $127.4 million
of five-year inflation bonds at a yield of 2.57 percent and
$95.8 million seven-year inflation bonds at a yield of 2.53
percent. The central bank manages bond auctions on behalf of the
government.  Banks bought 62 percent of the seven-year fixed-rate bonds
in pesos, 18 percent of the five-year inflation-linked bonds and
4.9 percent of the seven-year inflation-linked bonds. Pension
funds and others bought the rest.  The bid-to-cover ratio was 3.3 for the peso bonds, 1.7 for
the five-year inflation bonds and 2.4 for the seven-year
inflation bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
