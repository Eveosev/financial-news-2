Thailand ’s baht strengthened to a
one-week high on speculation fund inflows to pay for insurance
claims related to the nation’s worst floods in almost 70 years
will boost demand for the local currency.  The baht rose for a fourth day and the  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-Pacific
Index of shares gained 1.5 percent after U.S. housing starts
increased more than economists forecast, easing concern the
world’s largest economy is faltering and boosting the outlook
for  Asia ’s exports. Thailand has recorded about $2 billion of
inflows from overseas insurance, Bank of Thailand Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said on Dec. 18.  “Fund inflows from overseas insurance companies like
Japanese insurers are providing an underlying support for the
baht,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at
Bangkok Bank Pcl. “The risk sentiment seems to be improving due
to some good data.”  The baht gained 0.2 percent to 31.23 per dollar as of 8:08
a.m. in Bangkok and touched 31.18 earlier, the strongest level
since Dec. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may trade between 31.10 and 31.40 this week, Disawat
said.  The Southeast Asian currency was set for its first annual
decline since 2008, weakening 4 percent, as exchange data show
international investors sold $449 million more Thai equities
than they bought during the period. Global funds were  net
sellers  of stocks for a seventh day yesterday amid concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  The yield on the 3.25 percent debt due June 2017 was
unchanged at 3.1 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
