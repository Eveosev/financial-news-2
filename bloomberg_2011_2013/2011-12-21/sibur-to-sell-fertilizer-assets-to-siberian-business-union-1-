Sibur Holding , controlled by
billionaires Gennady Timchenko and Leonid Mikhelson, agreed to
sell fertilizer assets to Siberian Business Union, Russia’s
third-largest producer of coal for power stations.  The deal will come up for approval at the next board
meeting, Sibur, Eastern Europe’s biggest petrochemicals
producer, said today in an e-mailed statement. The assets
include OAO Azot in the coal-producing Kemerovo region and the
Angarsk nitrogen fertilizer plant, both in Siberia, Sibur and
the buyer, known by its Russian initials SDS, said in separate
statements.  The deal was valued at as much as $1 billion, Vedomosti
reported yesterday, citing people it didn’t identify. Ammonium
nitrate is used in mining as well as fertilizers.  Uralchem,  Russia ’s second-largest producer of nitrogen
fertilizers, is in talks to buy 51 percent of OAO Perm Mineral
Fertilizer from Sibur to help double urea production, Uralchem
Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Konyaev said separately today.
Uralchem values the Perm unit, which wasn’t included in Sibur’s
deal with SDS, at $550 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
