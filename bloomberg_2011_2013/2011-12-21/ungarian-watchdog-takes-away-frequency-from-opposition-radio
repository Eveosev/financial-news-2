Hungary’s national media council
reassigned three radio frequencies, taking one of them from the
country’s largest opposition radio station,  Klubradio .  The station’s frequency was awarded to Autoradio
Musorszolgaltato Kft., which bid “significantly above”  the
asking price and promised to broadcast more Hungarian music, the
watchdog said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  The media council’s decision is a “de facto ban” of
Klubradio and a “public fraud,” Andras Arato, the station’s
chairman, said in an interview today. The result of the tender
is legally questionable as the frequency was awarded to a
company with capital of 1 million forint ($4,370), while the
tender called for a “realistic” business plan, Arato said.  The government of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  drew
international criticism this year for passing a media law that
critics said would curb press freedom. Hungary’s  Constitutional
Court  vetoed parts of the law this week, saying the bill
“unconstitutionally limited freedom of the written press.”  The media council is made up of appointees of Orban’s
Fidesz party, which has a two-thirds majority in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
