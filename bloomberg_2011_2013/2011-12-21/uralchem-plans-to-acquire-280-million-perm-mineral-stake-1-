Uralchem is in talks with Sibur
Holding to buy 51 percent of OAO Perm Mineral Fertilizers in a
deal valued at at least $280 million as it seeks to gain from
rising fertilizer prices.  The acquisition, which would bring Uralchem’s total holding
in the company to 98 percent, may take two to three months to
complete, Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Konyaev told reporters
today in Moscow. Konyaev said Perm Mineral is valued at $550
million. Sibur’s press office declined to comment.  The acquisition will help  Russia ’s second-largest nitrogen-
fertilizer maker more than double urea output and boost ammonia
production by 27 percent, according to the company’s data. Urea
prices rose 28 percent in the third quarter from the first
quarter, while ammonia prices added 8.5 percent, allowing
Uralchem to boost profit and reduce debt.  “The plant in Perm is one of the best in the country and
it is very modern,” Elena Sakhnova, an analyst at VTB Capital,
said by phone. “Since Uralchem already holds a stake, no wonder
they seek to consolidate the asset which will become the best in
the holding.” The price is “reasonable,” she said.  Sibur, controlled by billionaires Gennady Timchenko and
Leonid Mikhelson, had planned to sell its fertilizer assets to
one buyer but instead decided to split the deals as separate
bids gave the assets higher value, President Dmitry Konov said
this week, according to Interfax.  Sales Surge  The company will sell its fertilizer assets in Siberia
excluding the Perm plant to Siberian Business Union, the company
said today on its website.  Perm Mineral’s urea output may reach 600,000 metric tons in
2011, while Uralchem will produce 499,000 tons, according to
Uralchem. Ammonia output after the acquisition may rise to
712,000 tons from 562,000 tons this year.  Uralchem expects sales to surge 51 percent this year to
$2.1 billion, while earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization will more than double to $763
million, Konyaev said. Net income may reach $397 million.  Uralchem, which scrapped a London share sale last year
because of adverse market conditions, may revise the plan should
it see a “good window” of opportunity and attractive
acquisition prospects, Konyaev said.  The company decreased debt this year to “not more” than
$1 billion at the end of this year from $1.36 billion at the end
of 2010, it said today. Its net debt-to-Ebitda ratio will fall
to 1.3 by the end of 2011 from 4.4 last year, it said.  Capital spending  will rise from $115 million to about $150
million next year, including expansion into new products and the
construction of an export terminal at  Latvia ’s seaport of Riga,
Konyaev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
