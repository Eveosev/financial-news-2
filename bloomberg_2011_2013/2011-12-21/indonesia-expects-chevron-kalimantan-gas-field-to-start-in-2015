Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s deep sea  natural gas 
project off East Kalimantan may start production in 2015,
 Indonesia ’s oil and gas regulator BPMigas said.  The project’s Bangka well will begin in the first quarter
of 2015, the regulator said in a Dec. 16 presentation. Rudi
Rubiandini, deputy of operations at BPMigas, confirmed the date.
The site is expected to have peak production of 110 million
cubic feet a day, according to Gde Pradnyana, a  BPMigas 
spokesman.  Bangka is one of three sections in  Chevron’s Indonesia
Deepwater Development , the BPMigas data showed. The Gendalo hub,
consisting of three natural gas fields, is scheduled to start
production in the fourth quarter of 2016, the regulator said.
The final area, Gehem, will begin flowing in the second quarter
of 2017.  “Its peak output can reach as much as 1 billion cubic feet
which may be achieved in 2017 to 2018,” Pradnyana said.  Chevron said it doesn’t comment on project time lines or
production forecasts, according to an e-mail from a spokesman
based in  Singapore . The company is “continuing to advance the
Gendalo-Gehem and Bangka projects through the design phase,” he
said in a statement.  Natural gas produced from the Gendalo-Gehem hubs will be
used inside Indonesia and supplied to Bontang liquefied natural
gas facility for export, the San Ramon-based Chevron said in a
December 2010 statement on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
