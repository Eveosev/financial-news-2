Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures rose after the Energy Department said U.S.
inventories declined the most in a decade.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, slipped to 32.9 percent at 12:30 p.m. in  New
York  from 34.88 percent yesterday. Oil gained as much as 2.1
percent after the department said supplies fell 10.6 million
barrels to 323.6 million last week, the largest barrel drop
since Feb. 16, 2001.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were February $95 puts, with 583 lots changing hands as of
11:49 a.m. in New York. The options fell 57 cents to $2.17 a

to $98.37 a barrel at 12:36 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
