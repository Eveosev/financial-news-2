The Lithuanian Parliament gave final
approval to introduce a tax for homeowners who hold more
expensive property as the country seeks budget revenue sources.  Lawmakers approved the law in a 76-5 vote today, with 21
abstentions, to tax the value of real-estate that exceeds 1
million litai ($378,000), according to Parliament’s website. The
value exceeding the untaxed 1 million litai threshold will be
levied 1 percent per year.  The Baltic nation is introducing a real-estate tax, which
has been recommended by the  International Monetary Fund  for the
past few years to expand the budget revenue tax base. The
 Finance Ministry  estimates the so-called “luxury property tax”
will add 17 million litai in additional revenue.  The tax may have some “negative effect on demand” for
more expensive real-estate, Saulius Vagonis, an analyst at real-
estate brokers  Ober-Haus  in Vilnius, said by phone. “Buyers
will now also consider the costs of maintaining the property.”  The Baltic nation’s real estate in the capital of Vilnius
remains 28 percent cheaper, compared with  price levels  before
the global economic crisis in 2008, the nation’s registry office
said yesterday. Outside of Vilnius, prices are 42 percent below
the levels three years ago, it said.  “It’s not a good time to sell, the market is dormant,”
Vagonis said. “So owners of more expensive assets are unlikely
to increase the supply in a depressive sell-off.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
