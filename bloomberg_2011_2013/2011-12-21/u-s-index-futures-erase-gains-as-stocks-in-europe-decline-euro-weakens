U.S. stock futures erased earlier
gains, leaving futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index little
changed after yesterday’s 3 percent rally in the benchmark
gauge.  Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in March lost less than 0.1
percent to 1,235.7 at 7:45 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as
much as 1.1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
