Anyone expecting the so-called
January effect to turn shares of smaller U.S. companies into
market leaders may end up waiting in vain, according to Steven G. DeSanctis, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “We do not think we will see a January effect occur in the
remainder of this month or next month,” DeSanctis wrote
yesterday in a report.  As the CHART OF THE DAY depicts, smaller companies have
only kept pace with larger ones since the end of October. In
past years, they rallied during the period in anticipation of
further gains in January. The chart compares the  Russell 2000 
Index, whose companies have a median market capitalization of
about $455.65 million, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, with
a median market cap of $11.1 billion.  Price swings linked to concern that the U.S. and European
economies are faltering explain why the effect is unlikely to
surface, according to DeSanctis, a small-cap stock specialist
based in  New York .  Volatility for the Russell 2000 peaked on Nov. 30 at an
annual rate of 49.6 percent, based on its 90-day performance.
The reading was the highest in 2 1/2 years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In January, small caps beat large caps 73 percent of the
time since 1926, according to his analysis of figures from the
University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices.
The percentage is the highest for any month of the year. Small
caps also had their best monthly performance in January, with an
average gain of 4 percent, DeSanctis wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
