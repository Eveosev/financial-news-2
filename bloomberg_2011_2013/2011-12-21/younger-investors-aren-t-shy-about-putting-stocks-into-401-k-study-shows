More younger U.S. workers saving for
retirement have a higher allocation to stocks than a decade ago,
two groups that studied buying patterns said.  About 60 percent of 401(k) investors in their twenties had
more than 80 percent of their accounts invested in equities at
the end of 2010 compared with about 55 percent of investors in
2000, according to a report by the  Investment Company Institute ,
a trade group for the mutual-fund industry, and the Employee
Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit.  “Younger investors are pursuing a diversified investment
strategy that still relies heavily on stocks,” said Sarah Holden, senior director of retirement and investor research at
ICI.  The numbers from EBRI and ICI, both based in  Washington ,
were drawn from a database of about 23 million active 401(k)
savings-plan participants. An estimated 51 million American
workers were using 401(k)s at year-end 2010, and assets totaled
about $3 trillion, according to the  report .  About 21 percent of savers in their sixties had more than
80 percent of their accounts invested in stocks last year
compared with about 40 percent of investors in 2000, Holden
said. “We see a tempering of the allocation to stock among our
older participants,” she said.  No Equities  Separate  studies  by ICI have shown that U.S. households are
less willing to take on financial risk in the wake of the
financial crisis in 2008, said Holden. Concern that younger
individuals may be timid about buying stocks hasn’t been borne
out by the data on 401(k) participants, she said.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained about 826 percent
over the 30-year-period from Dec. 31, 1980, to the end of 2010.  The number of younger workers without equities in their
401(k) accounts also decreased at year-end 2010 to 9.4 percent
from 14.6 percent in 2000, said Jack VanDerhei, research
director at EBRI.  “A lot of that may not necessarily be due to employees
themselves actively making that choice as much as it’s them
being automatically enrolled, being put in target-date funds,”
VanDerhei said.  Target-Date Funds  Target-date funds move money from riskier investments such
as stocks to more conservative alternatives like bonds as an
investor reaches retirement. The funds were available in 70
percent of 401(k) plans in 2010, according to the study. At the
end of last year 49 percent of participants in their twenties
held them, compared with 28 percent of savers in their sixties,
the report said.  At the end of 2010, the average account balance of workers
was $60,329, compared with $58,351 in 2009, the data show. The
balances in this study are not based on a consistent sample
year-over-year, the report said.  The average balance at  Fidelity Investments , the largest
provider of 401(k) plans with almost 11.7 million participants,
was $64,300 as of Sept. 30, a decline of about 2 percent from a
year earlier, said  Beth McHugh , vice president of market
insights for the Boston-based firm.  Outstanding Loans  The percentage of participants with outstanding loans from
their 401(k)s remained unchanged at year-end 2010 compared with
2009, the study said. Last year, 21 percent of workers had loans
outstanding, which was higher than the 18 percent at the end of
2008, according to the report.  The number of people borrowing from their retirement-
savings plans reached a 10-year high in the second quarter of
2010 as Americans grappled with slowing economic growth,
according to a separate report by Fidelity Investments released
in August last year.  Total U.S. retirement assets including 401(k) and IRA
accounts decreased about 7.5 percent to  $17 trillion  as of Sept.
30, according to a separate report by the ICI released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
