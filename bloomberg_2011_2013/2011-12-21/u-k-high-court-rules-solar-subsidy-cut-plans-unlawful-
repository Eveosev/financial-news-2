The U.K. High Court ruled that a
government plan to cut subsidies for solar energy starting Dec.
12 was “unlawful,” suggesting incentives for the industry will
be restricted later than currently proposed.  Justice Mitting said the Department of Energy & Climate
Change made an “unlawful decision” in ordering the feed-in
tariff for solar power cut starting Dec. 12, before a
consultation with industry about the plan was finished.  Companies including Solarcentury and lobby groups such as
Friends of the Earth challenged the government plan, saying it
puts at risk 4,500 jobs and the future of the U.K. solar
industry.  “This is a great victory,” Howard Johns, head of the
Solar Trade Association, said at the court in  London  after the
decision was handed down. “It’s very unusual for a judicial
review to go against the government. The uncertainty is still
here, but it gives us hope.”  David Cameron ’s Conservative government and the Labour
opposition both agreed that subsidies for the industry had to be
cut to keep a boom in solar installations from driving up
electricity bills.  Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne  in October proposed cuts of as
much as 55 percent beginning Dec. 12. A consultation about the
changes ends later this month.  The government has until Jan. 4 to appeal today’s decision,
though the judge said it’s unlikely there would be grounds to
make a challenge successful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
