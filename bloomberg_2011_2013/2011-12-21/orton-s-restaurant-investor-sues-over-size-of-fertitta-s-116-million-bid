Morton’s Restaurant Group Inc. (MRT)  was
sued by an investor who claims a $6.90-a-share, $116.6 million
takeover offer by  Landry’s Inc.  restaurant chain Chief Executive
Officer Tilman J. Fertitta is too low.  Directors of the Chicago-based steakhouse operator have a
duty to enhance stockholder value in the sale and shirked their
responsibilities, lawyers for Shelley Willner said in today’s
Delaware Chancery Court complaint.  The price “is unfair and grossly inadequate” considering
the company’s potential for “future growth in profits and
earnings,” Willner contends in court papers asking a judge to
stop the deal and award unspecified damages.  The offer, announced Dec. 16, would add the high-end
steakhouse chain to the Texas billionaire Fertitta’s brands
including Landry’s, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., Rainforest Café and
pending acquisition McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood Restaurants
Inc.  Ronald M. DiNella, Morton’s chief financial officer, wasn’t
immediately available to respond to a phone call seeking comment
on the suit.  The case is Willner v. Morton’s, CA7132,  Delaware  Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
