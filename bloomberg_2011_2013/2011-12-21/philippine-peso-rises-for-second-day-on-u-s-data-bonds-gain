The  Philippine peso  advanced for a
second day after better-than-forecast U.S. housing starts eased
concern global growth is faltering. Bonds gained.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares climbed the most in
three weeks after U.S. builders broke ground in November on more
houses than at any time in the past 19 months. Starts increased
9 percent to a 685,000 annual rate, exceeding the highest
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, official data
showed yesterday. The U.S. is the second-biggest destination for
Philippine exports.  “We’re seeing U.S. developments supporting risk
appetite,” said Lito Biacora, senior vice president and head of
private banking at Bank of the Philippine Islands in Manila.
“The market is still cautious because of the European credit
situation.”  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 43.645 per dollar at the close
in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached
44.323 on Dec. 15, the weakest level since Jan. 31. It advanced
0.4 percent this year.  Foreign investors bought $391 million more Philippine
stocks than they sold in the first three days of this week,
exchange data show.  The yield on the Philippine government’s 5.75 percent bonds
due November 2021 dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage
point, to 5.394 percent, according to noon fixing prices from
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. That’s the lowest level for
a benchmark 10-year note since at least 1998, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation’s 11-month budget deficit reached 96 billion
pesos ($2.2 billion), compared with 269.8 billion pesos a year
earlier, the government said today.  The  Philippines  is likely to sell dollar-denominated bonds,
Treasurer  Roberto Tan  said yesterday. The government has
received central bank approval to sell as much as $1.5 billion
of debt and may offer 25-year securities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
