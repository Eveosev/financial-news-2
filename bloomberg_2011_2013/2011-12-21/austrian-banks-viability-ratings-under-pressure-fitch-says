Austrian banks’ credit ratings may
come under pressure if their plans to strengthen capital are
delayed or earnings are eroded by “accelerated deleveraging,”
 Fitch Ratings  said.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , eastern Europe’s third-
largest lender, will be “challenged” to fill a 2.1 billion-
euro ($2.8 billion) capital gap determined by the European
Banking Authority on its own, Fitch said in a statement today.
 Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) , the lender that failed the
EBA’s stress test twice and has a 1.05 billion-euro shortfall,
may have to seek state aid, Fitch said.  “Pressure could arise notably if plans to improve
capitalization” before the EBA’s mid-2012 deadline are
“delayed,” Fitch said. “Accelerated deleveraging in an
attempt to meet the EBA targets could firstly potentially damage
the banks’ earnings base, notably in central and eastern Europe
and secondly further worsen the already fragile banking
environment.”  Raiffeisen, Volksbanken,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and other
Austrian banks, excluding  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s Bank Austria AG, are
the biggest lenders in eastern Europe, having loaned $266
billion as of June, according to the Bank for International
Settlements. Erste and Raiffeisen have said they are able to
meet the EBA’s target to hold 9 percent of risk-weighted assets
in core capital without resorting to state aid and without
selling new shares.  Austria’s central bank and regulator FMA told Erste, Bank
Austria and Raiffeisen last month to limit new lending in
eastern Europe to the deposits and wholesale funding the units
can raise on their own. Erste’s gap determined by the EBA is
equivalent to 743 million euros of additional capital, the
regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
