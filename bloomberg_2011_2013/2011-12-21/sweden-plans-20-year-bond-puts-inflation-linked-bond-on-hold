Sweden will issue a new 20-year
nominal bond through debt exchanges in response to interest from
potential investors, the  Swedish National Debt Office  said.  “In order to create liquidity in the new loan, the volume
should quickly be raised to 10-20 billion kronor ($1.5 billion-
$2.9 billion),” the agency said. “As our borrowing requirement
is limited, the introduction will be made through exchanges.”  Plans for a 30-year inflation-linked bond have been put on
hold due to a lack of investor interest, the agency said.  Demand for Swedish bonds has surged during the financial
crisis as investors dumped euro asset. The country is tapping
longer maturity bonds to lock in borrowing costs. Sweden’s 10-
year notes yield about 24 basis points less than German debt
with a similar maturity.  Sweden’s general government debt will dwindle to 35.9
percent of gross domestic product in 2012, compared with 90.6
percent for the euro area, the OECD said last month. The  economy 
will expand 4.1 percent in 2011, more than twice the 1.6 percent
rate in the euro area, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
