Colombia  will limit the amount banks
can charge for cash withdrawals at automated teller machines in
a new regulation opposed by the country’s banking association.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said that under a
new decree banks will be able to charge a maximum 3,965 pesos
($2.05) per ATM withdrawal outside their networks. ATM costs in
Colombia are “excessive” and among the highest in  Latin
America , Echeverry said.  “This is aimed at more inclusive banking and will attract
more people to financial services,” Echeverry told reporters in
Bogota.  The fee ceiling may take away incentives for banks to
install more ATMs and could reduce “quality of service,” Maria Mercedes Cuellar, head of Colombia’s banking association, told
CM& Noticias Dec. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
