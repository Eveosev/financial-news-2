The  Federal Reserve  began selling as
much as $8.75 billion of Treasuries in todayâ€™s second permanent
open-market transaction, part of a program to lower borrowing
costs.  The Fed Bank of New York is offering Treasuries due from
June 2013 to November 2013 for sale in the operation, according
to data on its  website .  The central bank sold $8.12 billion of securities earlier
today maturing from November 2013 through March 2014.  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term securities through June. The program
has come to be known as Operation Twist, after a similar plan in
the 1960s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
