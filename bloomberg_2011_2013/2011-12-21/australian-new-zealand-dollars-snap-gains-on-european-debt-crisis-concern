The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars snapped a two-day advance amid concern the  European
Central Bank ’s measures to boost liquidity may not stem the
region’s debt crisis.  The so-called Aussie slid on prospects Asian stocks may
decline, sapping demand for higher-yielding assets. Losses in
the New Zealand dollar were limited after a report showed the
economy expanded in the third quarter more than economists had
forecast as the  Rugby World Cup  boosted spending.  “I think we’re still at the beginning of the crisis and
nowhere near towards the end,” said Keagan York, the SYdney-
based head of foreign-exchange strategy at Compass Global
Markets. “The ECB loans operation was only a temporary measure
to get some liquidity back into the markets. You’ll see the
Aussie start to drift back off.”  The Australian dollar was at $1.0088 at 10:25 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0103 in  New York  yesterday. The currency slid to
78.78 yen from 78.82.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 76.92 U.S. cents from 77.04
yesterday, when it advanced 0.3 percent. The so-called kiwi fell
0.1 percent to 60.07 yen.  Euro-area lenders took a record 489 billion euros
($638 billion) from the ECB in three-year loans yesterday, more
than economists’ median estimate of 293 billion euros in a
Bloomberg News survey. Policy makers are flooding the banking
system with cheap money in an attempt to stave off a credit
crunch by encouraging banks to maintain lending.  New Zealand’s gross domestic product expanded 0.8 percent
in the third quarter from the previous three months and 1.9
percent from a year earlier, a government report showed today in
Wellington. The median estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of
14 economists were for a 0.6 percent quarterly gain and a 2.2
percent year-on-year advance.  -- Editors: Benjamin Purvis, Garfield Reynolds  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
