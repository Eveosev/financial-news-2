it plans to give one bonus share for every five held.  The shares rallied 2.5 percent to 28.60 riyals, the highest
intraday level since Nov. 14, at 2:25 p.m. in  Riyadh .  The bank will raise its capital to 3.97 billion riyals from
3.31 billion riyals through the bonus issue, it said late
yesterday. Saudi Hollandiâ€™s board also proposed paying 1 riyal a
share dividend for 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
