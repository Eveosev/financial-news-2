Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s BMO Harris Bank
agreed to pay $9.4 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the
Chicago lender of illegally charging excessive overdraft fees,
according to court papers.  The settlement reached Nov. 30 ends the bank’s role in the
litigation, according to a filing yesterday in federal court in
Miami. Overdraft suits filed across the U.S. have been
consolidated in that court for pretrial proceedings.  Account holder Stephanie Blahut accused the bank of
manipulating and reordering debited transactions in accounts
from highest to lowest to increase the number of overdraft fees
it can charge. Blahut sued seeking to represent all Harris Bank
customers.  Suits against more than 30 banks have been consolidated
before U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in Miami in so-
called multidistrict litigation. King has been overseeing
pretrial exchanges of information in the cases since June 2009.
The Harris Bank settlement still requires the judge’s approval.  The consolidated case is In re Checking Account Overdraft
Litigation, 09-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 Florida  (Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
