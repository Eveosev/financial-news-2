Mediterranean ports are luring trade
from Hamburg and Rotterdam as upgraded rail links allow shipping
lines to unload containers earlier in the journey from  Asia  and
complete deliveries overland.  Trieste  on the Adriatic is 22.5 days sail from  Singapore ,
Asia’s No. 2 port, or a week closer than Hamburg, according to
 A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S , owner of the No. 1  container line . The
rail journey from the Italian port takes a few more days.  Mediterranean harbors, which vessels transporting goods
from Asia encounter first after passing through the Suez Canal,
are becoming competitive even for consignments headed further
north as shippers slow sailing speeds to reduce diesel costs.
The trend may accelerate as south European governments eager to
encourage economic growth spend more on rail infrastructure.  “Northern Europe’s market share could be under threat in
coming years as more cargo shifts south,” said Mike Garratt,
director of  Box Trade Intelligence , which monitors 20 global
trade lanes. The time saved compared with a journey to the  North
Sea  via Gibraltar can cut transit times or allow even slower
sailings, paring fuel use without impacting deliveries.  Deep-sea imports through  Italy  and the Balkans have risen
115 percent over the past 15 years, while Germany,  Belgium ,
Denmark and the Netherlands posted a 69 percent gain, figures
compiled by Box Trade Intelligence show.  Deep Water  Shipping lines are exploring all options as vessels bought
when demand was higher enter service, hurting freight rates and
margins. European box shipments rose 4.5 percent in the first 10
months, trailing an 8 percent gain in capacity, data from
Container Trade Statistics shows. Volumes in 2012 may rise 3.1
percent and capacity 10 by percent, according to  Alphaliner .  Trieste, located on the open sea 70 miles (113 kilometers)
from Venice, has a harbor that’s 18 meters (60 feet) deep and
able to handle the largest container ships at full load, unlike
northern rivals Hamburg, Bremerhaven and Antwerp, which are
situated on river estuaries and rely on regular dredging.  The  Italian port  has more than 100 container-train services
a week provided by Societa Alpe Adria SpA to destinations in
 Germany ,  Austria ,  Hungary , Slovakia and the  Czech Republic , and
is targeting countries as distant as  Poland , one of the main
markets for Hamburg, as it benefits from 334 million euros ($436
million) in spending on docks and infrastructure by 2017.  BMW Bid  A near-term aim is to capture flows from Munich in southern
Germany, home to  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , Siemens AG and
truckmaker MAN SE. The Bavarian city is situated 322 kilometers
from Trieste, or about half the distance to Hamburg and
Rotterdam, a 12-hour journey for a container train.  In addition to improved rail links, Trieste also sits 71
kilometers closer to the “center of gravity” for the region’s
ports compared with 1996 as demand grows faster in Central and
Eastern Europe than further west, while Rotterdam is relatively
more distant, according to Box Trade Intelligence.  Just around a headland to the south of Trieste,  Luka Koper (LKPG) ,
the only port on  Slovenia ’s 30-mile coastline, already forwards
two-thirds of the goods it handles to Hungary, Italy, Slovakia,
south Germany and Austria, for which it’s the No. 1 coastal
entry and exit point, with a bigger market share than Rotterdam.  Luka Koper ranks as the Adriatic’s busiest container dock,
handling an estimated 600,000 boxes this year, and is one of the
biggest Mediterranean auto terminals, spokesman Sebastjan Sik
said, with links to Alpine rail routes to be upgraded next year.  Paris Link  Clients include Italy’s Sermar Line Srl and Shipping Corp.
of  India , or SCI, which said October they’d establish a joint
service linking Koper and Venice and Ravenna in Italy with the
Indian ports of Nava Sheva and Mundra, easing the transport of
exports from the subcontinent to central and eastern  Europe .  Marseille Fos, Europe’s fifth-biggest port and the world’s
third-largest crude oil terminal, will begin operating extra-
long 850-meter container trains to Valenton in the suburbs of
Paris next year. It also plans to start services connecting with
a truck-on-train “rolling motorway” between Perpignan, close
to the Spanish border, and Bettembourg in Luxembourg from 2015.  Total cargo handled at  France ’s top port  rose 1 percent  in
the first nine months on increased shipments of liquefied gas,
fertilizers and cereals as container traffic shrank 6 percent.  Piraeus Potential  Harbors in other countries hurt by Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis might reap similar gains given infrastructure
improvements. Vessels operated by CMA CGM SA, the world’s No. 3
container line, take 26 days to reach Piraeus, near  Athens , from
 Taiwan , versus  33 days  to Rotterdam and 35 to Hamburg.  Southern ports have suffered most as the crisis crimps
growth. Box numbers fell 0.7 percent in Gioia Tauro, Italy, in
the first half and rose 3.9 percent in Algeciras,  Spain , versus
gains of 9.8 percent in Rotterdam and 17 percent in Hamburg.  The latter has the biggest hinterland among European ports
in terms of containers moved by train, truck and barge, serving
Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and  Denmark , and is
taking steps to safeguard its market share.  Container numbers moved by train this year rose 9 percent
to 2.1 million, the Hamburg Port Authority estimates. Rail
traffic to Poland and the Czech Republic will double by 2020,
with 400 trains a day versus 1,200 a week today, it said Nov. 29
in a presentation at the Intermodal Europe 2011 conference.  To contact the reporters on this story:
