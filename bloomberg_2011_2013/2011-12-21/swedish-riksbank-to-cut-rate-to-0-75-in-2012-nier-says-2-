Sweden’s economy will stall in the
coming quarters and the country’s central bank will lower
 interest rates  next year as inflation slows, the National
Institute for  Economic Research  said.  “We forecast falling GDP in the coming quarters,” said
Jesper Hansson, head of forecasting at NIER, at a press
conference today in Stockholm. The institute forecasts the
Riksbank will cut its benchmark rate by one percentage point
during the first half of 2012, he said.  The largest Nordic economy will grow 0.6 percent next year,
down from an August forecast of 1.9 percent, the Stockholm-based
institute said. The Riksbank will cut its benchmark rate to 0.75
percent by the end of next year, the group forecast.  Sweden’s central bank yesterday cut its benchmark repo rate
for the first time since 2009 to 1.75 percent, citing weakening
growth prospects and inflationary pressure. Growth in the
Swedish economy is slowing as European leaders are struggling to
contain a sovereign debt crisis.  “Through increased uncertainty and weak exports,  Sweden  is
being negatively affected by the government debt crisis in
 Europe ,” the NIER said in a statement. “The year 2012 will
thus be one of lackluster growth. Absence of progress toward
solutions for the crisis-ridden countries of the euro area is
unnecessarily delaying recovery.”  The krona rose 0.2 percent to 8.9627 per euro and 0.6
percent to 6.8225 against the dollar as of 11:46 a.m. in
Stockholm.  The NIER today forecast growth of 4.5 percent this year.
Inflation will slow to 1.1 percent next year from 3 percent this
year and unemployment will rise to 7.8 percent next year and 7.9
percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
