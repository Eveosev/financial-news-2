Former  Areva SA (CEI)  Chief Executive  Anne Lauvergeon  has filed a criminal complaint after discovering a
private investigators’ report that included detailed itineraries
and telephone communications of her husband, Le Canard Enchaine
reported, citing an interview.  Her complaint is against ‘X’, a legal formula used in
France when asking investigative magistrates to start a probe,
Le Canard reported. The report focuses on the purchase of a
Namibian uranium mine during Lauvergeon’s tenure, and concludes
that her husband didn’t benefit from the operation, the
investigative weekly reported.  Lauvergeon was replaced by Luc Oursel as Areva’s CEO in
June. Areva’s press office didn’t immediately return phone calls
seeking comment.  AREVA FP <Equity> CN  To contact the reporter on this story:
