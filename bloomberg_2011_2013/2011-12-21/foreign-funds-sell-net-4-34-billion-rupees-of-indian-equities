Overseas  investors  sold a net  4.34
billion rupees  ($82 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, taking
their withdrawals from equities this year to 29.3 billion
rupees, according to data from the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 19.63 billion rupees of shares and sold
23.97 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India
said  today . They bought a net 1.19 billion rupees of bonds,
taking total flows into debt this year to 400.1 billion rupees.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has dropped 24 percent this
year on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis
will erode corporate earnings already threatened by the most
aggressive interest-rate increases among major Asian economies.  Flows from abroad surged to a record $29.4 billion in 2010,
making the Sensex the best performer among the world’s top 10
markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual
slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds  have placed 4.4 trillion rupees in stocks and
1.187 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
