Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp. (IART) 
promoted Peter Arduini to chief executive officer and named
current CEO Stuart Essig as board chairman of the surgical-
products company.  Arduini, the current chief operating officer, will take
over on Jan. 3, the Plainsboro, New Jersey-based medical-device
maker said in a statement today. He was also elected to a new
position on Integra’s board. Essig was appointed executive
chairman of the board after serving as CEO for 14 years,
according to the statement.  Arduini takes over a company that had $732.1 million in
sales of devices for orthopedic, neurosurgery, spinal and
reconstructive procedures last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. He joined Integra in November 2010 after
management positions in health-care units at General Electric
Co. and Baxter International Inc.  “Pete is an enormously talented executive with a truly
global perspective,” Essig said in the statement.  “He has won
the respect and loyalty of our board, management team, employees
and customers, and is the right leader to drive the growth and
profitability of this great company for years to come. ”  Integra fell less than 1 percent to $31.19 at the close of
New York trading. The shares have declined 34 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
