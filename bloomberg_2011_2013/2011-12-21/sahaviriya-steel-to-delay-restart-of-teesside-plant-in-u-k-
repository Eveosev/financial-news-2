Sahaviriya Steel Industries Pcl (SSI) ,
Thailand’s biggest steelmaker, said the restart of its iron and
steelmaking operations at the Teesside site in northeast  England 
will be delayed.  Unfavorable weather conditions and additional unplanned
works are responsible for the company’s inability to restart
operations on Jan. 6 as originally scheduled, Phil Dryden, chief
executive officer at Sahaviriya Steel Industries UK Ltd., said
in a statement today. The resumption should take place at the
beginning of next year, he said.  Sahaviriya Steel Industries UK Ltd., a unit of the Thai
company, acquired Teesside Cast Products from Tata Steel Ltd. in
March for $469 million. The deal includes the purchase of coke
ovens, power-generation facilities and the Redcar Blast Furnace.
Under the ownership of  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the plant ceased
operating in February 2010.  The delay isn’t expected to affect Sahaviriya’s sales. The
company has prepared raw materials to meet a forecast increase
in orders as factories rebuild after Thailand’s worst flooding
in 70 years, President Win Viriyaprapaikit said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
