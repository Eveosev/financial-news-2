EON AG ,  Germany â€™s largest utility,
received permission from local authorities for a 250 million-
euro ($328 million) expansion of an underground hydro pump
storage plant.  The utility plans to add a 300-megawatt pump turbine to the
Waldeck 2 facility, the Dusseldorf-based company said today in
an e-mailed statement. A final  investment decision  will be made
next year, it said.  EON last week said it will invest 7 billion euros in
renewable energy projects in the next five years as the country
abandons nuclear power.  Pump storage plants pump water at hydropower plants from a
lower reservoir to a higher elevation during times of low
demand. The water is released when demand is high, plunging
through a turbine to generate electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
