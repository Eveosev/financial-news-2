Hungary plans to pass a law by the
year-end governing the central bank, including how monetary
policy committee members are nominated, even after the European
Commission called for it to be withdrawn, Foreign Affairs
Minister Janos Martonyi said in an interview on public radio
station  MR1-Kossuth  today.  Lawmakers amended the draft to satisfy most of the  European
Central Bank â€™s recommendations, the minister said. The EC
yesterday said President  Jose Barroso  called on Hungarian Prime
Minister Viktor Orban to withdraw and rewrite the draft law,
saying it would subject the Hungarian central bank to
improper political influence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
