Vietnam ’s five-year bonds advanced
on speculation cash added to the financial system by the central
bank provided lenders with more funds to purchase government
debt. The dong fell.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam added a net 17.6 trillion dong
($836 million) this month through yesterday via open-market
operations, compared with 12.6 trillion dong for the whole of
November, according to Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-
based analyst at Viet Capital Securities.  “The secondary market has been quite active as demand for
bonds has improved because banks have more cash,” Phong said.  Yields  on five-year government debt fell eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 12.47 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong dropped 0.1 percent to 21,043 per dollar as of
3:07 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the reference rate at 20,813, unchanged since
Dec. 14, its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up
