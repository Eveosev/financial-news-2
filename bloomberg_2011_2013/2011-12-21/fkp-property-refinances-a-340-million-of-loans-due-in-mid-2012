FKP Property Group (FKP) , an Australian
real-estate company, refinanced A$340 million ($343 million) of
loans due in mid-2012.  The Brisbane-based company extended a A$272 million
facility and a separate A$68 million project finance credit to
June 30, 2015, according to a regulatory filing. The pricing and
terms were improved on both, and the companyâ€™s weighted average
cost of debt reduced to 8.3 percent, FKP said today in the
filing.  FKP also agreed to a A$50 million project finance loan to
fund the construction of an apartment development in Sydney,
according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
