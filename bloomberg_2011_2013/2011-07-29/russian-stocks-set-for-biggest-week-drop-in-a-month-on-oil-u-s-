Russian stocks fell, capping the
biggest weekly decline in more than a month, as oil fell and a
report showed the  U.S. economy  grew less than forecast.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks dropped 0.9 percent to
1,705.18 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. That brings the
week’s retreat to 1.4 percent, its worst since June 19. Oil
producer OAO Tatneft slumped 3.2 percent today. OAO Gazprom, the
natural-gas export monopoly, fell 1.3 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index declined 1 percent to 1,965.02.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as 2.6 percent to
$94.95 a barrel in  New York  after House Speaker  John Boehner 
delayed a planned vote on debt-limit legislation as Senate
leaders stood ready to kill the measure should it get to their
chamber. Stocks extended losses after data from the Commerce
Department showed the world’s largest economy grew 1.3 percent
in the second quarter, less than analysts predicted.  “The longer we wait for the deal the greater the level of
nervousness,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at ING Groep NV in
Moscow, said in an e-mailed report today. “A majority of
traders will simply stay away until the U.S. debt uncertainty is
resolved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
