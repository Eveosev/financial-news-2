Copper futures rebounded after a
strike at  Chile ’s Escondida mine, the world’s largest source of
the metal, stretched into an eighth day, signaling shrinking
global supplies.  Union leaders at BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida unit
rejected an improved bonus offer by the company and vowed to
continue the strike that has halted shipments from the mine.
Escondida accounts for about a fifth of all copper produced in
Chile, the world’s top supplier.  “The market wants to rally,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “Investors make a scramble for the metal
every time there is a big strike.”  Copper futures for September delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.2
percent, to close at $4.4795 a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . In July, the metal gained 4.6 percent, the most
this year.  Earlier, the price fell as much as 1.3 percent amid signs
of a sluggish  U.S. economy  and the political stalemate on the
debt ceiling. The metal climbed 1.6 percent this week.  Futures may advance next week on supply concerns, a
Bloomberg survey showed. Copper has gained 36 percent in the
past year, reaching a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15, as mining
companies struggled to keep pace with rising consumption.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose $16, or 0.2 percent, to $9,830 a ton ($4.46 a
pound).  Nickel also gained in  London . Aluminum, lead, tin and zinc
fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
