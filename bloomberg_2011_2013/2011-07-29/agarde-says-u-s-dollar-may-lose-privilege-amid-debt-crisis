International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said the dollar’s standing as the
world’s main reserve currency may be diminished as U.S.
lawmakers fail to lift the nation’s debt limit.  The U.S. currency has had an “exorbitant privilege because
it was the reserve currency that most central banks had,”
Lagarde said in an interview on PBS’s “Newshour” yesterday.
“If there was a dent in this exorbitant privilege and the
confidence that most people have towards the dollar, it would
probably entail a decline of the dollar relative to other
currencies.”  U.S. lawmakers are negotiating to raise the nation’s $14.3
trillion debt limit by Aug. 2 to prevent a default. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the currency against those of six trading
partners, slid to an eight-week low this week.  The delay may cause “doubts in the mind of those people
who reserve currencies as to whether the dollar is effectively
the ultimate and prime currency of reserve,” Lagarde said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
