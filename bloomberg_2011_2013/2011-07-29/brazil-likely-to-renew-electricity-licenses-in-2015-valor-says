Brazil â€™s government is likely to
renew contracts for hydroelectric plants, electricity
distributors and transmission networks expiring in 2015, Valor
Economico said, citing unidentified officials from the Mines and
Energy Ministry and the national electricity regulator, Aneel.  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  wants Brazil to change a
law to enable the expiring power licenses to be renewed, which
would allow the state-controlled company to cut energy costs,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
