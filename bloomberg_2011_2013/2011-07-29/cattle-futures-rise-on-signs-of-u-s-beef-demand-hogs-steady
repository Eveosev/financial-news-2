Cattle futures rose to the highest
in more than a week on signs of improved demand for U.S. beef.
Hogs were little changed.  Meatpackers are willing to pay more for animals amid higher
profits, said  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures Insights
in Altus,  Arkansas . Spot-market  steer  prices averaged $1.0755 a
pound in the first four days of this week, up 16 percent from a
year earlier, government data show.  Prices rose on “underlying demand for cattle and beef,”
Vaught said in a telephone interview. “Packer profits have been
quite strong, and that’s probably as much as a reason for the
cash strength as anything.”  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 1.175 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $1.17325 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, after reaching $1.17475, the highest since
July 19. The price, up 1.7 percent this week, has climbed 5.8
percent this month, a second straight gain.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.05 cent to settle
at 92.4 cents a pound in  Chicago . The commodity has jumped 18
percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement gained 1.25
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.3705 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
