Suntech Power Holdings, the world’s
largest maker of solar panels, rose the most in six weeks after
a media report that said  China  will announce benchmark prices
for the state power grid to purchase electricity from
photovoltaic projects.  The American depositary receipts jumped 6 percent to $7.38
at 2:31 p.m. New York time, the biggest intraday gain since June
14.  The purchase prices for solar power will be higher than
those for wind-generated electricity and open to local
government subsidies, China Securities Journal reported today,
citing an unidentified official with the National Energy Bureau.
