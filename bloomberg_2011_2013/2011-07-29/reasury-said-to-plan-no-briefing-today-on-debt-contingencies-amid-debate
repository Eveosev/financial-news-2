The U.S. Treasury Department won’t
brief the public today on contingency plans for payment of the
nation’s bills in case the debt ceiling isn’t raised by Aug. 2,
according to a Democratic Party official familiar with the
matter.  The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the briefing and
didn’t want to be named.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
