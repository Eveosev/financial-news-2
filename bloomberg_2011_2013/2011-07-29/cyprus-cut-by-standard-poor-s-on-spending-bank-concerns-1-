Cyprus’s long-term government bond
ratings were downgraded by  Standard & Poor’s  Ratings Services to
BBB+ from A-, two days after a similar move by Moody’s Investors
Service.  S&P cited concerns about the Cypriot government’s
“inconsistent commitment to cutting public spending in order to
offset a substantial decline in  capital gains  and corporate tax
revenues.” It also said there is a risk that some Cypriot banks
will need state support, given their exposure to both Greek
loans and government debt. The rating company said its outlook
for Cyprus was negative.  “The Cypriot banking sector’s loans to Greek customers and
holdings of Greek sovereign and bank debt are alone equivalent
to more than 160 percent of Cyprus’s gross domestic product,”
S&P said in an e-mailed statement today.  President Demetris Christofias ordered his Cabinet to
resign amid political discord after the Moody’s cut and
following a munitions blast that wrecked a main power plant.  “Despite ongoing talks about substantial consolidation
measures, we believe the Cypriot government will struggle to
meet its 2011 general government deficit target of less than 4
percent of GDP and its 2012 target of 2 percent,” S&P said.
“This, in turn will likely increase the government’s debt
burden, which we currently expect will be 80 percent of GDP by
the end of 2011.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
