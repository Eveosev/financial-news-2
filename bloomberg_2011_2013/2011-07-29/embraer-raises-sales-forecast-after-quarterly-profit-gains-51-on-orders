Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker by sales, said second-quarter profit rose 51
percent after it added orders and delivered 48 aircraft. The
company boosted its sales forecast for the year.  Net income increased to 153.8 million reais ($98.1 million)
from 101.7 million reais a year earlier, the  Sao Jose dos
Campos , Brazil-based company said yesterday in a regulatory
filing. The mean estimate of three analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was 102 million reais. Sales fell 11 percent to 2.17
billion reais. Deliveries reached 48 aircraft, with a backlog of
$15.8 billion.  The company boosted its net sales forecast for the year to
$5.8 billion from $5.6 billion. Embraer also estimated its
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
for the year would reach $700 million, with an Ebitda margin of
12 percent. The planemaker cut investments for 2011 to $160
million from $210 million. The company has booked 62 E-Jet
orders so far in 2011.  Embraer saw “significant strength in orders,” Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said in a July 13 report. Shares have lagged
partly due to concerns on unit slippage beyond the quarter into
the second half, and the appreciation of  Brazil ’s real, Goldman
said in the note. Embraer said in April it will postpone some
deliveries for the quarter to the second half after the
earthquake in  Japan .  The company’s shares fell 1.4 percent to 10.46 reais at the
market close in  Sao Paulo  yesterday. The shares have fallen 11
percent this year, against a 15 percent drop of the benchmark
Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
