Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , the second-
biggest South African coal producer, plans to close the Zincor
refinery in the country and may fire workers at the plant after
failing to turn a profit or find a buyer.  “Zincor as a zinc-making operation has proved to be
unsaleable,” Chief Executive Officer Sipho Nkosi said today in
a statement. “Zinc-making is financially unsustainable, with
Zincor incurring mounting financial losses; and turn-around and
improvement interventions have proved fruitless.”  Exxaro unveiled plans to restructure and then sell zinc
assets in 2009 to rid itself of low-margin, cyclical operations
susceptible to rising energy costs and currency rates. Exxaro is
still in talks on selling 50.04 percent of  Namibia ’s Rosh Pinah
zinc and lead mine and 22 percent of the Chifeng smelter in
 China . Zincor produced 120,000 metric tons of zinc last year.  Base metals and industrial minerals contributed 12 percent
to Exxaro’s overall sales in 2010, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
