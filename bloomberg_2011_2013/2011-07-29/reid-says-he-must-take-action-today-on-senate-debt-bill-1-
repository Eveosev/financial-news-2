Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
said he will take action by the end of the day on his debt-limit
plan.  “Will today’s Republicans break away from the shrill voice
of the Tea Party and return to the Republican Party of  Ronald
Reagan ?” the Nevada Democrat said today on the Senate floor.
“This is likely our last chance to save this nation from a
default.”  Reid said he was told by Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  that “it’s already started. The international
community is extremely worried. They can only get overnight
loans, and it’s really precarious for our country.”  He said he is asking Senate Republican leader  Mitch McConnell  of Kentucky to meet with him and “negotiate in good
faith knowing the clock is running down.”  “We cannot wait for the House any longer,” Reid said.
“It’s time for the Republicans to stop wasting time and embrace
compromise.”  He said there is no time left to vote on another bill to be
considered by the Senate. “The last train is leaving the
station,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
