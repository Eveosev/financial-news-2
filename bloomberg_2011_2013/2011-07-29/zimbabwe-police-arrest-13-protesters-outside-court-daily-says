Zimbabwe police arrested 13
protesters outside the Harare High Court, the  Daily News 
reported, citing Stendrick Zvorwadza, a spokesman for the
Restoration of Human Rights organization.  The activists were protesting the 8-week detention of
Movement for Democratic Change party members, the Harare-based
Daily News said on its website. They accused the police of bias,
saying that no action was taken against supporters of President
 Robert Mugabe â€™s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
who stormed parliament, assaulting a lawmaker and journalists on
July 23, the newspaper said.  The eight MDC members were detained following the murder of
a policeman in a Harare township. They deny involvement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
