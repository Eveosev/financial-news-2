The discount to obtain coffee from
top producer  Brazil  narrowed this week after the price for the
commodity in  New York  fell, broker Flavour Coffee said.  Fine cup qualities from the South American country were
between 8 cents and 13 cents a pound below the price on the ICE
Futures U.S. exchange, Flavour Coffee said in a report
yesterday, compared with 9 cents to 14 cents recorded in a July
7 report. Good cup beans were at a discount of 13 cents to 18
cents a pound, compared with 16 cents to 21 cents a pound last
week, data from the the Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage showed.  “Producers remain disciplined sellers,” and are
succeeding in keeping prices steady even amid volatile
international markets, Flavour Coffee said in a weekly report.  Arabica coffee for September delivery fell as much as 2.6
percent on ICE on July 27. The contract rose 0.3 percent to
$2.3935 a pound by 10:35 a.m.  London  time today, still down 0.9
percent this week. Arabica beans from Brazil usually trade at a
discount to the price in New York.  Robusta coffee from the South American country is at a
premium of 10 cents a pound above the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London, the broker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
