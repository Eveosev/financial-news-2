Taiwan ’s government bonds declined
for a sixth week after insurers cut their purchases at an
auction yesterday, raising concern demand for the island’s debt
is waning.  The Ministry of Finance sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of
20-year notes at a yield of 1.975 percent, compared with the
1.945 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of six
finance companies. The  insurance industry  bought 27.7 percent of
the securities, compared with 42.3 percent in the previous sale
of bonds of the same maturity on May 23, according to the
central bank.  “Traders knew insurers might be less interested in this
auction,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Looking forward, the yield curve
will be lifted higher, driven by rising long-term rates.” A
yield curve plots rates on bonds of the same quality and
different maturities.  The yield on the 2 percent debt due July 2016, the most-
traded  government bonds , increased to 1.214 percent from 1.210
percent a week ago and 1.209 percent yesterday as of the 4 p.m.
close in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The
rate reached 1.22 percent on July 22, the highest level since
January 2009. It was up four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, for the month.  Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.2 percent today and this week to
NT$28.890 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It dropped 0.3 percent this month.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, gained two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.401 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center. The rate
was up three basis points for the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
