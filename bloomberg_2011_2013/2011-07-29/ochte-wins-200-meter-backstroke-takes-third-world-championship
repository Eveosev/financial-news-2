Ryan Lochte of the U.S. took his
third individual title at the world swimming championships in
Shanghai by winning the 200-meter backstroke.  The American finished in 1 minute, 52.96 seconds, shaving
one second off his best time over the distance.  Japan ’s Ryosuke
Irie was second and Tyler Clary of the U.S. took the bronze
medal.  Earlier today, Denmark’s Jeanette Ottesen and Aliaksandra
Herasimenia of Belarus tied for the 100-meter freestyle gold
medal with a time of 53.45 seconds. Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the
Netherlands took the bronze in a time of 53.66 seconds.  Rebecca Soni of the U.S. won the 200-meter breaststroke
final in a time of 2 minutes, 21.47 seconds. Yuliya Efimova of
Russia took the silver medal and Canada’s Martha McCabe won the
bronze.  Lochte yesterday broke his own world record in beating
teammate and 14-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps in the
200-meter individual medley final. He also beat Phelps in the
200-meter freestyle three days ago. Phelps has won one
individual gold medal in  Shanghai , in the 200-meter butterfly.  Also scheduled for today are men’s finals in the 200-meter
breaststroke and 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay, in which Phelps
and Lochte will swim for the U.S. team.  It’s the last major international swimming meet before the
