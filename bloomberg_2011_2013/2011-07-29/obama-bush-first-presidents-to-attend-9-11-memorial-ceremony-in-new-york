President Barack Obama and former
President  George W. Bush  will attend  New York  City’s ceremony
observing the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack
on the World Trade Center, Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said.  Obama’s and Bush’s presence marks the first time a U.S.
president has participated in the annual event, which this year
will coincide with the opening of a memorial plaza featuring
reflecting pools, meant to be symbolic voids, on the footprints
of the destroyed Twin Towers. The attack occurred eight months
after Bush took office.  Bush and Obama will join governors Andrew Cuomo of New York
and  Chris Christie  of New Jersey; George Pataki, who was New
York’s governor in 2001; former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; and
Bloomberg. The ceremony will include poetry and quotations, and
a reading of the names of all who died that day after al Qaeda
terrorists hijacked jets that also crashed into the Pentagon in
 Washington  and in Pennsylvania.  “Family members only will be allowed to walk onto the
plaza, look at their loved ones’ names, look down into the
voids,” Bloomberg said during his weekly appearance on WOR
radio. “The first day it’s reserved for those family members
who lost somebody on 9/11.”  Visitors must apply for reservations to see the site after
Sept. 11, to avoid crowding, Bloomberg said. Tickets may be
obtained through the city’s Website, www.nyc.gov.  The mayor is 9/11 National Memorial chairman, and founder
and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
