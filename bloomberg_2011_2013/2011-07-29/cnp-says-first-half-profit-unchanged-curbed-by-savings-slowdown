CNP Assurances (CNP)  SA, France’s largest
life insurer, said first-half profit was unchanged as a slowdown
in its savings business in France countered higher pension sales
in  Brazil .  Net income totaled 543 million euros ($776 million),
compared to 542 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. The insurer didn’t
provide year-earlier profit figures and didn’t break down
second-quarter earnings.  Revenue from the company’s savings business fell 23 percent
to 10.4 billion euros, while sales at its Caixa Seguros unit in
Brazil climbed 16 percent to 1.4 billion euros, CNP said. Total
revenue in the period dropped 14 percent to 15.3 billion euros.  The insurer said it has “absorbed” a 353 million-euro
charge on its sovereign debt in  Greece  through a surplus reserve
linked to policyholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
