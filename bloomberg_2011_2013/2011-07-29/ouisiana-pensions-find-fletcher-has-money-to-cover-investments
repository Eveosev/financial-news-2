Fletcher Asset Management Inc. has
sufficient funds to cover withdrawal requests of three Louisiana
pensions, the  retirement plans  said after a review of the New
York-based hedge fund’s financial statements.  The Firefighters’ Retirement System, the New Orleans
Firefighters’ Retirement System and the Municipal Employees’
Retirement System sent a team to review the firm’s records and
holdings after redemption requests were met with a promissory
note that gave the hedge fund as much as two years to return the
money.  “FAM has presented documentation and financial statements
indicating that the fund has assets exceeding the value of the
systems’ investments and earnings showing more than $40 million
in profit on the systems’ original investment,” the three funds
said in the statement.  The firm, founded in 1991 by Alphonse Fletcher, received
investments of $100 million from the pension funds in 2008,
according to the Wall Street Journal. The investment was
designed to return at least 12 percent annually, with other
investors absorbing losses when fund returns were below that
mark, the pension funds have said.  A spokesman for Fletcher didn’t immediately return phone
call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
