Ryan Lochte won his fourth gold
medal at the world swimming championships in  Shanghai  as the
U.S. successfully defended its 800-meter freestyle relay title.  The U.S. finished in a time of 7 minutes, 2.67 seconds,
2.14 seconds ahead of France and 3 seconds before  China . It
trailed France after 600 meters when Lochte, swimming the final
leg, fought back to clinch the title. Michael Phelps, Peter
Vanderkaay and Richard Berens were also part of the winning team.  “It’s not a bad day at the office,” Lochte told
broadcaster Eurosport.  Earlier on the sixth day of the championships, Lochte won
the 200-meter backstroke for his third individual title. He
finished in 1 minute, 52.96 seconds, shaving one second off his
best time over the distance.  Japan ’s Ryosuke Irie was second and
Tyler Clary of the U.S. took the bronze medal.  “It wasn’t perfect, I know I can go a lot faster,” Lochte
said. “I know that there is a lot I can still work on.”  Lochte yesterday broke his own world record in winning the
200-meter individual medley final and he also took the 200-meter
freestyle three days ago.  Denmark’s Jeanette Ottesen and Aliaksandra Herasimenia of
Belarus tied for the 100-meter freestyle gold medal with a time
of 53.45 seconds. Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands took
the bronze in of 53.66 seconds.  Rebecca Soni of the U.S. won the women’s 200-meter
breaststroke final in a time of 2 minutes, 21.47 seconds, while
 Hungary ’s Daniel Gyurta won the men’s event in 2 minutes, 8.41
seconds.  It’s the last major international swimming meet before the
 2012 Olympics  in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
