Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the world’s largest
biotechnology company, reported second-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates on higher drug sales and said 2011
earnings would reach the upper end of its forecast.  Net income fell to $1.17 billion, or $1.25 a share, from
$1.2 billion, or $1.25, a year earlier, the  Thousand Oaks ,
California-based company said today in a statement. Adjusted for
acquisitions and restructuring costs, profit of $1.37 beat the
average $1.28 estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Amgen has increased marketing spending to promote
denosumab, approved last year as Prolia, for women with
osteoporosis, and Xgeva, to reduce fractures in cancer patients.
The medicines helped boost revenue in the quarter by 4.1 percent
to $3.96 billion, joined by increased sales of Neulasta,
Neupogen and Enbrel, Amgen said. The company declared its first
quarterly dividend, of 28 cents per share.  “The business on the top line was very strong,”  Eric Schmidt , an analyst with Cowen & Co. in New York, said today in
a telephone interview. “They did spend more than expected, but
they were able to beat on the bottom line despite the increased
spend because the top line was so good.”  Amgen rose 35 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $53.78 at 10:04
a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.9 percent. Amgen shares
had lost 2.7 percent this year before today.  Dividend, Forecast  In April, Amgen said it would start paying its first
dividend, and reaffirmed its forecast for 2011 adjusted earnings
of $5 to $5.20 a share and revenue of $15.1 billion to $15.5
billion. The company has been buying back stock, helping boost
earnings per share,  said Gene Mack, an analyst with Mizuho
Securities in  New York , in a telephone interview yesterday.  Research costs rose 26 percent in the quarter, to $808
million. For the full year, Amgen forecast the expenses,
adjusted for some items, would reach the upper range of 18 to 20
percent of product sales. Selling, general and administrative
costs rose 15 percent to $1.11 billion.  Revenue from Neupogen and Neulasta, used to reduce the risk
of infection in patients on chemotherapy, rose 13 percent to
$1.33 billion in the second quarter, while sales of Enbrel, for
autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, increased 9
percent to $956 million.  Xgeva drew $73 million in sales, topping the average $68.5
million estimate of four analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Prolia
had revenue of $44 million, above the $38.5 million average
estimate of five analysts.  Medicare Reimbursement  Revenue from Epogen, used by patients with  kidney disease ,
has slipped this year after tighter rules were put in place for
reimbursement from Medicare, the U.S.-backed insurance plan for
the elderly and disabled. Epogen sales in the second quarter
dropped 17 percent to $543 million.  Further reimbursement and labeling changes proposed by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may lead to a decline
in Epogen dosing of 20 percent to 25 percent in 2011, if
implemented, Amgen said.  “Amgen means it to be a worst-case scenario,” Schmidt
said. “That’s mostly reflected in the stock. Putting that out
there should give some comfort and remove some fears that
Epogen’s in a freefall situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
