Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.,  Asia â€™s
biggest drugmaker, reported an 18 percent jump in first-quarter
profit, helped by the sale of new medicines for diabetes and
cancer in  Japan .  Net income was 75.6 billion yen ($975 million), or 96 yen a
share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with 64
billion yen, or 81 yen, a year earlier, the Osaka, Japan-based
drugmaker said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.
Sales increased 0.7 percent to 357.2 billion yen.  Takeda is selling new products such Nesina for diabetes and
Vectibix for cancer in Japan and turning to acquisitions
overseas to compensate for the anticipated sales decline when
its best-selling diabetes treatment Actos faces competition from
cheaper generic drugs in August 2012. It expects profit to fall
to a 13-year low by March 2014, the company said in May.  Earnings were announced after markets in  Tokyo  closed.
Takeda fell 0.5 percent to a one-month low of 3,675 yen today,
while the benchmark Topix index declined 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
