Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators declined for the first time in three
days as shipments to the Southeast fell.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments dropped 5.4 percent to 20.6
million dekatherms (20 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in the
Southeast fell 15 percent to 5.23 million dekatherms.  Schedules for 705 of 743 pipelines had been reported as of
9:31 a.m.  Wholesale gas at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is delivered
from Texas and Louisiana to the Southeast, fell 5.92 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $4.3886 per million British thermal units
yesterday on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
slid 4.74 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $4.4121 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
