Nigeria â€™s two main labor federations
said talks with the government over the implementation of a new
minimum wage had collapsed,  Punch  reported, citing the deputy
presidents of the Nigerian Labour Congress and the Trade Union
Congress.  The agreement was reached on July 19, averting a three-day
strike planned to start the next day, the Lagos-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
