Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , the world’s
largest oilfield-services provider,  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  and  Repsol
YPF SA (REP)  are among the final bidders in an auction offered by
 Petroleos Mexicanos  to develop onshore mature fields.  Pemex authorized 17 oil firms to bid for three mature
fields in the southeastern state of Tabasco, the state-owned
producer, based in  Mexico  City,  said  today on its website.   The
company is scheduled to announce the winners on Aug. 18.  The company in November approved the first round of
performance-based contracts that open projects to private crude
producers for the first time since Mexico nationalized its oil
industry in 1938.  Latin America ’s largest oil producer plans to
hire companies to maximize reserves in older fields and explore
in deep waters in the  Gulf of Mexico , where it estimates it may
have 30 billion barrels of oil.  Bridas Corp., Petrofac Ltd., Maersk Oil, Pacific Rubiales
Energy Corp. were also pre-qualified to bid in the fields by
Pemex.  The field of Santuario is expected to get 16 bids, while
Magallanes obtained 11 requests for pre-qualification, and
Carrizo field three, according to Pemex.  The company has been preparing the performance-based
accords since Mexico revised its oil laws in 2008 to allow the
hiring of foreign and private companies to manage and operate
production projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
