Serbia’s economic growth slowed in
the second quarter of the year.  Gross domestic product rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier
after 3.4 percent expansion in the previous three months, the
Belgrade-based Statistics Office said today in a flash estimate.
Preliminary figures will be published in late September. The
central bank estimated 3.3 percent growth for the April-June
period.  Serbia is emerging from its first recession since 1999,
when a NATO bombing aimed at forcing the country’s troops out of
 Kosovo  destroyed most of its infrastructure. The nation relied
on a 3 billion-euro ($4.3 billion) bailout loan from the IMF
since mid-2009, when the global financial crisis triggered a
flight of capital.  The government and the International Monetary Fund estimate
this year’s growth at 3 percent, driven by private investments.
The economy expanded by 1 percent in real terms in 2010, led by
exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
