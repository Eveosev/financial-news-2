Old Republic International Corp. (ORI)  had
a unit suspended by  Fannie Mae  as an approved mortgage insurer
after it failed to meet capital standards.  Fannie Mae will phase out the purchase or securitization of
loans backed by Republic Mortgage Insurance Co. after the
carrierâ€™s regulator in North Carolina banned it from writing new
policies in the state, starting September of this year, the
government-run firm said in a  statement  today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
