Japan ’s government will outline
plans today to reduce the country’s reliance on nuclear power by
2050, the Asahi newspaper  reported  without saying where it got
the information.  The plan will also call for reviewing the regional monopoly
status of Japan’s power utilities and consider separating their
electricity distribution and generation operations, the
newspaper said.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  pledged on July 13 to reduce
Japan’s dependence on nuclear energy and said the government
will draw up a blueprint for the country’s future energy policy.
Opposition to atomic power is rising in Japan after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami crippled Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, triggering the worst atomic
disaster since Chernobyl 25 years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
