Oman crude’s official selling price
rose in September for the first time in two months as the high
price of oil from West Africa and  Russia  forced refiners to
purchase more Middle Eastern grades.  Oman exports will cost $110.78 a barrel, based on the
average of daily futures settlement prices on the Dubai
Mercantile Exchange, calculated by Bloomberg News. That’s 2.7
percent above August’s level of $107.84. Today’s settlement at
12:30 p.m. Dubai time was $111.75.  Demand for Middle Eastern crude was supported by refiners’
inability to afford grades from West Africa and Russia such as
Agbami from Nigeria and Urals. The September Brent-Dubai
exchange for swaps, which measures the difference between the
two benchmarks, was at $5.58 a barrel today, up from $4.44 a
month ago, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based broker. The exchange for swaps for October narrowed
14 cents to $5.22.  Open interest in the August Oman futures was 14,989
contracts as of 4:29 p.m. Singapore time, the equivalent of
about 14.9 million barrels of crude, or about 30 cargoes of
500,000 barrels each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the most since February when it reached a record 15,557
contracts, and compares with open interest of 8,460 a month
earlier for the first month future.  Oman futures for October delivery rose 4 cents to $111.94 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 3:44 p.m. Singapore
time, with 8 contracts traded.  Oman crude for immediate loading declined 75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $111.56 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September fell 0.7 percent to $111.10. Abu
Dhabi’s Murban decreased 0.7 percent to $115.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
