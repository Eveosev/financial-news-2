Turkey ’s trade deficit widened to
the biggest on record in June, signalling that central bank
efforts to rein in a surge in imports aren’t working.  The deficit was $10.2 billion in the month, up from $5.6
billion a year earlier, the statistics office in Ankara said on
its website today. The figure exceeded last month’s then-record
deficit of $10.1 billion and the median estimate of $9.5 billion
from eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci said yesterday that the
limits on bank lending he has imposed this year will help narrow
the imbalance between imports and exports that’s threatening
Turkey’s financial stability. The current-account balance, the
widest measure of trade in goods and services, will improve in
the last quarter of the year, he said.  “A new record trade deficit is not what we wanted at
all,” Levent Durusoy, chief economist at Yatirim Finansman
Securities in Istanbul, said in a telephone interview. “The
measures taken so far will take some more time to work and for
the impact of the shift in the  exchange rate  to be seen.”  Basci has held the benchmark one-week repo lending rate
unchanged at a historic low of 6.25 percent since January,
helping to weaken the lira about 8 percent against the dollar
this year, the most of 25 emerging market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The currency is no longer overvalued, Basci said
yesterday.  Lira, Bonds Drop  The lira and bonds declined after today’s trade figures.
The lira dropped 0.3 percent to 1.6813 per dollar at 10:15 a.m.
in Istanbul and yields on two-year bonds rose 4 basis points to
8.85 percent.  Imports surged 42 percent to $21.6 billion in June, more
than double the pace of growth in exports, which increased 19
percent to $11.4 billion, the statistics agency said today.  The 12-month current-account gap more than doubled from a
year earlier to $68.2 billion in May, the most since records
began in 1984 and equivalent to about 9 percent of gross
domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
