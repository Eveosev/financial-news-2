OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel
dropped the most in more than a month after saying production of
crude steel in the second quarter fell 10 percent from the
previous three months to 2.79 million metric tons.  The stock of Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikovâ€™s
steelmaker retreated 2.1 percent to 23.96 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest fall since June 23.  Production of finished steel products decreased 7 percent
in the period to 2.5 million tons, Magnitogorsk said in a
statement today. Domestic prices increased 10 percent and export
prices rose 2 percent on average in the period, the company
said. Magnitogorsk still expects full-year output of finished
products to increase 10 percent to 15 percent, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
