Electricite de  France  SA,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, reported a 6 percent increase in first-
half profit and said annual spending on French nuclear reactor
maintenance and upgrades could more than double.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose to 8.62 billion euros ($12.4 billion) from
8.14 billion euros a year earlier, EDF said today in a
statement. That was in line with the 8.58 billion-euro median
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  EDF has been struggling to raise atomic output in France,
where the former monopoly operates 58 reactors and is building
an EPR model at Flamanville in Normandy. After the meltdown at
the Fukushima reactor in  Japan , the utility faces increased
spending on safety in addition to technical upgrades needed to
prolong the lives of aging plants.  EDF fell as much as 2.6 percent and traded at 26.465 euros
as of 3 p.m. in Paris. The shares have dropped about 14 percent
since the start of the year.  “There are worries that EDF will raise investment by a lot
with little return,” Per Lekander, an analyst at UBS AG in
Paris, said by telephone. “It was known that EDF would have to
spend a lot but the outlook given today is much higher.”  Decade Low  The French government ordered Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  to make higher nuclear production a priority after
output sank to a decade-low in 2009. EDF said today that
spending on nuclear plants in France will rise to 3.4 billion to
3.6 billion euros in 2015, compared with 1.7 billion euros last
year.  “Our cost estimates are for extending the lives of our
reactors and their maintenance, we won’t break out how much will
be linked to post-Fukushima safety,” Proglio said at a results
presentation.  The Paris-basis utility reiterated 2011 financial targets
and raised its outlook for domestic nuclear output. In new goals
through 2015, it sees annual average ebitda growth of 4 percent
to 6 percent, a 5 percent to 10 percent increase in recurring
net income and cost savings of 2.5 billion euros. Total
investment could rise to 15 billion euros that year.  “The further we go in the future, the more replacement
parts will be needed,” Chief Financial Officer Thomas Piquemal
said. Investment will be 11 billion euros this year.  Stress Tests  Fatal accidents and post-Fukushima stress tests have raised
the cost of EDF’s new reactor in Normandy to around 6 billion
euros and delayed the start of commercial operations to 2016,
the company said last week.  EDF raised its target for 2011 nuclear output to 411 to 418
terawatt-hours from a previous estimate of 408 to 415 terawatt-
hours. EDF kept its target for reactor availability of 78.5
percent this year, the same as in 2010 and higher than the 78
percent in 2008. “There is no reason” to change a longer-term
target of reaching 85 percent, Piquemal said.  EDF will have prolonged shutdowns of nine reactors this
year due to 10-year safety inspections compared with five last
year and six in 2012, he said. The higher number in 2011 means
EDF will remain “prudent” about full-year French output.  First-half output reached a record, Proglio said earlier
this week after wholly owned grid operator RTE reported a 7.7
percent rise over the first six months of the year against a 30
percent drop in hydroelectric production amid dry weather.  Lower Debt  The utility isn’t optimistic about a rise in hydroelectric
output in the second half despite rainy weather in France in
July, according to Piquemal. “The threat of drought has
diminished, but what counts is the filling of reservoirs in the
winter months.”  EDF’s debt fell to 29.2 billion euros at the end of June
from 34.4 billion euros at the end of December, according to
today’s statement.  Net income climbed to 2.55 billion euros from a restated
1.66 billion euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
