Temasek Formation Sdn. offered to
buy out AIC Corp. and  Jotech Holdings Bhd. (JTEC) , two Malaysian
semiconductor companies, and auto-parts supplier AutoV Corp. for
about 696 million ringgit ($235 million) as it seeks to merge
their businesses to boost earnings.  Temasek Formation has been set up by Goh Tian Chuan, the
chairman of AIC and Jotech, for the deal, it said in a statement
today. AIC shareholders have been offered 1.80 ringgit a share,
or 21 percent more than the closing price on July 26, before
trading was suspended. Jotech shareholders will get 18 sen each,
or 16 percent more than the July 26 closing price. AutoV
stockholders will get 2.38 ringgit, or 19 percent more, it said.  The deal would give Temasek Formation control over
manufacturing operations for auto parts and electrical and
electronics products, as well as medical and life-science
businesses, in  Malaysia ,  China ,  Indonesia  and Taiwan. Goh said
the combined company will be better able to compete, raise funds
and attract investors.  “The merger will create a larger and integrated
manufacturing group,” Goh told reporters in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  Temasek Formation will issue new shares to finance the
acquisition, the company said. It will assume the listing status
of one of the three companies after the buyouts, it said,
without providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
