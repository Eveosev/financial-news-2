Metro AG (MEO) , the operator of Media
Markt stores, said it expects 2011 sales to increase less than
previously forecast because of slowing economic growth in
southern  Europe .  Revenue won’t rise more than 4 percent, a spokesman said,
confirming the Dusseldorf, Germany-based company had given the
guidance to analysts earlier this week. Metro had said in May
that it anticipated underlying sales growth to exceed that rate
this year. The spokesman spoke on condition of not being cited,
citing company policy.  The cut is “nothing new,” said Justin Scarborough, an
analyst at RBS, in an e-mailed note. Investors never expected
Metro would reach its original 2011 sales targets, he said.  Metro shares fell as much as 3.6 percent before paring the
loss. They were down 35 cents, or 0.9 percent, at 38.30 euros at
12:13 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The company has lost almost 30 percent
of its value this year.  Earlier this week, the company repeated its forecast for
2011 operating profit growth, after saying its Media-Saturn unit
had a loss in the second quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
