The euro weakened against the Swiss
franc after Moody’s Investors Service put  Spain ’s credit ranking
on review for a possible downgrade.  The euro depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.14490 as of 6:25 a.m.
in  London .  The review stems from “the continued funding pressures
facing the Spanish government, which the precedent set for
future euro-area support arrangements by the official package
for Greece is likely to exacerbate, and the resulting increase
in risks to bondholders,” Moody’s said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
