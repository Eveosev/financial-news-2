Ireland’s central bank cut its
economic growth forecast for this year and next as falling
 consumer spending  outweighs increases in exports.  Gross domestic product will rise 0.8 percent this year and
2.1 percent next year, the Dublin-based central bank said in its
quarterly bulletin on its website today. The bank forecast in
April the economy would increase by 0.9 percent this year and
2.2 percent next year.  “The broad narrative behind these figures remains
unchanged,” the central bank said. “Exports continue to grow
while domestic demand remains weak, although the contraction in
the latter is gradually easing.”  Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said this week the
government will need to make at least 3.6 billion euros ($5.1
billion) in savings next year as it seeks to cut its deficit.
The central bank forecast consumer spending will drop by 2.4
percent this year, compared with its earlier forecast of 2.2
percent.  Exports will rise 6.4 percent, the central bank said,
raising its earlier forecast of 6.1 percent.  “The prospect for a broad-based recovery continues to
depend significantly on external conditions,” the central bank
said. “The recovery in global economic activity is continuing
at a reasonably strong, if somewhat uneven, pace.”  The economy contracted 1 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
