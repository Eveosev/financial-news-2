Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , the world’s best-
performing major auto stock this year, posted a 67 percent
increase in second-quarter profit as it sold more sedans and
sports utility vehicles in the U.S.  Net income was 1.13 trillion won ($1.07 billion) in the
three months ended June 30, up from a revised 676.1 billion won
a year earlier, the Seoul-based company said in a regulatory
filing today. This compares with the 913 billion won average of
six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Kia sold 21 percent more cars than a year earlier, boosted
by a 36 percent surge in exports to the U.S., where the company
sold more K-5 sedans and Sorento SUVs. Deliveries in the U.S.
will keep rising this quarter while Kia’s market share may slip
as Japanese automakers return production to normal levels after
the March earthquake, said Yim Eun Young, an analyst at Dongbu
Securities Co.  “As long as the company retains the current sales volume,
the impact on profits will not be that big,” Yim, who is based
in  Seoul , said before the announcement. “What Kia has to look
out for in the second half is the impact of the strong Korean
currency.”  Kia’s shares rose 0.8 percent to 78,100 won at 10:51 a.m.
in Seoul. The stock has surged 54 percent this year, the most of
26 major automakers tracked by the Bloomberg World Auto
Manufacturers Index.  The won has advanced 6.4 percent this year, making it
 Asia ’s second-best-performing currency in 2011. It is forecast
to strengthen to 1,050 won per dollar this quarter, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A stronger won hurts  South
Korea ’s exporters because it cuts the value of repatriated
earnings.  Operating Profit  “The strong won will make it difficult, but we are
confident that we will be able to continue profitable
performance,” Lee Jae Rok, Kia’s chief financial officer, said
in a briefing in Seoul. “Profits will continue to increase with
new model releases in the second half.”  The automaker will introduce a large luxury sedan in early
2012, Lee said. Overseas demand for its Forte and Pride models
continues to rise, he said.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods and
administrative expenses, rose 56 percent to 1.03 trillion won
from 662.2 billion won, the carmaker said. Sales by value rose
25 percent to 11.58 trillion won.  Market Share  The sales of vehicles produced in the U.S. almost doubled
in the second quarter from year earlier, according to data on
Kia’s website. The carmaker’s U.S. market share rose to 3.9
percent in the first half from 3 percent a year earlier, the
company said today.  In  China , Kia sold 190,000 vehicles in the first six months,
an increase of 18 percent from a year earlier, the company said.  Kia, South Korea’s second-largest automaker, sold 621,000
units in the April to June period, 21 percent more than the
previous year, according to a regulatory filing.
      Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , which owns 34 percent of Kia, yesterday
reported that second-quarter profit rose to 2.3 trillion won
from 1.68 trillion a year earlier, as the company increased
production to fill the void left by disruptions at Japanese
rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
