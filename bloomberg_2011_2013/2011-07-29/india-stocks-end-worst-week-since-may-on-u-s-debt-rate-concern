Indian stocks had their biggest
weekly decline since May amid concern the U.S. won’t reach an
agreement on raising its federal debt limit in time to avoid a
default, and on speculation domestic interest rises will hurt
corporate earnings and slow growth.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, lost 3.1 percent after it posted first-quarter
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Jaiprakash Associates
Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of dams, roads and bridges sank 3.9 percent.
 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker, surged 1.8
percent after its Manesar factory resumed production.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
less than 0.1 percent to 18,197.20, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge retreated 2.8
percent this week, its steepest slide since the five days ended
May 6. The S&P CNX Nifty Index declined 0.1 percent to 5,482 and
its July futures settled at 5,490.55. The BSE 200 Index
decreased 0.5 percent to 2,256.48.  To contact the reporters on this story:
