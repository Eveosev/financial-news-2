Germany ’s government is weighing
legal questions about lifting its freeze on Libyan assets and is
discussing the issue with other nations, the Foreign Ministry
said.  Germany’s decision to lend 100 million euros ($144 million)
to Libya’s National Transitional Council for civilian purposes
is an effort to help while the assets remain frozen, a Foreign
Ministry official in Berlin said by phone today, speaking on
condition of anonymity.  The decision means Germany isn’t following the U.K. for now
in giving the rebels fighting to overthrow Muammar Qaddafi
access to any blocked funds such as oil revenue. The U.K. will
recognize the transitional council as Libya’s sole legitimate
government, Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said July 27.  Germany, which views the rebel council as the “legitimate
representative of the Libyan people,” is waiting for the  United
Nations Security Council  to lift its asset freeze, Foreign
Minister Guido Westerwelle said as he announced the aid on July
24. The loan to the rebels will be repaid from Libyan assets
frozen in Germany, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
