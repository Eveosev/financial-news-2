Russian airlines with regular
passenger flights on the country’s main routes should have at
least 20 planes of the same model in their fleet, RIA Novosti
reported, citing the Federal Air Transport Agency.  The agency is seeking changes to certification rules as
soon as possible, spokesman Sergei Izvolsky was cited as saying.
The country’s 15 largest carriers generally meet that
requirement and account for about 90 percent of passenger
flights, the state-run  news agency  reported.  Other airlines should either be reclassified as charter
carriers or stop operating regular flights on main routes,
Izvolsky was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
