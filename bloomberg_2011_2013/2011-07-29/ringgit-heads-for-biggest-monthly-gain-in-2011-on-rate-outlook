Malaysia’s ringgit headed for its
second biggest monthly gain this year on speculation policy
makers will tolerate a stronger currency to damp inflation.  The ringgit traded near its strongest level in almost 14
years after  Bank Negara Malaysia  Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said
this week that addressing inflation is “critical” as rising
prices would undermine economic growth prospects. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional shares dropped for a third day as
lawmakers in the U.S. struggled to find a solution to raise the
nation’s debt ceiling.  “The ringgit is expected to stay firm as the central bank
appears to put more emphasis on inflation, suggesting that a
rate hike may be on the cards,” said Calbert Loh, head of
treasury at Bangkok Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The situation
in the U.S. doesn’t seem to have much impact on the local
currency.”  The ringgit strengthened 1.7 percent this month to 2.9660
per dollar as of 4:48 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 0.2 percent this week. The
currency touched 2.9335 on July 27, the strongest level since
September 1997.  Malaysia’s consumer prices rose 3.5 percent in June from a
year earlier, the most since March 2009, the government said on
July 20.  Bank Negara Malaysia kept its overnight policy rate at 3
percent on July 7. The nation will raise borrowing costs by 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 3.25 percent this
quarter, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
central bank meets next on Sept. 8.  Government bonds  gained. The yield on the 4.16 percent
notes due July 2021 fell 19 basis points this month to 3.87
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia Bhd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
