Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, reported second-quarter profit that trailed
analystsâ€™ estimates as mining costs increased.  Net income rose 1.3 percent to $387 million from $382
million a year earlier,  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based
Newmont said today in a statement. Per-share profit was
unchanged at 77 cents. Earnings adjusted for asset-sale
impairments and a tax benefit from restructuring were 90 cents,
less than the $1.01 per-share average estimate from 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 11 percent to $2.4 billion.  Newmont fell $2.12, or 3.7 percent, to $55.61 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have fallen 9.5 percent this year.  Mining companies around the world are paying more for
labor, fuel and the raw materials used to construct their
operations even as commodity prices advance. The average cost of
producing an ounce of gold rose to $588 an ounce from $507 a
year earlier, Newmont said.  Gold for immediate delivery rose to a record $1,628.05 an
ounce in London trading on July 27 as investors bought the metal
as a hedge against a potential default on  U.S. government debt .
Gold climbed to a record during the second quarter too and
averaged $1,509, up 26 percent from the same period a year
earlier.  Newmont reiterated its 2011 gold production forecast of 5.1
Million to 5.3 million ounces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
