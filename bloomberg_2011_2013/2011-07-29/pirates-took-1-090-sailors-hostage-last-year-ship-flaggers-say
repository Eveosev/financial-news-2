Pirates took 1,090 sailors hostage
last year, the world’s three biggest flag states that register
vessel ownership said.  Panama, Liberia and the  Marshall Islands  said in a
statement today that 4,185 seafarers were attacked with firearms
and rocket propelled grenades, 342 survived attacks in vessels’
security rooms, and 516 were used as human shields.  The three countries, used by owners from  Greece , China and
elsewhere to register vessel ownership, said they will sign a
joint declaration next week committing to provide data on
attacks for the  International Maritime Bureau  to collate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
