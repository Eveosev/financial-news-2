Merck & Co., the second-largest U.S.
drugmaker, plans to eliminate an additional 12,000 to 13,000
jobs by 2015, expanding a restructuring program to save as much
as $4.6 billion a year.  As much as 14 percent of the company’s 91,000 employees
will lose their jobs, based on the size of the workforce at the
end of last month. The  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based
drugmaker also reported today that second-quarter earnings
excluding one-time items were 95 cents a share, matching the
average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Merck is cutting costs, expanding in emerging markets and
spending on research and development as the company tries to
gain momentum before it loses patent exclusivity next year on
its Singulair medicine for asthma. The company just introduced a
new hepatitis C drug,  Victrelis , and is testing an experimental
treatment to raise good cholesterol in a 30,000-patient trial.  “They are focusing on costs,” said  David Maris , an
analyst at CLSA in New York, in a telephone interview. “That is
exactly what they need to do under the new environment we
operate under.”  Merck fell 80 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $34.13 at 4 p.m. in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
declined 5.3 percent this year.  The drugmaker will continue to hire in growth areas such as
emerging markets, said David Caouette, a Merck spokesman, in a
telephone interview.  Non-Revenue Positions  The job cuts will come “disproportionately from the
elimination of non-revenue generating positions,” Caouette
said. These include administrative and headquarters positions,
as well as the consolidation of offices and the closing of
animal health manufacturing plants.  Net income almost tripled to $2.02 billion from $752
million the previous year, when earnings were held down by
acquisition-related costs, the company said in a statement
today. Sales climbed to $12.2 billion, more than the analysts’
estimate of $11.8 billion.  Second-quarter sales of diabetes drug Januvia increased 30
percent to $779 million, while sales of Remicade for arthritis
and inflammatory diseases jumped 26 percent to $842 million.  The slide in the dollar’s value against other currencies
boosted global sales 4 percent, the company said in the
statement.  Raised Forecast  Merck raised the lower end of its full-year forecast,
saying earnings excluding certain items will be to $3.68 to
$3.76 a share. The company previously said annual profit would
be $3.66 to $3.76 a share.  Since Kenneth Frazier started as chief executive on Jan. 1
Merck has had testing setbacks that included a trial of an
experimental blood thinner that was halted in January. The
drugmaker said today that it plans to spend as much as $8.3
billion on research and development this year, less than its
April outlook that it would spend as much as $8.4 billion.  Frazier told investors on a conference call today that he
doesn’t intend to reinstate a long-term profit outlook. In
February, Merck withdrew its forecast for profit through 2013.  “I intend to make smart investments that will drive our
long-term profitability and growth and that continues to be my
view of how I should look at this company,” he said on the
call.  Merck eliminated about 11,500 jobs last year in a plan to
reduce its workforce by 17 percent by 2012. The company had
94,000 employees at the beginning of this year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
