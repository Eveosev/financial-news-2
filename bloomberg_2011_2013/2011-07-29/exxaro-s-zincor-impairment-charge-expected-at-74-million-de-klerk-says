Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , the second-
biggest South African coal producer, will take an impairment
charge of about 500 million rand ($74.5 million) on the closure
of its unprofitable Zincor plant after failing to find a buyer.  The charge will be booked in Exxaro’s interim results,
Finance Director Wim de Klerk said today on a conference call.
The company plans to shut the zinc refinery in Springs,  South
Africa , by Dec. 31 and may fire as many as 800 workers.  Exxaro, based in  Pretoria , unveiled plans to restructure
and sell zinc assets in 2009 because they had lower profit
margins than other units and cyclical operations that were
susceptible to rising energy costs and currency fluctuations.
The company is scheduled to report interim results on Aug. 18.  Exxaro traded little changed at 180 rand in Johannesburg at
the 5 p.m. close.  The company is in the second phase of due diligence to sell
its Rosh Pinah zinc mine in Namibia, De Klerk said. It’s also
selling a 22 percent stake in the Chifeng zinc smelter in  China ,
and is at a “very advanced stage” of that process, he said.  Other holdings include a 26 percent stake in Black Mountain
(Pty) Ltd., a zinc and lead miner that’s majority-owned by
 Vedanta Resources Plc. (VED)  Any sale of that holding would be subject
to South Africa’s black economic empowerment regulations, which
“complicates” a potential transaction, De Klerk said.  South African legislation requires 26 percent non-white
ownership of mining assets by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
