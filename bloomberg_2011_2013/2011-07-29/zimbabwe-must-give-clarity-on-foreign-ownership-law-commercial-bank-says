Zimbabwe ’s government must give more
clarity on how its indigenization law will be implemented, said
John Mangudya, managing director of Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe
Ltd.  “The law has caused uncertainty and to some extent de-
industrialization in the country,” Mangudya said in a speech at
a conference in Victoria Falls, northwestern Zimbabwe.
“Businesses are not certain about the future.”  Banks will be the next priority, after mining, for the
government’s drive to transfer majority ownership of foreign
companies to Zimbabweans,  Saviour Kasukuwere , the minister for
indigenization, said yesterday. The government wants foreign
companies to sell a majority stake in their assets in the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
