Kenya ’s shilling headed for the
longest streak of declines in more than four months against the
dollar as oil importers sought to buy the U.S. currency to pay
for the commodity.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened for
a sixth day, losing 0.1 percent to 91.20 per dollar by 11:31
a.m. in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. A close at this level will be
the longest losing streak since March 14, when it weakened for
eight days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency is headed for a third month of declines, sliding 1.6
percent so far in July.  “The shilling is under pressure from oil importers who are
seeking dollars to enable them meet businesses demand for diesel
as they shift to thermal power following the start of power
cuts,” Jeremiah Kendagor, acting head of treasury at Nairobi-
based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
