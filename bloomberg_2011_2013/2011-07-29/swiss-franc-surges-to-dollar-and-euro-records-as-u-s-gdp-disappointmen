The Swiss franc surged to records
against the euro and dollar after U.S. data showed the world’s
biggest economy grew less than forecast in the second quarter.  The franc appreciated versus all of its 16 major peers
tracked by Bloomberg. It climbed earlier as Moody’s Investors
Service said it may downgrade  Spain , spurring demand for the
safest assets. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 1.3 percent
annual rate following a 0.4 percent gain in the prior quarter,
less than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 1.8 percent increase.  “The data from the U.S. is a reminder that the outlook for
global growth is actually weak,” said  Derek Halpenny , European
head of currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
in London. “The Swiss franc continues to be a favorite against
other currencies, with strong liquidity and low government
debt.”  The Swiss currency advanced 1.3 percent to 1.13394 per euro
as of 5 p.m. in  London , surpassing the 1.13737 record set on
July 18. It reached a record 1.12982 earlier in the day. The
franc strengthened 1.6 percent against the dollar to 78.74
centimes after appreciating to 78.54.  Switzerland ’s currency has surged 3.6 percent against the
euro this week as economic indicators in  Europe ’s most indebted
nations worsened and optimism faded that last week’s European
rescue package would stem the sovereign-debt crisis.  The Swiss central bank said today that it posted a first-
half loss of 10.8 billion Swiss francs ($13.5 billion) as the
decline of the euro eroded the value of the bank’s reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
