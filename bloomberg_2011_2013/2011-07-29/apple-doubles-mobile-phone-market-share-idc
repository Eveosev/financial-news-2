Apple Inc. (AAPL)  more than doubled its
share of the global handset market last quarter as the iPhone
maker posted record shipments, while  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s lead in the
industry shrank amid a sales slump, research company IDC said.  Apple increased its market share to 5.6 percent in the
second quarter, from 2.6 percent a year earlier, IDC said in an
e-mailed statement today. Nokia, Samsung Electronics Co. and  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570) , the three biggest vendors, all lost market
share, making Apple the only one of the top-four to post a gain,
according to the Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher.  Nokia this month posted its first quarterly loss since 2009
as the Espoo, Finland-based company reported weaker-than-
expected revenue. Apple, the world’s biggest technology company
by market value, had record sales and profit last quarter helped
by demand for the iPhone, its biggest revenue contributor.  Nokia’s market share shrank to 24.2 percent from 33.8
percent a year earlier, after shipments plunged 20 percent,
according to IDC. The Finnish company is losing out to low-cost
vendors including China’s  TCL Corp. (000100)  and Huawei Technologies Co.,
according to IDC.  Samsung, maker of the Galaxy smartphone, accounted for 19.2
percent of the global mobile-phone market last quarter,
declining from 19.4 percent a year earlier, IDC said. LG’s
market share fell to 6.8 percent from 9.3 percent, IDC said.  Global handset shipments rose 11.3 percent to 365.4 million
in the quarter, according to IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
