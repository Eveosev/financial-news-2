Robert Kendrick, an American tennis
player ranked 105th on the ATP World Tour, has been suspended by
the  International Tennis Federation  for a year for taking a
banned stimulant.  The 31-year-old Kendrick was found to have taken
methylhexaneamine during the French Open in Paris on May 22, the
ITF said in a statement. He lost in the first round of the Grand
Slam tournament at  Roland Garros .  Kendrick also loses 10 ranking points and 15,000 euros
($21,564) in prize money from his first-round loss at the
tournament.  Kendrick told the antidoping authorities that the stimulant
got into his system “through ingestion of a capsule of Zija
XM3, which he took to combat jetlag,” the ITF said. “He denied
any intent to enhance his performance as a result of taking this
substance.”  Even though the London-based ITF said it accepted the
American’s account, he was still suspended for 12 months ending
at midnight on May 21, 2012. It said he lacked a valid
therapeutic-use exemption for the substance and stressed that
each player is responsible for whatever he or she ingests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
