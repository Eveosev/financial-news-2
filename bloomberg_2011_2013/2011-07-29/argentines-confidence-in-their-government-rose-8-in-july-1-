The confidence of Argentines in
their  government  rose 8 percent in July from the previous month,
the biggest increase since March, according to a survey released
by Torcuato Di Tella University in  Buenos Aires .  Confidence in the government of President Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner rose 47 percent from a year earlier to
2.48 from 1.69 on a scale of zero to five, according to the
poll.  About 59 percent of those surveyed said Fernandez’s
administration is facing up to the country’s problems or knows
how to resolve them, the survey of 1,200 people from July 7-15
said. The poll, undertaken by Poliarquia Consultores on behalf
of the university, had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage
points.  A total of 50 percent of respondents said they had a good
opinion of the government, compared with 46 percent in last
month’s poll.  Fernandez is leading in polls ahead of the Oct. 23
presidential elections, where she will seek re-election for
another four-year term. Under Fernandez, who succeeded her
husband  Nestor Kirchner  in Dec. 2007, the economy has expanded
an average 5.6 percent per year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
