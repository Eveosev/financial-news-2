Derivatives traders increased
bullish bets on  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  after first-quarter profit at
 India ’s biggest non-state lender rose 30 percent on a decline in
bad loans and expanding credit.  Combined open interest, or the number of futures contracts
held by traders, was 41,603, about 6 percent more than the
previous day’s average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Open
interest in put options rose to 3,289, 8 percent more than the
20-day average.  ICICI’s net income increased to 13.3 billion rupees ($301.2
million), or 11.51 rupees a share, in the three months ended
June 30, from 10.3 billion rupees, or 9.16 rupees, a year
earlier, the Mumbai-based bank said today in a statement. That
compares with the 13.7 billion-rupee median of 28 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors are bullish on ICICI Bank as a decline in bad
loans and provisioning boosted profits,” Savio Shetty,
derivatives analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt., said in a phone
interview today. “Traders are writing put options at 1,000
rupees strike as the stock is likely to find strong support
there.”  Shares rose 2.6 percent to 1,043.7 rupees as of 2:39 p.m.,
paring this year’s loss to 8.9 percent. That compares with the 7
percent drop in 2011 in the Bankex index, which tracks 14
banking stocks in Mumbai.  Traders are unwinding  call options  at a strike of 1,050
rupees, suggesting shares may rise further, Shetty said.  Provisions at the bank fell 43 percent to 4.5 billion
rupees from 7.9 billion rupees a year earlier, ICICI said. Non-
performing loans dropped to 0.9 percent of total loans, from 1.6
percent in the June quarter the previous year, the bank said.  A call option gives investors the right to buy a security
at a set price by a specific date. A put option gives the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the prices of securities they own, speculate on share-price
moves or bet that volatility will rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
