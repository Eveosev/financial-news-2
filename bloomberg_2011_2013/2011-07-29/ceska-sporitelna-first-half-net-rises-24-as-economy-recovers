Ceska Sporitelna AS, the Czech unit
of Erste Bank AG, said first-half profit rose 23.7 percent as
the local economy revived following an economic crisis.  Net income for six months ended June 30 was 7.21 billion
koruna ($426.5 million), compared with 5.83 billion koruna a
year earlier, the Prague-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement. Net interest income rose 3.1 percent to 15.4 billion
koruna.  The results show the “gradual recovery of the Czech
economy from the crisis,” Chief Executive Officer Pavel Kysilka
said in the statement. Some parts of corporate business are
“rapidly” growing because of foreign demand, while retail
finance remains subdued, he said.  International banks including  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and
Unicredit SpA are betting that lending in the former communist-
bloc countries will return to growth and drive profits again.  The  Czech Republic  didn’t have to bail out any banks during
the global financial crisis as their exposure to toxic assets
accounted for less than 1 percent of all assets, banks had a
liquidity surplus and deposits exceeded loans, Czech central
bank said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
