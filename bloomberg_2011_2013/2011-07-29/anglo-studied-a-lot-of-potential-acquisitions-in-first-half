Anglo American Plc (AAL) , part-owner of
the world’s biggest platinum and diamond producers, studied
several potential acquisitions in the first half, said Chief
Executive Officer  Cynthia Carroll .  “We conducted a lot of due diligences on potential
acquisitions already this year,” Carroll told reporters on a
conference call today.  Mining companies are recovering from a 2008 metal-price
slump that reduced their ability to purchase assets. Mergers and
acquisitions in the industry doubled in value to $96.3 billion
in the first half, Ernst & Young LLP said July 25, forecasting
an extension of the trend through the year.  Anglo will weigh up acquisitions against expanding existing
assets, Carroll said, adding that “we’re the only ones in this
industry bringing on new production as we speak.” The London-
based company has said it may spend $85 billion over 10 years
digging iron-ore mines in  South America  and coal mines in
Australia. It started the Barro Alto nickel project in Brazil
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
