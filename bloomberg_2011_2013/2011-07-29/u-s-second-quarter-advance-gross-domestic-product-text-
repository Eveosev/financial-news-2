Following is the text of the Gross Domestic
Product from the Commerce Department.  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by
labor and property located in the  United States  -- increased at an annual
rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter of 2011, (that is, from the first
quarter to the second quarter), according to the "advance" estimate released
by the  Bureau of Economic Analysis .  In the first quarter, real GDP increased
0.4 percent.  The Bureau emphasized that the second-quarter advance estimate released
today is based on source data that are incomplete or subject to further
revision by the source agency (see the box on page 3).  The "second" estimate
for the second quarter, based on more complete data, will be released on
August 26, 2011.  The estimates released today reflect the annual revision of the
national income and product accounts (NIPAs).  In addition to the regular
revision of estimates for the most recent 3 years and the first quarter of
2011, current-dollar GDP and some components are revised back to the first
quarter of 2003.  In cases for which the estimates for the reference year
(2005) are revised, this results in revisions to the levels of the related
index numbers and chained-dollar estimates for the entire historical period;
revisions to percent changes before the first quarter of 2003 are small.
Annual revisions, which are usually released in July, incorporate source data
that are more complete, more detailed, and otherwise more reliable than those
previously available.  This release includes the revised quarterly estimates
of GDP, corporate profits, and personal income and provides an overview of
the results of the revision.  The August 2011 Survey of Current Business will contain NIPA tables and
an article describing the revisions.  The complete set of revised estimates
will be available on BEAÆs Web site at www.bea.gov.  The increase in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected
positive contributions from exports, nonresidential fixed investment, private
inventory investment, and federal  government spending  that were partly offset
by a negative contribution from state and local government spending.
Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.  The acceleration in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected
a deceleration in imports, an upturn in federal government spending, and an
acceleration in nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by a
sharp deceleration in personal consumption expenditures.  Final sales of computers added 0.15 percentage point to the second-
quarter change in real GDP after adding 0.08 percentage point to the first-
quarter change.  Motor vehicle output subtracted 0.12 percentage point from
the second-quarter change in real GDP after adding 1.08 percentage points to
the first-quarter change.  The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices
paid by U.S. residents, increased 3.2 percent in the second quarter, compared
with an increase of 4.0 percent in the first. Excluding food and energy
prices, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.6 percent in
the second quarter, compared with an increase of 2.4 percent in the first.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased 0.1 percent in the
second quarter, compared with an increase of 2.1 percent in the first.
Durable goods decreased 4.4 percent, in contrast to an increase of 11.7
percent.  Nondurable goods increased 0.1 percent, compared with an increase
of 1.6 percent.  Services increased 0.8 percent, the same increase as in the
first.  Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 6.3 percent in the
second quarter, compared with an increase of 2.1 percent in the first.
Nonresidential structures increased 8.1 percent, in contrast to a decrease of
14.3 percent.  Equipment and software increased 5.7 percent, compared with an
increase of 8.7 percent.  Real residential fixed investment increased 3.8
percent, in contrast to a decrease of 2.4 percent.  Real exports of goods and services increased 6.0 percent in the second
quarter, compared with an increase of 7.9 percent in the first.  Real imports
of goods and services increased 1.3 percent, compared with an increase of 8.3
percent.  Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment
increased 2.2 percent in the second quarter, in contrast to a decrease of 9.4
percent in the first.  National defense increased 7.3 percent, in contrast to
a decrease of 12.6 percent.  Nondefense decreased 7.3 percent, compared with
a decrease of 2.7 percent.  Real state and local government consumption
expenditures and gross investment decreased 3.4 percent, the same decrease as
in the first.  The change in real private inventories added 0.18 percentage point to
the second-quarter change in real GDP after adding 0.32 percentage point to
the first-quarter change.  Private businesses increased inventories $49.6
billion in the second quarter, following increases of $49.1 billion in the
first quarter and $38.3 billion in the fourth.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in private
inventories -- increased 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after increasing
less than 0.1 percent.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of goods
and services wherever produced -- increased 0.7 percent in the second
quarter, the same increase as in the first.  Disposition of personal income  Current-dollar personal income increased $132.5 billion (4.2 percent)
in the second quarter, compared with an increase of $251.9 billion (8.3
percent) in the first.  Personal current taxes increased $22.6 billion in the second quarter,
compared with an increase of $122.3 billion in the first.  Disposable personal income increased $109.9 billion (3.9 percent) in
the second quarter, compared with an increase of $129.6 billion (4.7 percent)
in the first.  Real disposable personal income increased 0.7 percent, the
same increase as in the first quarter.  Personal outlays increased $83.5 billion (3.1 percent) in the second
quarter, compared with an increase of $153.5 billion (5.8 percent) in the
first.  Personal saving -- disposable personal income less personal outlays -
- was $590.6 billion in the second quarter, compared with $564.3 billion in
the first. The personal saving rate -- saving as a percentage of disposable
personal income -- was 5.1 percent in the second quarter, compared with 4.9
percent in the first.  For a comparison of personal saving in BEAÆs national
income and product accounts with personal saving in the  Federal Reserve 
BoardÆs flow of funds accounts and data on changes in net worth, go to
www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Nipa-Frb.asp.  Current-dollar GDP  Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation's output of goods
and services -- increased 3.7 percent, or $136.0 billion, in the second
quarter to a level of $15,003.8 billion.  In the first quarter, current-
dollar GDP increased 3.1 percent, or $112.8 billion.  ___________________ BOX.  Information on the assumptions used for unavailable source data is
provided in a technical note that is posted with the news release on BEA's
Web site.  Within a few days after the release, a detailed "Key Source Data
and Assumptions" file is posted on the Web site.  In the middle of each
month, an analysis of the current quarterly estimate of GDP and related
series is made available on the Web site; click on Survey of Current
Business, "GDP and the Economy." ___________________  Revision of the National Income and Product
Accounts  The revised estimates reflect the results of the annual revision of the
national income and product accounts (NIPAs).  In addition to the regular
revision of estimates for the most recent 3 years and the first quarter of
2011, this ôflexibleüEannual revision results in revisions to current-dollar
GDP and some components back to the first quarter of 2003.   The reference
year remains 2005.  In cases for which the estimates for the reference year
(2005) are revised, this results in revisions to the levels of the related
index numbers and chained-dollar estimates for the entire historical period;
revisions to percent changes before the first quarter of 2003 are small.  Annual revisions, usually made each July, incorporate newly available
and more comprehensive source data, as well as improved estimating
methodologies.  In this annual revision, the notable revisions primarily
reflect the incorporation of newly available and revised source data.  For
example, the revised estimates of profits reflect newly available Internal
Revenue Service tabulations of tax returns for corporations for 2009 and
revised tabulations for 2008.  With the release of the annual revision, statistics for selected NIPA
tables will be available on BEAÆs Web site (www.bea.gov).  Shortly after the
GDP release, BEA will post a table on its Web site showing the major current-
dollar revisions and their sources for each component of GDP, national
income, and personal income.  The August 2011 Survey of Current Business will
contain NIPA tables and an article describing the revisions.  That issue will
also contain an analysis of the current quarterly estimate of GDP and related
series (ôGDP and the EconomyüE.  Because of the additional data shown, tables 3, 11, and 12 of this
release are each divided into two separate tables -- 3A and 3B, 11A and 11B,
and 12A and 12B.  There are also a number of special tables that compare the
revised and previously published estimates for selected periods:  *    Table 1A shows the percent change in real GDP and related measures;
table 1B shows revisions  to current-dollar GDP, to national income, and to disposition of
personal income; table 2A shows  contributions to the percent change in real GDP; and table 4A shows
the percent change in the  chain-type price indexes for GDP and related measures.  *    Tables 7A, 7B, and 7C show annual levels, percent changes, and
revisions to percent changes for  current-dollar GDP, for real (chained-dollar) GDP, and for chain-type
price indexes for GDP,  respectively.  *    Table 12C shows revisions to corporate profits by industry.  This section of the release discusses the highlights of the revisions
and describes their sources.  Summary of revisions  For this annual revision, the most notable revisions are generally
limited to the period from 2008 to the first quarter of 2011.  The revisions
for earlier periods tend to be small.  *    For 2007-2010, real GDP decreased at an average annual rate of 0.3
percent; in the previously  published estimates, real GDP had increased at an average annual rate
of less than 0.1 percent.  From the fourth quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2011, real
GDP decreased at an average  annual rate of 0.2 percent; in the previously published estimates,
real GDP had increased at an  average annual rate of 0.2 percent.  *    The percent change in real GDP was revised down 0.3 percentage point
for 2008, was revised  down 0.9 percentage point for 2009, and was revised up 0.1 percentage
point for 2010.  *    The revisions to the annual estimates for 2008 and 2010 reflect partly
offsetting revisions to the  quarters within the year.  For example, for 2010, the annual rate of
change in GDP was revised  up 0.2 percentage point for the first quarter and was revised up 2.1
percentage points for the  second quarter, while the growth rates for the third and fourth
quarters were revised down 0.1  and 0.8 percentage point, respectively.  The downward revision to the
change in real GDP for  2009 reflects downward revisions to the first and fourth quarters.  *    For the 13 quarters from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the first
quarter of 2011, the average  revision (without regard to sign) was 0.9 percentage point.  The
revisions did not change the  direction of the change in real GDP (increase or decrease) for any of
the quarters.  *    For 2007-2010, the average annual rate of growth of real disposable
personal income was revised  down 0.6 percentage point from 1.2 percent to 0.6 percent.  *    From the fourth quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2011, the
average annual rate of increase in  the price index for gross domestic purchases was revised up from 1.4
percent to 1.6 percent.  The  average annual rate of increase in the price index for personal
consumption expenditures (PCE)  was revised up from 1.6 percent to 1.7 percent, and the increase in
the ôcoreüEPCE price index  (which excludes food and energy) was revised up from 1.5 percent to
1.6 percent.  *    National income was revised up 0.4 percent for 2008, was revised down
0.6 percent for 2009,  and was revised up 0.1 percent for 2010.  *    Corporate profits was revised down 1.1 percent for 2008, was revised up
8.3 percent for 2009,  and was revised up 10.8 percent for 2010.  Revisions to the 2008-2010 estimates  The percent change from the preceding year in real GDP was revised down
from a decrease of less than 0.1 percent to a decrease of 0.3 percent for
2008, was revised down from a decrease of 2.6 percent to a decrease of 3.5
percent for 2009, and was revised up from an increase of 2.9 to an increase
of 3.0 percent for 2010.  For 2008, the largest contributors to the downward revision to the
change in real GDP were downward revisions to PCE, to nonresidential fixed
investment, and to state and local government spending.  For 2009, the
largest contributors to the downward revision were downward revisions to PCE,
to inventory investment, and to nonresidential fixed investment, and an
upward revision to imports.  For 2010, the largest contributors to the upward
revision were upward revisions to inventory investment and to PCE; these
revisions were partly offset by downward revisions to nonresidential fixed
investment, to state and local government spending, to residential fixed
investment, and to exports.  The percent change from fourth quarter to fourth quarter in real GDP
was revised down from a decrease of 2.8 percent to a decrease of 3.3 percent
for 2008, was revised down from an increase of 0.2 percent to a decrease of
0.5 percent for 2009, and was revised up from an increase of 2.8 percent to
an increase of 3.1 percent for 2010.  For the period of contraction from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the
second quarter of 2009, real GDP decreased at an average annual rate of 3.5
percent; in the previously published estimates, it had decreased 2.8 percent.  For the period of expansion from the second quarter of 2009 to the
first quarter of 2011, real GDP increased at an average annual rate of 2.6
percent; in the previously published estimates, it had increased 2.8 percent.  The percent change from the preceding year in real gross domestic
income (GDI) was revised up from a decrease of 0.8 percent to a decrease of
0.4 percent for 2008, was revised down from a decrease of 2.9 percent to a
decrease of 4.0 percent for 2009, and was revised up from an increase of 3.1
percent to an increase of 3.6 percent for 2010.  The percent change from the preceding year in the price index for gross
domestic purchases was unrevised at 3.2 percent for 2008, was revised up from
a decrease of 0.2 percent to a decrease of 0.1 percent for 2009, and was
revised up from an increase of 1.3 percent to an increase of 1.5 percent for
2010.  For the quarters of 2008 to 2010, the percent change in the price
index was revised down for one quarter, was revised up for seven quarters,
and was unrevised for four quarters; the largest upward revision was 0.4
percentage point (for both the fourth quarter of 2008 and the second quarter
of 2010).  Current-dollar GDP was revised down for all 3 years:  $77.6 billion, or
0.5 percent, for 2008; $180.0 billion, or 1.3 percent, for 2009; and $133.9
billion, or 0.9 percent, for 2010.  The percent change from the preceding
year was revised down from an increase of 2.2 percent to an increase of 1.9
percent for 2008; was revised down from a decrease of 1.7 percent to a
decrease of 2.5 percent for 2009; and was revised up from an increase of 3.8
percent to an increase of 4.2 percent for 2010.  Current-dollar gross
national product (GNP) (GDP plus net receipts of income from the rest of the
world) was revised down for all 3 years:  $82.9 billion, or 0.6 percent, for
2008; $174.1 billion, or 1.2 percent, for 2009; and $132.8 billion, or 0.9
percent, for 2010.  Net receipts of income was revised down $5.3 billion for
2008, was revised up $6.1 billion for 2009, and was revised up $1.1 billion
for 2010.  The revisions to net receipts of income -- which affect GNP,
national income, corporate profits, net interest and miscellaneous payments,
and personal income receipts on assets -- resulted from the revisions to
BEA's international transactions accounts (ITAs) that were released in June.
Although the revisions to the ITAs extended back to 1999, the revisions prior
to 2008 were not incorporated into the NIPAs except for the estimates of
petroleum imports, which were revised back to 2007.  (An article describing
the revisions to the ITAs was published in the July 2011 issue of the Survey
of Current Business.)  Current-dollar GDP was also revised down for all 4 years from 2004-
2007:  $14.5 billion for 2004, $15.4 billion for 2005, $21.7 billion for
2006, and $33.1 billion for 2007.  For 2003, GDP was revised up by less than
$1 billion.  For 2003-2007, the revisions to current-dollar GDP were mainly
accounted for by revisions to PCE.  National income was revised up $51.3 billion, or 0.4 percent, for 2008;
was revised down $77.4 billion, or 0.6 percent, for 2009; and was revised up
$18.5 billion, or 0.1 percent, for 2010.  For 2008, upward revisions to net
interest, to supplements to wages and salaries, and to rental income of
persons were partly offset by downward revisions to corporate profits and to
wages and salaries.  For 2009, downward revisions to net interest and to
nonfarm proprietorsüEincome were partly offset by upward revisions to
corporate profits, to rental income of persons, and to farm
proprietorsüEincome.  For 2010, upward revisions to corporate profits, to
rental income of persons, and to wages and salaries were partly offset by
downward revisions to net interest, to nonfarm proprietorsüEincome, and to
supplements to wages and salaries.  Corporate profits from current production -- profits before tax with
inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments -- was revised down
$14.4 billion, or 1.1 percent, for 2008; was revised up $104.0 billion, or
8.3 percent, for 2009; and was revised up $175.3 billion, or 10.8 percent,
for 2010.  For 2008, downward revisions to profits of domestic financial
corporations and to profits from the rest of the world were partly offset by
an upward revision to profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations.  For
2009, upward revisions to profits of domestic financial corporations and to
profits from the rest of the world were partly offset by a downward revision
to profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations.  For 2010, upward revisions
to profits of domestic financial and to profits of nonfinancial corporations
were partly offset by a small downward revision to profits from the rest of
the world.  Profits before tax was revised up for all 3 years:  $26.7 billion for
2008, $139.0 billion for 2009, and $18.4 billion for 2010.  The before-tax
measure of profits does not reflect, as does profits from current production,
the capital consumption and inventory valuation adjustments.  These
adjustments convert depreciation of fixed assets and inventory withdrawals
reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost measures
used in the national income and product accounts.  The capital consumption
adjustment was revised down $40.8 billion for 2008, was revised down $23.7
billion for 2009, and was revised up $151.1 billion for 2010.  The inventory
valuation adjustment was revised down 0.4 billion for 2008, was revised down
$11.3 billion for 2009, and was revised up $5.8 billion for 2010.  Personal income was revised up $69.1 billion, or 0.6 percent, for 2008;
was revised down $244.7 billion, or 2.0 percent, for 2009; and was revised
down $167.5 billion, or 1.3 percent, for 2010.  For 2008, upward revisions to
personal interest income, to supplements to wages and salaries, and to rental
income of persons were partly offset by downward revisions to personal
dividend income, to wages and salaries, and to nonfarm proprietorsüEincome.
For 2009, downward revisions to personal interest income, to personal
dividend income, and to nonfarm proprietorsüEincome were partly offset by
upward revisions to rental income of persons and to farm proprietorsüEincome.
For 2010, downward revisions to personal interest income, to nonfarm
proprietorsüEincome, to supplements to wages and salaries, and to personal
current transfer receipts were partly offset by upward revisions to rental
income of persons, to wages and salaries, and to farm proprietorsüEincome.  Disposable personal income (DPI) (personal income less personal current
taxes) was revised up $71.6 billion, or 0.7 percent, for 2008; was revised
down $246.1 billion, or 2.2 percent, for 2009; and was revised down $195.0
billion, or 1.7 percent, for 2010.  Personal current taxes was revised down
$2.5 billion for 2008, was revised up $1.4 billion for 2009, and was revised
up $27.6 billion for 2010.  The percent change from the preceding year in
real DPI was revised up from 1.7 percent to 2.4 percent for 2008, was revised
down from an increase of 0.6 percent to a decrease of 2.3 percent for 2009,
and was revised up from an increase of 1.4 percent to an increase of 1.8
percent for 2010.  Personal outlays -- PCE, personal interest payments, and personal
current transfer payments --was revised down for all 3 years:  $72.8 billion
for 2008, $143.3 billion for 2009, and $133.8 billion for 2010.  For all 3
years, downward revisions to PCE accounted for most of the revisions to
personal outlays.  The personal saving rate (personal saving as a percentage
of DPI) was revised up from 4.1 percent to 5.4 percent for 2008, was revised
down from 5.9 percent to 5.1 percent for 2009, and was revised down from 5.7
percent to 5.3 percent for 2010.  PCE was revised down for all 4 years from 2004-2007:  $14.5 billion for
2004, $15.5 billion for 2005, $21.7 billion for 2006, and $34.0 billion for
2007.  The personal saving rate was revised up from 3.4 percent to 3.6
percent for 2004, was revised up from 1.4 percent to 1.5 percent for 2005,
was revised up from 2.4 percent to 2.6 percent for 2006, and was revised up
from 2.1 percent to 2.4 percent for 2007. (For 2003, PCE was revised up by
less than $1 billion, and the personal saving rate was unrevised.)  The statistical discrepancy is current-dollar GDP less current-dollar
gross domestic income (GDI).  It arises because most components of GDP and of
GDI are estimated independently.  GDP measures final expenditures -- the sum
of  consumer spending , private investment, net exports, and government
spending.  GDI measures the incomes earned in the production of GDP.  In
concept, GDP is equal to GDI.  In practice, they differ because they are
estimated using different source data and different methods.  As a result of the annual revision, the statistical discrepancy as a
percentage of GDP was revised down from 1.0 percent to less than 0.1 percent
for 2008, was revised down from 1.3 percent to 0.6 percent for 2009, and was
revised down from 1.1 percent to less than 0.1 percent for 2010.  For 2008
and 2010, the revisions to the discrepancy reflected downward revisions to
GDP and upward revisions to GDI.  For 2009, the revision to the discrepancy
reflected a downward revision to GDP that was larger than the downward
revision to GDI.  New source data  In this annual revision, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is
revised back to 2003 to incorporate source data from the 2007 Economic Census
(specifically, final data on merchandise lines) and data from the Census
annual and monthly retail trade and food services surveys and from the Census
service annual survey that have been benchmarked to the economic census.  In addition, the annual revision incorporated data from the following
major federal statistical sources:  Census Bureau annual survey of
manufactures for 2008 (revised) and 2009 (preliminary); Census Bureau annual
surveys of merchant wholesale trade and of retail trade for 2008 (revised)
and for 2009 (preliminary); Census Bureau revised monthly indicators of
manufactures, of merchant wholesale trade, and of retail trade for 2008-2010;
Census Bureau annual surveys of services for 2008 (revised), 2009 (revised),
and 2010 (preliminary), and of state and local government finances for fiscal
years 2007 (revised), 2008 (revised), and 2009 (preliminary); Census Bureau
monthly survey of construction spending (value put in place) for 2008-2010
(revised); Census Bureau quarterly services survey for 2008-2010 (revised);
Census Bureau current population survey/housing vacancy survey for 2010;
federal government budget data for fiscal years 2010 and 2011; Internal
Revenue Service tabulations of tax returns for corporations for 2008
(revised) and 2009 (preliminary) and for sole proprietorships and
partnerships for 2009; Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly census of
employment and wages for 2008-2010 (revised); Department of Agriculture farm
statistics for 2008-2010 (revised); and BEA's ITAs for 2008-2010 (revised).  Changes in methodology  The annual revision also incorporated improvements to estimating
methodologies, including the following:  *    Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) are revised back to 2003 to
incorporate source data  from the 2007 Economic Census (specifically, final data on
merchandise lines) and data from the  Census Bureau annual and monthly retail trade and food services
surveys and from the Census  Bureau service annual survey that have been benchmarked to the
economic census.  In addition,  for 2008 forward, improved price indexes are used for deflating PCE
for property and casualty  insurance.  *    Starting with the first quarter of 2011, the quarterly and monthly
estimates of PCE for portfolio  management and investment advice services reflect the incorporation
of newly available Census  Bureau quarterly services survey data on ôother financial investment
activities.üE  *    The estimates of petroleum imports are revised back to 2007 to
incorporate improvements in the  seasonal adjustment methodology for real petroleum imports, which are
now derived by directly  adjusting the petroleum imports quantity data; previously, BEA
seasonally adjusted the  petroleum price index and calculated seasonally adjusted real
petroleum imports by deflation.  *    The estimates of private fixed investment, exports, and imports of
communication equipment are  revised back to 2003 to incorporate quality-adjusted price indexes
from the Federal Reserve  Board (FRB).  (During the 2010 NIPA annual revision, the FRB price
indexes were incorporated  only back to 2007.)  *    The estimates of rental income of persons are revised back to 2008 to
reflect an improved  methodology for calculating the effective rate of interest on
mortgage debt outstanding, which is  used to derive the estimates of mortgage interest paid, the largest
expense deducted in the  calculation of rental income.  The new method is based on the
incorporation of up-to-date  monthly mortgage servicing data on actual loans and their
characteristics, and provides a more  accurate picture of loan performance in the mortgage market.  This
change in the methodology  for deriving mortgage interest paid is also reflected in the
estimates of net interest and personal  interest income.  *    In the personal income and outlays tables, the presentation of
government social benefits is  modified to focus on the largest and most significant programs.  *          *          *  BEA's national, international, regional, and industry estimates; the
Survey of Current Business; and BEA news releases are available without
charge on BEA's Web site at www.bea.gov. By visiting the site, you can also
subscribe to receive free e-mail summaries of BEA releases and announcements.  *          *          *  Next release -- August 26, 2011, at 8:30 A.M. EDT
