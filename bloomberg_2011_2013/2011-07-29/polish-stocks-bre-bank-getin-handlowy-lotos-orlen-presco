Poland ’s WIG20 Index fell 20.23, or
0.7 percent, to 2,700.5 at 1:39 p.m. in Warsaw, extending this
week’s decline to 1.6 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the financial-services group
controlled by Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, retreated for
a fifth day, sliding 0.23 zloty, or 2 percent, to 11.22 zloty.
Bank Handlowy SA (BHW PW), majority-owned by Citigroup Inc.,
declined 1.15 zloty, or 1.4 percent, to 81.35 zloty.  BRE Bank SA (BRE) 
, a unit of Commerzbank AG, fell 2.8 zloty, or 0.9
percent, to 315 zloty.  Banking shares slumped across  Europe  as U.S. lawmakers
called off a vote on a Republican plan for raising the nation’s
debt limit.  Presco Group SA (PREA PW) jumped 0.49 zloty, or 8.2
percent, to 6.49 zloty as shares of the debt-collecting company
started trading in Warsaw. The company sold 22.2 million zloty
($7.9 million) of shares at 6 zloty each in an initial public
offering this month.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, lost
1.02 zloty, or 2.2 percent, to 45.81 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, declined 0.85 zloty, or 2.2
percent, to 38.15 zloty. Oil fell on concern a failure to reach
a deal on raising the U.S. debt limit may cause the nation to
default, threatening the economy of the world’s biggest crude
consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
