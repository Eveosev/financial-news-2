Japan ’s ministers charged with
outlining a new energy policy have agreed on a plan that will
gradually reduce dependence on nuclear energy, Prime Minister
 Naoto Kan  said.  The new proposal will be split into three phases covering
the next three years, until 2020 and until 2050, Kan said at the
conclusion of the ministers’ meeting today. The plan will also
suggest separating the generation and distribution of
electricity, he said.  Japan will make the plans to reduce the country’s reliance
on nuclear power by 2050 public today, the Asahi newspaper
 reported  without saying where it got the information. Kan is
scheduled to address the nation at 8 p.m. Japan time, according
to his office.  “We will review the current thinking from scratch and
consider a scenario to reduce dependency on nuclear power,” Kan
said.  Kan pledged on July 13 to reduce Japan’s use of nuclear
power and said the government will draw up a blueprint for the
country’s future  energy policy . Opposition to atomic power is
rising in Japan after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami
crippled Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant and triggered the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl 25
years ago.  “We will encourage various operators to supply
electricity,” Kan said today. “We have also confirmed we will
seek rigorous safety measures for nuclear power plants.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
