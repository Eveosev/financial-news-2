New Jersey ’s pension system gained
about 18.5 percent in the fiscal year ended June 30, its best
performance in more than 12 years, said Robert E. Grady,
chairman of the state’s Investment Council.  The funds, with $74.7 billion in assets as of May 31,
underwent a “tactical shift” in their investing about nine
months ago that included reducing fixed-income holdings and
adding U.S. stocks,  Grady said in an interview today with
Bloomberg TV at the Rocky Mountain Economic Summit in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming.  New Jersey’s pension funds totaled about $67.6 billion as
of May 2010, state documents  show . At least $2 billion of the
fiscal year’s gain was because of the shift in investments,
Grady said.  “Specifically we radically lightened up on Treasuries,”
Grady said. “We overweighted U.S. equities, and that was a good
bet.”  Andy Pratt , a spokesman for the state Treasury Department,
said documents showing fiscal-year pension returns won’t be
available until September, after an audit.  The importance of the U.S. debt debate for investors is
“the prospect over the long term of higher  interest rates ,
potentially higher inflation, and of slower growth in the United
States,” said Grady, a partner and managing director of Denver-
based private equity firm Cheyenne Capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
