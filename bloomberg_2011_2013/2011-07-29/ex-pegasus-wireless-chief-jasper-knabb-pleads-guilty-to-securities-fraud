Ex-Pegasus Wireless Corp. Chief
Executive Officer Jasper Knabb pleaded guilty to  securities
fraud  and other charges in connection with a $25 million scheme
to sell shares for bogus debt and funnel the proceeds to
himself, family and friends.  Knabb, 44, created 31 fake promissory notes and other
documents representing that Pegasus had outstanding debt, U.S.
Attorney Melinda Haag in  San Francisco  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  From 2005 to 2008, Knabb caused 490 million shares to be
issued to satisfy the bogus debt, prosecutors said. By selling
some of the fraudulent shares, he netted $25 million for himself
and others, according to the statement.  Christopher Bruno, an attorney for Knabb, didnâ€™t
immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment about
the plea.  Knabb, a resident of Wenatchee,  Washington , pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud and
maintaining false books and records, according to the statement.
His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 3.  The maximum penalty for the conspiracy and securities fraud
charges is 25 years in prison and a fine of twice the loss or
gain plus restitution. The maximum penalty for the false books
charge is 20 years in prison and twice the loss or gain plus
restitution.  The case is U.S. v. Durland, 11-00009, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
