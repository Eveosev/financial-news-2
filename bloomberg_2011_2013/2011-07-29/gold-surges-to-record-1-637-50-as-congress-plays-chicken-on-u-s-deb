Gold futures rose to a record
$1,637.50 an ounce on demand for an investment haven amid
mounting concerns on the U.S. debt impasse and signs of a
faltering economy.  U.S. lawmakers are offering rival plans to avert a default
as the Aug. 2 deadline for raising the $14.3 trillion debt limit
nears. A government report today showed that gross domestic
product rose less than forecast in the second quarter, driving
the dollar lower. Gold had the biggest monthly gain since
November 2009.  “The economy is weak, and these guys in  Washington  are
playing chicken with the debt ceiling,” Matt Zeman, a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “It’s not a good mix, and gold may be one
of the safe harbors that people find.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $15, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,631.20 at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal, up 8.5 percent in July, had four straight
weekly advances.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index headed for its third
straight monthly loss, the longest slump since 2008. The dollar
was down for the third consecutive week against a basket of six
major currencies.  Gold has climbed 15 percent this year, heading for the 11th
straight annual gain. Yesterday, holdings in exchange-traded
products backed by the metal rose 0.9 percent to a record
2,150.5 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Ability to Govern’  “People want to own gold,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “Investors want something tangible to
diversify away from U.S. assets. Everyone is uncertain about
what’s going to become of the  U.S. economy  and our ability to
govern and control our debt.”  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark  interest rate  at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and bought back
Treasuries to help bolster the U.S. economy. Moody’s Investors
Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have said they will
cut the nation’s top-level credit rating should a failure to
raise the debt ceiling lead to a default.  Silver futures for September delivery climbed 31.2 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $40.106 an ounce on the Comex, little changed
for the week. The price gained 15 percent in July.  Platinum futures for October delivery declined $7.10, or
0.4 percent, to $1,785.30 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , down 0.7 percent this week. The price still climbed
3.4 percent in July.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell 40 cents to
$827.70 an ounce. The metal gained 2.6 percent this week and
climbed 8.8 percent in July, the most this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
