Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, reported second-quarter profit that trailed
analysts’ estimates as mining costs increased.  Adjusted net income climbed 18 percent to $445 million, or
90 cents a share, from $377 million, or 77 cents, a year
earlier,  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based Newmont said today in
a statement. That missed the $1.01 per-share average estimate
from 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 11 percent to
$2.4 billion.  Mining companies around the world are paying more for
labor, fuel and the raw materials used to construct their
operations even as commodity prices advance. The average cost of
producing an ounce of gold rose to $588 an ounce, from $507 a
year earlier, Newmont said.  Gold for immediate delivery rose to a record $1,628.05 an
ounce in London trading on July 27 as investors bought the metal
as a hedge against a potential default on  U.S. government debt .
Gold climbed to a record during the second quarter too and
averaged $1,509, up 26 percent from the same period a year
earlier.  Newmont advanced 41 cents to $57.73 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 6
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
