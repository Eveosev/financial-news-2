Slovakia’s banking industry posted a
79 percent increase in first-half profit as the eastern European
country’s recovering economy fuelled lending and cut the need
for loan-loss reserves.  The combined net income of the banks, most of which are
units of international lenders such as Vienna-based  Erste Group
Bank AG (EBS) , rose to 431.4 million euros ($621 million) from 240.4
million euros in the same period last year, according to
preliminary data from the central bank in Bratislava, the
capital. Assets grew 1.8 percent to 55.8 billion euros, Narodna
Banka Slovenska said today on its  website .  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is benefitting
from increasing demand for its exports, which fuels growth and
job creation. Gross domestic product expanded 3.5 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier.  Loans to companies and households amounted to 32.8 billion
euros as of June 30, up 9.3 percent from a year earlier. Net
loan-loss provisions dropped 67 percent to 62.9 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
