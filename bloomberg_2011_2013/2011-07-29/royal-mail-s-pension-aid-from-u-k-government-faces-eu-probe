Royal Mail  Group Ltd.’s pension aid
from the U.K. government is under investigation by European
Union regulators.  “We must ensure that the state measures do not provide
undue advantages to Royal Mail as this would distort the
conditions of competition among postal operators,” said EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  in a statement today.  The British government plans to take responsibility for
Royal Mail’s 8.4 billion-pound ($13.7 billion) pension liability
from March 2012 ahead of a sale of the state-owned postal
service. EU regulators can block payments that would give one
company an unfair advantage over rivals. The EU is also
investigating German subsidies for Deutsche Post AG and Belgian
aid to La Poste.  The Royal Mail may not be making a “sufficient own
contribution” to restructuring costs and may not be planning
“adequate measures” to compensate for the harm to competition
caused by the state subsidy, the Brussels-based European
Commission said today.  Royal Mail in  London  declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
