Derek Jeter and  Babe Ruth  are tied
as the greatest players in New York Yankees history, according
to a Quinnipiac University poll.  The survey of 1,528 New York City adults showed Jeter and
Ruth each with 23 percent of the votes.  Joe DiMaggio  was third
with 9 percent, followed by Lou Gehrig with 8 percent and Mickey Mantle with 6 percent.  Women picked Jeter, who became the first Yankee with 3,000
career hits on July 9, by a 30 percent to 16 percent margin,
while men favored Ruth 29 percent to 18 percent. Jeter was the
favorite of those age 18 to 34, while Ruth, who played from 1914
to 1935 and held the single-season home run record for 42 years,
was top for the 35-to-64-year-olds. DiMaggio was favored by
those over 65 with 24 percent, compared with 19 percent for
Jeter and Ruth.  Half of the people surveyed said they would have returned
the ball that Jeter hit for a home run to reach 3,000 hits,
while 42 percent would have kept it. Christian Lopez, a Yankees
fan, caught the ball in the left-field seats and returned it to
the shortstop rather than cashing in on the memorabilia,
estimated to bring as much as $250,000 by  Doug Allen , president
of Chicago-based Legendary Auctions.  The poll, conducted July 19-25 by the Hamden, Connecticut-
based school, had a margin of error of plus-minus 2.5 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
