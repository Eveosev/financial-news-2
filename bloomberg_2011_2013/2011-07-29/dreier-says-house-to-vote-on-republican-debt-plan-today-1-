The U.S. House plans to vote on
Republicans’ two-step debt-limit plan today, and lawmakers said
it will have enough votes to pass.  Speaker  John Boehner ’s plan is being revised to hinge the
second debt-limit increase on a balanced-budget constitutional
amendment being passed by Congress and sent to the states, said
House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, a California
Republican.  Representative Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, said he
now supports Boehner’s plan and that he “absolutely” believes it
has the votes to pass.  Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said he
decided to support Boehner’s plan after colleagues agreed to tie
it to the proposed balanced-budget amendment. He also said he
believes Boehner now has the votes to pass the bill.  “I think you’ll see quite a few get on board,” Flake, who
earlier said he leaned against the plan, told reporters.  Jeff Landry of  Louisiana  said he will vote for the bill
because of the balanced-budget amendment provision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
