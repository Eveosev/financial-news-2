Severe thunderstorms are expected
today across the U.S. Northeast, including  New York City , with
wind gusting as high as 70 miles per hour and hail almost as
large as golf balls, the National Weather Service said.  A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect from  New York  to
Philadelphia until 11 p.m., according to the  weather service .  “Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity this afternoon,” according to a weather service
bulletin. “Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather.”  There is a possibility a tornado may form in southeastern
New York or northeastern Pennsylvania, according to the U.S.
 Storm Prediction Center  in Norman,  Oklahoma .  The storms are being driven by high humidity, said Mike Pigott, a senior meteorologist at  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State
College , Pennsylvania.  “It is the urban flooding that concerns me more, because
there will be very heavy rain associated with these
thunderstorms,” Pigott said.  At any given moment, there are 1,800 thunderstorms in
progress somewhere in the world, and lightning has killed 13
people in the U.S. this year, the weather service said. An
average of 57 people a year have been killed by lightning in the
past six years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
