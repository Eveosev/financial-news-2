Capital One Financial Corp.
considered a takeover bid last year for E*Trade Financial Corp.,
though an offer was never made, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The failure of the negotiations helped prompt Citadel LLC,
 Ken Griffin ’s hedge fund, to request in a July 20 statement that
E*Trade arrange a meeting for shareholders to vote on hiring an
investment banker and removing two directors, the newspaper
reported, citing people it didn’t identify. E*Trade responded by
hiring  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to explore a sale.  Julie Rakes, a spokeswoman at McLean, Virginia-based
Capital One, didn’t immediately respond to a voice mail and e-
mail requesting a response to the Journal’s story. Nor did Susan Hickey of New York-based E*Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
