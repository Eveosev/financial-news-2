German government subsidies will
amount to 22.6 billion euros ($33 billion) in 2012, compared
with 28.5 billion euros in 2009,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing a
report set for adoption by  Chancellor Angela Merkel â€™s cabinet
next week.  Most of the reduction has been achieved through cuts in
financial aid of more than 4 billion euros, the newspaper said.
German industry remains the biggest beneficiary of state
subsidies, at 13.7 billion euros, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
