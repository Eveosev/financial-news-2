Westfield Group (WDC) , the world’s biggest
shopping-center operator, agreed to invest $612.5 million to
develop the retail part of  New York ’s World Trade Center.  The Sydney-based company has agreed in principle on a 50
percent share of a joint venture with the Port Authority of New
York and  New Jersey  to develop the stores on the lower Manhattan
site, Westfield said today in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange.  Westfield invested in the retail concourse at the original
trade center six weeks before it was destroyed in the Sept. 11,
2001, attacks, and sold its stake back to the Port Authority in
December 2003. The mall owner signed a letter of intent with the
bi-state agency in 2008 to jointly develop the new complex’s
shops. The current agreement will replace the original letter,
Westfield said in the statement.  The project will encompass about 365,000 square feet
(34,000 square meters) of rentable retail space, and Westfield
will be in charge of management and leasing, according to the
statement. Westfield expects another 90,000 square feet will be
added in the future.  Westfield shares fell 1.1 percent to A$7.96 at the 4:10
p.m. close of trade in Sydney, the lowest since May 25, 2009.  Trade Center ‘Turnaround’  “The agreement further validates the turnaround at the
 World Trade Center site ,” which includes the scheduled opening
of the 9/11 Memorial in September and the signing of Conde Nast
Publications Inc. as an anchor tenant of 1 World Trade Center,
the  Port Authority  said in an e-mailed statement.  Legal documents must be completed and the agreement
approved by the authority’s board of commissioners later in the
year, the agency said.  The Port Authority owns the 16-acre (6-hectare) site, which
also includes the 1,776-foot (541-meter) 1 World Trade Center,
the 9/11 memorial and a mass-transit hub designed by Spanish
architect  Santiago Calatrava . The memorial plaza is slated to
debut on the 10th anniversary of the attacks, and two
skyscrapers, 1 and 4 World Trade Center, are to open in 2013.  A store-lined underground corridor will run from a new
subway center at Fulton Street and Broadway, a block east of the
trade center, to the World Financial Center on the Hudson
riverfront, Chris Ward, executive director of the Port
Authority, said on July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
