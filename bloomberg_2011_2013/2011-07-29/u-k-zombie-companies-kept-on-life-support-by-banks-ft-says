Banks are keeping alive “zombie”
U.K. companies that are able to pay interest charges but not
loans themselves, the Financial Times reported, citing a survey
by consulting company  KPMG .  KPMG found that the average time taken to resolve the
affairs of such companies, typically small to medium-sized, is
12 to 18 months, up from six to 12 months two years ago, the
newspaper said.  Richard Fleming, who heads restructuring at KPMG, said
that, while zombie companies aren’t technically insolvent, in
another interest-rate environment they would be, and lenders are
hoping for “miracle cures,” the FT reported.  KPMG concludes from the survey that formal insolvencies
occur when relationships between companies’ managers and their
banks break down, and when lenders perceive that managements are
weak, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
