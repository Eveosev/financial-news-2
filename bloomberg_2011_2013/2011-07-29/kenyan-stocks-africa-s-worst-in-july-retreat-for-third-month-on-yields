Kenya ’s stock index headed for a
third month of declines and is  Africa ’s worst performer in July
as investors bought fixed-income assets with better returns,
with government yields at a nine-year high.  The 55-member Nairobi Stock Exchange’s All-Share Index
increased 0.6 percent to 66.24 by 12:13 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, paring its drop this month to 5.8 percent. The gauge
has fallen 15 percent this year.  Kenya’s three-month borrowing costs climbed to 9.01 percent
at yesterday’s sale of 91-day bills. The yield reached 9.016
percent on June 9, the highest since May 2002, as price growth
soared on rising food and fuel costs. Inflation accelerated to
almost triple the targeted pace of 5 percent in June, reaching
14.5 percent.  “With the higher  interest rates , investors are looking
more into debt and limiting their exposure on equities,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL) , a unit of  South
Africa ’s Sanlam Ltd., led declines in percentage terms this
month. The stock slipped 0.8 percent to 32 shillings today,
taking its drop in July to 23 percent. CFC Insurance Holdings
Ltd., a unit of CFC Stanbic Holding Ltd. fell 18 percent in the
month.  “With the stock exchange performing dismally, it is
generally expected that insurance companies are not going to do
well because they invest some of their premiums in equities,”
Musau said. “They are also making losses on their fixed income
holdings,” as yield lag inflation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
