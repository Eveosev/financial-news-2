Spanish 10-year bonds fell for a
third-straight day after the nation’s credit rating was put on
review for a possible one-step cut by Moody’s Investors Service.  The yield on the securities rose seven basis points to 6.10
percent as of 7:41 a.m. in  London , increasing the additional
yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
benchmark German bunds by 13 basis points to 353 basis points.  Italian 10-year bonds also fell, with the yield rising 13
basis points to 5.95 percent. The yield spread to bunds
increased 18 basis points to 337 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
