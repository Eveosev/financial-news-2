Pearson Plc (PSON) , the owner of the
Financial Times, reported first-half profit that beat analysts’
estimates and predicted earnings will rise this year on growth
in its digital and education business lines.  Earnings per share, excluding some items, rose to 16.8
pence from 16.6 pence a year earlier, the London-based company
said today in a statement. That beat analysts’ 13.2 pence
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The company forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share
of 80 pence, up from 77.5 pence in 2010. Pearson gets more than
half of its revenue from the business that sells textbooks and
provides testing and educational consulting services, helping it
make up for industry-wide declines elsewhere in print sales.  Sales rose 3.2 percent to 2.42 billion pounds ($3.85
billion), compared with the 2.39 billion-pound average estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Excluding currency swings,
particularly a weaker  U.S. dollar , sales grew 6 percent, the
company said. Pearson raised its interim dividend by 8 percent
to 14 pence.  Pearson rose 1.6 percent to 1,157 pence at 8:01 a.m. in
London trading. The shares have climbed 15 percent this year,
giving the company a market value to 9.4 billion pounds.  The year-earlier period included large textbook orders for
Texas and  Florida , which contributed to net income more than
tripling in the first half of 2010, the company has said.
Pearson also sold researcher IDC last year, the company’s
largest disposal in a decade, according to Chief Executive
Officer Marjorie Scardino.  Sales in the education business grew 9 percent at constant
exchange rates, while revenue at the Penguin publishing unit
dropped 4 percent.  (The company will hold a conference call for investors at
9 a.m. London time to discuss results. To access the call, go to
