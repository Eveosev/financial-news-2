Austria’s  Oesterreichische
Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  won’t sell its Romanian unit in the next three
years, after agreeing to sell its other east European business
to  Russia ’s OAO Sberbank,  Ziarul Financiar  reported today.  Volksbank plans to sell its Romanian business in three to
five years, after the unit, which had assets valued at 5 billion
euros ($7.1 billion) was excluded from Sberbank’s purchase
probably because it was too big for the deal, the Bucharest-
based newspaper said, citing Johann Lurf, the chief executive
officer of Volksbank Romania SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
