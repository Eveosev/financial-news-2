Mauritius’s rupee declined, paring
its first monthly increase in three, as concern that the U.S.
and  Europe  will struggle to contain their debt crises curbed
demand for riskier frontier-market assets.  The currency weakened for a second day, depreciating 0.4
percent to 28.00 per dollar at 12:11 p.m. in  Port Louis , the
capital. That pared its monthly gain to 2.8 percent. Versus the
euro, the rupee retreated 0.6 percent to 40.1723. The currency
closely tracks the euro’s movements against the dollar, with an
average correlation of 0.88 this month. A value of 1 would mean
they move in lock step.  U.S. lawmakers delayed a vote on a plan to raise the debt
limit to avert a default and Moody’s Investors Service said it
may cut  Spain ’s credit rating.  Today’s decline follows the trend of emerging-market
currencies suffering from “lower risk appetite throughout
markets,” analysts at  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the country’s
largest lender by market value, wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients today. “Markets remain worried about the situation in
the U.S.”  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.2043 rupees to
27.3733 rupees, with a selling price of 28.6709 rupees per
dollar, according to indicative rates on  Bank of Mauritius’s
website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
