Linde AG (LIN) , the world’s second-biggest
maker of industrial gases, said second-quarter profit rose more
than estimated on demand from Indonesia and  China .  Net income rose to 282 million euros ($403 million) from
247 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company said
today in a statement. Sales rose 7.4 percent to 3.45 billion
euros. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated profit of
273.4 million euros on sales of 3.43 billion euros.  Linde’s results mirror those of U.S. rival Air Products &
Chemicals, which last week beat analyst estimates on sales.
Linde’s main growth driver is Asia, with the company last month
winning an order to construct Indonesia’s largest air separation
plant.  “The highest growth rates were once again to be seen in
the emerging economies of Asia, especially China, and in  South
America ,” the company said in today’s statement.  Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Reitzle is sticking to the
company’s full-year targets of increased earnings and revenue on
demand from the electronics, steel and health-care industries.  Larger competitor  Air Liquide SA (AI)  reports results on Aug. 1.  Linde rose 3 percent to 124.65 euros in Frankfurt trading
as of 12:14 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
