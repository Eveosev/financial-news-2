On the evening of July 23, news broke on China’s microblogs that a  collision and derailment occurred  on high-speed rail tracks between the boomtowns of Taizhou and Wenzhou, killing at least 39 people. Less than 48 hours later, Chinese  internet users  were  horrified and infuriated  by images of the damaged train cars being chopped up and buried. For a Chinese public that had, even before the accident, become fed up with the corruption related to the country’s outrageously expensive high-speed rail lines, the burial suggested a cover-up of defects in the rail system’s infrastructure. In the days since, China's propaganda managers have been learning a lesson American politicians know well (but don't always heed): the cover-up is often worse than the crime. For six decades, the Central Propaganda Department had virtually complete control of the government's image and -- when deemed necessary -- covered up its mistakes with little public backlash. But that sense of immunity has eroded. Today, department officials find themselves competing with Chinese bloggers, microbloggers and increasingly independent -- and ascendant -- journalists who are enraged with the government's latest case of incompetence and efforts to control public criticism of it. On July 27, the nationalist newspaper Global Times  wrote : Since 2010, anger over the government's  ambitious plan to create the world's largest high-speed rail network  has slowly simmered on the internet.  Before the rail lines opened to the public, Chinese journalists, bloggers and microbloggers  raised questions  and complained about its safety and the corruption related to its construction. The 1380-kilometer, Beijing-Shanghai line experienced several major delays and  mishaps  within its first two weeks of operating, quickly provoking  ridicule online . But public frustration with the government over high-speed rail didn't reach a boiling point until now. When the accident happened outside of Wenzhou, the propaganda department responded with a predictable list of orders for all media outlets. The list, which was quickly leaked onto the internet,  read in part : Ordinarily, these government directives are observed, or journalists elect to stay silent on the relevant matter. In this case though, the majority of Chinese media,  including state-owned mouthpieces , bucked the official orders and directly challenged the government. The devastating event tapped into a reservoir of frustration with everything  China 's high-speed rail lines had come to symbolize: corruption, official arrogance and an overwhelming sense that China’s newfound wealth isn’t being spent in the interests of the masses. Liu Junning, a reformist political scientist who has run afoul of the authorities in the past,  tweeted  on the microblog Sina Weibo: The most remarkable criticism came from establishment voices, which ordinarily support government propaganda goals. One such outlet is the China Youth Daily, an official mouthpiece of the Communist Youth League and a key power base for Chinese President  Hu Jintao . Shortly after the accident, it  wrote : Cao Lin, a China Youth Daily news commentator -- known for his outspoken comments on his Sina Weibo account --  tweeted : Zhao Chu, the patriotic editor of Military World -- a publication obsessed with, among other issues, modernizing China’s military -- agreed. He took to his Sina Weibo account  to carp : Of course, progressive voices joined conservative ones to vent their anger. The Beijing News, an influential and liberal newspaper,  directly questioned  the government's credibility after the crash: In the southern city of Guangzhou, the notoriously independent Southern Metropolis Daily, a paper that has often clashed with local and national interests, offered a  brutal backhanded compliment  to the Railway Ministry: The Southern Metropolis Daily has a history of irritating the government. But prior to the accident, it’s hard to imagine it -- or any other Chinese news outlet -- so directly questioning the intelligence of the Central Propaganda Department. In this instance, at least, the government censors and propagandists have lost the public relations battle to the media and the people. Perhaps they are hoping, like a patient parent, that the crying will stop, the tantrum will exhaust and the lines of authority will be restored. After all, it’s an approach that’s worked well in the past.
