Zimbabwe  is losing millions of
dollars to unlicensed miners, smugglers and producers who under-
invoice the minerals they sell, the  Zimbabwe Independent 
reported, citing Mining Secretary Thankful Musukutwa.  Government records of mining operations are a “shambles”
and many small and medium-scale miners aren’t registered with
the state, allowing them to work outside the law, the Harare-
based newspaper cited Musukutwa as saying on its website. They
are able to sell or smuggle their minerals onto the black
market, it said.  The government earned $20.7 million between January and
Sept. 30 last year from taxes and royalties on minerals against
exports of $593.8 million, the newspaper said, citing Farai
Magawu, director of the Center for Research and Development,
which monitors mining operations in Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
