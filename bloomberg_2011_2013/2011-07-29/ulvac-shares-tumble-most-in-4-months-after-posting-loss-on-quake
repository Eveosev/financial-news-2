Ulvac Inc. (6728)  shares had the biggest
drop since its listing in 2004 after the maker of solar cells
and vacuum components said it probably posted its first loss in
two years because of earthquake damage.  The stock plunged 19 percent to 1,429 yen at the 3 p.m.
close on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, the steepest slide since its
listing in April 2004. The company declined the most on the
Topix index, which slid 0.8 percent.  The Kanagawa-based company may report a net loss of 8.7
billion yen ($112 million) for the year ended June 30, compared
with a profit of 2.1 billion yen a year earlier, according to a
preliminary earnings statement yesterday. Costs related to
damage from  Japan ’s March earthquake and depreciation charges
hurt results, according to the statement.  The company forecast a 400 million yen profit on Feb. 10
and withdrew the forecast after the quake. The company plans to
announce its earnings on Aug. 11.  Ulvac shares have lost 33 percent this year, compared with
the Topix index’s 6.4 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on the story:
