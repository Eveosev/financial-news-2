South Africa ’s ruling African
National Congress said it wants  Julius Malema , the leader of its
youth wing, to explain allegations made in a Johannesburg
newspaper that he was paid to help businesses win government
contracts.  Malema, who is pushing for the nationalization of mines and
banks, was the sole trustee of a fund named after his 5-year-old
son that received the payments and was used to finance his
living expenses,  City Press  reported on June 25. Malema, 30,
said yesterday that the trust was used to help “the poorest of
the poor.”  The ANC will give Malema “a chance to explain” the claims
that he used the fund to “pay for his lavish lifestyle,” the
Johannesburg-based party said in its ANC Today newsletter,
distributed by e-mail today.  Having grown up in a township outside the northern town of
Polokwane, Malema is now driven around in a white Range Rover
and sports a Breitling watch. He has refused to disclose details
of how his lifestyle is funded.  The ANC cited executives of its youth league as saying
Malema was a victim of a “conspiracy hatched by white
capitalists, imperialists sucking the blood out of  Africa  and
those opposed to his plans to nationalize mines.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
