Thailand  posted a current-account
surplus for the first time in three months in June as overseas
shipments increased after the impact from  Japan ’s earthquake
eased and demand for agricultural goods surged.  The surplus was $2.5 billion, compared with a previously
reported $511 million deficit in May, the Bank of Thailand said
in a statement today. The median estimate of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a $1.35 billion surplus.  The current account is the broadest measure of trade,
tracking goods, services and investment income. Trade makes up
about 70 percent of the current account, and tourism contributes
most of the service industry’s 30 percent component.  To contact the reporter on this story:
