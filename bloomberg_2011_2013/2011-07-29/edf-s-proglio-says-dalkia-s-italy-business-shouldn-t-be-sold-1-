Dalkia , an energy-services company
owned by Electricite de France SA and  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ,
needs to revamp rather than sell its struggling Italian unit,
said EDF Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio .  “What is important is to turn it around, not to sell,”
Proglio told reporters following a presentation of EDF’s first-
half results in Paris today. He declined to comment on whether
EDF and Veolia have considered selling the assets.  EDF,  Europe ’s biggest power generator, booked a 170
million-euro ($242 million) exceptional charge from its Dalkia
International holding in the first half. Veolia said today it
would write down 800 million euros and miss a 2011 profit target
in part because of operations in  Italy . The water utility, which
was headed by Proglio before his move to EDF, said in March it
would sell 4 billion euros of assets over three years.  Dalkia has contracts for heating, cooling, lighting and
cleaning offices, hospitals and factories across 42 countries,
according to its  website . Its Milan-based Italian business,
called  Siram SpA , had 1.07 billion euros in sales last year and
employs 4,318 people.  Difficulties at Siram stem in part from late payments from
local governments, Proglio said. “They are trying to put things
right, so they have changed management,” he said, without
elaborating.  Siram has worked on heating systems at public buildings in
Trieste, energy for a hospital in Florence and a power plant for
Peroni Group, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
