Standard Bank Group Ltd. and  MTN
Group Ltd. (MTN)  are scheduled to go to  South Africa ’s second-highest
court on Aug. 1 to defend themselves in a technology supplier’s
lawsuit over a credit-card security feature.  3MFuture Africa Ltd. , a Seychelles-based company with
offices in Cape Town, is seeking damages from the MTN Mobile
Money Ltd. remote-banking joint venture for violating a patent
on a system allowing consumers to switch credit cards on or off
via mobile phone to prevent illicit use, the software developer
said in an e-mailed statement.  Standard Bank, Africa’s largest lender, said in April 2010
that it had received a summons in the dispute. The Johannesburg-
based bank will defend itself in the case,  Erik Larsen , a
spokesman, said today in a phone interview, declining to comment
further. Bridget Bhengu, a spokeswoman at Johannesburg-based
phone company MTN, said she couldn’t immediately comment.  3MFuture Africa held more than 30 meetings about the system
with  Standard Bank  and MTN representatives, Wolfram Reiners, a
director at the technology company, said in a phone interview.
The meetings took place in 2001 and 2002, Willem Steenkamp, a
spokesman for 3MFuture, said by phone.  The case is scheduled to be heard over the course of two
weeks in the Patent Court of the South African High Court in
Pretoria, 3MFuture said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
