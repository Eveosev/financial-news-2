CEZ AS (CEZ)  rose the most in a week after
the largest Czech power utility agreed to buy Energotrans AS to
expand in the country’s electricity and heat distribution.  The stock jumped 1.7 percent to 870 koruna at the 4:24 p.m.
close in  Prague , its biggest advance since July 21. More than
908,000 shares changed hands, or 139 percent of the three-month
daily average. CEZ was the best performer in the country’s 14-
member PX equity gauge, which closed little changed.  The purchase of Energotrans, whose pipeline delivers heat
to Prague, will help CEZ focus more on power distribution and
heat production and “generate stable income” because prices
are regulated, CEZ said in a statement late yesterday. CEZ is
selling its 50 percent stake in Mibrag, a German coal and power
producer, after  Germany  decided to phase out nuclear power and
add renewable energy sources and gas-fired plants, it said.  “We do not expect too much valuation and forecast impact
as Mibrag’s contribution has been only comparatively small,”
Teresa Schinwald, a Raiffeisen Centrobank AG analyst, wrote in a
report today. “We like, however, that CEZ acts on its strategic
target of increasing the share of regulated activities.”  Vienna-based Schinwald has a “buy” recommendation and a
price estimate of 1,050 koruna on CEZ’s shares, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
