Mitsubishi Estate Co.,  Japan ’s
biggest developer by market value, said first-quarter profit
fell 34 percent because the company sold fewer apartments
following the country’s earthquake on March 11.  Net income fell to 4.5 billion yen ($57 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 6.8 billion yen a year earlier,
the company said in a statement distributed through the Tokyo
Stock Exchange today. Sales rose 13 percent to 213 billion yen.  Japanese property companies including Mitsubishi Estate are
facing slowing economic growth as the country struggles to
rebuild in the wake of the nation’s strongest earthquake and
tsunami that led to a nuclear disaster. Revenue from the
residential business fell 38 percent in the quarter from the
same period a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said today.  Mitsubishi Estate has said it expects housing profit to
drop 75 percent this year because of the quake. The company left
its net income forecast unchanged at 55 billion yen on sales of
977 billion yen for the year through March 2012.  Shares of Mitsubishi Estate fell 0.4 percent to 1,384 yen
at the 3 p.m. close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
