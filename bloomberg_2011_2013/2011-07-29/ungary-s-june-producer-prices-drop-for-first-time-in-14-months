Hungarian producer prices, an early
indicator of inflation trends, dropped for the first time in 14
months in June.  Factory-gate prices fell 1 percent from a year earlier,
declining for the first time since April 2010, the Budapest-
based  statistics office  said today in an e-mail. The median
estimate of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.2
percent rise. Prices fell 0.8 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
