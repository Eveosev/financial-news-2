Lawrence Frank has been picked to
coach the  Detroit Pistons , his first head-coaching job since
being fired by the New Jersey Nets two years ago, the Detroit
Free Press said.  Frank, 40, will get a three-year contract with an option
year to lead the National Basketball Association team, the
newspaper said on its website citing an unidentified person
familiar with the deal.  It said Frank is expected to be introduced as coach next
week.  The Nets are the only NBA team Frank has directed, coaching
them from January 2004 until they started the 2009-10 season
0-16, finishing with a 225-241 record. He worked last season as
an assistant coach for the  Boston Celtics .  Frank would succeed John Kuester, who was fired as Pistons
coach last month after two years and a 57-107 record.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
