Bank of Moscow fell for the first
day in four after the lender recorded a net loss of 68.25
billion rubles ($2.5 billion) for 2010, before state-run VTB
Group agreed to take over the bank.  That compares with net income of 717 million rubles for
2009, Bank of Moscow said on its website today.  Bank of Moscowâ€™s shares retreated as much as 1.8 percent
before closing 0.1 percent lower at 819.3 rubles at 6:45 p.m. in
Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
