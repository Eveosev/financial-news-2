Turkish businessman Remzi Gur, a
close friend of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , and the
Gulf Finance House won an auction for Adabank of  Turkey , which
was put up for sale by a fund managing failed banks.  Gur and GFH bid $75 million for Istanbul-based Adabank and
will have a 50-50 partnership in the unit, Gur said in televised
comments on Bloomberg HT television today. Gur and GFH were the
only bidders in the auction.  Gur owns the Ramsey chain of men’s clothing stores. It was
Turkey’s fourth attempt to sell  Adabank , which has one branch
and 44 staff. The Savings Deposit Insurance Fund, or TMSF,
seized Adabank seven years ago from the Uzan family.  He has served as chairman of the Turkish British Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and is one of only three Turks to be
awarded the “Freeman” title, an honor bestowed upon the likes
of Princess Diana and  Nelson Mandela , according to the  website 
of the chamber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
