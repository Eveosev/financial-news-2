U.K. mortgage approvals unexpectedly
rose in June while net lending was little changed, a sign the
recovery in the housing market is struggling to build momentum.  Lenders granted 48,421 loans to buy homes, the most since
May 2010, compared with 46,418 the previous month, the  Bank of
England  said today in London. Economists forecast 46,000, based
on the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Approvals have held between 43,000 and 50,000 since the start of
2010, compared with an average of 119,000 in 2006.  U.K. house-price data have been mixed, with the  Land
Registry  saying this week values stagnated in July and
 Nationwide Building Society  reporting a 0.2 percent increase.
While the central bank left the key  interest rate  at a record
low this month, the National Association of Estate Agents said
mortgage scarcity and waning confidence is undermining demand.  “There are still significant difficulties in getting a
mortgage,”  Howard Archer , an economist at IHS Global Insight in
 London , said in a research note before the data were published.
“The main support for  house prices  will come from the fact that
interest rates are likely to remain very low.”  Net mortgage lending fell by 100 million pounds ($163
million) in June from May, while  consumer credit  increased by
400 million pounds, the central bank said.  The number of potential home buyers registered with real-
estate agents fell to 263 in June from 275 in May, the NAEA said
July 27. The average number of properties available per agency
rose to 74, the most since April 2009, from 68.  “Lack of mortgage availability is still proving a major
barrier to home ownership in addition to wider economic factors
such as struggling  consumer confidence ,” the association said.  Confidence Falls  Consumers’ confidence declined this month as their outlook
for the economy dimmed, GfK NOP Ltd said today in a separate
report. Britons are getting squeezed by inflation that’s more
than double the central bank’s 2 percent target and government
spending cuts. The economy expanded 0.2 percent in the second
quarter after showing no growth in the previous six months.  A measure of M4 money-supply growth that the central bank
uses to assess the effectiveness of its asset purchases rose 0.8
percent in the three months through June on an annualized basis.
That compares with a 1.6 percent increase in the three months
through May. The gauge excludes financial companies that
specialize in intermediating between banks, such as holding
companies and non-bank credit grantors.  Total M4 was down 0.5 percent in June from May and fell 0.7
percent on the year, the Bank of England said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
