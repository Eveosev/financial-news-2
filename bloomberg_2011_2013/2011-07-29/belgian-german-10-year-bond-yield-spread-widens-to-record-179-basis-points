The additional yield investors
demand to hold Belgian 10-year bonds instead of benchmark German
bunds widened to a record.  The difference in yield, or spread, increased to 179 basis
points as of 1:53 p.m. in  London , the most since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
