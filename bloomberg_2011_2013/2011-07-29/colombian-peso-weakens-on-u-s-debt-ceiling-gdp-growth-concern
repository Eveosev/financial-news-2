Colombia ’s peso weakened as U.S.
officials continued wrangling over a plan to raise the debt
ceiling and a report showed growth in the world’s largest
economy was less than forecast.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 1,778.38 per  U.S. dollar  at 2
p.m. New York time, from 1,772.47 yesterday. The currency has
jumped 7.8 percent since March 1, the best performance among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It has declined
0.4 percent in July.  “We’re in a tough international environment,” said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at brokerage Serfinco SA. “The debt ceiling
issue has markets nervous.”  The U.S. House of Representatives planned to vote today on
a two-step borrowing-limit plan from Speaker  John Boehner , a
Republican, and lawmakers from his party said it will have
enough support to pass. President Barack Obama opposes the plan.
Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Democrat, said he will take
action to move to a vote on his competing plan, and at the same
time held out hope for a deal with Republican leaders.  The  U.S. economy  grew 1.3 percent in the second quarter,
less than forecast, after almost coming to a halt at the start
of the year, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.64 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The security’s price rose 0.351
centavo to 119.001 centavos per peso.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
