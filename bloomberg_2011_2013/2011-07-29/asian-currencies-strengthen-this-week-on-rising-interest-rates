Asian currencies completed a second
weekly gain, led by the Philippine peso and India’s rupee, on
speculation the region’s growth outlook and rising interest
rates will attract foreign funds.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index touched a 14-year
high this week as India boosted borrowing costs by more than
economists forecast and Bank Negara Malaysia said taming
inflation is “critical,” a week after it described borrowing
costs as being “quite low.” In the U.S., lawmakers continued
to argue over how to tackle the nation’s debt as an Aug. 2
deadline to raise the borrowing limit looms.  “The fundamentals are still attractive in the Asian region
as growth continues,” said  David Cohen , a Singapore-based
economist for Action Economics. “This has been contributing to
the central banks’ decisions to raise interest rates, which is
supportive of their currencies.”  The Philippine peso strengthened 0.7 percent this week to
42.07 per dollar in  Manila , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rupee appreciated 0.4 percent to 44.19,
Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.3 percent to 8,507 and Singapore’s
dollar climbed 0.2 percent to S$1.2056.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
active currencies excluding the yen, advanced 0.2 percent this
week and 1 percent this month, the most since April.  Asian nations need to implement policies to curb inflation
even as the global economy slows, the Manila-based  Asian
Development Bank  said in a report released July 28. The lender’s
forecast for growth of 7.9 percent this year in emerging-market
East Asian economies may be revised lower, according to its Asia
Economic Monitor report.  Growth in Asia  Asia’s emerging-market economies will expand 8.4 percent in
2011, almost quadruple the 2.2 percent growth projected for
developed nations, the  International Monetary Fund  said last
month.  ‘Asia is relatively more stable than Europe or the U.S. and
looks safer compared with the rest of the world,” said Teck Kin Suan, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
“That contributes to inflows to Asia.”  The peso traded near its strongest level in more than three
years after Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said July 28 that risks
to its inflation forecasts remain “skewed to the upside”. The
central bank remains watchful against inflation and will adjust
its “policy and prudential setting as needed,” it said, citing
a necessity for “caution” in monetary stance.  Indian Rate Surprise  Policy makers kept the benchmark  interest rate  at 4.5
percent on July 28 having announced two increases of a quarter
of a percentage point each earlier in the year.  The rupee climbed to its highest level in almost three
years after the central bank raised interest rates this week for
the fifth time this year to damp inflation. The currency touched
43.855 on July 27, the strongest since August 2008.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  raised the repurchase rate by 50
basis points to 8 percent on July 26, double the increase
forecast by most economists in a Bloomberg survey. Benchmark
rates are a maximum 0.25 percent in the U.S. and  Japan .  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.2 percent this week to
2.9673. Thailand’s baht dropped 0.1 percent to 29.84,  China ’s
yuan advanced 0.1 percent to 6.4366, while Taiwan’s dollar fell
0.2 percent to NT$28.890 and South Korea’s won weakened 0.2
percent to 1,054.08.  To contact the reporters on this story:
