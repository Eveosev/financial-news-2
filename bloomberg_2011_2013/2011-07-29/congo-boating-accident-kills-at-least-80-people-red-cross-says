At least 80 people are presumed dead
after a boat accident in  Democratic Republic of Congo , said Gyna
Bafala, provincial secretary of the Congolese Red Cross.  A private boat was travelling down a tributary of the Congo
River near Ingende in Equateur province late yesterday when it
collided with a convoy of small wooden boats, Bafala said by
phone today from Mbandaka, the provincial capital. None of the
boats had lights, he said.  The wooden boats “were filled with great numbers of people
and merchandise,” Bafala said. Equateur’s minister of health
sent officials to investigate the accident, he said.  At least 115 people survived the crash, Lambert Mende,
Congo’s minister of information, said in an e-mailed statement.
The Transport Ministry has outlawed boats from travelling at
night, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
