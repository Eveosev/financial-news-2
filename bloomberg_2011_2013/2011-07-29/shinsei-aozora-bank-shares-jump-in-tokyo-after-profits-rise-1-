Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303)  and  Aozora Bank
Ltd. (8304)  gained in  Tokyo  trading after the Japanese lenders posted
first-quarter profit increases helped by one-time income from
securities sale and lower credit costs.  Shares of Shinsei Bank partly owned by J. Christopher Flowers rose as much as 6.7 percent to 95 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange as of 9:26 a.m., the biggest gain since March 1. Aozora
Bank, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, climbed 2.8
percent to 182 yen.  Income from selling assets including foreign stocks,
coupled with fewer credit costs and operating expenses boosted
Shinsei Bank’s net income by 31 percent to 18.2 billion yen
($234 million) in the quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier,
it said in an exchange filing yesterday.  Japan ’s bank lending
decline slowed in June falling 0.6 percent from a year earlier,
the smallest drop in 19 months, according to  Bank of Japan  data.  Shinsei Chief Executive Officer Shigeki Toma plans to
expand consumer financing including uncollateralized loans given
that signs of recovery in the country’s lending demand are
emerging, he said in the statement.  Aozora’s first-quarter profit surged 50 percent to 11
billion yen, helped by a decline in credit costs, according to a
statement filed yesterday to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
