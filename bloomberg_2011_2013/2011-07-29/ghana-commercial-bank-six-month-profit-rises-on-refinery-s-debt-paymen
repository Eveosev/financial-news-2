Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) , the West
African nation’s biggest lender, said first-half profit climbed
96 percent after most of the debt owed by the state-owned Tema
Oil Refinery was paid off.  Net income increased to 34.4 million cedis ($22.8 million)
in the six months through June, compared with 17.5 million cedis
a year earlier, the Accra-based bank said in a statement
published in the Daily Graphic newspaper today. Net interest
income fell 32 percent to 108.6 million cedis while impairment
charges on loans and advances narrowed to 3.6 million cedis,
compared with 73.5 million cedis, the bank said.  The government’s “restructuring of the Tema Oil Refinery
debt enhanced flexibility and provided more resources for the
bank’s business,” Sampson Akligoh, an economist with Databank
Financial Services Ltd., said in a telephone interview.  Ghana  sold three-year bonds last year to pay off the
refinery’s debt to the lender. In March, the bank said 572
million cedis had been paid, equalling about 90 percent of the
money owed, according to African Alliance Ltd.  Ghana Commercial’s shares were unchanged at 2.96 cedis by
1:04 p.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
