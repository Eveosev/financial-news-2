South Africa â€™s Nkomati Anthracite
Coal Mine, controlled by Sentula Mining Ltd., was forced to
close because of a protest by residents after it failed an
environmental assessment, the Mail & Guardian reported, citing
Sentula Chief Executive Officer Robin Berry.  The mine was operating near the border with  Mozambique 
without a water license, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited
Berry as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
