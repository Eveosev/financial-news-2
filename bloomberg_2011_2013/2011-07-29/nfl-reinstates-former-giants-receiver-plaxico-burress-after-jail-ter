Former  New York  Giants receiver
Plaxico Burress has been reinstated by the  National Football
League  after almost two years in jail on gun charges.  The NFL said before Burress was incarcerated  in 2009  that
he would be reinstated upon his release, NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail.  Burress, who is allowed to start visiting teams at 6 p.m.
New York time today, plans to have dinner with Giants coach Tom Coughlin and then may go to Pittsburgh to meet with Steelers
coach  Mike Tomlin ,  ESPN reported , citing people it didn’t
identify.  The Giants may pay Burress about $10.5 million over two
years, about 60 percent in salary and bonuses with the rest
earned through playing-time and performance bonuses, ESPN said.
The  Philadelphia Eagles  and New York Jets have also expressed
interest in Burress, ESPN said.  Burress, who caught the winning touchdown pass in the
Giants’ 17-14 victory over the New England Patriots in the Super
Bowl following the 2007 season, was sentenced to two years in
jail after pleading guilty in state court in Manhattan to
attempted possession of a weapon, as part of an agreement with
prosecutors.  The receiver turned himself in to police at the 17th
Precinct in midtown Manhattan in 2008 after a gun he was
carrying discharged and wounded him in the leg at the Latin
Quarter night club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
