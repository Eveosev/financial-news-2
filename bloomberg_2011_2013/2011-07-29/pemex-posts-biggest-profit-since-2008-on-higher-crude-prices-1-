Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, posted its biggest profit since June 2008
in the second quarter as crude prices surged and Mexican oil
traded with a premium over the U.S. crude benchmark.  Net income was 9.1 billion pesos ($776 million,) the Mexico
City-based company said today in a statement to the Mexican
Stock Exchange. The previous year, Pemex, as the Mexico City-
based company is known, reported a net loss of 20.1 billion
pesos.  The state-owned  oil company  has benefited from the rising
price of oil over the past year. The quarterly average price of
Mexican export crude jumped 51 percent to $105.33 a barrel.
Revenue for the first half of the year was 746 billion pesos.
The company didn’t provide quarterly revenue.  U.S. oil futures traded in  New York  averaged $102.34 a
barrel in the quarter, 31 percent higher than the $78.05 a year
earlier. The Mexican mix of oil for export was an average of
$5.67 a barrel higher than West Texas Intermediate in the
period, the first quarter that oil exported by Pemex traded with
a premium over the U.S. crude benchmark.  Oil exports from Mexico, the second-largest oil supplier to
the U.S. after  Canada , rose 28 percent to 1.43 million barrels a
day in June from the year-earlier period, Pemex said July 22.  Pemex taxes represent about a third of Mexico’s public
budget.  Worldwide demand for crude gained about 3.2 percent from a
year earlier in the three months that ended June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
