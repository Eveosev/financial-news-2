Colombia  plans to raise spending
next year in an effort to continue reconstruction of
infrastructure damaged by heavy rains, help victims of the
country’s internal conflict and bolster security.  The government will submit a plan to Congress that calls
for raising budgeted spending next year by 9.5 percent to 165.3
trillion pesos ($93 billion) from 151 trillion pesos, according
to a presentation today in Bogota attended by Finance Minister
Juan Carlos Echeverry. The spending called for in the 2012
budget is equivalent to 25.3 percent of gross domestic product,
up from 25 percent for 2011.  President  Juan Manuel Santos , a former finance minister,
had promised during his campaign last year to balance the budget
several years earlier though heavy rains this past year forced
an increase in spending to rebuild washed-out roads and provide
shelter to millions. Colombia is counting on surging foreign
investment in mining and energy to boost annual economic growth
and reduce its debt burden.  The plan includes 23.8 trillion pesos in defense and
security spending, a 6.9 percent increase from the year before.
Echeverry said the increase includes funds for 5,000 new police
officers and also 23 trillion pesos on education spending, an
8.4 percent increase from 2010.  Echeverry, who took office last August with Santos, gave
details about the budget, entitled “More Employment, Less
Poverty with More Security and Fiscal Soundness.”  The proposed budget includes 2.9 trillion pesos for victims
of the conflict, including care for displaced peoples,
reparations and enforcing the victims law.  The government’s biggest operating cost next year will be
25 trillion pesos for pensions, Echeverry said.  Santos before taking office last year pledged to increase
spending on public works to help accelerate annual economic
growth to 6 percent, create 2.4 million jobs within two years
and cut the  unemployment rate  to single digits.  The central bank today raised its 2011 economic growth
estimate to a range of 4.5 percent to 6.5 percent from 4 percent
to 6 percent previously. Policy makers earlier had raised the
benchmark rate by a quarter point to 4.5 percent.  Echeverry today said that the central government’s budget
deficit would be equivalent to 4 percent of GDP in 2011 and fall
to 3.5 percent next year.  The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 1778.38 per dollar from
1772.47 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
