JCDecaux SA (DEC) , the French outdoor
advertising company, said first-half earnings before interest
and taxes rose 20 percent as growth in  Asia  and some European
markets drove higher sales.  Ebit reached 136.5 million euros ($195 million), compared
with 113.7 million euros a year earlier, the company said in 
a  statement  today. That beat the 131.8 million-euro average 
estimate by five analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  JCDecaux, based in Neuilly-sur-Seine outside Paris, said
growth in the Asia and “rest of world” regions grew 20 percent
or more in the first half, offsetting declines in  North America .
The company increased operating profit by 5.4 percent.  “Although some concern remains regarding the short-term
economic outlook, we are confident in our ability to deliver
solid revenue growth,” Co-Chief Executive Officer Jean-Charles Decaux said in the statement.  Revenue climbed 5.3 percent to 1.17 billion euros in the
first half, in line with analysts’ estimates. Net income jumped
46 percent to 95.1 million euros.  The company said it expects third-quarter organic revenue
growth, which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and currency
swings to be similar to growth last quarter.  JCDecaux fell 13 cents to 19.21 euros in Paris trading
yesterday. The stock had declined 17 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
