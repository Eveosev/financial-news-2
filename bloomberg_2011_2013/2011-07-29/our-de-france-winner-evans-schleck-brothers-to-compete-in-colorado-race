Tour de France  winner Cadel Evans of
Australia will compete in next month’s inaugural  USA Pro Cycling
Challenge  in Colorado, joining Luxembourg brothers Frank and
 Andy Schleck .  It will be the first time the top three Tour de France
finishers will compete in a U.S.-based event the same year, race
spokeswoman Stacie Lange said.  Evans, 34, became the first Southern Hemisphere champion in
the sport’s most prestigious race, beating Andy Schleck by 1
minute, 34 seconds. Frank Schleck finished third, 56 seconds
behind his younger brother.  The seven-stage, 518-mile Colorado race is scheduled for
Aug. 22-28, conflicting with the dates of the Tour of Spain, one
of cycling’s top-three stage races. The Pro Cycling Challenge
goes from  Colorado Springs  to Denver, climbing passes through
the  Rocky Mountains  reaching an elevation of 12,126 feet, the
highest elevation of any cycling race.  Evans, a member of the U.S.-based  BMC  Racing team, became
the oldest and the third non-European in 108 years to win the
Tour de France, following Greg LeMond and Lance Armstrong of the
U.S. He wore the leader’s yellow jersey into Paris after
overcoming a 57-second deficit to Andy Schleck in a time trial
on the next-to-last day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
