The costs of a South African rapid
rail line in Johannesburg and  Pretoria , known as the Gautrain,
increased by 2 billion rand to 30 billion rand in less than a
month, The Star said, citing a progress report.  The train will start operating services between Rosebank in
Johannesburg and Pretoria on Aug. 2, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. The final leg of the project, from Rosebank to
Johannesburg’s central business district, has been delayed
because of water seepage problems, it said.  The costs of Gautrain were estimated at 7 billion rand when
the project was first planned in 2002, The Star said, increasing
to 20 billion rand three years later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
