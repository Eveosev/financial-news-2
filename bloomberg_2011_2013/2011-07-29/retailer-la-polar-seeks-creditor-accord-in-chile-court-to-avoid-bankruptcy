Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , the Chilean
retailer that set aside $900 million last month for consumer-
lending losses, will seek a court agreement with creditors to
renegotiate repayments and avoid bankruptcy.  The board agreed to file a so-called preventative judicial
agreement that requires support from creditors representing more
than half the outstanding debt to be processed, La Polar said in
an e-mailed statement today. The company would then have 90 days
protection against bankruptcy requests as it seeks an agreement
on new repayment terms from at least two-thirds of creditors.  “We took this decision due to the difficulty of reaching
unanimity with creditors, a task that would take too long,”
Chairman Cesar Barros said in the statement. “Also, we seek to
wrest unjust veto powers from some of them that would have led
us to defend the company from requests to declare bankruptcy.”  La Polar’s shares have lost 80 percent and its bond yields
have soared since the company announced on June 9 that
executives restructured 475 billion pesos ($1 billion) of
overdue credit without the consent of the more than 400,000
customers involved, triggering regulatory and criminal probes.  Bondholders agreed June 20 on a waiver of covenants that
allows the company to suspend pre-payments while stockholders
approved on June 22 the sale of $200 million in new shares thatBarros said would help make the company viable.  The yield on La Polar’s inflation-indexed bonds due in 2017
rose to 19 percent on July 22, when it last traded, from 4.11
percent before the irregularities were announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
