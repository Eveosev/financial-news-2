AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, will curb browsing speeds for its heaviest users on
unlimited wireless data plans to cope with surging data traffic.  Starting Oct. 1, customers on an unlimited plan whose
monthly use puts them into the top 5 percent of data consumption
may experience reduced speeds until the end of that billing
cycle, the Dallas-based company said today on its website.
Normal browsing speeds will return once the customer begins a
new cycle, AT&T said.  “This change will never impact the vast majority of our
customers and is designed to create a better experience for
all,” the company said. Heavy users who don’t want their speeds
curbed can switch to a so-called tiered plan and pay more, AT&T
said.  AT&T and other carriers are battling congestion on their
networks as sales of smartphones surge and more people use them
to download video and browse the Web. The company said the move
to curb unlimited data plan users is designed to target those
customers who typically use 12 times more data than the average
smartphone customer.  “Even as we pursue this additional measure, it will not
solve our spectrum shortage and network capacity issues,” AT&T
said. The carrier said its planned takeover of T-Mobile USA
Inc., which has yet to be approved by regulators, will address
capacity problems.  AT&T spokesman Brad Burns declined to comment beyond the
statement.  AT&T was unchanged at $29.26 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped less than
1 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
