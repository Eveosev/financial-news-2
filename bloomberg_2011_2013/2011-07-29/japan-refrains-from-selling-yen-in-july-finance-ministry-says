Japan  refrained from selling yen in
July, the government said today.  The  Ministry of Finance  didn’t sell any of Japan’s currency
between June 29 and July 27, it said in a statement on its
website. The ministry sold 692.5 billion yen ($8.9 billion) in
March in its first currency intervention since September.  The yen reached 77.46 per dollar today, the strongest since
March 17, when it climbed to a postwar record of 76.25,
prompting Group of Seven nations to jointly sell yen in foreign-
exchange markets the next day. The yen had advanced on
speculation Japanese companies would repatriate overseas assets,
following the magnitude-9 earthquake earlier in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
