The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.2 percent to 14,039.31 while the
Colcap Index retreated 0.7 percent to 1,659.39.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)   fell 1.2 percent to 3,735 pesos,
the most in two weeks.  Colombia ’s state-controlled oil company
fell in line with the price of crude, which retreated after the
U.S. posted lower-than-expected economic growth figures for the
second quarter.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB) lost 0.7 percent to 73.5 pesos. The
bankrupt Colombian textile producer’s rise this year on
expectations of a free-trade agreement with the U.S. is
unwarranted, said  Rupert Stebbings , the Colombia director for
Santiago-based Celfin Capital.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA CB) retreated 0.3 percent to
22,200 pesos, ending a four-day winning streak. Colombia’s
biggest food producer said first-half net income fell 8.1
percent from a year ago to 115 billion pesos ($65 million),
according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
