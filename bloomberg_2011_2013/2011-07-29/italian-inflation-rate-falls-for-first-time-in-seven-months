The inflation rate in  Italy , the
euro regionâ€™s third-biggest economy, fell for the first time in
seven months in July.  The inflation rate based on European Union measurements
dropped to 2.1 percent from a year earlier, after rising 3
percent in both May and June, which was the highest since
October 2008, the Rome-based national statistics office, Istat,
said in a preliminary report today. Prices declined 1.7 percent
from June.  Based on Italian methodology, prices gained 0.3 percent
from the previous month and 2.7 percent from a year earlier.
Producer prices in Italy rose 0.1 percent in June from the
previous month and 4.7 percent from a year earlier, Istat said
today in a separate report.  The statistics office will release final consumer-price
data on July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
