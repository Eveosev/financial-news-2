The European Commission will start a
probe into the U.K. government’s plan to sell off part or all of
Royal Mail Group Ltd to private investors, the Financial Times
reported without saying where it got the information.  The government has set a target of March 2012 to obtain
clearance from the inquiry, which will determine whether the
proposals meet European Union guidelines on state aid, the FT
said without attribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
