Uganda’s shilling, the world’s worst-
performing currency in the last two months, fell to the lowest
in more than two weeks against the dollar as local lenders
sought to buy the U.S. currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated 0.2 percent to 2,615 per dollar, the weakest
intraday level since July 12 by 12:32 p.m. in Kampala, the
capital. The decline pared the shilling’s gain this month to 2.5
percent, the first monthly increase since April.  “It is interbank interest which drove the market,” Benon
Okwenje, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd., said by
phone from Kampala. “There were some banks which were buying
the dollar,” he said without giving further details.  The shilling has depreciated 8.5 percent against the dollar
over the last two months, making it the world’s worst performer
in the period. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation
to a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent this month from 15.7
percent in June, the  Uganda  Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
