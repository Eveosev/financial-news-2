India  won the toss and elected to
bowl against England in their second cricket Test at Trent
Bridge in Nottingham.  England has made one change to the team which won the
opening Test by 196 runs as Tim Bresnan replaces injured Chris
Tremlett. India has two injury changes with Yuvraj Singh playing
in place of Gautam Gambhir and Shantha Sreesanth in for  Zaheer
Khan .  England can overtake India at the top of the International
Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-game series by two
Tests or more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
