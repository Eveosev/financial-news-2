Russia  lifted a ban on vegetable
imports from Bulgaria as of today following the deadly E. coli
outbreak, the consumer safety service said on its website.  The agency, known as  Rospotrebnadzor , said inbound
shipments will be allowed if they are validated safe by a
Bulgarian laboratory.  Russia prohibited all fresh-vegetable imports from the 27-
nation European Union on June 2 after the outbreak in May. It
previously canceled the ban on vegetables from Belgium, Greece,
Denmark, Spain, Netherlands, Poland, France, the  Czech Republic ,
Italy and Hungary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
