Oil options volatility increased as
futures tumbled in  New York  as the  U.S. economy  grew less than
estimated in the second quarter and a deadlock of U.S. lawmakers
over raising the debt limit further threatened expansion.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.5 percent at 2 p.m. in New York,
up from 30.2 percent yesterday.  Oil for September delivery dropped $1.74, or 1.5 percent,
to settle at $95.70 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since July 18. Prices tumbled
4.2 percent this week and gained 28 cents in July, the first
monthly increase since April.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $90 puts, with 4,411 lots changing hands. They gained
32 cents to 99 cents a barrel. September $85 puts, the next-most
active option, rose 12 cents to 38 cents a barrel with 3,216
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December $70 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,620 lots changing hands. They advanced 2 cents
to 49 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, September
$95 puts, increased 5 cents to $1.78 a barrel on volume of
3,911.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
45,568 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 44,949 and
December $125 calls with 41,349.  To contact the reporter on this story:
