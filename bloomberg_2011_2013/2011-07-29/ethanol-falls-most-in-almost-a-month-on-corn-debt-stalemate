Ethanol futures fell the most in
almost a month as corn declined and Congress remained divided
over plans to increase the national debt limit.  The grain-based additive slumped 3.6 percent on speculation
wet, cooler weather in the Midwest will help crops that have
been barraged by a heat wave.  Ethanol, made from corn in the Midwest, is blended with
gasoline to stretch supply of the motor fuel and to reduce
dependence on foreign sources of crude oil.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery sank 10.8 cents to
settle at $2.891 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the
biggest drop since July 7 and the lowest price since July 18.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago slumped 18.5
cents, or 5.8 percent, to $3 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
biofuel fell 12 cents to $3.045, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast tumbled 8.5 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $3.075 a gallon and in  New York  it slid 8 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $3.03.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 17.5 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $6.6875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
8 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 18 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
