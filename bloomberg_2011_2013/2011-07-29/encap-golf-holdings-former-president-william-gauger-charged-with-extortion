Former Encap Golf Holdings LLC
President William Gauger and his brother-in-law were charged
with extortion in a criminal complaint filed today by  Preet
Bharara , the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.  Gauger extorted $100,000 from a financial consultant,
according to a complaint filed in federal court in Newark, New
Jersey. Gauger hired the consultant and Craig Groce, his
brother-in-law, to provide services on redevelopment projects in
the state, Bharara said in an e-mailed statement. Bharara
handled the case because of conflicts of interest in the New
Jersey prosecutor’s office.  Gauger and Groce are scheduled to appear Aug. 3 before U.S.
Magistrate Judge Joseph A. Dickson, according to the statement.  Eric Tunis, a lawyer representing Groce, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment. Laurence Shtasel, who represents
Gauger, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. William H. Gauger III and Craig Groce,
No. 11-6638, U.S. District Court of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
