Japan ’s bonds fell as continuing
negotiations among U.S. policy makers on how to raise the debt
ceiling prompted investors to pare bets before a sale of 10-year
securities next week.  Benchmark yields rose from a week low before Obama
administration officials brief the public today on how the U.S.
will pay its bills if a $14.3 trillion debt ceiling isn’t
raised. Japan’s Ministry of Finance is scheduled to sell 2.2
trillion yen ($28.4 billion) in 10-year bonds on Aug. 2.  “Investors are taking profits amid uncertainties over how
legislation to raise the U.S. debt limit will develop over the
weekend,” said  Katsutoshi Inadome , a strategist in Tokyo at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s
largest bank.  The yield on the 1.2 percent bond due June 2021 rose half a
basis point to 1.075 percent as of 3:21 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price fell 0.045 yen to 101.116 yen. The yield declined two
basis points this week and 5.5 points this month.  Ten-year yields touched 1.065 percent yesterday, the lowest
since July 19. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Bond futures for September delivery fell 0.01 to 141.83 at
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The contracts rose 0.41 this week.  U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  delayed yesterday’s planned
vote on debt-ceiling legislation as Senate leaders stood ready
to kill the measure should it get to their chamber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
