Dorbyl Ltd. (DLV)  surged the most in 18
months after the South African mechanical-engineering company
said it was successful in a high court claim against a former
director regarding undisclosed gains by the director.  The stock rallied 20 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since January 2010, to 2.95 rand by 3:25 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The judgment is unlikely to be appealed, the company said
in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
