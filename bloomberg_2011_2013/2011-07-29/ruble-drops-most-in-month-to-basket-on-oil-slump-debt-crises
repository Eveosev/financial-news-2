The ruble dropped the most against
the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket in more than a
month as oil fell and concerns that the U.S. or European
countries may default hurt demand for riskier assets.  Russia ’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 33.0514 versus
the basket at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest drop since
June 27. The ruble weakened 0.1 percent to 27.63 per dollar and
slid 0.5 percent versus the euro to 39.6776.  Mounting concern that U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree on
the federal government’s debt ceiling by next week’s deadline
pushed down prices for oil, Russia’s chief export earner, as
investors speculated demand for the commodity may decline. In
 Europe , Moody’s Investor’s Service said it was reviewing  Spain ’s
credit rating, spurring concern the region’s debt crisis may
spread further.  “Oil weakness and negative sentiment” from the crises in
the U.S. and Europe are driving down the ruble, Maxim Oreshkin,
Moscow-based chief strategist for Russia and the former  Soviet
Union  at Credit Agricole CIB, said in response to e-mailed
questions. There’s an “overall risk-off mode,” he said.  Crude for September delivery slumped as much as 2.5 percent
to $94.95 a barrel. Two-year bonds issued by Greece and
Portugal, both of which have received bailouts, yield 30.6
percent and 13 percent respectively, compared with the 5.4
percent yield on similar-maturity Russian debt.  Risk Aversion  “Market sentiment has certainly plummeted today with EU
and U.S. debt woes still on the table,” Carolin Hecht, a
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said by e-mail.
“Even though euro and dollar weakness currently still persists,
the ruble today can no longer withdraw from the whirl of rising
 risk aversion .”  Russian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
ruble Eurobond due in 2018 up one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.831 percent. Non-deliverable forwards,
which provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
allow companies to hedge against them, show the ruble at 27.8638
per dollar in three months, compared with 27.8735 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
