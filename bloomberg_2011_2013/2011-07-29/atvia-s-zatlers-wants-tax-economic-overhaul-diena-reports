Latvia’s former president, Valdis Zatlers, who is running in September’s parliamentary elections,
will advocate an overhaul of the economy, education and
politics, he told  Diena  in an interview.  The former president, who lost a re-election bid in
parliament on June 2, favors the creation of a fiscal council
that will evaluate threats to the country’s economy and be
staffed by academics, Diena said. The lower rates of the value
added tax should be lifted, with a benefit system put in place
to protect the poorest members of society, he said, Diena
reported. His party also wants to lower some taxes on labor and
raise them on real estate, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
