Electricite de France SA Chief
Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  said he won’t renegotiate a deal
on taking control of utility  Edison SpA (EDN)  until Italian
authorities give their approval.  A preliminary agreement reached in March between EDF and
Italian shareholders was held up by the government amid a
controversy over efforts by French companies to take over
Italian dairymaker Parmalat SpA and jeweler Bulgari SpA.  “We reached an agreement and authorities said they didn’t
want it because of cheese and jewelry,” Proglio said. “We had
a deal.” Any new accord with shareholders is likely to adhere
closely to the original agreement, he said. The deal gave EDF
control in exchange for assets and cash.  Brescia-based utility A2A, the largest Italian shareholder,
said July 7 it would recommence negotiations seeking better
terms.  “I can’t do anything about cheese and jewelry so I have to
wait for the green light from authorities,” Proglio said. “I
will see with my partners what we will do. I won’t reopen talks
with anyone until someone tells me I am welcome.” The March
agreement was “balanced” and beneficial for EDF, A2A and
Edison, he said.  “I’m not going to lose my time renegotiating,” Proglio
said, adding that Sept. 15 remains a target to reach an accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
