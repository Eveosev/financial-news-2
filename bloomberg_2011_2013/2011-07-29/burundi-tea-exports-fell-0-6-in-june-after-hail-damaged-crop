Tea exports from  Burundi , which
relies on agriculture to generate most of its foreign-exchange
earnings, fell 0.6 percent in June from a year earlier after a
hail storm earlier this year damaged the crop.  Shipments fell to 926.5 metric tons from 932 tons a year
earlier, Remy Ndayininahaze, head of exports at the Burundi Tea
Board, said in an interview yesterday in Bujumbura, the capital.
Export earnings jumped 31 percent to $2.58 million, he said.  “The cause of this increase in revenue was the higher tea
prices on the international market,” Ndayininahaze said. Prices
climbed to $2.79 per kilogram last month from $2.11 a year
earlier, he said.  Burundi relies on tea and coffee to generate 90 percent of
its foreign-exchange earnings, according to the CIA World
Factbook. Yields in the East African country have fallen from
more than 9,000 tons in 2001 because of an insurgency that
displaced small-scale growers, who account for 80 percent of
production.  Tea output in Burundi may decline 2.6 percent this year to
8,025 tons after the hail storm in February damaged most
plantations in the country and after farmers failed to apply
fertilizer to their crops, the Tea Board said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
