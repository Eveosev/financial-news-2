SIC Insurance Co., the biggest
insurer in  Ghana , may raise $100 million through a rights offer
this year for investment in property in the capital, Accra, and
to expand operations in other West African nations.  The company will raise the equivalent in the local
currency, the cedi, through a Ghana Stock Exchange offer, said
Franklin Asafo-Adjei, deputy managing director in charge of
finance, in an interview on the sidelines of the company’s
annual meeting today. Shareholders will decide on the plan at an
extraordinary general meeting by the end of the third quarter,
he said.  SIC, which is 40 percent-owned by the Ghanaian government
and listed on Ghana’s bourse in 2008, reported a 74 percent jump
in first-half profit. Net income rose to 6.8 million cedis while
net premium income climbed 36 percent to 32.6 million cedis, the
company said July 27. The stock was unchanged at 53 pesewas,
valuing the company at 104 million cedis ($69 million), by 1:48
p.m. in  The company will use the funds raised in the offer to build
five office towers, residential facilities and hotels in the
Ghana’s biggest city, as well as financing plans to open units
in Liberia and  Sierra Leone , said Chairman Max Cobbina at the
meeting.  “This multimillion-dollar project will be unmatched in the
Accra metropolis,” he said. The company’s unit in Liberia will
start operations before the end of the year while talks with
officials in Sierra Leone may start next year, Cobbina said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
