Electricite de France SA,  Europe â€™s
biggest power generator, said first-half profit rose 6.2 percent
after domestic nuclear output surged to a record, making up for
poor hydroelectric production amid the spring drought.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose to 8.62 billion euros ($12.36 billion) on a
like-for-like basis, EDF said today in a statement. That was in
line with the 8.58 billion-euro median estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Like-for-like net income climbed to 2.55
billion euros from a restated 1.7 billion euros a year earlier.  The French utility reiterated 2011 financial targets and
added some through 2015 including 4 percent to 6 percent average
annual ebitda growth and 5 percent to 10 percent increase in
recurring net income.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
