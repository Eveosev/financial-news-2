George Economou, a Greek shipowner,
ordered four liquefied natural gas carriers worth $848 million
from a South Korean shipyard,  TradeWinds  reported.  The contract with Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering
Co. included an option for two more vessels, the shipping
industry newspaper said, without saying where the information
came from. The ships are scheduled to enter  service  in 2014, it
said. TradeWinds said it was unclear whether the order was
placed via DryShips Inc. or a privately owned company.  Economou is chairman and chief executive officer of Athens-
based DryShips, which is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
