Total SA (FP) ,
 Europe ’s third-largest oil company, may slow the pace of its
acquisitions after announcing $11 billion of the deals this
year, Chief Financial Officer Patrick de la Chevardiere said.  “We’ve done a lot,” he said today on a conference call.
“I’m not so sure we will be able to continue at this pace.
We’re still open to opportunities. We have a strong balance
sheet that would enable us to make an acquisition if there is an
opportunity but there is nothing at the top of my head.”  Total began to increase energy operations and cut European
refining last year. It purchased 12 percent of OAO Novatek, the
second-largest Russian gas company, and agreed to buy 60 percent
of SunPower Corp., the U.S.’s No. 2 solar-panel maker. It sold a
stake in a Spanish oil refiner and the Gassled pipeline network
in  Norway , and plans to offload the U.K.’s Lindsey refinery.  The French oil producer, based in Paris, may increase its
holding in Novatek to 15 percent, De la Chevardiere said at the
second-quarter results. Total has announced about $11 billion of
acquisitions so far this year and $10 billion of sales, he said.  Total’s second-quarter profit fell as field maintenance and
Libya shutdowns crimped production. Adjusted net income slid 6
percent to 2.8 billion euros ($4 billion), it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
