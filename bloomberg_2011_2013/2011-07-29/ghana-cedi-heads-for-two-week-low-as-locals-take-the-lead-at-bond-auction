Ghana ’s cedi headed for a two-week
low after a sale of five-year bonds where local investors bought
most of the debt, resulting in reduced demand for the currency
of the world’s second biggest cocoa producer.  The cedi weakened as much as 0.5 percent to 1.5158 per
dollar before trading 0.3 percent down at 1.5124 as of 3:51 p.m.
in Accra, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
that level would be the weakest since July 15 and would pare the
cedi’s gain this month to 0.2 percent.  Bank of Ghana  yesterday sold 301 million cedis ($199
million) of the notes, the first sale of five-year debt since
2007, said Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury. Investors bid for
448 million cedis of the 300 million cedis of bonds on offer.  “Though yesterday’s auction was oversubscribed, it was
bought largely by local investors,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency
trader at the local unit of Barclays Bank Plc, said by phone.
“Otherwise, today we should see more offshore investors buying
the cedis to pay for their investments.”  Calls to the treasury department of the central bank today
weren’t answered.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
