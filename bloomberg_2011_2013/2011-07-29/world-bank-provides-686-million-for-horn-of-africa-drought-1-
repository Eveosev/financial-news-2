The  World Bank  will provide $686
million of drought relief to countries in the Horn of  Africa 
over the next five years, said Johannes Zutt, country director
for the Washington-based lender’s Kenyan office.  The first phase of emergency relief will cost $89 million
and last six months, Zutt said in a statement handed to
reporters today in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.  The program “will address the immediate needs of people
facing starvation and also put in place mechanisms to ensure
these communities have longterm solutions to the regular food
shortage crisis,” Zutt said. The countries covered by the
program are Ethiopia,  Kenya , Somalia and Djibouti.  East Africa has suffered from two poor rainy seasons that
caused one of the worst droughts since 1950-51, according to the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The UN needs
$1.6 billion in the next 12 months to provide aid to the region,
it said on July 25.  The second phase of the World Bank’s aid program will focus
on improved crop and livestock production at a cost of $267
million, while the third will enhance future drought resilience.
That will take five years and cost $330 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
