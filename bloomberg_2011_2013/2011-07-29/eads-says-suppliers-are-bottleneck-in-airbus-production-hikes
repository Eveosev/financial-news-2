European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. Chief Executive Officer  Louis Gallois  said suppliers are the
“main bottleneck” toward lifting production, as its Airbus SAS
unit pulls in record orders for single-aisle jets.  Gallois cautioned that suppliers may strain Airbus’s
ability to meet demand, as the aircraft manufacturer becomes an
increasingly dominant part of the company’s portfolio. Earnings
surged 39 percent in the first half, as operating profit almost
doubled at Airbus, EADS said today. The unit accounts for 70
percent of sales, which rose 8 percent to 21.9 billion euros.  Suppliers of equipment ranging from  aircraft engines  to
seats are struggling to keep up as Airbus and rival  Boeing Co. (BA) 
rake in orders and retool their aircraft. EADS today predicted
orders for more than 1,000 planes this year, up from 644 in
2010. Airbus plans to boost monthly output of A320 single-aisle
jets to 42 in 2012 from 38 before going even higher.  “The question is the capacity of the supply chain,”
Gallois said on a conference call with journalists. “Reaching
42 is already a challenge, and to go further we have to make
sure the supply chain is able to follow.”  EADS rose as much as 41 cents, or 1.7 percent, to 24.71
euros in Paris, and traded at 24.31 euros as of 1:27 p.m. in
Paris. The stock has gained 41 percent in value so far this
year.  Boosting Production  Boeing announced plans in June to boost production of its
737 jetliner by 33 percent to 38 a month by 2013 to work off a
record order backlog. Last week, Chicago-based Boeing decided to
follow Airbus in offering new engines on its 737 to improve  fuel
efficiency . The Airbus variant, called A320neo, has become the
company’s fastest-selling aircraft to date.  Airbus has garnered orders or commitments for more than
1,000 A320neos since it went on offer in December 2010, with 667
at the  Paris Air Show  in June. The A320 is powered either by the
Leap, a new engine that supersedes the CFM56, or with geared
turbofan engines by  Pratt & Whitney . Boeing’s updated 737 will
only feature the CFM’s Leap as the engine choice.  Gallois singled out CFM as one company that may be under
strain, because the company already supplies engines to the
existing Boeing 737 and the A320. The manufacturer has also won
a place on the planned Chinese 168-seater being developed by
Comac for introduction in 2016.  Chinese Assembly  “They have their own supply chain, and have to take that
into account,” Gallois said.  General Electric Co. (GE) , which runs the CFM joint venture with
 Safran SA (SAF)  of  France , and Pratt & Whitney are hiring to handle
rising demand. GE is adding more than 1,000 U.S. workers, while
Pratt & Whitney plans more than 800 jobs, with 500 engineers
tied to geared turbofan engines.  Airbus assembles its single-aisle A320 family in Hamburg,
Toulouse in southern France and in  China , where the company
opened a final assembly line in 2009 to help it win local
orders. The factory in Tianjin will build aircraft at a rate of
four planes a month, a fraction of the European output.  Airbus had considered adding a final assembly line in the
U.S. when the company competed for an aerial refueling contract.
After Boeing won the deal, the plan fell through. Gallois said
adding another line is “speculation” at this point.  The planemaker may need to rethink it strategy for
protecting dollar revenue later in the decade, and one way to
assure that would be doing more work in the U.S., EADS Chief
Financial Officer Hans Peter Ring said.  “We have to think strategically about this question of
getting more natural hedges into our exposure,” he told
analysts on a call. “It’s a long-term topic, which would mean
to buy even more in dollars and probably do more in the dollar
area but we don’t have a concrete plan as of today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
