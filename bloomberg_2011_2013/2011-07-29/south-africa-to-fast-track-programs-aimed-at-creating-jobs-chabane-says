South Africa ’s government said
President Jacob Zuma and his deputy Kgalema Motlanthe will lead
a renewed drive to create jobs and develop  Africa ’s largest
economy, following an increase in unemployment.  The government has “resolved to fast-track interventions
that will create employment,” Collins Chabane, a minister in
the presidency, told reporters in Pretoria today. The Cabinet
agreed after a meeting on July 26-28 to establish “an
infrastructure commission to be chaired by the president and a
job creation commission to be chaired by the deputy president.”  The  unemployment rate  rose to 25.7 percent in the second
quarter from 25 percent in the previous three months, leaving
4.5 million people without jobs, the government statistics
agency said in a report released yesterday. The government aims
to create 5 million jobs by 2020 in a bid to slash unemployment.  Among projects to create work, the Cabinet agreed to expand
community works programs to create 1 million positions by March
31, 2014 and to encourage manufacturing by cutting the cost of
power, transport, communication and construction. The
departments of economic development and trade and industry are
formulating steps to reduce the cost of steel, which will be
unveiled by the end of September.  A government team will also be set up to focus on
regulatory changes needed to “unblock private-sector
projects,” Chabane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
