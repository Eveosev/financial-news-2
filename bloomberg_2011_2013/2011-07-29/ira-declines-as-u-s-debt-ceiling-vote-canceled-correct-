The lira retreated for the first
time in four days after  Turkey ’s trade deficit widened to a
record last month, the latest evidence that central bank efforts
to contain the current-account gap aren’t working.  The lira weakened 0.4 percent to 1.6829 per dollar at 5:45
p.m. in Istanbul, bringing this month’s loss to 3.6 percent, the
worst performance among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. Traders increased bets the lira will
depreciate, with options contracts indicating 74 percent odds
the lira will decline to 1.75 by the end of 2011 up from 70
percent yesterday.  The trade deficit was $10.2 billion in June, up from $5.6
billion a year earlier, and exceeding the median estimate of
$9.5 billion from eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The
deficit in the current-account, the difference between exports
and imports of goods, services and transfers, more than doubled
from a year earlier to $68.2 billion in May, the most since
records began in 1984.  “Even under an optimistic assumption that the monthly
trade deficit slows down by 20 percent on average until the end
of the year, the year-end current-account deficit will exceed
$70 billion, or 9 percent” of gross national product, Istanbul-
based Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS said in a note to clients.  The lira has lost 8.3 percent versus the dollar this year
as the central bank raised  reserve requirements  for lenders in
an effort to curb loan growth and rein in the current-account
gap, while keeping  interest rates  at a record low to discourage
currency speculators.  Dollar Purchases  Turkey’s currency rallied 2.2 percent in the previous three
days this week after the central bank ended daily purchases of
$30 million and reduced some reserve requirements. Central bank
governor Erdem Basci indicated yesterday he is ready to take
steps to halt the lira’s retreat.  Yields on two-year debt rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 8.87 percent, compared with 8.68 percent at
the end of last week, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc index
showed. The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  dropped 0.4 percent to
62,295.68, heading for a weekly gain of 4.2 percent.  “The June outcome is negative for stocks, the lira and
bonds,” Ibrahim Aksoy, an economist at Seker Securities in
Istanbul, wrote in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
