Ukraine, once the world’s largest
barkey exporter, harvested 28 million metric tons of grains as
of yeterday, UkrAgroConsult said.  The country reaped 7.77 million tons of barley and 19.5
million tons of wheat, the Kiev-based researcher said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The grains, collected from 9.5 million hectares (23.5
million acres), had an average yield of 2.95 tons a hectare,
compared with 2.42 tons a year earlier, UkrAgroConsult said.  The country’s  Agriculture Ministry  raised its grain harvest
forecast for this year to between 48 million tons and 51 million
tons,  RBC-Ukraine  news wire reported today, citing Agriculture
