President  Dennis Lockhart  said the government’s revisions to
gross domestic product data raise concerns about the strength of
the U.S. recovery.  The changes “still gives me some pause,” Lockhart told
reporters after a speech in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. “What is the
true nature of what we are dealing with here? Those revised
numbers are thought-provoking.”  The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter, less than forecast by economists, following a 0.4
percent gain in the prior quarter that was smaller than earlier
estimated, the Commerce Department said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
