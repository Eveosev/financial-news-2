Gasoline declined the most since
June on concern that Congress won’t reach agreement on raising
the debt ceiling before the Aug. 2 deadline and as the  U.S.
economy  grew less than forecast, threatening fuel demand.  Futures fell as much as 1.6 percent as House Republican
leaders, facing internal opposition on a debt bill, plan a
second try at passing a version that is headed for a Senate
roadblock. Commerce Department figures showed gross domestic
product increased at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the second
quarter, less than the 1.8 percent rise forecast in a survey by
Bloomberg News.  “Prices are lower as traders continue to stress out on the
lack of progress on the debt ceiling,” said  Peter Beutel ,
president of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover Inc. in
 New Canaan ,  Connecticut . “And the 1.3 percent rate was
disappointing. Those who had been trying to see some upside
lately in the economic numbers had their hopes dashed.”  Gasoline for August delivery fell 3.91 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.0785 a gallon at 9:42 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The front-month gasoline contract has
gained 1.6 percent this month following a 3.8 percent slide in
June.  The more actively traded September contract lost 3.29 cents
to $3.0309. August Nymex gasoline and heating oil futures will
expire at the close of floor trading today.  Republicans led by House Speaker  John Boehner  were forced
to scrap action on the measure late yesterday. The Treasury
Department has set an Aug. 2 deadline for raising the $14.3
trillion debt limit to avert a default.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.4
cent to $3.71 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for August delivery declined 2.33 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.0819 a gallon on the exchange. August futures
have gained 5.1 percent this month after sinking 4 percent in
June. The September contract lost 2.43 cents to $3.0901.  To contact the reporter on this story:
