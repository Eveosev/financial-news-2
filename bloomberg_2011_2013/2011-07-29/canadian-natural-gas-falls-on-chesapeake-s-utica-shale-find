Canadian natural gas fell as a shale
gas discovery across more than 1 million acres in Ohio buoyed
potential U.S. supplies and depressed export prices of the
power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 2
percent after  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  yesterday announced a find
in the Utica shale formation that may be valued as much as $20
billion.  “Natural gas is probably available in every state in the
nation,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa, Florida. “While we have extended
hot temperatures in the Northeast and the Midwest, people are
just looking at overwhelming supply going forward and it’s
really creating a lethargic market on the upside.”  Alberta gas for September delivery declined 6.5 cents to
C$3.24 per gigajoule ($3.21 per million British thermal units)
as of 3 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. August gas fell 4.75 cents to $3.275. Gas
traded on the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and
is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for September delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange fell 9.9 cents to settle at $4.145.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet as of 2 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.59 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.07 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.07 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.69 billion cubic feet today, about 64
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
fell 11.19 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $4.3209 per million British
thermal units as of 1:32 p.m. New York time on the
Intercontinental Exchange. Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
 Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas dropped 14.11 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $3.8713.  To contact the reporter on this story:
