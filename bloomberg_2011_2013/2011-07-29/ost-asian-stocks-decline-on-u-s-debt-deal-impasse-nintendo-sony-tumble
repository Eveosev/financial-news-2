Asian stocks fell, dragging down the
benchmark index for the week, after the U.S. Congress delayed a
vote on a plan to raise the country’s borrowing limit,
increasing concern the government will default on its debt.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, dropped
0.9 percent in Tokyo. Nintendo Co. plunged 12 percent, leading
declines in information technology shares, after the maker of
Wii game consoles slashed its profit forecast.  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) ,
the third-largest Asia-based insurer by market value, advanced
3.4 percent after first-half profit beat estimates.  “If a resolution in the U.S. is not reached, clearly the
economy will suffer so that demand will wane significantly, and
we’ll see pressure on Asian exporter earnings and shares,” said
Chris Hall, who helps manage $4 billion of assets at Argo
Investments Ltd. in Adelaide. “Earnings are mixed across the
spectrum. There are still a lot of unknowns right now, and
everyone’s incredibly cautious.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.9 percent to 136.36
as of 7:45 p.m. in Tokyo. About seven shares fell for every
three that rose on the gauge. The measure is headed for a 1.9

financial markets but their own constituents’ jobs,” said
Sydney-based  Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management. “It’s certainly adding to stock-market nervousness.
I think they will eventually get a deal that avoids massive
spending cuts or default, but the risk is growing that they
won’t.”  All Groups Lose  All 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index

earnings than those that missed, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Nintendo plunged 12 percent to 12,290 yen in Osaka, the
biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The gamemaker
