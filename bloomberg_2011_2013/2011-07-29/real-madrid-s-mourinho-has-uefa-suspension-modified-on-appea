Real Madrid coach  Jose Mourinho  had
a five-game European suspension modified by  UEFA  following an
appeal hearing.  Mourinho was banned by European soccer’s governing body in
May for his actions and comments toward the officials during the
two-game Champions League semifinal against rival Barcelona. The
fifth game was originally suspended three years and UEFA said
today on its website that the fourth game is now also suspended.  Mourinho served part of the suspension when he missed the
second match with Barcelona, which won the semifinal 3-1. 
He now won’t have to sit out the fourth and fifth matches unless
he has another violation in the next three years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
