Munich Re , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, said it filed criminal charges with the public
prosecutors’ office in Munich over suspected fraud by a service
provider and former employees.  “A detailed internal special audit confirmed the suspicion
of fraud,” the Munich-based reinsurer said today in a  statement 
on its website. “As a result, Munich Re has filed criminal
charges against a service provider, former employees and persons
unknown.”  Internal investigations show that an external service
provider from southern Europe that worked for one of the
reinsurer’s departments “received unjustifiable amounts of
money by making false declarations and manipulating accounts,”
Munich Re said. While the company isn’t aware of any client
losses, Munich Re expects to have incurred a loss of more than
10 million euros ($14.3 million).  Munich Re didn’t identify the name of the service provider
or the ex-employees and spokeswoman Johanna Weber declined to
give more details on the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
