The  New Zealand  dollar headed for a
fifth weekly gain against its U.S. counterpart as traders
increased bets the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will raise
interest rates.  The so-called kiwi advanced versus 12 of its 16 major
counterparts this week after Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard
said yesterday the bank sees “little need” to keep the 50-
basis-point cut it made after a February earthquake.  Australia ’s
currency held onto yesterday’s decline against the dollar amid
concern Asian stocks will extend a global slump in equities and
commodities as the U.S. struggles to find a long-term solution
to curbing its deficit.  “It’s pretty handy support” for the New Zealand dollar,
said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. in Sydney. “Any currency whose central bank is
threatening an increase in  interest rates  soon is going to be
attractive.”  New Zealand’s dollar fetched to 87 U.S. cents as of 9:49
a.m. in Sydney from 87.13 cents in  New York  yesterday, headed
for a 0.6 percent gain this week. It reached 87.66 cents on July
27, the most since it was freely floated in 1985. It was at
67.72 yen from 67.68 yen. Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0994
from $1.1003 and bought 85.56 yen from 85.46. It climbed to a
record $1.1081 on July 27.  Best Performer  The kiwi has risen 4.9 percent this month against the
dollar, the best performer among the greenback’s 16 major
counterparts, and Australia’s currency has climbed 2.5 percent.  Swaps traders are betting borrowing costs will rise about
109 basis points over the next 12 months, a Credit Suisse AG
index showed today. That compares with a 101-basis-point
increase projected on July 27.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent
yesterday and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19  Raw
Materials  lost 0.6 percent. House Speaker John Boehner delayed
yesterday’s planned vote on debt-ceiling legislation as Senate
leaders stood ready to kill the measure should it get to their
chamber.  Obama administration officials will brief the public no
earlier than after financial markets close today on priorities
for paying the nation’s bills if the U.S. debt limit isn’t
raised, a Democratic Party official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
