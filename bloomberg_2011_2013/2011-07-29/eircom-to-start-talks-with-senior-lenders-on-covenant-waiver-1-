Eircom Group Ltd. will start talks
with senior lenders on a possible waiver of its financial
covenants, which the Irish telecoms company said it is likely to
breach by the end of August.  “The company will commence discussions” to secure a
possible covenant waiver from senior lenders “which may be
required should a covenant breach occur,” the Dublin-based
company said in a  statement  after meeting lenders today. Company
owners have a right to inject equity to “cure” any covenant
breach, it said.  Eircom, saddled with 3.75 billion euros of debt, formally
recognized a committee of senior lenders earlier this month as
it starts talks to restructure its balance sheet. Eircom may ask
lenders to write off more than 1 billion euros of debt, two
people familiar with the situation said June 16. The company was
taken over last year by Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte and
a trust owned by current and former Eircom employees.  The company said today its earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization for the year through June 2012
will be “materially lower” than preliminary figures for the
previous 12 months. Those figures haven’t yet been published.
The company’s covenants relate to senior debt-to-ebitda ratios.  The company’s five-year business plan to June 2016 “is
challenged on a number of fronts,” it said. “Increasing
competition from global brands, outdated infrastructure and an
uncompetitive cost structure compared with its peers
necessitates transformation and investment to capitalize on
future opportunities for growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
