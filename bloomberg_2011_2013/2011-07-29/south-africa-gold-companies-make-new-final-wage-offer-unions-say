AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Harmony Gold
Mining Co. and  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) ,  South Africa ’s three biggest
gold producers, made a “final” wage offer to striking workers,
according to the  United Association of South Africa  labor union.  The offer won’t be made public and talks will resume on
Aug. 1 in Johannesburg, Franz Stehring, a spokesman for the
UASA, said by mobile phone.  Lesiba Seshoka, a spokesman for the  National Union of
Mineworkers , said it’s “an offer our members might consider”
and will be discussed over the next two days.  The Chamber of Mines, which negotiates on behalf of the
gold producers, couldn’t confirm that a new offer was tabled.
Jabu Maphalala, a spokesman for the chamber, said only that
union negotiators will seek a new mandate from members over the
weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
