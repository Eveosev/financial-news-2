South African inflation-linked bond
yields fell at the weekly government auction of the debt today
after producer price data stoked concern of price rises in
 Africa ’s biggest economy.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 600 million rand of
securities maturing in 2022, 2028 and 2033, according to the
central bank’s data on Bloomberg. The average yield on the 225
million rand ($33 million) of 2.6 percent notes due 2028 was
dropped 2.5 basis points, or 0.025 percentage point, to 2.575
percent from the previous auction. Investors bid for almost
three times the amount allocated.  The 10-year breakeven rate, or yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and similar-maturity fixed-interest debt,
climbed two basis points to 5.75 percentage points since
yesterday, when the statistics agency reported the price of
goods leaving South African factories and mines rose 7.4 percent
in June after gaining 6.9 percent in May. The breakeven rate is
an indication of bondholders’ outlook for inflation, which
reached 5 percent in June.  “As you would expect, inflation-linked bonds continued to
rally as inflation fears gather momentum,” Rand Merchant Bank
analysts led by Theuns de Wet said in a research note before
today’s auction. “This should result in good demand in today’s
inflation-linked bond auction.”  The central bank also sold 120 million rand of 2.75 percent
bonds due 2022 at an average yield of 2.545 percent, and 255
million rand of 3.45 percent notes due 2033 at an average yield
of 2.54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
