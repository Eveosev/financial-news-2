Michelin & Cie., the world’s second-
largest tiremaker, raised its 2011 sales target after first-half
operating profit jumped 18 percent on recovering demand for car
and truck tires in its home European market.  Operating income, excluding one-time gains and losses,
advanced to 971 million euros ($1.39 billion) from 822 million
euros a year earlier, the Clermont-Ferrand, France-based company
said in a statement. Analysts had expected operating profit of
990 million euros, based on the average of five estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The second-half business environment should see ongoing
market growth at a pace closer to long-term trends,” the
company said in the statement. It lifted its full-year target
for volume growth to 8 percent from at least 6.5 percent.  Michelin is seeking to defend profitability by passing on
rising raw-material costs to customers through price increases.
The price of natural rubber has jumped 44 percent in the past 12
months, while crude oil has gained almost a quarter.  Net income also advanced, to 667 million euros from 503
million euros, on a 21 percent gain in sales to 10.11 billion
euros.  Michelin’s car and light-truck tire revenue gained 14
percent to 5.25 billion euros globally, while heavy-truck tires
advanced 27 percent to 3.27 billion euros, the company said.
Specialty tires for airplanes and construction equipment,
Michelin’s most profitable division, recorded a 37 percent sales
surge to 1.59 billion euros, driven by growth in demand from
mining companies and farmers.  Raw Material Costs  Michelin reiterated its forecast for a 1.8 billion-euro
impact from higher raw-material prices in 2011, as well as its
goal to increase operating profit for the year. The higher costs
should be covered by price increases already announced or
implemented, the company said.  Michelin is targeting 2 billion euros in operating profit
by 2015 and 9 percent return on capital, while pledging to pay
out 30 percent of its profit as dividends. Sales volumes are
seen growing 25 percent by 2015 and 50 percent by 2020,
according to a medium-term strategy unveiled in September.  The French tiremaker, which ranks behind Bridgestone Corp.
of  Japan  in global production, raised 1.2 billion euros in a
share issue last year to finance expansion plans that include
factory investments in  India ,  Brazil  and  China . The company said
aimed to add the equivalent of a new plant each year to harness
tire-demand growth averaging 9 percent in emerging markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
