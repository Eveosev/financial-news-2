Energy Future Holdings Corp., the
 Texas  power company that was taken private in 2007 in the
largest buyout in history, reported a second-quarter loss as
wholesale and retail electricity sales fell.  The loss widened to $705 million from $426 million for the
same period a year earlier, the closely held company said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made
public today. Revenue fell 16 percent to $1.68 billion as the
company’s retail unit lost business and residential customers,
according to the filing.  Energy Future, facing a decline in natural-gas and power
prices, has sought to reduce its risk of default by extending
debt maturities and asking bondholders to swap their holdings at
discounted prices for new securities. In April, lenders agreed
to refinance about $17.8 billion in the company’s debt.  Interest and related charges rose by $179 million from a
year earlier to $1.3 billion for the quarter, consuming about 77
percent of revenue. Long-term debt rose by $517 million in the
quarter, reaching $40.2 billion as of June 30 for Energy Future
and its wholly owned power-delivery unit, Oncor Holdings,
according to the filing.  The company’s $1.87 billion of 10.25 percent bonds due
November 2015 have dropped 9.5 cents since July 7, when the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency directed 27 states including
Texas to reduce power-plant emissions.  Energy Future, formerly known as TXU Corp., was sold to a
group led by KKR & Co. LP and TPG Capital in 2007, in a $43.2
billion transaction.  Energy Future’s units include Oncor, a regulated power-line
business; TXU Energy, a retail electricity seller with more than
2 million customers; and Luminant, which owns more than 15,400
megawatts of generation capacity in Texas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
