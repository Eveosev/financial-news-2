Vietnam ’s bonds declined for a
second week on speculation demand from banks is decreasing as
their interest costs increase.  Interest rates  offered by local banks have risen to as high
as 19 percent for deposits of around 500 million dong ($24,295),
and may increase further as lenders try to lure depositors amid
high gold prices and accelerating inflation, Dau Tu newspaper
reported today, without citing a source. Dong interest rates in
the  interbank market  rose to 18 percent for six-month loans this
week, compared with 14 percent a week earlier, Dau Tu said.  “Many banks have had to raise interest rates to lure
depositors, and that made their funding costs swell,” said Pham
Minh Hoang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.  The yield on five-year notes climbed six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, this week to 12.51 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It was little
changed from yesterday.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,580 per dollar as of
4:41 p.m. in Hanoi, and was unchanged from the end of last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank fixed
the reference rate at 20,608, unchanged from July 11, according
to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
