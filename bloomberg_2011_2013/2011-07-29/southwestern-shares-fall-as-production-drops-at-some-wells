Southwestern Energy Inc., the
biggest natural-gas producer in  Arkansas ’ Fayetteville Shale,
fell after production declined at some of its wells in the
second quarter.  Southwestern fell $2.91, or 6.1 percent, to $44.56 at 4:18
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most
since October 2009.  Average initial production from wells that began flowing in
the second quarter was 7 percent lower than in the same quarter
of 2010, the company said in a statement yesterday. Overall,
Southwestern’s production rose 25 percent.  Southwestern has not set a date for a spinoff or sale of
its midstream pipeline unit, Chief Financial Officer Greg Kerley
said on a conference call today. The company said in February it
was reviewing strategic alternatives for the division.  There is “no real boost in growth,” Michael Bodino, head
of energy research for Global Hunter Securities LLC in  Fort
Worth ,  Texas , said in an e-mail. Bodino rates Southwestern a
“reduce” and owns none of its shares.  Southwestern yesterday reported net income of $167.5
million, or 48 cents a share, which was 4 cents more than the
average of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
