British taxpayers made a net profit
of 339.8 million pounds ($554.7 million) in the first half of
2011 from the assets they still hold in Bradford & Bingley Plc
and Northern Rock (Asset Management) Plc.  Bradford & Bingley’s net income for the six months to June
30 was 100.5 million pounds, according to government-owned bank
 U.K. Asset Resolution Ltd.  The bank’s first-half 2010 result of
645.1 million pounds was boosted by one-time items. NRAM posted
a 239.3 million pound profit, down from 358.8 million pounds in
the same period last year.  “Our aim is to maximize value for the taxpayer and we have
accelerated the repayment of government debt,” U.K. Asset
Resolution Chief Executive Officer Richard Banks said in the
statement. “We remain cautious about the future as there is
continuing pressure on household finances.”  U.K. Asset Resolution was formed in October 2010, taking
mortgages from Bradford & Bingley, which is closed to new
customers, and some from nationalized lender Northern Rock Plc.
The banks were taken over by the taxpayer in 2008 and now
operate separately, under a single board and management
structure. Northern Rock Plc operates as a separate company.  Costs at  NRAM  dropped 28 percent in the first six months,
while loan impairment charges fell by 105.7 million pounds to
171.9 million pounds. The number of NRAM accounts more than
three months in arrears rose 6 percent from the year end to
27,010, while at Bradford & Bingley the figure fell 16 percent
to 10,956.  Both companies get low rate loans from taxpayers. The
Treasury will take an additional 124 million pounds from
Bradford & Bingley during the remainder of 2011 by raising the
rate it charges the bank for funding, reducing future profit by
the same amount, the statement said.  NRAM repaid 1 billion pounds of its loan, reducing the
balance to 20.7 billion pounds at the half year. Bradford &
Bingley’s balance was unchanged from December 2010 at 27 billion
pounds.  U.K. Asset Resolution expects to pay back the majority of
the government loans in the next 10 years, Banks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
