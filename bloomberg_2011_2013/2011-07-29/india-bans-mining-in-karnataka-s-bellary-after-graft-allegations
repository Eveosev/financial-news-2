India ’s  top court  banned mining in
the mineral-rich area of Bellary in Karnataka two days after the
state’s chief minister was accused of accepting bribes from
companies illegally mining in the region.  The three-judge bench of the  Supreme Court  led by Chief
Justice S.H. Kapadia said in a ruling today that mining in an
area of 10,868 hectares in Bellary will be banned until further
notice. The judges also asked the  Ministry of Environment and
Forests  to confirm how much iron ore is needed to meet the
country’s needs.  Parts of Karnataka, India’s second-largest iron-ore
producing region, have been plagued by allegations that
companies have been mining illegally for the last decade. Miners
are accused of extracting the minerals and selling them without
a license, depriving the state of taxes.  Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has said he will
resign on July 31 after the state’s anti-graft ombudsman said a
mining company made a 100 million rupee ($2.2 million) donation
to a trust controlled by Yeddyurappa to gain favors.  It also said another mining company, in a separate deal,
paid more than 10 times the market value for a property owned by
the chief minister’s family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
