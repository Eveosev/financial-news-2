OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia ’s
largest mining company, said metals prices will climb higher
this year as debt woes in the U.S. and  Europe  stoke investor
demand for physical assets.  Nickel, copper, platinum and palladium will probably all
advance, driven more by demand from investors than from
industrially users, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Viktor Sprogis told reporters in Moscow today. The emergence of more
exchange-traded funds will also support prices, he said.  “We see a strong end to the year,” Sprogis said. Norilsk
reported second-quarter declines in all the metals it mines,
citing floods that disrupted shipping and refining.  Norilsk is seeking to buoy output by spending $20 billion
over two decades at a Stalin-era site in Siberia. CEO Vladimir Strzhalkovsky said in a June 8 interview that he may seek
acquisitions in Indonesia and  Latin America . The company may
team up with Amsterdam-based trader Trafigura Beheer BV to start
mining in regions where it isn’t operating, Sprogis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
