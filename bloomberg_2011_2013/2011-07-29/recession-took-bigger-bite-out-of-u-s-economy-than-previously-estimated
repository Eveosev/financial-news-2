The 2007-2009 recession gouged the
world’s largest economy more deeply than previously estimated
and the recovery lost momentum throughout 2010 before stalling
this year, revised figures show, painting a bleaker picture that
may raise concern over the outlook for U.S. growth.  Gross domestic product shrank 5.1 percent from the fourth
quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, compared with the
previously reported 4.1 percent drop, the Commerce Department
said today in  Washington . The second-worst contraction in the
post-World War II era was a 3.7 percent decline in 1957-58.  The depth of the economic slump better explains why the
jobless rate doubled, climbing from 5 percent at the start of
the downturn to a 26-year high 10.1 percent in October 2009. The
strongest quarter of the recovery is now the first three months
of last year. Growth decelerated every quarter thereafter.  “The overall recession is indeed deeper,” Steven Landefeld, director of the Commerce Department’s  Bureau of
Economic Analysis , told reporters this week. “This is the Great
Recession, the deepest one we’ve had in the post-WWII era.”  The economy expanded at a 1.3 percent annual rate from
April through June of this year, less than forecast, the
Commerce Department’s advance report for the second showed.
Growth in the prior three months was revised down to 0.4 percent
from 1.9 percent. At $13.27 trillion in the second quarter, GDP
has yet to surpass the pre-recession peak.  By the fourth quarter of 2009, the updated figures showed
GDP was $205.5 billion less than previously reported, a cut
equivalent to the size Ireland’s economy.  More Severe Recession  In 2008, the GDP contracted 0.3 percent rather than being
little changed as previously estimated. It shrank another 3.5
percent in 2009, rather than 2.6 percent, and grew 3 percent
last year, 0.1 percentage point more.  On a quarterly basis, the last three months of 2008 and
first three months of 2009 showed the biggest cuts to growth,
coinciding with the aftermath of the collapse of  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  The fourth quarter of 2008 now shows an 8.9
percent plunge in GDP, marking the steepest single-quarter
decline since 1958.  The deeper contractions in 2008 and 2009 were due to bigger
declines in consumer spending and business investment than
previously estimated.  Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of
the economy, shrank 1.9 percent in 2009, compared with a prior
estimate of 1.2 percent and the biggest contraction since 1942.  2010 Slowdown  The improved GDP reading for 2010 belies a marked slowdown
over the year. After expanding at a 3.9 percent annual pace in
the first three months, now the strongest quarter of the
recovery, growth cooled until reaching a 2.3 percent rate from
October through December.  Companies fared better and workers worse over the past
three years than previously estimated. Before-tax corporate
profits adjusted for the value of inventories and capital
depreciation were revised up by $264.9 billion over the period,
led by improved earnings at financial institutions.  After-tax personal income adjusted for inflation rose 0.6
percent on average from 2008 to 2010, half the 1.2 percent prior
estimate. It dropped 2.3 percent in 2009, revised from the last
reported 0.6 percent gain, marking the first decrease since 1974
and the biggest since 1947. The cut in income estimates
reflected reductions in dividends and interest payments.  Price measures including the  Federal Reserve ’s preferred
inflation gauge -- which tracks  consumer spending  and excludes
food and fuel -- were little changed during the 2008 to 2010
timeframe, the new figures showed. The so-called core PCE price
index rose 1.4 percent in 2010, the new figures show, compared
with 1.3 percent.  The revisions are part of the government’s annual updates
derived from broader, more complete, surveys. Data back to 2003
were subject to revisions, and some components were updated for
the entire history of the series, according to the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. The biggest changes took place over the past
three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
