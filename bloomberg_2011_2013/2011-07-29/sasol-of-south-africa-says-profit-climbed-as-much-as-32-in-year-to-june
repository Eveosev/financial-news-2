Sasol Ltd. (SOL) ,  South Africa ’s biggest
fuel company, said earnings excluding one-time items advanced as
much as 32 percent in the year through June.  Profitability improved after operational efficiencies
increased, costs were contained and fuel prices rose, the
Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement.  “Robust global commodity prices have countered the impact
of the strong rand,” it said.  The profit gain is provisional, and meets analyst
estimates. Sasol earned 26.44 rand ($3.91) a share a year
earlier and is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of
34.99 rand when it releases annual results Sept. 12, according
to the median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nine of the 14 analysts recommend buying the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
