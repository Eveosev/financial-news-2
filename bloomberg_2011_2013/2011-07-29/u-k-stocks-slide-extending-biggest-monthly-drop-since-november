U.K. stocks fell after a report
showed that the  U.S. economy  grew less than forecast in the
second quarter and as Republicans failed to muster support
within their party for a plan to raise the country’s debt limit.  Banking and mining stocks led the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lower with
Lloyds Banking Group Plc and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  losing more than
2 percent.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  declined 3.3 percent as earnings
trailed projections.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  surged 4 percent after
announcing a special dividend.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index declined 58.02, or 1 percent,
to 5,815.19 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending this
month’s drop to 2.2 percent. The gauge has slumped 4.5 percent
from this year’s high on Feb. 8 amid concern that  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis will derail the economic recovery. The
FTSE 100 dropped 2 percent this week. The FTSE All-Share Index
lost 0.9 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.1
percent.  “Certainly the continued delay is upsetting the markets,”
said Joshua Raymond, a market strategist at  City Index  in
London. “How can we expect the Republicans to forge a
compromise with the Democrats over what they’re going do if they
can’t agree among themselves over what the plan is?”  House Republicans called off the vote on their plan last
night as they failed to convince members of their own party to
back it.  If an agreement isn’t reached to lift the debt ceiling over
the weekend, “we’ll see a lot more volatile trade action on
Monday morning,” Raymond said.  U.S. GDP Growth  The FTSE 100 extended its losses after the U.S. Commerce
Department announced that the economy expanded at a 1.3 percent
annual pace in the second quarter. Economists had predicted
growth of 1.8 percent in a Bloomberg survey. The Commerce
Department revised growth in gross domestic product for the
first quarter down to 0.4 percent.  Lloyds, the U.K.’s biggest mortgage lender, slid 3.7
percent to 43.4 pence.  BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining
company, lost 2.3 percent to 2,273 pence.  Anglo American, part owner of the world’s biggest platinum
and diamond producers, slipped 3.3 percent to 2,900 pence. The
company said underlying earnings climbed to $3.1 billion, or
$2.58 a share. That fell short of the $2.63 mean estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News yesterday and a
consensus compiled by Anglo for $2.59 a share.  Vodafone, Pearson Rise  Vodafone jumped 4 percent to 172 pence, its biggest gain
since May 2010. Europe’s third-largest phone company by sales
said it will pay a 2 billion-pound ($3.3 billion) special
dividend after  Verizon Wireless , Vodafone’s U.S. venture, said
it will pay its first dividend since 2005.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA climbed 2
percent to 237.3 pence. The airline formed from the January
merger of British Airways and Iberia posted second-quarter
operating profit of 190 million euros ($273 million), beating
the average analyst estimate of four analysts for 166 million
euros.  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , Europe’s largest defense contractor and a
maker of the Eurofighter warplane, lost 0.9 percent to 304 pence
after it was downgraded to “neutral” from “outperform” at
Exane BNP Paribas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
