Russian RTS stock-index futures rose
as U.S. lawmakers sought to forge a deal to raise the country’s
debt limit and avoid a default before the Aug. 2 deadline.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September gained 0.8 percent to 197,210 yesterday.  Contracts on OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer,
rose 0.5 percent, and those on VTB Group, Russia’s second-
largest lender, advanced 0.5 percent. Futures on OAO Gazprom,
the world’s largest gas producer, gained 0.6 percent.  “A deal will be done even at one minute to midnight on
Tuesday,” Chris Weafer, chief strategist at ING Groep NV in
Moscow, said in an e-mailed report. “The majority of investors
expect a deal ahead of the default deadline.”  President  Barack Obama  said yesterday that Republicans and
Democrats are in “rough agreement” on their plans to raise the
nation’s debt limit. The Senate and House stood at odds, with
Senate leaders planning to kill the House proposal, and Obama
threatening a veto.  Crude for September delivery dropped $1.74, or 1.8 percent,
to $95.70 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , capping
its first weekly decline since June, as the U.S. economy grew
less than forecast in the second quarter.  U.S. gross domestic product climbed at a 1.3 percent annual
rate in the second quarter following a 0.4 percent gain in the
prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed in Washington.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 1.8 percent increase.  The euro strengthened 0.3 percent against the dollar to
$1.4381 at 4:25 p.m. yesterday in New York. U.S. stocks fell as
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 0.8 percent. The 30-
stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  declined 0.9 percent to 1,705.18 in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
