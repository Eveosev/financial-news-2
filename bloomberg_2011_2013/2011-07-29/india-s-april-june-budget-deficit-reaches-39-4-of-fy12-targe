India ’s budget deficit in the first
three months of the fiscal year that began April 1 reached 39.4
percent of the annual target, the government’s auditor said.  The deficit was 1.62 trillion rupees ($36.6 billion) in the
April-June period, compared with the annual target of 4.12
trillion rupees, the Controller General of Accounts  said  on its
website today. The deficit was 10.5 percent of the annual target
in the same period a year earlier.  India’s 10-year government bond yields have surged the most
in  Asia  this year, partly on concern slower economic growth and
higher  oil prices  may cause slippages in tax collections and
make it difficult for Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee to
reduce the  budget deficit . Mukherjee aims to trim the budget
deficit to a four-year low of 4.6 percent in the year ending
March 31.  “The fiscal consolidation exercise is clearly not on
expected lines and a deficit slippage looks imminent,” said Jay Shankar, chief economist at Religare Capital Markets Ltd. in
Mumbai. Shankar expects the deficit to be 5.6 percent of gross
domestic product in the fiscal year through March.  Ten-year bond yields in India have climbed 53 basis points
this year, Bloomberg data show. The yield on the 7.8 percent
government debt due April 2021, rose 14 basis points this week
to 8.45 today. The rupee weakened 0.3 percent to 44.19 a dollar.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao raised
interest rates by half a percentage point to 8 percent on July
26 and said achieving the 4.6 percent deficit-cut target has
become “more of a challenge” due to higher spending on
subsidies. “Fiscal consolidation is critical to managing
inflation.”  The $1.4 trillion economy may expand around 8 percent in
the fiscal year through March, compared with an 8.5 percent gain
in the previous year, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
