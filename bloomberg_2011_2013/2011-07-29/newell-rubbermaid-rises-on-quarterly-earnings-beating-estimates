Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL)  rose the most
in more than two years after the plastic-container maker
reported second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The maker of Rubbermaid containers and Sharpie pens surged
$1.15, or 8 percent, to $15.52 at 4 p.m. in  New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the biggest one-day gain since April
30, 2009. The Atlanta-based company reported earnings of 46
cents a share for the quarter ended June 30, compared with the
42-cent average projected by 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Michael B. Polk, who joined Newell
this month, said the company was lowering its full-year earnings
forecast by 5 cents to a range of $1.55 to $1.62. Newell has
faced slumping  consumer spending  that previously led the company
to close plants and invest in higher-margin brands such as
Calphalon cookware.  Polk’s forecast “put out expectations that were a little
bit better than a worst-case fear,” said Jason M. Gere, an New
York-based analyst with  RBC Capital Markets , in a telephone
interview today. “It provides a more pragmatic and realistic
case of the growth of the next two quarters.”  In June, the company slashed its earnings outlook to $1.60
to $1.67, lower than the average estimate of $1.69 by analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg at the time. The shares have fallen 15
percent this year.  Company News: NWL US Equity  To contact the reporter on this story:
