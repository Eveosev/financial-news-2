Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
appealed a judge’s order that it couldn’t recover an alleged
$11 billion “windfall” made by  Barclays Plc (BARC)  when the London-
based bank bought defunct Lehman’s North American business.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck signed final orders on
July 15 denying Lehman’s bid to recoup money from Barclays.
Lehman filed its notice of appeal yesterday.  Earlier this month, the trustee overseeing the liquidation
of Lehman’s brokerage appealed Peck’s ruling that awarded
Barclays $1.1 billion, while ordering Barclays to return
$2 billion in margin assets to the brokerage. Barclays has
appealed that part of the ruling.  The dispute, arising from Barclays’s September 2008
purchase of bankrupt Lehman’s businesses and subsequent profit
on them, led to a bankruptcy court trial in 2010 with more than
30 days of testimony. The trial pitted the third-biggest U.K.
bank against two defunct parts of what was once the fourth-
largest U.S. investment bank.  The main case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,
08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
