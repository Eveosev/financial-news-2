The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index fell for a fourth day to the lowest in almost eight months
as the U.S. debt-ceiling impasse hurt investor demand for risk
and  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG) ’s profit missed estimates.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slid as much as 1 percent to
1,163.8, its lowest since Dec. 6, and traded down 0.4 percent by
11:40 a.m. in Prague.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  dropped 1.6 percent to
3,779 koruna, heading for its lowest close in 11 months.  Global stocks declined, the Swiss franc and yen gained and
the cost of U.S. default insurance rose to the highest since
March 2009 as American lawmakers called off a vote to increase
the debt limit, a move needed to prevent a default. Moody’s
Investors Service said it may downgrade Spain’s debt rating.  “There have been no positive developments concerning the
U.S. debt ceiling and this morning’s decision by Moody’s to
place  Spain  under a review for a possible downgrade will not
help markets,” emerging-market strategists at BNP Paribas SA
led by London-based Bartosz Pawlowski wrote in a report today.  Erste fell as much as 1.7 percent after the Austrian bank
said today net income in the second quarter was 235.7 million
euros ($337 million). The average estimate of 14 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for 258 million euros. The stock last
traded down 0.6 percent at 797 koruna in Prague. In Vienna, its
home market, Erste slid 1 percent to 32.99 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
