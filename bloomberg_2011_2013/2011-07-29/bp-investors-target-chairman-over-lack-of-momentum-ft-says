Carl-Henric Svanberg, the chairman
of  BP Plc (BP/) , is being criticized by some investors over what they
see as a lack of strategic clarity and momentum by the  oil
company , the Financial Times reported, citing several
unidentified top-15 shareholders.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Dudley  is likely to meet
investors in the next few days, following the company’s
announcement on July 26 of its second-quarter results, the
newspaper said.  The substantial vote against William Castell, BP’s senior
independent director, at the annual meeting was really directed
at the chairman, the FT cited one of its informants as saying.  A quarter of shareholders’ votes were cast against Castell
at the April 14 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
