Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the world’s largest
maker of motor fuel from coal, had its lowest close in seven
months as a drop in  oil prices  outweighed the company’s forecast
that annual earnings per share increased.  The stock fell as much as 2.9 percent to 330.31 rand and
closed 1.2 percent lower at 335.90 rand at 5 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Oil for September delivery sank as much as 2.6
percent to $94.95 a barrel in  New York , bringing this week’s
loss to 3.8 percent, on concern a failure to reach a deal on
raising the U.S. debt limit may cause the nation to default,
threatening the economy of the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Sasol earlier said earnings per share excluding one-time
items increased as much as 32 percent. Sasol earned 26.44 rand
($3.91) a share a year earlier and is expected to report
adjusted earnings per share of 34.99 rand when it releases
annual results Sept. 12, according to the median estimate of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Jui Kulkarni, an analyst at Afrifocus Securities Pty Ltd.,
said Sasol’s forecast was higher than her estimates and the
recent decline in the oil price may be behind the fall in
Sasol’s shares.  “You have a market which is very well supplied and there
are demand questions cropping up again and again, not just from
the U.S. but also out of  Europe ,” Kulkarni said by telephone
from Mumbai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
