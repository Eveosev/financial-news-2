Jurgen Klinsmann, who led Germany to
a third-place finish at the 2006  World Cup , was named coach of
the U.S. men’s national soccer team.  Klinsmann, 46, replaces Bob Bradley, who was fired
yesterday after five years, U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati
announced on the team’s website. He will become the 35th coach
in the history of the program.  “We are excited to have Jurgen as the head coach of our
men’s national team,” Gulati said. “He is a highly
accomplished player and coach with the experience and knowledge
to advance the program. Jurgen has had success in many different
areas of the game and we look forward to the leadership he will
provide on and off the field.”  Klinsmann hasn’t coached since being fired by  Germany ’s
Bayern Munich club in April 2009. His first match with the U.S.
team will be against Mexico on Aug. 10 in Philadelphia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
