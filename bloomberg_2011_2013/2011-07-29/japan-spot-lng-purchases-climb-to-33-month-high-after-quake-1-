Japan , which suffered damage to its
nuclear and coal-fired power plants in the March 11 earthquake,
boosted Atlantic spot purchases of liquefied natural gas to a
33-month high in June to replace lost electricity generation.  The world’s biggest buyer of the fuel purchased at least
nine spot cargoes from Yemen,  Peru ,  Algeria ,  Nigeria  and
 Equatorial Guinea  last month compared with seven in May,
according to data from the country’s  Ministry of Finance  on its
website. The number of cargoes is the highest since September
2008 when Japan bought at least 11 cargoes, the data showed.  LNG prices are headed for a three-year high as Asian
purchases surge and Libyan supply disruptions boost European
fuel imports, with spot prices for the fuel rising by the fourth
quarter to $16 per million British thermal units, according to
the median estimate of seven analysts, traders and importers
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The fuel on spot terms delivered to Japan, the world’s
biggest buyer, averaged about $722 a ton, or $13.80 per million
British thermal units in June, from $12.50 in May, Japanese
customs data show.  Asian LNG typically trades at a premium to U.K. natural gas
prices. U.K. gas for December cost about 38 percent more than
August supplies, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
Month-ahead gas traded at 53.30 pence a therm yesterday,
equivalent to $8.70 per million British thermal units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
