India ’s rupee gained the most in a
month since March after foreign funds pumped cash into the
nation’s assets to take advantage of its yield advantage over
developed countries.  The currency has advanced 0.4 percent after the  Reserve
Bank  of India raised its repurchase rate to 8 percent from 7.5
percent on July 26, a move predicted by none of 22 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. India’s rate compares with a maximum 0.25
percent in the U.S. and Japan. Foreign investors raised holdings
of Indian debt by 4.7 percent this month through July 27 to a
record $21.7 billion, and bought $1.7 billion more local stocks
than they sold, according to exchange data.  “Right now, the  Indian rupee  gives the highest carry among
most of Asian currencies so it’s pretty attractive,” said
Kenneth Kan, the Singapore-based head of emerging markets
foreign-exchange trading at Credit Agricole CIB.  The rupee strengthened 1.1 percent this month to 44.19 per
dollar at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It rose 0.4 percent this week and pared gains by
0.3 percent today. The currency reached 43.8550 on July 27, the
highest level since Aug. 29, 2008.  India’s benchmark lending rate compares with 6.75 percent
in Indonesia and 3.25 percent in  South Korea .  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.65
per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.50
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
