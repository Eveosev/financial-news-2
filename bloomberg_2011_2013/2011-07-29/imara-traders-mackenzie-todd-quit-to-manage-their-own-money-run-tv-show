Imara Holdings Ltd. , which manages
about $368 million in assets in 14 African countries, will lose
derivatives traders Garth Mackenzie and  Andrew Todd  today as
they move to trading their own capital from home.  Both men have worked for Imara, based in Gaborone,
Botswana, for two years after moving from  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) ’s
BoE Stockbrokers Ltd. unit.  “We will not take on clients at this point, but will keep
running the Traders Corner  website  and TV show,” Mackenzie, 31,
said in a telephone interview in Johannesburg.  While at Imara, Mackenzie and Todd started a managed-
futures fund and agency-derivatives business.  “Garth and Andrew contributed quite a bit to the firm, but
we will not be replacing them,” Guy Algeo, a director at Imara
SP Reid, the company’s South African brokerage arm based in
Johannesburg, said in an interview. “We have hired four people
in addition to these two in the last two years and feel we are
comfortably placed for now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
