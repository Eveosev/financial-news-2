Hong Kong stocks dropped, led by
banks and exporters, after the U.S. Congress delayed a vote on a
plan to raise its borrowing limit, pushing the world’s biggest
economy to the brink of defaulting on its sovereign debt.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the largest supplier of toys and clothes to
retailers including Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., sank
5.5 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , a lender that gets more than 20
percent of revenue from  North America , declined 1 percent.  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  fell 1 percent as oil prices headed
toward a weekly decline.  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , an insurer, gained 3.4
percent after reporting a stronger-than-expected increase in
first-half profit.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.6 percent to 22,440.25 at the 4
p.m. close of trading in Hong Kong, paring its monthly advance
to 0.2 percent. About three times as many stocks declined as
advanced. The gauge’s losses deepened today after chief U.S.
House of Representatives vote counter Kevin McCarthy said there
would be no vote on Speaker John Boehner’s debt-limit plan
Thursday night.  “It’s unbelievable, these guys are not just playing with
financial markets but their own constituents’ jobs,” said
Sydney-based  Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management. “It’s certainly adding to stock-market nervousness.
I think they will eventually get a deal that avoids massive
spending cuts or default, but the risk is growing that they
won’t.”  Debt Wrangle  The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index, which tracks so-
called H shares of Chinese companies, dropped 1.2 percent to
12,373.64. The Hang Seng surged 2.6 percent last week, the
steepest gain among Asian benchmark indexes, as European leaders
took more steps toward easing that region’s sovereign debt
crisis, including providing fresh aid for Greece.  Stocks fell today as Republicans and Democrats continued
their wrangling over the debt ceiling. Obama administration
officials will brief the public on priorities for paying the
nation’s bills if the U.S. debt limit isn’t raised, a Democratic
Party official said in an e-mail yesterday.  Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has repeatedly said
the government’s authority to borrow will run out on Aug. 2
unless Congress raises the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3
percent today, indicating U.S. stocks will open lower.  Separately, Spain’s Aa2 ratings were today placed by
Moody’s Investors Service on review for a possible downgrade.  Banks Drop  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a global fashion retailer that gets
more than 80 percent of its revenue from Europe, fell 1.5
percent to HK$22.70.  Li & Fung dropped 5.5 percent to HK$12.96. Aluminum Corp.
of China Ltd., the listed unit of the nation’s biggest maker of
the lightweight metal, slumped 1 percent to HK$6.67.  Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Hong Kong’s largest carrier, lost 1.7
percent to HK$18.06.  HSBC declined 1 percent to HK$76.55.  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) 
slipped 1.4 percent to HK$3.59.  “Markets have been forced to seriously contemplate the
unthinkable, a U.S debt default,” said  Tim Schroeders , who
helps manage $1 billion in global equities at Pengana Capital
Ltd. in Melbourne. Stock markets have “continued to push lower
as nervousness amongst investors intensifies.”  China Petroleum slid 1 percent to HK$7.69. PetroChina Co.,
the nation’s largest oil company, fell 1.4 percent to HK$11.04
and  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  lost 0.3 percent to HK$17.42.  Oil headed for the first weekly decline in five weeks on
concern a failure to reach a deal on raising the debt limit may
cause the U.S. to default, threatening the economy of the
world’s biggest crude consumer. Crude oil for September delivery
fell as much as 0.8 percent today on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101) , a Hong Kong developer that
focuses on building shopping malls in China, slumped 4.2 percent
to HK$28.80, the lowest in more than a year, after saying full-
year profit excluding gains from revaluations fell 59 percent on
fewer home sales in the city.  Among the stocks that climbed today, AIA Group gained 3.4
percent to HK$28.65. The insurer posted first-half net income of
$1.3 billion, beating the $1.09 billion average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  Developer Rises  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16)  gained 0.8 percent to
HK$118.60 after its Pacific Earth Enterprise Ltd. unit won a
tender for a residential site in Hong Kong’s Tung Chung district,
according to  Radio Television Hong Kong , which didn’t say where
it got the information.  Futures on the Hang Seng retreated 1.2 percent. The HSI
Volatility Index rose 9 percent to 21.43. The benchmark gauge
for Hong Kong stock options indicates traders expect a swing of
6.1 percent in the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  in the next 30 days.  The Hang Seng index has retreated 2.6 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 3.4 percent by the S&P 500 and a drop of
3.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Hong
Kong benchmark are valued at 12.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500 and 10.9 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
