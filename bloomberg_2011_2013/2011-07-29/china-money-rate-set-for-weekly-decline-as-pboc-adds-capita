China ’s money-market rate declined
this week as the central bank injected capital into the
financial system to help ease a cash shortage.  The People’s Bank of China added a net 32 billion yuan ($5
billion) this week, compared with 19 billion yuan in the five
days through July 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank didn’t offer any repurchase agreements and kept
yields on bills unchanged for a fourth week.  “It’s a bit easier to borrow money in the  interbank
market ,” said Xu Dazhu, a bond trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan,
capital of eastern Shandong province. “There is a chance that
the seven-day repurchase rate may fall below 5 percent next
month.”  The seven-day repo rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, dropped 31 basis points this week to 5.10 percent
as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.
The rate rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
today.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined four
basis points to 4.17 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It fell three basis points for the week.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
