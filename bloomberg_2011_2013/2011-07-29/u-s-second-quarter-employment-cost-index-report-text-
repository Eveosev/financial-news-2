costs) increased 0.4 percent, and benefits (which make up the
remaining 30 percent of compensation) increased 1.3 percent.  Civilian Workers  Compensation costs for civilian workers increased 2.2 percent
for the 12-month period ending June 2011. A year earlier -- in
June 2010 -- the increase was 1.9 percent. Wages and salaries

the June 2010 increase of 2.4 percent. Employer costs for
health benefits increased 3.6 percent for the 12-month period
ending June 2011. In June 2010, the 12-month percent change

private industry workers for the 12-month period ending June
2011 ranged from 1.8 percent for service occupations to 2.7

occupations.  Among industry supersectors, compensation cost increases for
private industry workers for the current 12-month period
ranged from 1.1 percent for leisure and hospitality to 3.3

in June 1982 -- have ranged from 1.7 percent in both June 2010
and the current reference period to 9.6 percent in June 1982.
Wages and salaries increased 1.2 percent for the 12-month

be released on Friday, October 28, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  Some Employment Cost Index estimates from June 2009 through
September 2010 were corrected on January 18, 2011.  (In some
of the seasonally adjusted series, corrections were made to
estimates back to June 2005.) For further information, see:
www.bls.gov/bls/eci_corrections_111910.htm  TECHNICAL NOTE  The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures the change in
the cost of labor, free from the influence of employment
shifts among occupations and industries. Detailed information
on survey concepts, coverage, and methods can be found in BLS
Handbook of Methods, Chapter 8, "National Compensation
Measures," Bureau of Labor Statistics, on the Internet at
www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch8.pdf.  Sample size  Data for the June 2011 reference period were collected
from a probability sample of approximately 62,100 occupational
observations selected from a sample of about 12,700
establishments in private industry and approximately 11,500
occupations from a sample of about1,800 establishments in
State and local governments.  Health insurance data  Data from the ECI that provide 12-month percent changes
in employer costs for health insurance in private industry are
available at www.bls.gov/ect/sp/echealth.pdf.  Historical listings  Historical listings that provide all ECI data are
available at www.bls.gov/ect/#tables. Included among these
listings is one that provides continuous occupational and
industry series. This listing uses the Standard Industrial
Classification Manual and Census of Population series through
2005 and the North American Industry Classification System and
Standard Occupational Classification from 2006 to the present.
It provides the official series from the beginning of the ECI
in 1975 through the current quarter. For more information on
the criteria used in defining continuous series, see the
article published in the Monthly Labor Review at
www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2006/04/art2full.pdf.  Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data  The costs per hour worked of compensation components,
based on data from the ECI, are published in a separate news
release titled "Employer Costs for Employee Compensation"
(ECEC). The next ECEC release is scheduled for 10:00 a.m.
(EDT), Thursday, September 8, 2011. Historical ECEC data are
available in summary documents. Since the ECEC is calculated
with current employment weights rather than the fixed weights
used in computing the ECI, year-to-year changes in the cost
levels usually differ from those in the ECI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
