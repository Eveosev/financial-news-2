French  consumer spending  on
manufactured goods climbed for the first time in four months
in June on expectations that growth will pick up after almost
stalling in the second quarter.  Household spending on manufactured products increased 1.1
percent, after declining a revised 1.2 percent in May,
national statistics office Insee said today in an e-mailed
statement from Paris. The median estimate of 10 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 0.8 percent.  The increase suggests that demand may rebound in the
second half as a surge in energy prices subsides and leaves
consumers with more disposable income. The improved purchasing
power helped generate an unexpected increase in  consumer
confidence  in July, the first this year, even after
joblessness increased.  Consumers have “a better financial situation, most
likely a combination of a decline in energy prices and a drop
in consumption since last March,” said  Dominique Barbet , an
economist at BNP Paribas in Paris. The improved confidence
“opens the prospect of a rebound” in spending in the third
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
