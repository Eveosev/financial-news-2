South Africa  posted a trade surplus
of 4.9 billion rand ($725 million) in June, the biggest in six
months, as it earned more from exports of gold, platinum,  iron
ore  and coal.  The surplus compared with a deficit of 1 billion rand in
May, the Pretoria-based South African Revenue Service said in an
e-mailed statement today. The median estimate of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1 billion-rand surplus.  “Gold and platinum accounted for the bulk of the jump,”
Andrew Fisher, an executive at the revenue service, said by
phone today. “Iron ore also fetched good prices.”  Exports increased 7.5 percent to 60.6 billion rand in June
from the previous month as shipments of precious and semi-
precious stones and metals jumped by 2.1 billion rand, or 14
percent, the revenue service said. Mineral product exports
advanced 7 percent in the month, while vegetable product exports
rallied 39 percent.  Imports fell 2.9 percent to 55.7 billion rand in the
period, mainly due to a decline in mineral products and
vehicles, it said.  Trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of
shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
