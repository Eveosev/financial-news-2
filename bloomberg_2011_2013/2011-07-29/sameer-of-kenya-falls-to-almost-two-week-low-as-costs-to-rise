     July 29 (Bloomberg) --  Sameer Africa Ltd. (SAME)  fell to an almost
two-week low after the Nairobi-based tiremaker said costs were
likely to rise in the second half of this year.  The shares retreated for a second day, losing 2 percent to
4.8 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, the
weakest level since July 19.  An “increase in costs of energy, power rationing and the
continued weakening of regional currencies will continue to
remain a challenge to business performance for the balance of
the year,” it said in a statement yesterday.  Uganda  and Kenya’s currencies are the second- and third-
worst performers worldwide against the dollar this year as
inflation in both nations surged on higher food and fuel costs.
 Kenya  Power Ltd., the sole electricity distributor in East
Africa’s biggest economy, started scheduled outages on July 27
amid a shortage caused by a lack of infrastructure and machine
breakdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
