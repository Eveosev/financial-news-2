The rate at which European banks say
they see each other lending for a week fell to the lowest in
more than three weeks, according to the European Banking
Federation, as  bank deposits  with the central bank surged.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, fell four
basis points to 1.212 percent today, the lowest since July 6,
EBF data today show. One-month Euribor declined to 1.433
percent, the lowest since July 11.  “There seems to be ample liquidity in the system,” said
 Luca Jellinek , the London-based head of European interest-rate
strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.
“This can perhaps be explained partly by an increase in short-
term bank deposits with the  European Central Bank  as people seek
safety amid uncertainty in the U.S. and in the euro zone.”  Banks deposited 47 billion euros ($67 billion) with the
ECB’s overnight facility yesterday, compared with 32 billion
euros a week ago and 10 billion euros on July 15, according to
ECB data.  U.S. lawmakers have failed to reach an agreement on a plan
to raise the country’s debt ceiling to avert default. The
government says the Treasury’s borrowing authority runs out Aug.
2 and that it may not be able to pay all of its bills after that
date unless the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit is raised.  In  Europe , Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut
 Spain ’s credit rating further as its regions struggle to cut
budget shortfalls and last week’s Greek bailout increases the
risk that bondholders will have to pay for further European
rescues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
