News Corp.’s Fox Sports asked a U.S.
bankruptcy judge to stop the  Los Angeles  Dodgers from hiring
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  to help the baseball team arrange a cable-
television rights deal.  Fox Sports New West 2 LLC, which does business as Prime
Ticket, said in a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Delaware that it has the rights to the games through the 2013
season and that its agreement with the Dodgers includes a
negotiation timeline that conflicts with the proposed hiring of
Blackstone to sell the rights.  “The current employment of Blackstone for that purpose is
premature, and such employment should be denied or deferred,”
lawyers for Fox Sports said in the filing.  Bruce Bennett , a lawyer for the Dodgers, didn’t immediately
return a call to his office seeking comment.  The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy last month after Major
League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig named a monitor to
oversee the team’s day-to-day operations and rejected a proposed
television-rights deal with Fox Sports.  News Corp. (NWSA)  and
Blackstone are both based in New York.  The bankruptcy case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-
12010, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
