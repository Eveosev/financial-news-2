China , the world’s biggest energy
user, asked  power plants  to increase coal imports to ensure
maximum generation to meet summer demand.  Major power stations in China held a total 65 million
metric tons of thermal coal inventories as of July 27,
equivalent to 16 days of consumption, the National Development
and Reform Commission  said  on its website today.  China’s southern regions may face temperatures of up to 39
degrees Celsius in the near term, exacerbating electricity
supply tightness as residents increase use of air-conditioners,
the NDRC said. Electricity load from using the air coolers this
summer may expand by 13 percent, accounting for a quarter of
maximum load, the top economic planning agency said.  The country’s eastern, central, northern and southern areas
may have 40 gigawatts of power shortage this summer, the China
Electricity Council said in a  separate statement  today. Twelve
Chinese provinces had to restrict power supplies in early and
mid-July, NDRC said.  China’s power demand may rise 12 percent to 4.7 trillion
kilowatt-hours this year, China Electricity Council, a trade
association comprising members including the nation’s two grid
operators and five state-owned power producers, said.  Generation capacity may increase by 85 gigawatts to 1,050
gigawatts by the end of the year, the council said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
