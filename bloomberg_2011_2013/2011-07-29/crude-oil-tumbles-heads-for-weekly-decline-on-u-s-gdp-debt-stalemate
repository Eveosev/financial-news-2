Oil fell, capping its first weekly
drop since June, as the  U.S. economy  grew less than estimated in
the second quarter and a deadlock of U.S. lawmakers over raising
the debt limit further threatened expansion.  Futures tumbled 1.8 percent after the Commerce Department
reported that gross domestic product climbed at a 1.3 percent
annual rate, less than the 1.8 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The Treasury Department
has set an Aug. 2 deadline for increasing the U.S.’s $14.3
trillion debt limit to avert a default.  “The markets have been negative all week as we continue to
watch the stalled debt ceiling talks,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker
with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. “The GDP
number missed expectations and that’s created more pressure on
oil and equities.”  Crude for September delivery fell $1.74 to $95.70 a barrel,
the lowest settlement since July 18. Prices tumbled 4.2 percent
this week and rose 28 cents in July, the first monthly increase
since April.  Brent for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange dropped 62 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$116.74 a barrel. The European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $21.04 a barrel to  New York  futures, compared with a
record close of $22.63 on July 14. Brent fell 1.6 percent this
week and gained 3.8 percent in July.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to
1,296.93, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 57.44
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,182.67.  Technical Support Breach  Crude in New York settled below its 50-day moving average
for the first time since July 19, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A breach of the technical-support level, at $97.31
today, usually means prices will continue to fall.  U.S. GDP increased following a 0.4 percent gain in the
prior quarter that was less than the 1.9 percent previously
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . Household purchases, about 70 percent of the
economy, rose 0.1 percent in the second quarter. The U.S. is the
world’s largest oil-consuming country.  House Speaker  John Boehner , a Republican, delayed a planned
vote on debt-limit legislation late yesterday as Senate leaders
stood ready to kill the measure should it get to their chamber.
Boehner’s plan failed to gain enough backing from his own party
members. He plans to take his proposal to the chamber at 6 p.m.
Washington time today, Republican leaders announced.  Debt Vote  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  and other Democrats are
working to break the impasse over raising the debt limit by
devising a strict enforcement mechanism to guarantee future
deficit savings, according to party officials. President  Barack Obama  said today that the two parties are in “rough agreement”
on a debt measure and urged senators from both parties to work
together to resolve the deadlock.  “The U.S. debt talk resembles a train wreck,” Thorbjoern Bak Jensen, an analyst at Global Risk Management, said by phone
from Middelfart,  Denmark . “Oil is still awaiting the debt
ceiling outcome.”  Oil inventories in Cushing,  Oklahoma , the physical delivery
point for Nymex futures, rose by 583,000, or 1.6 percent, to
36.9 million barrels on July 26 from July 16, according to data
compiled by  DigitalGlobe Inc. (DGI)  from satellite images.  The Energy Department said July 27 that Cushing stockpiles,
including floating and fixed tanks, were 37.1 million. The hub
has working storage capacity of 48 million barrels, the
department said on May 31.  OPEC Production  Crude production from the 12 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries jumped 245,000 barrels a day in
July from June to 29.6 million barrels a day, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of producers,  oil companies  and industry
analysts. The 11 members with output quotas, all but  Iraq ,
pumped 26.8 million barrels a day in July, up 230,000 barrels a
day from June.  Tropical Storm Don, currently in the northwestern  Gulf of
Mexico  and heading for the  Texas  coastline, has shut in about 12
percent of oil and 6.2 percent of gas production from the gulf,
according to the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation
and Enforcement.  The storm will make landfall late today or early tomorrow
and the move across southern Texas, the National Hurricane
Center in Miami said in a bulletin at 1 p.m. local time. Don is
about 145 miles (235 kilometers) southeast of  Corpus Christi ,
Texas, with maximum winds of 50 miles per hour, it said.  Crude may drop next week, a Bloomberg News survey showed.
Thirteen of 32 respondents, or 41 percent, forecast oil will
decrease through Aug. 5. Analysts were split last week, with 41
percent looking for a gain and 41 percent projecting a fall.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 422,579
contracts as of 3:40 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 426,749
contracts yesterday, 31 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.51 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
