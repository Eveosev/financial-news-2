Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s biggest refiner,
has no plans to break out its refining business from the rest of
the company, the finance chief said.  “As far as we are concerned we are an integrated
company,” Chief Financial Officer Patrick de la Chevardiere
said on a conference call about second-quarter earnings. “We
see some benefit in that and there is nothing in the pipeline to
break up the company today.”  ConocoPhillips (COP)  said earlier this month it will spin off its
crude processing operations in the first half of 2012 to focus
on exploration and production. Its plan follows a similar move
announced by Marathon Oil Corp. at the start of the year. Total
has now exceeded a target of reducing global refining capacity
by a fifth, de la Chevardiere said today.  The French  oil company  was on the verge of selling its
Lindsey refinery in the U.K. until the potential buyer was
refused financing for the deal, he said. Total has reopened
talks with another potential acquirer.  “It is extremely difficult to sell a refinery today,” he
said. “We will try to secure something by the end of this
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
