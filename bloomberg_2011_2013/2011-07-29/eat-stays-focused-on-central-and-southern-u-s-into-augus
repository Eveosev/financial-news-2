The central U.S. will continue to
bake under hotter-than-normal weather into mid-August, while the
northern Plains and Northeast may get some relief, said  Matt Rogers , President of  Commodity Weather Group LLC .  Rogers has been tracking the potential cooling that would
spread from Minnesota into  New York  and New England from Aug. 8
to Aug. 12 for several days. Today he said the computer forecast
models may be “overdoing this heat retreat to some extent.”  As a result, he said he expects the heat that has been
setting record in the center of the U.S. to continue through the
6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day forecast periods covering Aug. 3
to Aug. 12.  Natural gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling needs. Excessive
heat warning and watches cover parts of Kansas,  Oklahoma  and
Missouri, according to the National Weather Service. In
addition, heat advisories stretch from Texas to southern  New
Jersey , according to the weather service.  The temperature in  Fort Smith , Arkansas, reached 104
degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) yesterday. It was the 24th day
in a row temperatures reached higher than 100, extending a
record. The old record of 17 days was set in 1934, according to
the weather service office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since June 24,
the high temperature in Fort Smith has been below 100 only three
times.  At  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport  the temperature
has reached at least 100 for the last 27 days, according to the
weather service. In San Angelo,  Texas , the thermometer has
reached 100 degree 63 times this year, which is a new record. In
Abilene, Texas, that has happened 49 times, also a record. The
old records were set in 1969 and 1934, respectively, according
to the weather service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
