Aggreko Plc (AGK) , a British supplier of
power generators, won a contract to set up a 60 megawatts plant
in Western Kenya that might alleviate an electricity shortage in
the east African nation, the Business Daily said.  The company, which has been operating in Kenya since 2000,
submitted a bid of $16.22 per kilowatt hour per month, compared
to a $21 per kilowatt hour proposal by the second lowest bidder,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing  Permanent Secretary  in
the Ministry of Energy Patrick Nyoike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
