Mauritius’s central bank will
probably maintain “very prudent” monetary policy as the
average inflation rate climbs, Bank of Mauritius Governor
Rundheersing Bheenick said.  Inflation for the 12 months through June averaged 5.1
percent compared with 4.8 percent a month earlier, Bheenick said
in a transcript of an interview published in the Port Louis-
based l’Express newspaper today.  “The dynamics are still pointing up, which means that the
central bank will have to maintain its very prudent stand.”  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee raised the
benchmark  interest rate  twice this year to 5.5 percent. The
average inflation rate has climbed from 1.7 percent in June last
year after annual inflation accelerated for six months to peak
at 7.2 percent in March due to higher food and fuel prices. It
was at 6.6 percent in June, according to the  Bank of Mauritius .
The Indian Ocean island nation is a net importer of food and
motor fuels.  Since 2007, the central bank has diversified its currency
holdings, moving away from the dollar, euro and pound into
commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, the  New
Zealand dollar , the Norwegian Krone and the Swedish Krone,
Bheenick said.  “We are looking at the South African rand, the renminbi,
and Indian and Chinese bonds as well, to diversify our
reserves,” he said. “We are diversifying like mad.”  The Mauritian rupee weakened for a second consecutive day,
depreciating 0.9 percent to 28.15 against the dollar by 11:40
a.m. in  Port Louis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
