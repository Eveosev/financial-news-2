Eolia Renovables de Inversion SCR
SA, a Spanish renewable-energy developer, received 153.3 million
euros ($218 million) in financing to build three wind parks in
the northeastern region of Catalonia.  The company will use the funds to develop wind projects
with 111.5 megawatts of combined capacity in Lleida, western
Catalonia, Eolia said in an e-mailed statement. The financing is
split into loans of 127 million euros and 26.3 million euros, it
said, declining to disclose terms when contacted by telephone.  Six European banks -- CaixaBank,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,  Banco Espanol de Credito SA (BTO) , WestLB AG,  Banco de
Sabadell SA (SAB)  and Bankia SAU -- provided the funds, according to
the July 27 statement. Construction of the wind parks will start
immediately, Eolia said, without specifying a completion date.  The Madrid-based developer has 19 wind farms and seven
solar plants operating in  Europe , according to its  website .
 Spain  has more than 15,000 megawatts of commissioned onshore
wind projects, the most of any European country, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
