Dug into trenches behind massive
rows of barbed wire at Loos,  France , the Germans couldn’t
believe their eyes on Sept. 26, 1915.  British troops were walking toward them across no man’s
land. They opened fire with machine guns located in protected
bunkers.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The 10,000 advancing soldiers began falling, and soon their
comrades were walking on top of the dead and wounded, slipping
and sliding in the mud and the blood. Too numerous to be buried,
the bodies festered until rats picked the skeletons clean.  Fighting continued for several more weeks, and by the end,
there were more than 61,000 Allied casualties and no real gains.  The British generals who ordered the massacre later
downplayed the efficacy of the newfangled machine gun in a memo
to the Ministry of Munitions, saying it had not “altered the
universally accepted principle that superior numbers of bayonets
closing with the enemy is what finally turns the scale.”  Even in 1918, British forces still had only one machine gun
for every 61 men.  I spoke with Adam Hochschild, author of “To End All Wars:
A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion,” on the following topics:  1. Murderous Folly  2. Loyalty and Rebellion  3. Propaganda Effort  4. Trench Warfare  5. Industrial Combat  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
