OAO Inter RAO UES,  Russia ’s state-
controlled power exporter, surged to its highest in more than
three months after MSCI Inc. said it would move the stock to its
large cap segment following a share placement in May.  Inter RAO shares rallied 4.7 percent to 3.98 kopeks by the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the strongest level since April 11.  The company’s shares will migrate to the large cap segment
of the MSCI Global Standard Indices from its mid cap segment by
the close of August 4, MSCI said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  Inter RAO’s higher weighting will probably lead to inflows
of $50 million to $60 million for the stock, Peter Szopo, head
of research at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow, said in an e-mailed report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
