Evolution Group Plc (EVG) , a London-based
stockbroker, said first-half profit climbed 12 percent as funds
under management increased.  Net income rose to 2.7 million pounds ($4.4 million)
through June 30 from 2.4 million pounds in the year-earlier
period, Evolution said in a statement today. Funds under
management reached 6 billion pounds, an increase of 17 percent.  “The first half of 2011 has been good for the group,”
Chief Executive Officer Alex Snow said in the statement. “We
are well on track to fulfill our strategic aim of achieving 10
billion-pounds assets under management.”  The firm said this month that Williams de Broe, its wealth-
management unit, is in talks to acquire BNP Paribas Private
Investment Management Ltd.  “The discussion is progressing well,” Finance Director
Andrew Westenberger said in a phone interview. The company is
also looking for more acquisition opportunities to develop its
investment business and expects to hire more fund managers this
year after recruiting 10 in the first half, he said.  Evolution’s shares were up 2.7 percent to 76.5 pence at
12:07 p.m. in  London  trading, giving the company a market value
of 178 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
