Daiichi Sankyo Co.,  Japan ’s second-
largest drugmaker, raised its full-year profit forecast by 11
percent helped by lower tax charges at its Indian unit and asset
sales.  Net income will be 50 billion yen ($645 million) in the
year ending March 31, 2012, Daiichi Sankyo said in a statement
to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The Tokyo-based company said
fiscal first-quarter profit fell 24 percent to 25.3 billion yen.  Daiichi Sankyo declined 1.3 percent to 1,586 yen in Tokyo
trading at 1:06 p.m. local time, the biggest fall since June 27.
The benchmark Topix index shed 0.6 percent.  Daiichi Sankyo, which has a 64 percent stake in India’s
 Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) , accounts for the Indian unit’s
earnings with a lag of one quarter. Ranbaxy,  India ’s biggest
drugmaker, is scheduled to report second-quarter profit next
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
