Chile ’s peso fell for the first time
in four days as copper tumbled after U.S. lawmakers failed to
agree on increasing the debt ceiling, raising concern that a
default could lead to a drop in demand for the metal.  The peso decreased 0.2 percent to 457.05 pesos per U.S.
dollar at 9:35 a.m. New York time, from 456.38 yesterday. The
currency has gained 1 percent this week.  “The main factor affecting the Chilean peso today is the
uncertainty on a global level about the negotiations to increase
the debt ceiling in the U.S., which is generating more  risk
aversion  amongst investors,” Sergio Tricio, head of research at
ForexChile, said in a phone interview from Santiago. “Copper is
also falling, which is further weakening the peso.”  Republicans led by House Speaker  John Boehner  were forced
to scrap action late last night on passing legislation that is
headed for a Senate roadblock. The Treasury Department has set
an Aug. 2 deadline for raising the $14.3 trillion debt limit to
avert a default. Moody’s Investors Service said it may lower
Spain’s sovereign credit rating.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, tumbled
1.1 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, was unchanged at 5.61 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
