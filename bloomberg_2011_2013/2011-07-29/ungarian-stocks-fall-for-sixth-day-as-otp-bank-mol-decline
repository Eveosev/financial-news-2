Hungarian shares rallied, snapping
five days of losses, on speculation U.S. lawmakers may reach a
deal to avoid a federal default, lifting demand for riskier
assets.  The benchmark BUX index of shares rallied 1.4 percent to
21,617.93 by the 5 p.m. end of trade in Budapest, the first gain
since July 21 and paring losses this week to 1.3 percent. Mol
Nyrt., the country’s largest refiner, rose 2.3 percent and
Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., the biggest drugmaker which exports
products to the U.S., advanced 3.3 percent. The BUX gauge
earlier today fell as much as 1.5 percent.  The U.S. House plans to vote on Republicans’ two-step debt-
limit plan today, and lawmakers said it will have enough votes
to pass. Representative Patrick Tiberi, a Republican from  Ohio ,
said more members of the House were supporting Boehner’s plan to
raise the debt ceiling and Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican,
said he now supports Boehner’s plan and believes it has enough
votes to pass.  To contact the reporter on this story:
