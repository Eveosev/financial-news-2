Roger Altman , a former U.S. deputy
Treasury secretary and the founder of  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) ,
said he doesn’t expect the U.S. to default if Congress misses
raising the debt ceiling by an Aug. 2 deadline.  “As long as you’re timely on interest payments and on
principal payments, then you are not in default under any
definition,” Altman said today in an interview with Betty Liu
on Bloomberg Television.  The Treasury Department has set the Aug. 2 deadline for
raising the $14.3 trillion debt limit to avoid default. House
Republicans are considering rewriting legislation to raise the
debt ceiling after being forced to abort action on the measure
late last night.  “We have today a political crisis in Washington, we do not
have a financial crisis,” said Altman, 64, chairman of the New
York-based investment bank who served as deputy Treasury
secretary under President  Bill Clinton .  To contact the reporters on this story:
