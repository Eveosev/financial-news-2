Inflation in  Uganda  accelerated to
the fastest pace in 18 years this month as food prices surged,
raising the prospect that the central bank may raise  interest
rates  next week.  The inflation rate climbed to 18.7 percent in July, the
highest since February 1993, from a revised 15.7 percent in
June, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said in a statement handed
to reporters today in Kampala, the capital. Prices rose 2.2
percent in the month, it said.  The data means there is “a high likelihood that the Bank of
Uganda will raise the central  bank rate  next week,” Mark
Bohlund, senior economist at IHS Global Insight in  London , said
in an e-mailed note today. “The 18.7 percent reading is
considerably higher than the 12-14 percent the central bank said
it was expecting in the third quarter.  Last month, Uganda’s central bank introduced a new
benchmark interest rate, which it set at 13 percent. The bank
also plans to introduce inflation targeting in the fiscal year
through June 2012, aiming for annual price growth of 7 percent
in the first three years of the program. The central bank is
scheduled to announce its latest monetary policy stance in
 Kampala  on Aug. 2.  Food costs jumped 40.6 percent in the month compared with a
33.4 percent increase in June, as the cost of corn flour, sugar,
bread and potatoes increased, the statistics bureau said.  “The near-term inflation outlook will continue to be
determined by the food-supply situation, where Uganda has been
considerably harder hit than neighboring Rwanda and Tanzania,”
Bohlund said. He forecast inflation would average 14.3 percent
in 2011.  Uganda’s shilling is Africa’s worst-performing currency
this year after weakening 12 percent against the dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shilling weakened
0.2 percent to 2,605 at 5:03 p.m. in Kampala today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
