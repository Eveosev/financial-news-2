ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s second-
largest lender, said first-quarter profit rose 30 percent after
credit expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years and bad
loans declined.  Net income increased to 13.3 billion rupees ($301 million),
or 11.51 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30, from
10.3 billion rupees, or 9.16 rupees, a year earlier, the Mumbai-
based bank said in a statement to exchanges. That compares with
the 13.7 billion rupee median of 28 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Chanda Kochhar  has delivered
earnings growth for six straight quarters after the steepest
increase in  interest rates  among major Asian economies failed to
deter Indian companies from borrowing. ICICI’s reluctance to
match the central bank’s move and raise its deposit rates also
helped the lender boost profit.  The bank’s net interest income is “higher” than
estimates, said Abhijit Majumder, an analyst at Prabhudas
Lilladher Pvt. in Mumbai. “ICICI didn’t get into offering high
deposit rates when other banks were doing so.”  ICICI Bank rose 1.9 percent to 1,036.75 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai, making it the second-best performing stock
in the MSCI  India /Financials Index.  Credit Forecast  Kochhar today cut her forecast for credit growth three days
after India’s central bank surprised all 22 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News with a half-point increase in the repurchase
rate. She expects lending to expand 18 percent in the year to
March 31, from her previous forecast of 20 percent  Provisions at ICICI increased 17 percent to 4.5 billion
rupees, compared with 3.83 billion rupees in the March quarter.
Non-performing loans dropped to 0.9 percent of total loans from
1.6 percent in the June quarter the previous year, the bank
said.  “Provisions have moved up on a quarterly basis, after
seven quarters of declines, which is a concern,” said  Brian Hunsaker , an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in  Hong Kong .
“There’s still a lot of downside risk to loan growth for Indian
banks over the next year. Even the 18 percent estimate looks
optimistic.”  India’s outstanding bank loans climbed 20 percent as of
June 24 from a year earlier, according to data compiled by the
central bank. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao on July 26 cut the
projection for bank credit growth to 18 percent from 19 percent
for the year ending in March 2012.  Treasury Income  Interest income rose 31 percent to 76 billion rupees in the
quarter. The period’s figures include the full cost of operating
expenses for its Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. acquisition, Kochhar
said. The numbers also reflected the impact of an 11 percent
salary increase to employees, Kochhar told reporters on a
conference call.  ICICI Bank’s total outstanding loans increased 20 percent
to 2.2 trillion rupees at the end of June. Deposits grew 18
percent to 668 billion rupees, the bank said in a statement.  ICICI Bank’s income from fees for distribution of mutual
funds and investments rose 12 percent to 15.8 billion rupees,
according to the statement. Treasury income, or income from
trading in bonds and currencies, posted a loss of 250 million
rupees, compared with a profit of 1 billion rupees in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
