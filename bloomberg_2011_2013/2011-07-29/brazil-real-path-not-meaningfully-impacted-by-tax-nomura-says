The Brazilian government’s new tax
on bets against the dollar in the country’s futures market won’t

to long term,  Tony Volpon , a Latin America strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc., said on a call with reporters.  Volpon reaffirmed his forecast for the real of 1.57 per
dollar for the end of this year and 1.50 for the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
