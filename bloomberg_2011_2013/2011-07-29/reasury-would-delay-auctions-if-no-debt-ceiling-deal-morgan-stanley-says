The Treasury would delay quarterly
auctions of U.S. notes and bonds if there isn’t an extension of
the nation’s debt ceiling before next week’s scheduled
announcement of the sales, according to Morgan Stanley.  The U.S. would consider selling cash-management bills as a
substitute, Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients after
Treasury officials met with bond dealers in  New York . Treasury
will hold its scheduled $51 billion of three- and six-month bill
auctions on Aug. 1, according to Morgan Stanley, one of the 20
primary dealers required to bid at the sales.  “They’ll delay the auctions and issue short-term cash-
management bills and just keep rolling them,” said James Caron,
head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New
York. “It’s one market where rates can’t get much lower.”  The government is inching closer to running out of cash
before an Aug. 2 deadline to raise the $14.3 trillion debt
ceiling. House Republican leaders scrapped a vote on the debt
ceiling bill late yesterday, fueling concern a compromise by the
two parties won’t be reached before the deadline and casting
doubt on whether the Treasury can sell more debt. A vote on the
House bill has been rescheduled for later today.  “We discussed a number of options to get feedback from
market participants, but have made no final decisions,” a
Treasury official said.  Debt Sales  At its previous refunding announcement on May 4, the
Treasury announced plans to sell $72 billion in its quarterly
sales of long-term debt and that it anticipated auction sizes
would “remain steady” as Congress and the White House debate
raising the debt limit. The Treasury’s next scheduled refunding
announcement is for Aug. 3 at 9:00 a.m. in  Washington .  The government sold $32 billion of three-year notes in May,
June and July, and $24 billion of 10-year notes and $16 billion
of 30-year bonds in May. The 10-year and 30-year sales were
lowered to $21 billion and $13 billion respectively in June and
July.  Treasuries rallied today, driving benchmark 10-year yields
to the lowest levels this year, on speculation lawmakers will
break the deadlock over raising the nation’s debt limit.  Yields on 10-year notes tumbled 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 2.79 percent at 3:20 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 2.78
percent, the lowest level since Nov. 30. Yields are down 18
basis points this week and 38 basis points this month, the most
since August. The 3.125 percent securities maturing in May 2021
climbed 1 12/32, or $13.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 102 28/32.  Standard & Poor’s  placed the U.S. AAA rating  on
“CreditWatch” July 14, saying there’s a 50 percent chance it
would be cut in the next 90 days even if an agreement is reached
by the deadline. S&P said it needs to see “a credible solution
to the rising U.S. government debt burden.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
