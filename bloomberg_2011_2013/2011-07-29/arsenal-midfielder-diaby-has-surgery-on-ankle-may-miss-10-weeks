Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby may be
out until September after undergoing ankle surgery, manager
 Arsene Wenger  said.  Diaby had a problem with his ankle at the end of last
season and did not take part in the Gunners’ preseason tour to
 Asia  or the club’s training camp in Germany.  “Abou had ankle surgery during the break,” Wenger said on
the club’s website. “Normally he should be back eight to 10
weeks after his surgery, which means the end of August.”  Diaby is likely to miss Arsenal’s Premier League matches
against Newcastle, Liverpool and Manchester United, as well as
the Champions League playoff. Arsenal opens the league season on
Aug. 13.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
