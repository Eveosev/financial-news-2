Indonesia ’s rupiah recorded its
second weekly gain as global funds boosted holdings of the
nation’s assets on expectations inflation will continue to ease.  The currency touched a seven-year high on July 27 as
overseas investors bought $48 million more shares than they sold
this week through yesterday, exchange data show. Consumer-price
gains slowed for a sixth month in July, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast before data due next week. Indonesia has a
“more than 50 percent chance” of winning a sovereign upgrade
in the next 12 to 18 months,  Fitch Ratings  said this month.  “Positive sentiment from slowing inflation and
expectations that Indonesia will get a rating upgrade is driving
capital inflows,” said Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ
Panin Bank in Jakarta. “Uncertainty about what’s happening in
the U.S. caused the dollar to weaken this week.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.3 percent this week to 8,503 per
dollar as of 4:08 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 8,476 on July 27, the strongest
level since March 2004, and rose 0.8 percent this month. It was
little changed today.  The government will report Aug. 1 that year-on-year
inflation was 4.8 percent in July, compared with 5.5 percent in
June, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Foreign ownership  of government debt rose 25 percent
to 245.5 trillion rupiah ($28.9 billion) this year through  July
27 , according to debt management office data.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of major trading partners, dropped to a two-month low
earlier this week as U.S. lawmakers struggled to agree on a plan
to increase the borrowing ceiling and avoid a default ahead of
an Aug. 2 deadline.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose today and for the week. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 declined 23 basis
points, or 0.23 percentage point, this week to 7.03 percent,
according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. The rate fell two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
