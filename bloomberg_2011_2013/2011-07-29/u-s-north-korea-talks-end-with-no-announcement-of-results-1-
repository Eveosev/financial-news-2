Diplomats from the U.S. and  North
Korea  ended two days of talks today in  New York  that both sides
called “constructive and business-like.”  While there was no announcement of results or plans for a
future meeting, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan
told reporters the two nations would remain in contact.  U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Stephen Bosworth said the Obama administration would consult South
Korea, Japan,  China  and Russia before deciding on further talks.  “We reiterated that the path is open to North Korea
towards the resumption of talks, improved relations with the
United States, and greater regional stability, if North Korea
demonstrates through its actions that it supports the resumption
of the six-party process as a committed and constructive
partner,” Bosworth said.  North Korea and  South Korea  on July 22 agreed to try to
revive the six-party forum on the North’s nuclear-weapons
program.  The six-party talks last convened in December 2008. In
April 2009, the regime said it would restore its main reactor
for making weapons-grade plutonium at Yongbyon, which had been
disabled under a February 2007 accord.  Bosworth said the talks at the U.S. mission to the UN were
“designed to explore the willingness of North Korea to take
concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
