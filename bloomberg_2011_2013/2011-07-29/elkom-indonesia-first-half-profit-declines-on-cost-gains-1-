PT Telekomunikasi  Indonesia , the
nation’s largest telephone company, reported a 1.5 percent slide
in first-half net income as higher costs, led by marketing,
outweighed gains in sales.  Net income in the six months ended June 30 declined to 5.94
trillion rupiah ($698 million) from 6.03 trillion rupiah a year
earlier, Telkom, as the company is known, said in an e-mailed
statement today. Sales climbed to 34.46 trillion rupiah from
33.71 trillion rupiah, it said. Marketing expenditure jumped 61
percent from a year earlier, pushing operating costs to 23.53
trillion rupiah from 22.37 trillion rupiah a year earlier, the
company said.  Mobile-phone subscribers at Telkom’s unit,  PT
Telekomunikasi Selular , have risen 16 percent from a year ago to
102.3 million people, Telkom said. Users of the unit’s internet
service, Flash, jumped 74 percent from a year ago to 5.19
million people, the Bandung, West Java-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
