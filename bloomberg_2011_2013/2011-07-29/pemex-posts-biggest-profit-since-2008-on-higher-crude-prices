Petroleos Mexicanos ,  Latin America ’s
largest oil producer, posted its biggest profit since 2008 in
the second quarter as crude prices surged and Mexican oil traded
with a premium over the U.S. crude benchmark.  Second-quarter profit was 9.1 billion pesos ($775 million,)
the Mexico City-based company said yesterday in a statement to
the Mexican Stock Exchange. The previous year, Pemex, as the
company is known, reported a net loss of 20.1 billion pesos,
according to Bloomberg data.  The state-owned  oil company  has benefited from the rising
price of oil over the past year. The quarterly average price of
Mexican export crude jumped 51 percent to $105.33 a barrel.  U.S. oil futures traded in New York averaged $102.34 a
barrel in the quarter, 31 percent higher than the $78.05 a year
earlier. The Mexican mix of oil for export was an average of
$5.67 a barrel higher than West Texas Intermediate in the
period, the first quarter that oil exported by Pemex traded with
a premium over the U.S. crude benchmark.  Oil exports from  Mexico , the second-largest oil supplier to
the U.S. after  Canada , rose 28 percent to 1.43 million barrels a
day in June from the year-earlier period, Pemex said July 22.  Pemex taxes represent about a third of Mexico’s public
budget.  Heavy, sour oil typically sells at a lower price because it
is more expensive to refine into products such as gasoline and
diesel fuel. Refineries that have invested in equipment to
process these grades benefit when the discount for heavy crude
widens. Sour refers to the oil’s sulfur content, while heavy
refers to its density.  Worldwide demand for crude gained about 3.2 percent from a
year earlier in the three months that ended June 30.  (The company plans to hold two conference calls today at 10
