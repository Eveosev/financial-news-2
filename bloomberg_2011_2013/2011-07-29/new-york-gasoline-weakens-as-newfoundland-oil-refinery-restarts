New York gasoline weakened as Korea
National Oil Corp.’s Come-by-Chance refinery in Newfoundland
began starting up after planned work.  All process units are expected to resume normal operations
during the next week, Gloria Slade, a company spokeswoman, said
in an e-mail. The crude and isomax units at the 115,000-barrel-
a-day refinery were shut in May for maintenance and inspections.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 1 cent to 2.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:10 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery lost
1.96 cents to $3.133 a gallon.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  widened 1.1 cents to 9.1 cents a gallon after  BP Plc (BP/) 
said it would start a unit at its Texas City refinery. Prompt
delivery lost 3.23 cents to $2.9515 a gallon.  The 475,000-barrel-a-day refinery plans to resume “normal
operations” of a residual hydrotreater unit, according to a
filing with state regulators.  The RHU 300 Train start-up may result in the release of
gases from 12 p.m. local time today until Aug. 4, according to
the filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
