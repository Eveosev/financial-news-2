President  Barack Obama  said that any
plan to cut the deficit and raise the federal debt ceiling must
get support from both parties and that the proposal from House
Republicans won’t meet that test.  Obama said at the White House that both parties are in
“rough agreement” and lawmakers must act to deal with the
“increasingly urgent” need to raise government borrowing
authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
