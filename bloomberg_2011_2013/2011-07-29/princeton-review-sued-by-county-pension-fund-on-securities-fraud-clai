Princeton Review Inc. (REVU) , the test-
preparation provider, was sued for  securities fraud  by a
Michigan county pension fund that claimed the company misled
investors about its condition.  Washtenaw County Employees Retirement System said Princeton
Review issued “false and misleading statements” about the
business related to the company’s April 2010 secondary stock
offering and financial results, according to the court filing
today in Boston federal court. The pension is seeking class-
action, or group, status for its suit.  Also named as defendants are the former chief executive
officer, Michael Perik, who resigned in March, and the former
finance chief, Stephen Richards, who left the company in June
2010. Roth Capital Partners LLC, the underwriter for the
secondary offering, is also a defendant.  Chris Kasper, the current finance chief, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Princeton Review, based in Framingham,  Massachusetts , fell
3.9 cents, or 14 percent, to 23 cents at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have dropped 81 percent
this year.  The case is Washtenaw County Employees Retirement System v.
The Princeton Review Inc., 11-cv-11359, U.S. District Court,
