Thailand ’s baht posted its biggest
monthly advance in more than three years after global investors
added to holdings of the nation’s assets on optimism elections
held on July 3 will usher in political stability.  International funds bought $1.2 billion more Thai equities
than they sold this month through July 28, the most since March
2010, exchange data show. Incoming leader Yingluck Shinawatra
said today her Cabinet will likely be announced in the middle of
next month. The baht fell earlier today on speculation the
central bank will curb appreciation that may threaten the
nation’s exports.  “There has been a good amount of inflows into Thailand
since the election earlier this month, providing a boost to the
baht,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “But there’s concern about
intervention, which is weighing on the baht at the moment.”  The baht strengthened 3.4 percent this month to 29.74 per
dollar as of 3:22 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That was the biggest monthly gain since February 2008.
The currency advanced 0.2 percent this week and was little
changed from yesterday. The baht’s advance in July was the best
performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the
yen.  Global investors bought a net $4.2 billion of Thai
government debt this month, according to the Thai Bond Market
Association.  Current-Account Surplus  Thailand had a current-account surplus of $2.5 billion in
June, compared with a deficit of $511 million a month earlier, a
Bank of Thailand report showed today. That was more than the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey for an excess of
$1.35 billion.  Government bonds  had a second weekly gain. The yield on the
5.25 percent notes due May 2014 dropped six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3.75 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell five basis points today.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, jumped 47.5 basis points
this month and 4.5 basis points this week to 3.665 percent. The
rate was up 2.5 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
