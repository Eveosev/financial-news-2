The U.S. government nominated  Derek
Mitchell , the state department special envoy to Myanmar, as the
first U.S. ambassador to the country since 1990, the Financial
Times reported, without saying where it got information.  The appointment, which the newspaper said will be announced
in the coming days, comes after the country held by-elections on
April 1 that included democracy advocate  Aung San Suu Kyi .  Mitchell was formerly the principal deputy assistant
secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs,
according the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
