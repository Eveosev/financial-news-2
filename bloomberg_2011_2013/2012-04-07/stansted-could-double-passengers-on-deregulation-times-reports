The U.K.’s Stansted airport could
double the number of handled passengers to 36 million if it was
exempt from Civil Aviation Authority regulation, the Times
reported, citing Nick Barton, the airport’s managing director.  Managing that many passengers would help alleviate
congestion at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, according to
Stansted. “Stansted should be competing on a level playing
field,” Barton said in the report.  The number of passengers passing through Stansted fell 25
percent between 2007 and 2011, according to the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
