The German tax office in Wuppertal
in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia is in negotiations to buy
two new sets of customer data from  Switzerland  to help identify
tax evaders,  Spiegel reported , without saying where it got the
information.  One of the sets of data is information from the Zurich
Coutts Bank, a unit of the  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the
German magazine reported. Data on 1,000 customers may cost about
2 million euros ($2.6 million), Spiegel said.  Calls by Bloomberg News to the Coutts press department and
the tax authorities in Wuppertal outside office hours went
unanswered. An RBS spokesman didnâ€™t immediately return a call
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
