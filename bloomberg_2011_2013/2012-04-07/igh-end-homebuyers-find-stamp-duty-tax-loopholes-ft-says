Buyers of U.K. homes with a value
exceeding two million pounds ($2.91 million) have found
loopholes to avoid paying top-rate stamp duty less than a month
after the government introduced a higher levy, the Financial
Times reported.  One of the plans marketed by some law firms involves buyers
signing multi-year leases that are automatically renewed on a
rolling basis, the report said. The approach circumvents the top
tax as the value of each lease is much less than the freehold of
the house.  Such plans are offered after the government last month
raised a stamp-duty tax rate on such properties to 7 percent
from 5 percent in an effort to raise an extra 150 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
