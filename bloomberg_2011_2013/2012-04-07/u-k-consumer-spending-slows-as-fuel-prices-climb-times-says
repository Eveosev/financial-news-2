Consumer spending  in the U.K. on
items other than gasoline has risen in March at the slowest pace
in at least two years because of rising fuel prices, The Times
reported, citing MasterCardâ€™s SpendingPulse survey.  Spending rose 0.8 percent last month as consumers were
forced to divert more of their earnings to fuel costs for their
cars, according to the newspaper. Gasoline prices were 9.8
percent higher in March than a year ago, The Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
