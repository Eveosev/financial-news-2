Cambridge University  defeated Oxford
University in the 158th Boat Race on the River Thames in London.  The 4.25-mile (6.8-kilometer) race was delayed for about 30
minute near the midway point by a man swimming in the river. The
boats then clashed oars after the restart, with the blade of one
of the Oxford oars breaking off, and Cambridge pulled away for
the victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
