Russia’s youth movement Nashi denied
a report by Gazeta.ru about a planned dissolution of the group
known for its support of Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  “Nashi movement proceeds with its activities,” the group
said in an e-mailed statement today. “There will be a congress
of the movement in May.” The statement came after  Gazeta.ru 
said Russia plans to dissolve the movement, citing unidentified
people in the group.  Nashi, which means “ours,” was formed after the 2004
Orange Revolution in neighboring  Ukraine , where student groups
played a crucial role in bringing a pro-western government to
power through mass protests. Nashi is known for organizing pro-
Putin rallies with thousands of young participants in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
