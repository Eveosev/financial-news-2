Defending champion Leinster easily
advanced to the Heineken Cup rugby semifinals, as Edinburgh
became the first Scottish team to reach the final four.  Rob Kearney scored two tries and Isa Nacewa and  Brian
O’Driscoll  touched down once each as Leinster routed  Cardiff
Blues  34-3 in Dublin. Leinster is seeking its third title in
four seasons in Europe’s elite club competition.  Greig Laidlaw kicked 14 points and Mike Blair scored a try
in Edinburgh’s 19-14 home upset of four-time champions Toulouse.
Timoci Matanavou touchded down for Toulouse and Lionel Beauxis
kicked three penalties.  Leinster will meet the winner of tomorrow’s game between
Saracens and Clermont in one semifinal on April 28, while
Edinburgh faces Munster or Ulster in the other.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
