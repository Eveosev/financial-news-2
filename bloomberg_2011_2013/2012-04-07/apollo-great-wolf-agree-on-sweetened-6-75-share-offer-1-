Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  boosted
its takeover of  Great Wolf Resorts Inc. (WOLF)  to $6.75 per share in
cash, or $225.6 million, an offer that was approved unanimously
by Great Wolf’s board.  Apollo Global also will assume $570 million in debt and $34
million in cash on the resort operator’s books, said  Carrie Bloom , an outside spokeswoman for Great Wolf at Sard Verbinnen &
Co., today.  With the sweetened offer, Great Wolf said it will no longer
consider an unsolicited $6.25 per-share bid made by KSL Capital
Partners LLC. Great Wolf owns, manages and licenses 11 resorts
which cater to families and feature indoor water parks, suite-
style rooms, restaurants, spas and arcades.  Phone calls and e-mails to KSL Capital by Bloomberg
News today weren’t returned.  Holders have until April 20 at midnight to tender their
shares, Great Wolf and  Apollo Global (APOL)  said yesterday in a
statement. Great Wolf also agreed to boost its termination fee
to $9 million from $7 million, the statement said.  Apollo Global made an earlier bid for Great Wolf on March
13, offering $5 a share, about a 19 percent premium from the
company’s closing stock price the day before. On March 15, the
company was sued by investors who said the $703 million offer,
which included debt, undervalued the company.  Midwestern Roots  Denver-based KSL Capital made its offer on April 4.  The Madison, Wisconsin-based Great Wolf opened its first
lodge in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, in 1997. The chain has
expanded into eight other U.S. states and  Canada  since then. New
York-based private-equity firm Apollo Global went public last
year.  Shares of Great Wolf rose 88 cents to $6.58 in Nasdaq
trading on April 5. The stock has more than doubled year to
date. Apollo Global rose 22 cents to $14.35 on April 5. The
stock is up 16 percent year to date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
