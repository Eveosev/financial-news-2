Coty Inc., the closely held perfume
maker seeking to buy  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  for $10 billion, is
stepping up its campaign by planning to talk to shareholders of
the door-to-door beauty group, the Financial Times reported. [bn:PRSN=1710887]   Bart Becht, [] Coty’s chairman, said he will start talking to
Avon’s shareholders in the next two weeks to put pressure on the
company’s board who rejected its proposal, the FT reported,
citing an interview.  The acquisition of Avon and its sales team would create a
new rival to global beauty groups such as  L’Oreal SA (OR) , the
world’s largest maker of cosmetics, and  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) ,
the world’s largest consumer-products company, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
