Insolvent German retailer Schlecker
may get bids of less than 100 million euros ($131 million) from
potential investors,  Focus  said, citing unidentified creditors
and people in the finance industry.  Thomas Roeb, professor for retailing at the Bonn-Rhine-Sieg
University and a former adviser to Schlecker, estimates that the
price may be in the “two-digit million” range, the magazine
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
