Britain will discuss the current tax
deal with Swiss authorities after the Easter holiday, the
Guardian reported, citing confirmation from the U.K. Treasury
last night.  Chancellor  George Osborne  could invoke a clause in the
current tax agreement with Switzerland that would allow the U.K.
to benefit from better terms negotiated by  Germany , the
newspaper said. According to the deal, incomes of U.K. nationals
in Switzerland will be subject to tax on a sliding sale from 21
percent to 34 percent. Germany agreed to a higher tax rate of 41
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
