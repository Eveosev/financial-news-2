House prices  in the U.K. will rise
to levels in late 2007 before the country’s economy sank into a
 recession , the Centre for Economics and Business Research said.  Shortage of housing relative to demand, improved
affordability and mortgage availability will probably support
house prices in the U.K., the London-based research group said
in a report today. It sees unemployment as a negative factor.  “House prices have been pretty stable over the past two
years,” said Shehan Mohamed, an author of the report. “Lending
for housing was 74.5 billion pounds ($118 billion) in 2011 and
we forecast that this will rise to 109.9 billion pounds by
2016.”  It forecast house prices will rise 0.8 percent this year,
compared with a contraction of 1.3 percent in 2011. That’s a
downward revision from 1.6 percent growth projected in November.  CEBR expects prices of residential properties will increase
2.2 percent next year, 2.6 percent in 2014, 2.8 percent in 2015
and 3.8 percent in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
