Celtic defeated Kilmarnock 6-0 to
win the Scottish soccer’s Premier League and claim its 43rd
national title.  Charlie Mulgrew and Gary Hooper scored two goals each to
lead Celtic to the away win at Rugby Park, while Glenn Loovens
and Joe Ledley had one goal each.  The win gives Celtic a 21-point lead over Rangers, which
received a 10-point deduction for entering administration in
February, with five matches remaining.  The title is Celtic’s seventh since the Scottish Premier
League began in 1998, matching Rangers’ record. Rangers has won
a record 54 Scottish championships.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
