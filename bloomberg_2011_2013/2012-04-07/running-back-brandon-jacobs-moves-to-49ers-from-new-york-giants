Former  New York Giants  running back
Brandon Jacobs signed a one-year contract with San Francisco,
the second Giants player to move to the 49ers this offseason.  The 49ers announced the deal yesterday in a release that
did not include contract terms.  Jacobs, 29, was released in March by the Super Bowl-
champion Giants after seven seasons in New York. He has rushed
for 4,849 yards and 56 touchdowns in his National Football
League career. Last year, he had 571 yards rushing, his fewest
since 2006, and scored eight touchdowns.  Jacobs will team in the 49ersâ€™ backfield with Frank Gore,
whose 1,211 yards rushing last season ranked sixth in the NFL.  Free-agent wide receiver  Mario Manningham  left the Giants
and signed with the 49ers in March.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
