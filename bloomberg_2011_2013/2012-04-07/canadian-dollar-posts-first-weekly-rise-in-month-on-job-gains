Canada ’s dollar posted its first
weekly advance in a month against its U.S. counterpart as
higher-than-forecast employment growth added to speculation the
central bank’s next move will be to raise borrowing costs.  The currency outperformed a majority of its major peers,
strengthening as crude oil rose and a report showed April 5 that
jobs gains last month were more than seven times greater than
economists forecast. Canada will sell C$3.3 billion ($3.31
billion) of two-year bonds April 11.  “The Canadian dollar has held up amazingly well,”  John Curran , senior vice president in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd.,
an online foreign-exchange dealer, said in a telephone
interview. “It was faring well against the crosses anyway. The
strong jobs data punched it back into being an outperformer.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, rose 0.2 percent to 99.72 cents per  U.S. dollar  as
of 12:05 p.m. yesterday in  New York . One Canadian dollar
purchased $1.0028. It climbed 2.1 percent to C$.30525 versus the
euro in the Good Friday holiday shortened week.  Employment (CANLNETJ)  rose by 82,300 following a February decline of
2,800, lowering the jobless rate to 7.2 percent from 7.4
percent, according to Statistics Canada data. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast a jobs increase of
10,500 and unemployment to remain at 7.4 percent.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said in an April 2
speech that the nation’s economy had topped his expectations in
recent months.  Index Swaps  Odds of an increase in the Bank of Canada’s target rate by
the December meeting swung to 26 percent after the report, with
zero chance of a cut, according to Bloomberg calculations on
overnight  index (SPX)  swaps. Odds before the report were about 17
percent each for a raise and a reduction.  Canada’s currency traded as low as C$1.0319 in early
January before rallying to 98.42 cents per U.S. dollar last
month as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained. Optimism over
accelerating global growth bolstered demand for Canada’s  raw
materials , which account for about half of export revenue.  Government bonds  fell this week, pushing the yield on the
benchmark  10-year note  higher by two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.13 percent. The yield reached 2.297
percent on March 19, the highest since October. It was as low as
1.887 percent in January.  The two-year notes being sold next week will have a coupon
of 2.25 percent and mature Aug. 1, 2014, according to the  Bank
of Canada ’s  website . The previous auction of two-year bonds, on
Feb. 29, drew an average yield of 1.116 percent and a coverage
ratio -- the amount bid for the amount on offer -- of 2.15
times, versus a five auction average ratio of 2.42 times, Bank
of Canada  data  show.  The loonie rose 0.6 percent over the past month in the
fourth best performance among the 10 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
