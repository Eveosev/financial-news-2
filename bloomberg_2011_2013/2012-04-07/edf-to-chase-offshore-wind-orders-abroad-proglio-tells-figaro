Electricite de  France  SA will pursue
orders for offshore wind parks outside France after winning
tenders with partners  Alstom SA (ALO)  and Dong Energy A/S at three
French sites,  Le Figaro  reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer  Henri Proglio .  EDF is creating an offshore wind industrial base in France
that will be used to win international contracts such as in the
U.K., according to the newspaper.  EDF, Danish utility Dong, and Alstom were picked to build
1,428 megawatts of wind power at three sites off the coasts of
Brittany and Normandy, the government said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
