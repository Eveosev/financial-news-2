Russia’s Academy of Sciences plans
several projects to explore the moon, Venus and Mercury in the
next 20 years, RIA Novosti said citing a draft program on solar
system exploration.  Russia plans to send two moon rovers after 2020 and several
landing stations after 2022 to form a lunar practice ground for
exploring the satellite’s polar areas, RIA said.  Scientists are also planning to launch the Venus-D lander,
an orbital unit and a satellite after 2024 to explore Venus’s
atmosphere and geology, the agency said. The country’s plan for
the first-ever lander to Mercury wont’ be for at least 20 years,
later than an earlier target of 2019, RIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
