New York Rangers coach John
Tortorella was fined $20,000 by the  National Hockey League , one
day after he labeled the  Pittsburgh Penguins  “one of the most
arrogant organizations in the league.”  Tortorella told reporters after a 5-2 loss at Pittsburgh on
April 5 that he was furious that Penguins defenseman Brooks
Orpik swung his right knee into the right knee of Rangers center
Derek Stepan.  Stepan doubled over onto the ice before skating off under
his own power slumped in pain. Orpik got a five-minute major
penalty and a game misconduct.  “It’s a cheap, dirty hit,” the Rangers coach said. “They
whine about this stuff all the time, and look what happens.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
