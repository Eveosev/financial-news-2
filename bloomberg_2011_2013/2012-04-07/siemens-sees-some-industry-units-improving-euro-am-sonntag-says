Siemens AG (SIE)  Chief Financial Officer
Joe Kaeser said that some of the German company’s industrial
businesses are performing better than last year,  Euro am Sonntag 
reported, citing an interview.  Concerns at the start of the fiscal year that weakening
European and Chinese economies would damage shorter-cycle
businesses such as industry automation or parts of the drive
technologies unit didn’t materialize, Kaeser said, according to
the German newspaper. Business has stabilized at “a high
level,” he told Euro am Sonntag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
