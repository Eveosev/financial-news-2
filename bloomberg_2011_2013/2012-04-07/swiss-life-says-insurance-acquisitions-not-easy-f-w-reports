While  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  could
consider a merger or making an acquisition, implementation is
“anything but easy,” Finanz & Wirtschaft reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Bruno Pfister.  The life insurer sees “no big movements” in  Switzerland 
and there are few pure listed non-life insurers in  Europe ,
Pfister said in an interview in today’s  newspaper . Interest
rates will probably remain low for the next five to seven years
to allow banks to increase their capital, according to Pfister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
