Pakistani soldiers, backed by
helicopters and sniffer dogs, are searching for 135 people
buried after an avalanche struck a military post in the Siachen
glacier region in the Himalayas.  The avalanche hit the base at Gayari yesterday and covered
a 1 square kilometer (0.4 square mile) area, the army said in a
 statement  on its website. Heavy machinery is being airlifted to
the site to help with rescue efforts, it said.  One hundred and twenty-four soldiers and 11 civilians
working for the military were buried in the snow slide, the army
said. “The battalion headquarters has been situated at the same
place for the last 20 years and no incident of this nature has
happened,” it said.  The Siachen glacier is known as the highest militarized
zone in the world.  India  sent troops to the 75-kilometer (47-
mile) glacier that reaches an altitude of 6,300 meters (20,670
feet), in 1984 and  Pakistan  responded with its own deployment.  While a cease-fire has been observed since 2003, talks have
failed to agree on the location of a boundary along the glacier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
