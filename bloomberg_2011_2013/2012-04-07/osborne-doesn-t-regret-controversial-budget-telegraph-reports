U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said he stands by his “controversial” budget
which drew criticism after it was announced last month, the
Daily Telegraph reported, citing an interview.  Osborne said the budget, which included a new value-added
tax on a popular hot snack, removing the age-related allowance
for pensioners, and a cut in the top tax rate, is a pro-business
budget that will boost Britain’s competitiveness, the Telegraph
reported. He said the government must focus on the big picture.  “When I stood outside this building on Budget day, I knew
it was a controversial budget,” he told the Telegraph. “But we
must not be distracted by that. We are not in a daily popularity
contest, but I tell you what, Britain is in a daily contest
around the world.”  His Conservative-led coalition government intends to narrow
a record  budget deficit  as indebted countries in  Europe  struggle
to tame their finances and regain investor confidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
