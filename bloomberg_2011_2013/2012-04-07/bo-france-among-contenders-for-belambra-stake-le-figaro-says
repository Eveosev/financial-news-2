LBO  France , LFPI, Sagard and
Montefiore are competing to buy a 60 percent stake in vacation
and real-estate company Belambra,  Le Figaro  reported without
saying where it got the information.  Bids for  Groupama SA’s (GPAS)  Acto Capital investment fund’s
Belambra stake have so far fallen short of the around 200
million euro ($262 million) initial valuation, according to the
report, which says the winner could be announced in June
following a second round of bidding organized by Lazard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
