U.K. retailers ’ demand for stores
fell in the first quarter from a year ago, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported, citing a survey from the  Royal Institution  of
Chartered Surveyors.  The number of property agents reporting a fall in interest
from retailers rose 11 percent, according to the newspaper. The
RICS survey also found 17 percent more property surveyors
reporting a rise in empty shops, and 28 percent more surveyors
predicting a fall in rents in the next three months.  “Across many parts of the country, it seems that the
commercial property sector in general is continuing to struggle,
with a lack of affordable finance proving a big barrier to
growth,” RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said in the
newspaper report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
