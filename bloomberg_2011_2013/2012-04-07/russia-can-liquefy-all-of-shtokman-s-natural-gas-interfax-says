Russia  can liquefy all natural gas
extracted in the first production stage of the Shtokman offshore
project in the Barents Sea, Interfax said, citing OAO Gazprom
Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Alexander Medvedev .  “Belief in LNG came back to our partners, and it never was
leaving us,” Medvedev said in the Interfax report.  Gazprom, which is Russia’s natural gas exports monopoly,
expects its fuel supplies to Europe this year to be same as in
2011, Medvedev said in the Interfax report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
