England  defeated Sri Lanka by eight
wickets in their second Test to remain the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings.  Alastair Cook was 49 not out and  Kevin Pietersen  had an
unbeaten 42 as England reached its target of 94 in just 19.4
overs in Colombo. Pietersen clinched the victory with a six as
the visitors ended 97-2.  Graeme Swann earlier finished with six wickets as Sri Lanka
was bowled out for 278. Mahela Jayawardene top-scored for the
hosts with 64.  The victory enabled England to split the two-game series
after losing the opener by 75 runs. If England had lost, South
Africa would have taken over the top spot in the ICC world
rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
