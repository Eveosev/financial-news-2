Jason Dufner , who began the third
round of the Masters Tournament tied for the lead, signed a new
sponsorship agreement for the weekend.  Dufner, runner-up in last year’s PGA Championship, has
partnered with  Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (WYN) ’s Wyndham Hotels &
Resorts brand. He’s wearing the company’s logo on his shirt at
Augusta National Golf Club, where golf’s first Grand Slam event
of the year is being played. The Masters is typically the
sport’s most-watched tournament.  Dufner is at 2-under par after a 3-over 75 today, seven
shots behind leader Peter Hanson.  Dave Haggith, a spokesman for Cleveland, Ohio-based IMG,
Dufner’s management agency, declined to disclose financial terms
of the agreement. The contract includes an undisclosed bonus if
Dufner, 35, were to win his first major championship and could
be extended to a longer term, Haggith said.  Wyndham, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, has also
sponsored the U.S. PGA Tour’s  Wyndham Championship  in Greensboro,
 North Carolina  since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
