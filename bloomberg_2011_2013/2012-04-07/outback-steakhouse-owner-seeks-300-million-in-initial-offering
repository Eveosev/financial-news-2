Bloomin’ Brands Inc., owner of the
Outback Steakhouse restaurant chain, is seeking to raise $300
million in an initial public offering to help pay down debt.  Bank of America Corp. ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  will manage the offering, Bloomin’ Brands said in a filing
yesterday. The Tampa, Florida-based company, owned by Bain
Capital LLC and Catterton Management Co., will trade under the
ticker BLM.  Bloomin’ Brands also owns the chains Carrabba’s Italian
Grill, Bonefish Grill, Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar and
Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion Cuisine.  Private equity owners are taking their holdings public
again as stock markets rebound and market volatility decreases.
Fast-food chain  Burger King Worldwide Holdings Inc. (BKC)  said this
week it would go public again after it was taken private in 2010
by investment firm 3G Capital Inc.  In 2011, Bloomin’ Brands had net income of $100 million, or
94 cents a share, on revenue of $3.84 billion, up from $52.9
million, or 50 cents, on revenue of $3.63 billion in 2010, the
company said in the filing. The company first disclosed plans
for a possible IPO last month.  Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will also
help on the offering, according to the IPO prospectus.  To contact the reporters on this story:
