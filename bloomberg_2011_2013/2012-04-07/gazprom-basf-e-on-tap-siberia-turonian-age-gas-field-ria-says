OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , Russia’s state-run
natural-gas producer, BASF AG and  E.ON AG (EOAN)  started gas production
from Turonian-age deposits in Siberia, RIA Novosti said.  Severneftegazprom, a joint venture of the three companies
and license holder for the Yuzhno-Russkoye gas field, started
pumping gas from the field’s Turonian geological strata to
Russia’s domestic pipeline system today, RIA said.  Russia possesses more than 20 gas fields that contain about
2 trillion cubic meters (70.6 trillion cubic feet) of the
Turonian-age deposits, RIA said citing  Alexander Medvedev ,
Gazprom’s deputy chief executive officer. While technically
difficult to convert into reserves, extraction of Turonian-age
deposits is more effective than shale gas production, Medvedev
said, according to RIA.  The Yuzhno-Russkoye field is the main natural gas source
for the Nord Stream pipeline, which supplies fuel directly to
Germany under the  Baltic Sea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
