Spain  will manage to get through the
current crisis without external help even as the economy is
expected to shrink this year,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
said , citing an interview with economy minister Luis de Guindos.  The Spanish budget, which foresees savings and increased
tax revenue of 25 billion euros ($33 billion) this year, is
“absolutely necessary,” because financing costs will rise
should the markets fail to see budget consolidation, the German
newspaper cited De Guindos as saying.  This year will be “difficult” with the economy expected
to shrink about 1.5 percent before showing a “slightly positive
development” next year, De Guindos said, according to the
newspaper. While unemployment will probably rise further, the
foreign trade deficit will disappear this year, the minister
told FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
