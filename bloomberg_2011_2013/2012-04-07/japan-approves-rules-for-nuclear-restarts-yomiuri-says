     April 7 (Bloomberg) --- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and three cabinet ministers approved revised safety
standards yesterday for restarting nuclear  power plants  shut
after the March 11 earthquake, the Yomiuri newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The new criteria include ensuring plants can cope when they
lose all electricity in an earthquake or tsunami and have
installed filtered vents to reduce radiation leaks in case of an
accident, Yomiuri reported.  Industry Minister  Yukio Edano  ordered  Kansai Electric Power
Co. (9503) , operator of the Ohi nuclear plant in  Fukui prefecture , to
draft a compliance plan and the utility will submit the document
as early as next week, Yomiuri reported.  Kepco, as the utility is known as, hasn’t decided when to
submit the safety compliance plan, Kazushige Maeda, Tokyo-based
spokesman at Kepco, said by telephone today. “I don’t think it
will take that much time to put together the document,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
