Commission General Counsel Frank Lindh recused himself as chief
advisory attorney in investigations into a  PG&E Corp. (PCG)  pipeline
explosion that killed eight people in 2010.  Lindh will be replaced by retired CPUC assistant general
counsel Arocles Aguilar, according to an e-mailed statement from
the agency. Some CPUC lawyers working on the probes and proposed
penalties for PG&E had asked to be reassigned, the regulator
said June 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
