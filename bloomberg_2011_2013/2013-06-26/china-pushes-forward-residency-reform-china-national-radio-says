China  plans to end residency
restrictions in small towns and introduce “reasonable”
policies for the largest cities, China National Radio  reported 
yesterday, citing the nation’s leading economic planner.  The government will gradually ease limits on residence
permits in the smallest towns before moving on to medium- and
larger-sized cities, Xu Shaoshi, the chairman of the National
Development and Reform Commission, said in a report to the
standing committee of the National People’s Congress.  The move is part of a broader push by China to reform its
residence-permit system, known as hukou, which mandates that
people can only get most health and welfare benefits in the
place where they are registered, usually at birth. Hukou reform
may also narrow the  income gap  between rural and urban residents
and help Premier  Li Keqiang  in his effort to promote
urbanization and domestic consumption as drivers for the world’s
second-largest economy.  The new measures will enable rural residents who meet
certain requirements to become city dwellers instead, China
National Radio said in the report, citing Xu.  The hukou system, imposed under leader  Mao Zedong  in 1958
to bind farmers to their land, prevents the country’s tens of
millions of migrants from putting down roots in the cities where
they work because they can’t get government help or send their
children to school for free.  China’s biggest cities, including Shanghai, Beijing and
Chongqing, have yearly quotas on the number of people allowed to
become residents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
