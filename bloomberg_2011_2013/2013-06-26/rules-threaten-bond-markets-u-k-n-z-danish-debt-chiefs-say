Regulation of government bond
markets risks lowering liquidity and reducing the role of
primary dealers, the debt chiefs of the U.K.,  New Zealand  and
Denmark warned.  “Sometimes I get worried about the load of regulation,”
said Danish Debt Management Office head Ove Sten Jensen in a
panel at the the Euromoney Global Borrowers and Investors Forum
in London today. “Some regulations are conflicting.”  Brendon Doyle, head of the New Zealand Debt Management
Office, said he expects the “agenda of regulation” will affect
markets’ ability to work efficiently.  “That is a worry,” U.K. Debt Management Office Chief
Executive Robert Stheeman said. “We need deep, liquid markets
in order to sell the debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
