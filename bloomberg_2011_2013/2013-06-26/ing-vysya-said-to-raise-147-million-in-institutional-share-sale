  ING Vysya Bank Ltd. (VYSB) , the Indian
lender backed by  ING Groep NV (INGA) , raised about 8.8 billion rupees
($147 million) selling shares to institutional investors at the
top end of a marketed range, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  The Bangalore-based bank plans to raise another 9.5 billion
rupees in a preferential allotment to Mauritius-based investment
subsidiaries of ING Groep, according to terms for the deal
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  ING Vysya sold about 14.4 million shares to institutions at
612 rupees apiece, the people said, asking not to be identified
as the information is private. The shares were offered at a
range of 606 rupees to 612 rupees. Another 15.6 million shares
will be sold to ING’s subsidiaries at 611.18 rupees each, the
terms show.  JM Financial Ltd., Axis Bank Ltd. and Credit Suisse Group
AG are managing the offering.  ING Vysya rose 0.11 percent to 606 rupees at 2:20 p.m. in
Mumbai today. A spokesman for the bank didn’t immediately return
calls seeking comment on final pricing of the share sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
