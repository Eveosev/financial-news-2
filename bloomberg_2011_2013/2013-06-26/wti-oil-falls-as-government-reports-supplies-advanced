West Texas Intermediate oil rose for
a third day, advancing with equities on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain stimulus after a report showed slower-than-estimated economic growth.  Futures gained as the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rallied
after the U.S. revised lower its reading for first-quarter
economic growth. Prices rebounded after slipping 1.7 percent in
intraday trading when the Energy Information Administration
reported crude, gasoline and diesel supplies all gained last
week as refineries increased operating rates.  “There was an initial reaction to the fresh inventory data
and we saw prices fall,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It didn’t
take long for us to return to tracking equities. The markets
aren’t going to fall a great deal as long as the Fed is
continuing with stimulus.”  WTI crude for August delivery rose 18 cents to $95.50 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since June 19. The contract dropped as low as $93.68.
The volume of all futures traded was 6.6 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  Brent oil for August settlement climbed 40 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $101.66 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume for all contracts was
25 percent lower than the 100-day average.  The European benchmark grade traded at a $6.16 premium to
WTI based on settlement prices. The spread was $5.94 at
yesterday’s close, the narrowest since January 2011.  Quarterly Decline  WTI is down 1.8 percent this quarter amid speculation that
the Fed will pare stimulus and as  China ’s economic growth shows
signs of slowing. Brent futures are down 7.6 percent in the
quarter.  The  S&P 500  increased 1.1 percent. Gross domestic product
expanded at a revised 1.8 percent annualized rate from January
through March, down from a prior estimate of 2.4 percent, the
Commerce Department said. The 0.6 percentage-point reduction was
the biggest for a final reading of GDP since the figure for the
third quarter of 2009.  “The terrible GDP number gives the Fed room to continue
doing what they’ve been doing,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund that focuses on energy.
“There probably won’t be a tapering of stimulus anytime soon
after this large GDP revision.”  Rising Stockpiles  U.S. crude stockpiles rose 18,000 barrels to 394.1 million,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical unit.
The median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a
decline of 1.75 million. Supplies reached 397.6 million on May
24, the highest level since 1931.  Crude production  advanced 1.9 percent to 7.26 million
barrels a day last week, the EIA said. Output reached 7.37
million in the week ended May 3, the most since February 1992.
Production has surged as the combination of horizontal drilling
and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies
trapped in shale formations in the central part of the country.  Surging North American crude output has bolstered
stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI.
Inventories at the hub increased 664,000 barrels to 49.3 million
on June 21, the report showed. Stockpiles reached a record 51.9
million barrels in the week ended Jan. 11.  “The Cushing numbers were up strongly,” said Julius Walker, global energy markets strategist at UBS Securities LLC
in New York. “This shows that despite the construction of new
pipelines, there still isn’t enough transport capacity to deal
with increasing output.”  Fuel Inventories  Gasoline stockpiles rose 3.65 million barrels to 225.4
million, the most for any week in June since 1999. Supplies of
 distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, increased 1.57 million barrels to 123.2 million.  “This report was bearish across the board,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York. “Refinery runs climbed and we still didn’t get a draw in
crude stocks. There is more of just about everything.”  Demand for gasoline  rose 0.6 percent in the week ended June
21 to 8.89 million barrels a day. Total petroleum consumption
increased 3 percent to 19 million.  Fuel imports increased 50 percent to 2.65 million barrels a
day last week, the highest level since December 2011.  Refinery Utilization  Refineries operated  at 90.2 percent of capacity, up 0.9
percentage point from the prior week. Units are often reopened
in the late spring after being idled for maintenance in late
winter as attention moves away from heating oil and before the
peak season for U.S. gasoline consumption, which runs from late
May until early September.  “There were big gains in fuel supplies even though demand
was stronger,” Walker said. “The combination of higher
refinery runs and a huge gain in imports explain the gain.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
August was 20.7 percent, down from 21.1 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 548,949
contracts as of 2:56 p.m. It totaled 791,066 contracts
yesterday, 27 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.81 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
