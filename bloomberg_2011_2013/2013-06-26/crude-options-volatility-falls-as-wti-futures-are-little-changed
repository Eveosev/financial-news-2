Crude oil options volatility fell to
the lowest level in a week as underlying futures were little
changed for a second day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options, was 20.6 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 3:454 p.m., down from 21.09 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery rose 18
cents to settle at $95.50 a barrel on the Nymex after gaining 14
cents yesterday.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
August $90 puts, which fell 7 cents to 44 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,756 lots traded at 4 p.m. August $100 calls were the
second-most active, declining 4 cents to 38 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,345 contracts.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the prior session, bearish bets accounted for 66 percent of
97,470 contracts.  August $90 puts were the most-active options traded
yesterday, with 5,101 contracts changing hands. They fell 10
cents to 51 cents a barrel. December $87 puts declined 16 cents
to $2.87 on 4,070 lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts, with
41,046 contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 37,680 lots
and December $80 puts with 36,249.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
