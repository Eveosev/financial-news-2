West Texas Intermediate dropped for
the first time in three days after an industry report showed
U.S. crude stockpiles remained near the highest level in more
than 30 years.  Futures lost as much as 1.1 percent in  New York , before
paring some of the decline. U.S. inventories slid by 28,000
barrels last week to 392 million, the  American Petroleum
Institute  said after  futures markets  settled yesterday. Crude
supplies climbed to 396.3 million earlier this month, the most
since July 1981. A report from the  Department of Energy  today
may show a decrease of 1.75 million barrels, according to a
 Bloomberg News   survey . Stockpiles last month swung between a
drop of as much as 6.3 million barrels and a gain of 3 million,
according to weekly government data.  “Today is fairly quiet on the economic data front so the
focus will be on the DOE stats later,” Bjornar Tonhaugen,
senior commodities analyst at  Nordea Markets , said by telephone
from Oslo. “It’ll be interesting to see whether the Cushing
levels fall, as they are set to drop in the third quarter and
this could create some market moves.”  WTI for August delivery was trading at $94.83 a barrel,
down 49 cents, at 1:45 p.m. London time in electronic trading on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after falling as much as
$1.05. The contract rose 14 cents to $95.32 yesterday, the
highest close since June 20.  Brent for August settlement was down 14 cents at $101.12 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark grade was at a premium of $6.29 to WTI
futures after closing yesterday at $5.94, the lowest since
January 2011.  Fuel Supplies  WTI is heading for a 2.2 percent decline this quarter amid
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will pare stimulus as
signs grow of economic improvement in the U.S., the world’s
biggest consumer of crude. WTI has gained 3.3 percent this year.
Brent futures are headed for an 8.9 percent loss, the third
quarterly drop, and have also fallen by 8.9 percent this year.  Gasoline stockpiles increased by 1.3 million barrels last
week, the API data show. Supplies are projected to rise by
875,000 barrels, according to the  median estimate  of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg before today’s report by the Energy
Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .
Distillate inventories, including heating oil and diesel,
climbed by 527,000 barrels, according to the API, compared with
a forecast 650,000-barrel gain in the DOE survey.  Cushing Stockpiles  Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for Nymex WTI contracts and the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub,
were up 706,000 barrels at 49.2 million, according to the API.
That was the first gain in four weeks.  “The high volatility in the weekly numbers over the last
six weeks is a bit of a concern, with major draws and then
replenishment,” said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market
strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. “Clearly we are expecting
to see declines over the next weeks and months.”  The API in Washington collects supply information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, for its weekly survey.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will keep
crude exports in August unchanged at 56 cargoes, the same as for
July, according to a final loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News. Exports will be 53.69 million barrels, or 1.73 million
barrels a day, the plan shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
