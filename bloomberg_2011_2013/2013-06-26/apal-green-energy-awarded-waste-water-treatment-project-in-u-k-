Mapal  Green Energy , a Haifa, Israel-based developer of waste water treatment systems, was awarded a
project by Anglian Water for one of its plants in
Stanbridgeford, north of  London .  Mapal’s floating aeration system, designed to reduce energy
consumption and operation costs, will be installed in Anglian’s
plant, according to an e-mailed statement from the Haifa
company. Anglian provides water treatment services to more than
6 million customers in the U.K., Mapal said.  Mapal is in advanced talks with another water utility that
operates hundreds of water treatment plants in the U.K., the
company said. It also recently raised 1.5 million pounds ($2.3
million) in a second round of financing, Mapal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
