Argentina , which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a cargo from Belgium, according to ship-tracking data.  The Galicia Spirit, with a capacity of about 138,000 cubic
meters, is preparing to dock at the port of Bahia Blanca
southwest of  Buenos Aires , according to ship transmissions
captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. It was scheduled to dock
at Bahia Blanca yesterday.  The vessel sailed from Belgium’s LNG terminal in  Zeebrugge ,
where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and departed June 2,
the data show. The facility is used by traders to store and
export cargoes from Belgium, which doesn’t produce its own LNG.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes
for delivery to  Bahia Blanca . Enarsa and YPF have issued seven
spot tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
