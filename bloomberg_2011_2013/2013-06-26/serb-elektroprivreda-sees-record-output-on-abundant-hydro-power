Elektroprivreda Srbije JP, Serbia’s
dominant power company, expects a record output this year
because of high water levels at its hydro plants and cheap
exported power.  Output will be almost 37 billion kilowatt hours, above the
2011 record of 36 billion kilowatt hours, enabling net exports
of “at least” 2 billion kilowatt hours, double the five-year
average, said management board Chairman Aca Markovic, in an
interview in Belgrade today. The company also counts on an
average export price of 5 euro cents per kilowatt hour, he said.  “For our usual seasonal buyers in the region, it’ll be
cheaper to buy power from our hydro facilities than to burn gas
or coal at their own plants,” Markovic said. Rains that caused
floods across central  Europe  earlier this month worked well for
the company because hydro works account for 40 percent of
available capacity.  The Belgrade-based country’s unconsolidated net loss fell
50 percent last year to $27.5 million on cost cuts, even after
last year’s drought depleted power generation at its hydro
plants and forced it to turn to costly imports amid soaring
prices in the first quarter of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
