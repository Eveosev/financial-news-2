Denver Water,  Colorado ’s largest
municipal water supplier, modified restrictions today after an
unexpectedly wet spring and customer response to conservation
measures to allow a third day of watering a week.  The Denver Board of Water Commissioners lifted Stage 2
drought restrictions in place since April 1, declaring a Stage 1
effective immediately to help manage water supply reserves,
saying snowpack in both of Denver Water’s watersheds whose
runoff fills reservoirs ended up 90 percent of the average peak.  “While the drought is not over, conditions have improved
enough that customers may water a third day if their lawns need
it,’’  Greg Austin, president of Denver water board, said in a
statement. “We all still need to do our part to protect against
the possibility of another dry winter, and we ask everyone to
continue to use even less.”  The utility asked customers not to water lawns from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m., especially at midday, nor when it’s raining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
