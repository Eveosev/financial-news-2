Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) , a maker of graphics
chips for personal computers, delayed the shipment of its new
Shield portable gaming device, citing a mechanical issue
discovered in quality testing.  The handheld machine had been set to go on sale tomorrow.
The Santa Clara, California-based company is working with a
third-party supplier to fix a glitch in a component so it can
begin to ship them next month, Nvidia said today in a blog post.  Nvidia began taking orders last month for Shield, which is
built on the company’s Tegra processor. It’s aimed at boosting
sales of other devices using Tegra by increasing the use of
games designed for that platform, Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang said in an interview earlier this month.  “We want every Shield to be just right,” the company said
in the blog post. “We’ll let you know when we have an exact
shipping date in July.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
