The University of  California ,  Los
Angeles  defeated Mississippi State University 8-0 to sweep the
best-of-three final round in the College World Series and claim
its first national men’s college baseball championship.  UCLA (49-17) tallied its 109th overall National Collegiate
Athletic Association title, a record, with its 11th straight
victory. The Bruins beat the Bulldogs 3-1 in the first game of
the finals two days ago.  “It was our time,” UCLA coach John Savage told reporters.
“People didn’t believe in us all season long. We kept battling
and it’s a team win.”  Eric Filia drove in a career-high five runs and Nick Vander
Tuig held Mississippi State to five hits while striking out six
and walking one in eight innings last night at TD Ameritrade
Park in Omaha,  Nebraska .  “I thrive on this,” Filia told reporters. “We just
stayed with our approach. We stayed small and barreled balls
up.”  Bulldogs starter Luis Pollorena left after giving up one
run on one hit after facing five batters in the first inning.  Mississippi State (51-20) was seeking its first national
title in a team sport and was the sixth straight Southeastern
Conference team to make it to the finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
