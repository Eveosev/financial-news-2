Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  called a ballot for the leadership of the governing
 Labor party  for 7 p.m. today, setting up a showdown 2 1/2 months
from an election that polls show she will lose in a landslide.  Gillard called on Labor lawmakers to endorse her leadership
and said the loser of the ballot should quit parliament at the
Sept. 14 election to allow the winner to lead a united party.
She called the vote amid media reports that supporters of her
predecessor  Kevin Rudd  had circulated a petition calling for a
meeting of the Labor caucus to oust her.  “It’s in the best interests of the nation and in the best
interests of the Labor party for this matter to be resolved,”
Gillard said in an interview with Sky News. “Anybody who
believes that they should be Labor leader should put themselves
forward for this ballot. This is it.”  The winner of the vote faces the task of uniting the party
and turning around opinion polls that show opposition leader
 Tony Abbott ’s coalition is set to win in a landslide. Labor
hasn’t led in polls in more than 18 months and trails the
Liberal-National coalition by 14 percentage points as a slowing
economy and high currency hurt manufacturing in its heartland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
