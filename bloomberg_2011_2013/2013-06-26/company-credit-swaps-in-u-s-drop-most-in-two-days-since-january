A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell a second day as  China ’s central bank indicated it
would take measures to ease the country’s cash crunch.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
3.3 basis points to a mid-price of 89 basis points at 8:32 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure fell 10.3 basis points in the last two days, the biggest
intraday drop since the comparable period ended January 3.  Investors have been bolstered by central banks’ commitments
to take steps to aid the recovery of the global economy and to
stimulate the credit markets. The People’s Bank of China said in
a statement yesterday that it has provided financing to some
financial institutions to stabilize interbank lending rates and
that it will use short-term liquidity operations to ensure
steady markets.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
