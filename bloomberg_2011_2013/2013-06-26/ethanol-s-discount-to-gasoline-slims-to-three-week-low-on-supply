Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
tightened to the narrowest in three weeks after a government
report showed record-low seasonal supply of the biofuel while
output increased.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 2.68 cents to
26.46 cents a gallon, the smallest gap since June 5, after an
Energy Information Administration report showed  production  of
the fuel jumped to the highest level in three weeks while
 stockpiles  declined to a two-week low.  “The report was friendly, more ethanol production, less
supply, nothing bearish about it,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst
at Northstar Commodity Investments LLC in  Minneapolis .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.466 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices are up 13 percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery fell 0.68 cent, or 0.2 percent,
to $2.7306 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, compared with about 94 percent the previous
week.  Production of the fuel climbed 1.4 percent to 885,000
barrels a day, the first time output has increased since May,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Stockpiles Slip  Stockpiles slipped 1 percent to 16.3 million barrels, about
22 percent lower than a year ago and a record seasonal low, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Supply of the fuel has struggled to rebound to levels prior
to last summer’s U.S. drought that wilted corn crops and raised
manufacturing costs for ethanol companies.  Corn for July delivery climbed 7.75 cents to $6.645 a
bushel in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the cost difference
between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
5 cents, down 1 cent from yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Higher prices for ethanol have led to increased  imports .
Foreign purchases fell 42 percent to 38,000 barrels a day last
week, EIA data show.  They still have averaged 20,000 barrels a day so far this
year, up from 7,000 barrels during the same period a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
