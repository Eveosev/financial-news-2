Orascom Construction  Industries
headed for the biggest surge in more than seven years after  OCI
NV (OCI)  obtained regulatory approval to buy shares of  Egypt ’s biggest
publicly traded company at an 18 percent premium.  Shares of the Cairo-based company surged 10 percent, the
maximum allowed in a single trading day and the most on a
closing basis since January 2006, to 238.09 Egyptian pounds at
12:55 p.m. in Cairo. Orascom Construction’s market value
advanced to 49.8 billion pounds ($7.1 billion). The company
known as OCI accounts for 29 percent of the benchmark EGX 30
Index, which jumped 2.6 percent.  OCI shareholders will be allowed to swap their stock for
shares in the Amsterdam-based OCI NV or sell them for 255 pounds
each, OCI NV said in a statement yesterday after the Egyptian
Financial Supervisory Authority approved the tender. The stock
closed at 216 pounds yesterday. The approval allows OCI to
delist from the Cairo bourse should less than 5 percent of its
shares remain outstanding after the tender is completed.  “We recommend taking the cash offer as we believe OCI’s
liquidity will likely be negatively impacted subsequent to the
completion of the transaction,” Cairo-based Beltone Financial
Holding said in a report today.  OCI NV shares  traded on Euronext Amsterdam increased 4.7
percent to $27.75, or the equivalent of 194.67 pounds, set for
the highest close since June 7.  The buyout offer for 50.2 million Orascom shares starts
tomorrow and ends July 28, according to an advertisement in
state-run Al Ahram newspaper today. Cairo-based CI Capital is
the deal’s adviser and execution broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
