Bank of  Canada  Deputy Governor
Timothy Lane said the central bank is working on ways to improve
the safety of the country’s “shadow banking” sector, which he
said is smaller than in the U.S.  Turning government-insured mortgages into easier-to-trade
securities is an important part of shadow banking in Canada,
Lane said a speech today in Toronto. He made no comment on the
outlook for Canada’s economy or monetary policy in the speech,
and said in response to an audience question afterward that
risks from the housing market have moderated.  “We are seeing a moderation over the last year in both the
buildup of household sector indebtedness and also related
imbalances in the housing market,” Lane said. “That doesn’t
mean to say that the risk has suddenly disappeared and it’s
still a risk that we are watching very closely.”  The central bank  has said  that shadow banking -- which
refers to financial activities that occur outside the regulated
banking system -- can provide benefits by offering a wider range
of services. That view contrasts with officials from other
countries who, since the global financial crisis, have called
for stricter curbs on some types of non-bank activities.  “The goal is to create incentives so that risk is
allocated and managed appropriately, both in banking and in
shadow banking activities, making the entire financial system
stronger and more resilient,” Lane said.  Canada’s shadow banking industry is equal to about 40
percent of the country’s gross domestic product, less than the
95 percent share in the U.S., Lane said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
