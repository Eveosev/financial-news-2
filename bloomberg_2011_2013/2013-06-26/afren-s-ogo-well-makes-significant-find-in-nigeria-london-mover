Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. oil explorer in
Africa and northern Iraq, rose in London after its Ogo well
discovered a “significant” light-oil field in Nigeria.  Afren gained 7.3 percent to 130.6 pence, the second biggest
gain on the benchmark  FTSE All-Share (ASX)  index. Its well was drilled
to 10,518 feet (3,206 meters) and encountered a 524 feet gross
hydrocarbon section, London-based Afren said in a statement.  “Based on evidence to date, targeted resources are likely
to be significantly in excess of previous estimates” of 78
million barrels of oil equivalent, Afren said.  Afren holds 23 percent of OPL 310, where the well is
located, and  Lekoil Ltd. (LEK)  and  Optimum Petroleum  own the rest.
Lekoil rose 9.6 percent to 38.375 pence in  London .  “It opens up an underexplored oil basin with potential for
further upside to pre-drill estimates,” FirstEnergy Capital LLC
said in a note.  Afren in May sold about 17 percent of OPL 310 to Lekoil for
about $50 million. The U.K. explorer bought a stake in the
license from Optimum in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
