Maurice “Hank” Greenberg can
continue his lawsuit challenging the U.S. bailout of his former
company,  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  without shareholder
derivative claims on behalf of the insurer, a judge ruled.  Greenberg and other minority shareholders “have adequately
alleged that they conveyed a portion of the economic value and
voting power to the government and as a result suffered a direct
and substantial impact to their own property rights,” Judge
Thomas Wheeler of the Federal Claims Court in  Washington  wrote.  Wheeler today threw out derivative claims brought by
Greenberg’s Starr International Inc., while saying he is
“troubled that counsel for the Treasury Department (the
defendant agency) made threatening statements to AIG’s board
members.”  “We are pleased that the Court of Federal Claims has
denied the motion of the United States and permitted Starr
International to pursue the claims of two classes of AIG
shareholders for tens of billions of dollars that the government
took without just compensation and/or illegally exacted in 2008
and 2009,”  David Boies , of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, an
attorney for Starr, said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is Starr International Co. v. U.S., 1:11-cv-00779,
U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
