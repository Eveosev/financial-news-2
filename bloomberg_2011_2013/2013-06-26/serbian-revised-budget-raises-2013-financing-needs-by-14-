Serbia ’s financing needs will rise
14 percent this year as the government seeks to cover the
widening budget gap and service its debts.  Total financing needs rose to 630.9 billion dinars ($7.2
billion) from 554.4 billion dinars in the original 2013 budget.
Serbia will add 65 billion dinars to local market borrowing,
raising the full-year total to 330 billion dinars, it said in a
revised 2013 budget draft posted on parliament’s  website .  The 11-month old government of Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic 
adopted revisions yesterday as the former Yugoslav republic
seeks to strengthen the slipping economy and bring the widening
budget deficit under control before it begins formal membership
talks with the European Union.  “The current fiscal framework requires urgent additional
measures of fiscal consolidation,” the  Finance Ministry  said in
the draft budget. “In order to keep this year’s budget deficit
sustainable, it is necessary to immediately implement additional
fiscal adjustment on the spending side of at least 1 percent
of” gross domestic product.  The government asked lawmakers to approve the bill that
would contain the fiscal gap within 178.3 billion dinars, or 4.7
percent of GDP, from a previously planned 122 billion dinars, or
3.6 percent of GDP. The deficit reached 6 percent of GDP in the
first quarter.  The fiscal gap may balloon to 8 percent of GDP this year if
the government leaves policies unchanged, the  International
Monetary Fund  said on May 22.  Loan Concerns  The Washington-based lender refrained from negotiating a
new precautionary loan, which Serbia wants as proof to investors
that the government’s policies are on track.  Standard & Poor’s 
said in May the excessive fiscal deterioration could lead to a
downgrade in Serbia’s BB- credit rating.  Serbia will expand Eurobond sales by 32.8 billion dinars to
a full-year total of 221.2 billion dinars, or $2.5 billion,
leaving it with an outstanding issue of $1 billion after selling
$1.5 billion of seven-year bonds on Feb. 14.  Borrowing from foreign governments, banks and international
financial institutions is cut by 23.7 billion dinars to 77.3
billion dinars.  The government also increased the issuance of sovereign
guarantees for new borrowing by 26 million euros ($33.8 million)
to 507.5 million euros.  The revised budget used the average exchange rate of 116
dinars to the euro rather than 120 dinars to the euro in the
original 2013 budget, according to the government’s own
calculations presented in the document.  Weakening Dinar  Investor concern over Serbia’s fiscal slippage has
triggered a decline in the dinar, forcing the central bank to
sell 275 million euros on the  interbank market  since May 30. The
currency traded at 114.7450 to the euro at 12:41 p.m. in
Belgrade, or 0.2 percent lower, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Prospects that the U.S. Federal Reserve will gradually end
bond purchases by mid-2014 also reduced the relative
attractiveness of developing-nation assets, triggering a sell-off in global markets.  The government sold only a fifth of the bonds offered to
investors yesterday, while yields on Serbian 10-year Eurobond
maturing in 2021 fell 23 basis points on the day to 7.19 percent
at 12:45 p.m. in Belgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
