Maria Sharapova lost her second-round match at Wimbledon as men’s sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga
and women’s No. 2 seed Victoria Azarenka were among a record
seven players who dropped out of the grass-court tournament
today.  Sharapova of  Russia  was upset by Michelle Larcher de Brito,
a qualifier ranked 128 places below her. The Portuguese player
beat the 2004 champion 6-3, 6-4, on Court 2 at the All England
Club in London. It was the earliest loss at the grass-court
tennis tournament for Sharapova since 2009. Larcher de Brito,
ranked 131st on the women’s WTA tour, had never before reached
the third round.  “It was unbelievable, it’s probably the best win of my
career,” Larcher de Brito said in a televised interview. “I
just tried to stay calm.”  Sharapova had shouted “how many times” after she fell on
the grass at the end of the first set. She fell again at 3-2 in
the second set, and spoke to the umpire about conditions.  Former No. 1-ranked Caroline Wozniacki rolled her ankle on
the same court earlier today in a loss to Petra Cetkovska of the
Czech Republic. Britain’s Andy Murray, last year’s runner-up,
defeated  Taiwan ’s Yen-Hsun Lu, while  Germany ’s Dustin Brown
upset 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt.  Seven players quit the tournament today because of illness
or injury, which the International Tennis Federation said
probably is a single-day record in the professional era of the
sport. Ten player have left since the start of the tournament.  Injuries Mount  No. 10 Marin Cilic quit. Azarenka, the Australian Open
champion, along with Steve Darcis and Yarovlava Shvedova,
withdrew. Tsonga of France, American John Isner and Radek Stepanek quit during matches because of injuries. After 2 1/2
days of the tournament, nine players have left with illness or
injury.  Azarenka pulled out with a right-knee injury shortly before
her match against  Italy ’s Flavia Pennetta. The 23-year-old from
Belarus was hurt when she slipped on the grass two days ago in a
win over  Portugal ’s Maria Joao Koehler.  Azarenka said the court was “slippery” during that match
and that her opponent had fallen twice. Others also fell
afterward, she said.  “So I don’t know if it’s the court or the weather,” she
said at a news conference today. “I can’t figure it out. Would
be great if the club or somebody who takes care of the court
just would examine or try to find an issue so that wouldn’t
happen. Because there is nothing I’ve done wrong that cost me to
just withdraw from Wimbledon.”  Richard Lewis, chief executive officer of the All England
Club, said in an e-mail there have been no changes in the
preparation of the courts.  No Changes  “The court preparation has been to exactly the same
meticulous standard as in previous years and it is well known
that grass surfaces tend to be more lush at the start of an
event,” said Lewis, who said the organizers “sympathize” with
the players who quit. “The factual evidence, which is
independently checked, is that the courts are almost identical
to last year, as dry and firm as they should be, and we expect
them to continue to play to their usual high quality.”  It’s the first year that Eddie Stubley is head groundsman
at the All England Club. Eddie Seaward, who looked after the
Wimbledon lawns for 23 years, left after the London Olympics
last year. Stubley has worked at the club for 19 years.  Cetkovska, a qualifier from the Czech Republic, beat
Wozniacki, the ninth seed from Denmark, 6-2, 6-2, while  Canada ’s
Eugenie Bouchard defeated No. 12 Ana Ivanovic of  Serbia , 6-3,
6-3. Murray, the men’s second seed, beat Lu 6-3, 6-3, 7-5 and
Spain’s Nicolas Almagro defeated Guillaume Rufin of France.  Sloane Stephens, the No. 17 seed from the U.S. who reached
the Australian Open  semifinals earlier this season, beat
Germany’s Andrea Petkovic in three sets.  Brown Upset  Brown of Germany upset Hewitt of Australia 6-4, 6-4, 6-7
(3-7), 6-2.  “I cried like a little girl,” Brown said in a news
conference. “Just happy and emotional and everything. I have a
lot of friends here, my coach is here, my girlfriend is here.
Just been a very long way. Just happy that I actually got
through the match.”  Tsonga retired because of injury before the fourth set
against Ernests Gulbis of  Latvia . The Frenchman won the first
set before dropping the next two.  Cilic, of  Croatia , withdrew before his match with  France ’s
Kenny De Schepper, while Darcis of  Belgium  pulled out with a
shoulder injury before his match with Lukasz Kubot of  Poland .  Darcis, ranked 135th in the world, scored one of the
biggest upsets in tennis history by beating two-time champion
Rafael Nadal two days ago. The Spaniard, a 12-time major
champion, had never before lost in the first round of a major.  Darcis Exits  “Not to go on the court today, it’s maybe the biggest
disappointing thing I have had to do,” Darcis told reporters,
adding he hurt his shoulder during a fall in the first set
against Nadal, and the pain had grew worse at night. “No chance
I can play. I cannot serve. Even on the forehand side, I cannot
hit a ball. Makes no sense to go on the court to withdraw after
two games.”  Isner retired with a knee injury after 15 minutes of his
second-round match Adrian Mannarino of France. The 18th-seeded
player, who won the longest match in tennis history, 11 hours, 5
minutes, at Wimbledon three years ago, had been the highest-ranked American man left in the singles draw.  Stepanek of the Czech Republic retired with a hamstring
injury as he trailed Poland’s Jerzy Janowicz 6-2, 5-3 on Court
12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
