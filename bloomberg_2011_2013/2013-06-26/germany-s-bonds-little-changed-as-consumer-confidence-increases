Euro-area bonds rose, led by
peripheral nations such as Italy and  Spain (GSPG10YR) , as European Central
Bank President Mario Draghi’s pledge that monetary policy will
stay accommodative boosted the appeal of fixed-income assets.  Germany ’s  10-year bund yield  fell the most in three months
after Draghi told the French National Assembly that policy
makers stood ready to act to support growth in the region.
Italy’s 10-year yield dropped from the highest level in four
months before the nation sells up to 5 billion euros ($6.51
billion) of five- and 10-year securities tomorrow.  “This is a reflection that the market is expecting more”
from the ECB, said  Michael Leister , an interest-rate strategist
at Commerzbank AG in  London . “On the European side, rates have
overshot. There is good value in European fixed income.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 4.71 percent at 4:32 p.m. London time after
climbing to 4.93 percent, the highest level since Feb. 27. The
4.5 percent bond due in May 2023 rose 1.135, or 11.35 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 98.8.  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped 22 basis points to 4.85
percent, the biggest one-day decline on a closing basis since
Jan. 10.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield fell 24 basis points to 6.66
percent and  Greece ’s slipped 44 basis points to 10.99 percent.  The ECB’s monetary policy “will stay accommodative for the
foreseeable future,” Draghi said in Paris. “We have an open
mind about all other possible instruments that we may consider
proper to adopt.” An exit remains “very distant,” he told
reporters at a press conference.  Bunds Gain  Germany (GDBR10) ’s 10-year bund yield dropped five basis points to
1.76 percent, the biggest decline since March 27. The rate
climbed to 1.85 percent on June 24, the highest level since
April 4, 2012.  Euro-area sovereign bonds have slumped since Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 19 the U.S. may
slow asset purchases this year and end them in mid-2014.
