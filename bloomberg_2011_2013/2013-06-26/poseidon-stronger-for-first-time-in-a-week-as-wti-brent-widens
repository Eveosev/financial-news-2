Poseidon crude from the  Gulf of
Mexico  strengthened against West Texas Intermediate as the WTI-Brent spread widened after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  restarted a pipeline
section and inventories in  Oklahoma  grew.  Enbridge restarted part of Line 18 in Alberta after
shutting it over the weekend after a spill was discovered on an
adjacent line. The restart increases the amount of Canadian oil
Enbridge can transport to U.S. Midwest refineries, reducing
their demand for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil
in Cushing, Oklahoma.  The Energy Department reported that crude oil  inventories 
in Cushing rose 664,000 barrels last week, the first increase in
four weeks and the largest since April 12.  Brent’s premium to WTI grew to $6.16 a barrel today after
settling yesterday at $5.94, the lowest level since January
2011. Poseidon and other Gulf of Mexico crudes compete with
foreign oils priced against Brent for space in U.S. refineries.  Poseidon, a medium sour crude delivered to Houma,
 Louisiana , strengthened by $1.25 to a premium of $1.15 a barrel
versus WTI at 1:58 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the first time Poseidon gained against WTI since
June 19.  Mars Blend, Southern Green and  Thunder Horse , all medium-density crudes from the Gulf, also strengthened against WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the light, sweet benchmark on the
 Gulf Coast , weakened 30 cents to a premium of $7.60 a barrel to
WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 65 cents to a premium
of $7.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
