Members of the Icelandic central
bank’s policy board were unanimous on keeping Sedlabanki’s
benchmark interest rate unchanged at its June 11 meeting.  “Committee members agreed that the accommodative monetary
stance had supported the economic recovery in the recent term,”
according to the  minutes  published today. “It was still the
case that as spare capacity disappeared from the economy, it
would be necessary that slack in monetary policy should
disappear as well.”  Central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson “proposed that rates
be held unchanged” and all five board members “voted in favor
of the proposal,” the minutes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
