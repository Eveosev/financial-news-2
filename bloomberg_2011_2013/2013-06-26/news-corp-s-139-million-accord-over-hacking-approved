News Corp. (NWSA) , the media company headed
by  Rupert Murdoch , won approval of a $139 million settlement of
investor lawsuits claiming directors ignored employee
misconduct, including phone-hacking.  The settlement of claims that the board turned a blind eye
to journalists’ illegal reporting tactics, including paying
bribes and hacking into celebrities’ phones, “is reasonable,
fair and adequate,”  Delaware  Chancery Court Judge John Noble
said today at a hearing in Dover.  As part of the derivative accord, the $139 million is being
paid to News Corp. out of insurance covering directors.  Noble also approved $28 million in legal fees and expenses
for investors’ lawyers to be paid from the insurance proceeds.  News Corp. officials continue facing fallout from the
scandal over the company’s newsgathering tactics. Last week,
prosecutors said a journalist at News Corp.’s Sun tabloid
newspaper in  London  and a corrections officer are facing
criminal charges over bribes paid for information about
operations at English prisons.  Nathaniel Brown, a spokesman for New York-based News Corp.,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
court’s approval.  The case is In re News Corp. Shareholder Derivative
Litigation, CA 6285, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
