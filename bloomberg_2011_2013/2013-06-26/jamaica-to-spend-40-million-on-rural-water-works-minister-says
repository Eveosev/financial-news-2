Jamaica plans to develop 26 water
projects over the next three years, much of it in rural
communities across the island, at an estimated cost of $40
million, according to Water, Land, Environment and Climate
Change Minister Robert Pickersgill.  The minister said about 250,000 residents will benefit from
the increased access to potable water for projects slated for
implementation by Rural Water Supply Ltd., the Jamaica
Information Service said, citing a June 21 announcement by the
minister during the commissioning of a local water system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
