Gasoline slipped after a report that
U.S. inventories of the motor fuel increased last week. Crack
spreads narrowed.  Futures sank as much as 0.8 percent. The industry-funded
 American Petroleum Institute  reported that  gasoline stockpiles 
rose 1.33 million barrels in the week ended June 21. A Bloomberg
survey projects the Energy Information Administration will
report today that supplies increased 875,000 barrels.  “For products, you’re now going to look to the EIA for
direction,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at
Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in  London . “It doesn’t
seem that demand is enough to absorb the ample inventories.”  July-delivery gasoline fell 0.68 cent, or 0.3 percent, to
$2.7306 a gallon at 9:54 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume was 26 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day. Prices have declined 1.7 percent
this month and are down 2.9 percent in 2013.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI dropped 18 cents to
$18.94 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent slipped 43 cents
to $12.75 a barrel.  The EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department, is
scheduled to report last week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. today
in  Washington .  In the week ended June 14, EIA data showed total U.S.
 gasoline supplies  at a nine-week high and  crude inputs  were the
most since December, indicating more stock increases. Gasoline
 demand  over four weeks was 0.4 percent below a year earlier.  Under Pressure  “If the EIA confirms the API, the market is going to come
under pressure,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “Gasoline inventories have continued
to build as we enter the peak driving season.”  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, slipped 1.3
cents to $3.541 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today
on its website. Prices have retreated 14 consecutive days and
are the lowest since May 7.  The EIA will probably report that distillates, including
heating oil and diesel, increased 650,000 barrels, according to
the median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg. The
API reported that  distillate  supplies rose 537,000 barrels.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for July delivery slipped 0.18 cent
to $2.8566 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on volume that
was 20 percent below the 100-day average. Prices have increased
2.3 percent this month, narrowing the year’s decline to 6.2
percent.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 2 cents to $24.76 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  fell
26 cents to $18.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
