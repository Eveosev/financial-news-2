Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  bought
about 150,000 metric tons of naphtha for delivery to Mailiao,
 Taiwan , in the first half of August, according to three traders
who participate in the market.  Taiwanâ€™s only publicly traded oil refiner bought the
cargoes earlier this week at parity to Japan benchmark prices,
the traders said, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
