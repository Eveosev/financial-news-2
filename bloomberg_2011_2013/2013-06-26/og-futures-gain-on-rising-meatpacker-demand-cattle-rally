Hog futures climbed on signs of
increasing demand for U.S. animals from meatpackers. Cattle
prices also gained.  Meatpackers processed about 798,000 hogs in the first two
days of this week, up 1.7 percent from the previous week, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale  pork  added 0.7
percent to $1.0988 a pound yesterday, the highest since Aug. 10,
2011, USDA data show.  “I’m still hearing that packers are looking for pigs,”
 Christian Mayer , a market analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investments in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “The
demand is there because the packer margins are pretty good.”  Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.7 percent to 98.4
cents a pound at 10:04 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The contract increased 1.2 percent in 2013 through yesterday.  Cattle futures for August delivery added 0.6 percent to
$1.21875 a pound on the CME.  Wholesale  beef  slipped 0.8 percent to $1.9757 a pound
yesterday, the lowest since April 30, government data show.
Prices are down 6.5 percent from $2.1137 reached on May 23, the
highest since at least January 2004, USDA data show.  “Beef probably has come down to a level that’s found some
demand,” Mayer said.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.3
percent to $1.48275 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
