Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR) ’s venture
with  Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC)  agreed to sell its last
asset, an office and residential property near Regent’s Park in
 London ’s West End, to PCW Property Holding Ltd. for 105 million
pounds ($162 million).  The property, Park Crescent West, generates annual income
of about 2.2 million pounds, Great Portland said in a statement
today. Great Capital Partnership was set up in 2007 and is
expected to “wind down” before the end of July, Capital &
Counties Chief Executive Officer Ian Hawksworth said last year.  “Following the sale of Park Crescent East in April 2012,
this disposal represents the culmination of Great Capital
Partnership’s asset sales,” Hawksworth said in the statement.
“In line with the strategy it allows significant capital to be
returned to the joint venture partners for re-allocation within
their respective groups.”  London developers are selling properties to raise money for
development while bank finance remains scarce. Great Portland,
 Land Securities Group Plc (LAND)  and British Land Co. are building
office properties in the city to benefit from growing demand at
a time when supply is declining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
