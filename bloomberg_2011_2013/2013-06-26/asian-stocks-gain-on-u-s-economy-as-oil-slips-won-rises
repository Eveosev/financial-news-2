Stocks rose around the world as
Chinese money-market rates decreased and slower-than-estimated
U.S. economic growth spurred speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will be in no rush to reduce stimulus. Treasuries rallied while
silver and gold sank to the lowest since 2010.  The MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 1 percent at 4
p.m. in  New York  and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1
percent to 1,603.26, extending its two-day advance to almost 2
percent. The cost of locking in  China ’s interest rates fell for
a fourth day, the longest run of declines since February. Gold
and silver slumped more than 3 percent as the Dollar Index
climbed for a sixth straight day, its longest rally in 13
months. Treasury 10-year note  yields  lost seven basis points to
2.54 percent.  Global equities declined about 4.1 percent in June,
trimming this year’s gain to 3.7 percent, as the Federal Reserve
said it may taper monetary stimulus and investors speculated
rising Chinese funding costs will slow its economy. German
 consumer confidence  is set to increase next month, an industry
report showed today, while the U.S. revised lower its reading
for first-quarter economic growth. China’s central bank will use
tools to safeguard money-market stability and tight liquidity is
set to ease, it said yesterday.  “We’ve had a relatively sharp selloff over a couple of
days and we’re getting a bounce here,” James Gaul, a portfolio
manager at Boston Advisors LLC, which oversees about $2.6
billion in assets, said in a phone interview. “Weaker economic
numbers may be met with favor by the market because it can
suggest that the Fed can slow the tapering process or not taper
if the economy looks weaker than expected.”  Rally Extended  The S&P 500 extended yesterday’s 1 percent advance and
trimmed its June decline to 1.7 percent. The benchmark index is
up 2.2 percent in the second quarter and 12 percent in 2013.  Gross domestic product expanded at a revised 1.8 percent
annualized rate from January through March, down from a prior
estimate of 2.4 percent, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in  Washington . Household purchases, which account
for about 70 percent of the economy, were revised to a 2.6
percent advance compared with the 3.4 percent gain estimated
last month.  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker 
said he expects the U.S. expansion to remain “sluggish” for
“a couple more years,” and today’s downward revision to first-quarter growth is in line with his outlook. Lacker said he sees
growth of about 2.25 percent next year.  ‘Disappointing Rate’  “The economy is telling us this is about all we’re capable
of right now,” Lacker, who doesn’t vote on the  Federal Open
Market Committee  this year, said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview with  Peter Cook . “We’re going to continue to get
growth at a fairly disappointing rate going forward.”  Gauges of health-care, utility and consumer-discretionary
companies rose more than 1.2 percent to lead gains in  all 10  of
the main industry groups in the  S&P 500 .  Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. paced an advance
in banks, climbing at least 0.7 percent. Boeing Co., Home Depot
Inc. and Microsoft Corp. jumped at least 2 percent to lead gains
in the the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . Barrick Gold Corp. and
Newmont Mining Corp. fell more than 5 percent, leading a selloff
in precious-metal producers.  European Markets  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.7 percent, extending
its rebound from a six-month low as 18 of 19 industry groups
advanced. The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600
companies was in line with the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The VStoxx Index of options prices on the
Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell for a second day, losing 6.6 percent to
this week’s low of 22.55.  Colruyt SA jumped 8.3 percent, the most in almost a year,
after Belgium’s biggest discount food retailer reported earnings
that topped estimates. Afren Plc, a U.K. oil explorer in  Africa 
and northern  Iraq , rallied 7.3 percent after discovering a
“significant” light oil field in  Nigeria .  The Stoxx 600 has retreated 5.4 percent in June, poised for
its first  monthly decline  since May 2012. The gauge fell 3.2
percent this quarter, trimming this year’s advance to 1.7
percent.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose for a second day,
adding 1.9 percent for its biggest gain since January. The gauge
has dropped 11 percent so far this month, extending its 2013
decline to 14 percent. That compares with a 6.5 percent gain
this year for the MSCI World Index of developed countries.  China Rates  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index surged 5.7 percent
today, the most since 2008. Benchmark gauges in Russia,  Turkey ,
Indonesia, Thailand and  Taiwan  jumped more than 1.2 percent.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
rallied 3.3 percent, rebounding from the lowest level since
October 2011. The one-year  swap , the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, slid 20 basis
points to 3.875 percent. The overnight repo  rate  dropped 40
basis points to 5.6 percent, according to a daily fixing
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It reached a
record 12.85 percent on June 20 and has averaged 3.14 percent
this year.  The People’s Bank of China has provided liquidity to some
financial institutions to stabilize money-market rates,
according to a release yesterday. The statement is the first
public confirmation of central bank action to ease a crunch that
sent the overnight repurchase  rate  to a record. Premier  Li Keqiang  is seeking to wring speculative lending out of the
banking system after credit expansion outpaced economic growth.  ‘Calmed Markets’  “The Chinese central bank’s liquidity pledge has calmed
markets in the short term, but the picture is not that clear in
the medium term,” said Jean-Paul Jeckelmann, chief investment
officer at Banque Bonhote & Cie. in Neuchatel,  Switzerland , who
helps manage $1.4 billion in equities.  European Central Bank policy makers including President
 Mario Draghi  said they’ll maintain a loose  monetary stance for
as long as needed, while urging euro area governments to cut
their deficits and boost investment.  The ECB’s monetary policy “will stay accommodative for the
foreseeable future,” Draghi said today in a speech at the
French National Assembly in Paris. “We have an open mind about
all other possible instruments that we may consider proper to
adopt.” An exit is “very distant,” he said at a press
conference.  European bond markets rallied, with Spain’s 10-year yield
falling 23 basis points to 4.85 percent, Italy’s decreasing 15
points to 4.70 percent, Germany’s dropping four basis points to
1.77 percent and Britain’s declining eight basis points to 2.46
percent.  Treasury Volatility  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch  MOVE index  fell for the first time in seven days
yesterday. The measure dropped to 108.44 after reaching 110.98
on June 24, the highest since November 2011. It has averaged
61.91 this year.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Sovereign Plus Index lost 2.30 percent this quarter
through yesterday, set for the worst performance since the
indexes began tracking the data on Dec. 31, 1996. While the
average yield on the securities climbed to 1.79 percent from
1.43 percent on March 31, it is still below the mean of 2.06
percent for the past five years.  The  Dollar Index  gained 0.5 percent today, leaving it
little changed for the quarter. The euro weakened for a sixth
day against the dollar, slipping 0.5 percent to $1.3009.  Currency Volatility  The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index rose to 11.52
percent after touching 11.96 percent on June 24, the highest
since June 2012. The average for 2013 is 9.2 percent. Three-month implied volatility on the Australian dollar has risen the
most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg this quarter.  The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities lost 0.1 percent,
paring an earlier slide of as much as 1 percent. Gold for
immediate delivery fell to $1,226.22 an ounce, and is heading
for a quarterly drop of 23 percent, the most since at least
1920. Silver is down 34 percent for the second quarter, the most
since 1980. Silver and gold fell to the lowest price since 2010
today.  Copper dropped 1.2 percent and West Texas Intermediate oil
fluctuated near $95 a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
