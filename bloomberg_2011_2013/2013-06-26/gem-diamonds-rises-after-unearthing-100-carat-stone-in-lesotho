Gem Diamonds Ltd. (GEMD)  rose the most in
more than nine months in London trading after discovering a 100-carat white diamond at its Letseng mine in Lesotho.  Gem rose as much as 7.7 percent, the steepest intraday gain
since Sept. 6, and traded at 121.5 pence at 8:13 a.m. The
diamond is the third stone larger than 100 carats found at
Letseng since May, Gem said in a statement today.  “Following recent sales, we believe that this stone could
fetch offers greater than $5 million,” Numis Securities Ltd.
said in a note to investors.  Letseng, once operated by  De Beers , was bought by Gem in
2006 for $118.5 million. The mine has produced some of the
world’s biggest diamonds including the 603-carat  Lesotho 
Promise, the largest diamond unearthed this century, and a 550-carat stone that was discovered in 2011.  Gem said that its average selling price was $2,087 a carat
in June compared with $1,599 a carat in its first three tenders
of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
