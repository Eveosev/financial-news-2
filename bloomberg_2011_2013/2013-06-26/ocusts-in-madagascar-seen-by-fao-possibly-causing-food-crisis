Locusts in Madagascar are “largely
uncontrolled” and a food crisis may emerge, with two-thirds of
the country infested by September, the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization said.  The island, where the main staple is rice, needs $22
million for emergency controls, the FAO said in a statement on
its website today. It has issued warnings about the  locusts  and
called for financial support since August.  “If we don’t act now, the plague could last years and cost
hundreds of millions of dollars,” FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva said. “This could very well be a last window
of opportunity to avert an extended crisis.”  The  locust plague , which has infested over half of
Madagascar’s cultivated land and pastures, poses a food and
livelihood threat to 13 million people, or 60 percent of the
island’s population, according to the FAO. About 80 percent of
the population lives on less than $1 a day.  Rice production losses are estimated to be as much as
630,000 metric tons, or 25 percent of the country’s demand, the
FAO said.  Locusts have destroyed 40 percent to 70 percent of the
country’s rice and corn crops and more in some areas, according
to the FAO report.  Funding needs to be allocated by July to start an anti-locust campaign in September, otherwise the plague could last
for several years, the FAO said. More than $41.5 million is
needed over the next three years to deal with the plague.  To contact the reporters on this story:
