Treasuries gained, pushing 10-year
yields down the most in almost two weeks, as data showed the
 U.S. economy  grew less than previously estimated, easing concern
the  Federal Reserve  is moving closer to slowing its bond buying.  Ten-year notes  rose for the first time in eight days,
ending the longest stretch of declines since March 2012.
Richmond Fed Bank President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he expects the
U.S. expansion to remain “sluggish.” Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said last week policy makers may slow stimulus this
year if the economy grows in line with their projections.  “We are still in a low-growth environment,” said  Jay Mueller , who manages about $3 billion of bonds at Wells Capital
Management in  Milwaukee . “The selloff in rates was fast, and we
are seeing some retracement. Rates should stay near these levels
until we get closer to the Fed actually intervening. And that
will depend on the economy.”  The benchmark 10-year yield dropped seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 2.54 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was the most on a
closing basis since June 13. The yield slid earlier as much as
10 basis points to 2.51 percent after touching 2.66 percent on
June 24, the highest level since August 2011.  The price of the 1.75 percent security due in May 2023
gained 19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 5/32.  The current five-year note yield decreased seven basis
points to 1.42 percent after climbing to 1.56 percent on June
24, the highest since July 2011.  Volume Slips  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , declined 4 percent to
$459 billion. The 2013 average is $375 billion.  A technical gauge signaled that the increase in Treasury
10-year yields may have been too rapid. The 14-day relative-strength  index  climbed yesterday to 79.8 and was at 72.1 today.
A level above 70 shows yields may be set to change direction.  “Any time there is data suggesting that the selloff is
overdone after the extent of the weakness we have seen, you will
see some giveback,” said  Adrian Miller , New York-based director
of fixed-income strategies at GMP Securities LLC. “There is
still a question if we are getting to enough to propel the
economy forward.”  Treasuries climbed after the Commerce Department reported
U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a revised 1.8 percent
annualized rate from January through March, down from a prior
estimate of 2.4 percent.  Fed Purchases  The Fed has been buying $85 billion of U.S. government debt
and mortgage securities every month to put downward pressure on
borrowing costs in the third round of buying under its
quantitative-easing stimulus strategy. The asset-purchase
programs, which began in 2008, have lifted the central bank’s
assets to $3.5 trillion from below $1 trillion five years ago.  Bernanke, speaking on June 19 after a two-day meeting of
the  Federal Open Market Committee , said tapering the purchases
would depend on economic growth in line with the Fed’s
estimates. Policy makers are  forecasting  growth of as much as
2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent next year.  Lacker said he sees growth of about 2.25 percent next year.
The central bank isn’t close to reducing its bond holdings, he
said in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Peter Cook .  “The economy is telling us this is about all we’re capable
of right now,” Lacker, who doesn’t vote on the FOMC this year,
said. “We’re going to continue to get growth at a fairly
disappointing rate going forward.”  Lacker, who dissented in September 2012 against the
announcement of a third round of bond purchases by the Fed, said
he would be “fine with us tapering it off right now.”  Note Auction  Treasuries remained higher after the U.S. auctioned $35
billion of five-year securities to the lowest demand in almost
four years. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.45
percent, the least since September 2009. The average for the
previous 10 auctions was 2.84.  The  offering  drew a yield of 1.484 percent, the highest
since July 2011, compared with a forecast of 1.472 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.
The yield was 0.71 percent at the April sale.  “Overall the auction was fair, but interest is not amazing
for Treasuries right now,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, which as a
primary dealer is obliged to bid in U.S. debt sales. “There is
still concern, uncertainty and volatility.”  Bidder Participation  Indirect bidders,  an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 53 percent of the notes, the most since
January 2010. That compared with an average of 41.7 percent at
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury,  bought  3.6 percent of the
securities, the lowest level since November 2009, versus 23.3
percent at the May offering. The average at the past 10 auctions
was 16.9 percent.  The government will auction $29 billion of seven-year debt
tomorrow. It sold $35 billion of two-year notes yesterday.  Treasuries have  lost  2 percent this month and 3 percent
this year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index.  The 10-year  real yield , the difference between the
benchmark U.S. note yield and the annual inflation rate,
narrowed to 1.17 percentage points today after widening to 1.25
percentage points yesterday, the most since March 2011. It
averaged 1.13 over the past decade.  The yield gap between 10-year notes and Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities, a measure of trader expectations for
inflation over the life of the debt called the  break-even  rate,
was 1.95 percentage points after shrinking to 1.81 percentage
points on June 24, the narrowest since October 2011. The average
over the past year is 2.38 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
