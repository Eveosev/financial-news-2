Brazil defeated Uruguay 2-1 to reach
the final of soccer’s Confederations Cup, a warmup tournament
for next year’s  World Cup .  Brazil led 1-0 at halftime on a 41st-minute goal by Fred.
Edinson Cavani tied it three minutes after the interval and
Paulinho got the winning goal four minutes before the end of the
game at Estadio Mineirao in  Belo Horizonte .  Brazil -- which will host the World Cup from June 12 to
July 13, 2014 -- will face the winner of tomorrow’s semifinal
between world and European champion Spain and Italy in the June
30 final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
