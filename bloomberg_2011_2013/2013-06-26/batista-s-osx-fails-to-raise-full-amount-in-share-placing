OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3)  rose the most in a
month after billionaire  Eike Batista  and other shareholders paid
almost 30 times the market price to buy stock in the crude
shipper as it struggles for cash.  OSX, which plunged 87 percent this year through yesterday,
jumped 16 percent to 1.58 reais in Sao Paulo, the steepest gain
since May 21.  Brazil ’s benchmark Ibovespa rose 0.6 percent.  Batista, who gave OSX the right to sell him as much as $1
billion of its stock at 40.14 reais apiece through March 2014,
bought 183 million reais ($83 million) along with other
subscribing shareholders yesterday, the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said after markets closed. Shareholders have another
five days to subscribe to the 240 million-real tranche of the
put option, after which Batista will buy any remaining stock
offered, according to terms of the sale.  OSX, the worst performer among Latin American companies
worth at least $100 million this year, is cutting costs and
refinancing debt after Batista’s oil producer OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA, its main client, missed output targets.  The company declined to disclose the amount bought by
Batista yesterday or to name the other shareholders that
subscribed to the offering in an e-mailed response to questions.
OSX had already raised $620 million in other sales related to
Batista’s put option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
