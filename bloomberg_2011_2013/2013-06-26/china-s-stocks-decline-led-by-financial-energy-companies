China’s stocks  fell, sending the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  to a four-year low, as financial and
energy companies retreated.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. led a gauge of
financial shares to its lowest level in six months. China
Shenhua Energy Co. sank 2.1 percent to the lowest level since
October 2008.  The Shanghai Composite Index lost 1 percent to 1,939.84 as
of 9:44 a.m. local time, heading for its sixth day of declines.
The CSI 300 Index slid 0.5 percent. The gauge entered a  bear
market  on June 24 after the People’s Bank of China signaled it
will maintain efforts to curb speculative lending.  One-year interest-rate  swaps  based on China’s seven-day
repurchase rate retreated 33 basis points to 3.75 percent after
the People’s Bank of China said it will use tools to ensure
money-market stability and that the cash crunch will abate. The
contract touched a record 5.06 percent June 20.  “The concern about the impact of the cash crunch on the
real economy still lingers among investors and the government’s
deleveraging among the financial system isn’t likely to come to
an end after the capital injection,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “The capital injection simply eases the  market
sentiment .”  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Chan Tien Hin,  Matthew Oakley   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
