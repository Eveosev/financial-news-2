Treasuries advanced, with 10-year
notes gaining for the first time in eight days, ending their
longest run of declines in more than a year.  Treasury inflation-linked securities headed for their
second-worst monthly slump on record before U.S. data tomorrow
that economists said will show the  Federal Reserve ’s preferred
measure of inflation was near an all-time low. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central bank may
reduce bond buying this year if economic growth is in line with
central bank projections. The U.S. will sell $35 billion of
five-year notes today.  “Treasuries appear to be consolidating after the recent
selloff but sentiment remains fragile,” said Nicholas Stamenkovic, a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Today’s five-year auction will provide a
good gauge of investor demand.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.58 percent at 6:49 a.m.  New York 
time. The 1.75 percent note due in May 2023 rose 9/32, or $2.81
per $1,000 face amount, to 92 27/32. The yield had risen for the
previous seven days, the longest run since the period ended
March 19, 2012.  Worst Quarter  Government bonds  around the world are poised for their
worst quarter since at least 1997, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes.  Securities in the Global Broad Market Sovereign Plus Index
lost 2.3 percent this quarter through yesterday, set for the
biggest decline since the indexes began tracking the data on
Dec. 31, 1996. While the average yield on the securities has
climbed to 1.79 percent from 1.43 percent on March 31, it is
still below the average of 2.06 percent for the past five years.  The Fed has been buying $45 billion of  U.S. government debt 
and $40 billion of mortgage securities every month to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs in the third round of its
quantitative-easing program.  Bernanke, speaking on June 19, said reducing bond purchases
would depend on the economy achieving the central bank’s
objectives. Policy makers are  forecasting  growth of as much as
2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014.  U.S. gross domestic product expanded 2.4 percent in the
first three months of this year, unchanged from the preliminary
reading, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before
the data is released today.  The five-year note yield declined four basis points to 1.45
percent after climbing to 1.56 percent on June 24, the highest
level since July 2011.  Previous Auction  The U.S. last sold five-year notes on May 29 at a yield of
1.045 percent, the highest since October 2011, and up from 0.71
percent in April. The securities being sold today yielded 1.45
percent in pre-auction trading.  The government auctioned $35 billion of two-year notes
yesterday and will sell $29 billion of seven-year debt tomorrow.  TIPS handed investors a 5.4 percent loss this month through
yesterday, according to an index compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. That would be the biggest monthly slide since
October 2008. The securities have lost 9.4 percent this year.  The  difference in yield  between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a measure of expectations for
inflation over the life of the debt, was little changed today at
1.98 percent after shrinking to 1.81 percentage points on June
24, the narrowest since October 2011.  “Core inflation measures show the trend of an increasing
slowdown,” said Shinichiro Kadota, a strategist for non-yen
debt at Barclays Plc in  Tokyo  “With the Fed expected to taper
bond buying, real yields will probably continue to
underperform,” he said, referring to inflation-linked notes.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index declined to 108.44
yesterday from 110.98 on June 24, which was the highest since
November 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
