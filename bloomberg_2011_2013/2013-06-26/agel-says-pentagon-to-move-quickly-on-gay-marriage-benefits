The Pentagon will provide benefits
to the same-sex spouses of military personnel after the  Supreme
Court  today struck down a law that had barred the federal
government from doing so, Defense SecretaryChuck Hagel said.  “The  Department of Defense  intends to make the same
benefits available to all military spouses -- regardless of
sexual orientation -- as soon as possible,” Hagel said today in
an e-mailed statement. “That is now the law, and it is the
right thing to do.”  The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, today overturned the
Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a
heterosexual union, saying it violates the rights of married gay
couples by denying them government benefits.  Among the benefits currently available to opposite-sex
spouses that will be extended are housing, medical and dental
provisions as well as burial privileges at Arlington National
Cemetery, according to a separate statement by the Defense
Department.  Within 12 weeks the Defense Department will begin to update
and process identification cards for same-sex military spouses,
the Pentagon said.  “We are carefully reviewing command sponsorship for
overseas tours, and all applicable Status of Forces
agreements,” the department also said, hinting at unresolved
issues such as whether gay married couples can live together in
overseas bases where that would conflict with cultural values of
a host nation.  The changes signal an end to the last remaining
distinctions dividing straight and gay service members. In 2011,
the Obama administration ended the “don’t ask, don’t tell”
policy that barred gays from serving openly in the armed forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
