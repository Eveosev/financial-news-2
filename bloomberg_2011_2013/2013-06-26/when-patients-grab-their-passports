The U.S. may be a leader in medical innovation, but the nation's notoriously high health care costs are enough to make patients want to hop a plane out of the country. And many do. Costs for certain procedures can be 90 percent cheaper in India and other countries, which are adding U.S.-accredited hospitals to attract foreigners.

So where is everyone going? We've put together  a piece  looking at the world's top travel destinations for medical tourism.
