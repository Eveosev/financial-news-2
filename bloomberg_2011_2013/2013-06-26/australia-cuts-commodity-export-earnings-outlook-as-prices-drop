Australia , the largest  iron ore 
shipper, lowered its forecast for earnings from the export of
minerals and energy resources after prices tumbled.  The value of exports may total A$197 billion ($182 billion)
in the year starting July 1, the Bureau of Resources and Energy
Economics said in a  report  today. That compares with A$205
billion forecast in March. Earnings are set to total A$177
billion in the year ending June 30, less than the A$186 billion
previously estimated, and the first decline since 2009-2010, the
Canberra-based bureau said.  Iron ore has  tumbled  21 percent this year and slipped into
a  bear market  last month amid concerns slowing economic growth
in China, the world’s biggest metals consumer, will reduce
demand. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  China  International Capital
Corp. this week joined banks from Barclays Plc to HSBC Holdings
Plc in paring 2013 growth projections for China to 7.4 percent,
below the government’s 7.5 percent goal.  “Large fluctuations in equity and foreign exchange
markets, coupled with weakening sentiment have negatively
affected the price of some resource commodities, particularly
precious and base metals,” Quentin Grafton, the bureau’s
executive director, said in a separate statement. An assumed
depreciation of the Australian dollar in 2013–2014 will provide
support for Australian dollar-denominated resource and energy
exports, he said.  Coal at Newcastle has dropped 10 percent in 2013, extending
a 19 percent slump last year, the most since 2005, according to
IHS McCloskey, a Petersfield, England-based data provider.
Gold’s 24 percent slump this year, the biggest since a 33
percent plunge in 1981, comes after 12 years of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
