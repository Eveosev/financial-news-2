J.R. Smith will become an
unrestricted free agent on July 1 after rejecting a $2.93
million option from the Knicks, the  New York  Times reported.  The Knicks still can pay Smith a starting salary of $5.5
million or a maximum of $24.5 million over four years under the
team’s early-bird rights, the Times said.  Smith was selected as the National Basketball Association’s
sixth man of the year after averaging a career-best 18.1 points
per game this season. During the playoffs, he shot 33 percent
and was suspended for one game for elbowing  Boston ’s Jason Terry
in the chin.  The Knicks made qualifying offers to Chris Copeland and
Pablo Prigioni, which makes them restricted free agents. While
the Knicks can still match outside offers to the two players,
they are over the cap and luxury-tax threshold and have a mid-level exception of $3.18 million to spend, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
