Macau Legend Development Ltd (1680) ., the
casino firm backed by former Macau lawmaker David Chow, may
raise as much as HK$2.8 billion ($361 million) in its initial
public offering after cutting the shares sold by more than half.  The company is offering 934.8 million shares, lower than
the 2.05 billion it had earlier planned to sell, according to a
statement to the  Hong Kong  Stock Exchange today. The price range
is unchanged at HK$2.30 to HK$2.98 a share.  Macau Legend, which operates casino venues under  SJM
Holdings Ltd. (880) , is cutting the size of its IPO after Asian
markets have dropped amid concerns that a cash crunch in  China 
could slow economic growth there. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang
Seng index has lost about 11 percent so far in June.  Key assets of the company include the Landmark Macau hotel,
the  Pharaoh’s Palace  casino and the Macau Fisherman’s Wharf
complex. Macau Legend doesn’t have a casino license of its own.
Trading is expected to start July 5 in Hong Kong.  SJM is one of just six operators in Macau that have
government permission to run their own casinos. It operates some
casinos in partnership with companies that don’t have their own
licenses.  Mainland Chinese tourists have helped turn Macau into the
world’s largest gambling hub, with $38 billion in casino revenue
last year, more than six times the  Las Vegas Strip . Chow served
as a legislator in Macau from 2005 to 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
