CDW Corp. is cutting the  price range 
for its initial public offering as U.S. stocks decline, said a
person familiar with the matter.  The technology-supply company owned by Madison Dearborn
Partners LLC and Providence Equity Partners Inc. told
prospective institutional investors that it’s offering shares at
$17 to $18 each, said the person, who asked not to be named
because the information hasn’t been officially disclosed.
Madison Dearborn and Providence, which had both planned to sell
shares in the IPO, have decided not to sell, said the person.  CDW had sought as much as $641.7 million in the IPO and
initially offered shares at $20 to $23 each, regulatory filings
show. The Vernon Hills, Illinois-based company may increase the
number of primary shares it’s offering in the sale to help
offset the lower price range, the person said.  Representatives at Madison Dearborn and Providence declined
to comment. A spokesman at CDW didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
