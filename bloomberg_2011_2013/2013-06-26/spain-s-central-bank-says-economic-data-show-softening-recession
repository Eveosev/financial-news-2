Spain ’s central bank said latest
data indicate the recession is softening, supporting the
government’s view that an  exports boom  may help end an economic
slump that has entered its sixth year.  “Taken together, the most recent information referring to
the second quarter shows an improvement in most demand and
activity indicators and an easing in the trend of contraction,”
the Madrid-based Bank of Spain said today in its  monthly
bulletin .  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos is counting on overseas
sales to foster growth in the euro region’s fourth-largest
 economy  in the three months starting July 1, even as
unemployment reached a record 27 percent amid the deepest budget
cuts in Spain’s democratic history.  Indicators for April and May including households’ and
retailers’ confidence as well as order books point to a slower
decline in domestic demand, the Bank of Spain said. At the same
time, average annual export growth of 10.9 percent for the same
months “underscore the vigor of foreign sales,” according to
the report.  While the government is counting on inflation to fall below
1 percent this year and make Spanish products more competitive,
figures released yesterday showed that producer prices jumped
0.8 percent in May from a year earlier due to energy prices
after falling 0.6 percent in April.  Data today showed that declines in mortgage lending are
persisting. June consumer prices and May’s retail sales are due
tomorrow, with April current account data scheduled to be
released on June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
