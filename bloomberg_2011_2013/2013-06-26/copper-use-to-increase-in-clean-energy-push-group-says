Copper will play an “integral
role” in the push for cleaner energy after President  Barack
Obama  announced a plan to limit carbon emissions, a policy group
in Washington said.  The metal is a key component in renewable energy because of
its efficiency in conducting power and use in solar panels, wind
turbines and electric automobiles, the  American Resources Policy
Network  said today in a statement. The group advocates policies
aimed at expanding mineral production in the U.S.  The centerpiece of the president’s plan, announced
yesterday, is a limit on carbon emissions from all power plants,
a move opposed by utilities including  Southern Co. (SO)  and  American
Electric Power Co. (AEP)  and Peabody Energy Corp., a coal producer.
The  proposal  also seeks to promote renewable-energy development
on federal lands, and energy-efficiency standards for appliances
and government buildings.  “Because copper is an excellent conductor of electricity,
it allows us to create and use energy at a very high level of
efficiency, while minimizing environmental impacts,” Daniel
McGroarty, the president of the policy network, said in the
statement. “A steady supply of copper is critical” for Obama’s
plan, he said.  Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , based in Phoenix, is
the world’s biggest publicly traded copper producer.  Through yesterday, copper futures in New York dropped 16
percent this year, partly because of increasing global
inventories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
