The largest exchange-traded fund
tracking the $3.7 trillion municipal-bond market had its best
two days since 2008 after falling to the cheapest price in two
years.  The  $3.4 billion  iShares S&P National AMT-Free Municipal
Bond Fund, known as MUB, traded at  $104.97 (MUB)  at 4 p.m. in  New
York , up 3.6 percent from June 24 in the biggest two-day rally
since Oct. 20, 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The price change reflects yields on 10-year benchmark state
and local bonds falling for the first time in a week to 2.93
percent today, after reaching the highest levels since April
2011, Bloomberg data show.  The rise in yields signals that’s it’s a good time to buy
municipal securities for their relative value and tax-exempt
income,  David Kotok , chief investment officer at Sarasota,
Florida-based Cumberland Advisors, said in a report released
today.  “We see no more attractive alternatives,” Kotok said.
“We are taking advantage of this very opportunistic time.”  While ETFs are similar to mutual funds that track an index
of equities, bonds or commodities, they are bought and sold on
 stock exchanges  and their prices may rise or fall more than the
value of the assets they hold.  For investors in the highest tax bracket, 39.6 percent, the
2.93 percent benchmark yield for 10-year munis is equivalent to
a taxable return of 4.85 percent, Bloomberg data show. The yield
on  U.S. Treasuries  maturing in 10 years fell to  2.54 percent 
today, according to Bloomberg data.  Highest Ratio  The ratio of the yield of munis to those on Treasuries is
about 115 percent, the highest since July 2012, Bloomberg data
show. The higher the ratio, the cheaper local debt is when
compared with equivalent U.S. government securities.  MUB’s price plummeted to $101.35 June 24, the lowest since
April 2011. It sold at a record 2.86 percent discount to the
value of its assets June 21 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may moderate purchases of
federal and mortgage debt in 2013 and end them around mid-2014
if the economy performs as forecast.  Improving investor sentiment toward munis today was also
reflected in a $1.3 billion sale of general-obligation debt by
 Illinois . The lowest-rated U.S. state was able to reduce yields
by 0.10 percentage points, to 4.46 percent, on an uninsured
portion of the issue maturing in July 2023, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
