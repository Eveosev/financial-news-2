Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) , the
biggest maker of life-science equipment by market value, plans
to expand in  China ’s $200 million environmental-monitoring
market as the nation enhances efforts to curb pollution.  “We’ll continue to see strong support from China for the
quality of our products,” Bob Muscat, vice president of
environmental and process monitoring, said today in a phone
interview. Demand will move from large to small cities “forcing
Thermo Fisher to develop new products as we expand the growth,”
he said.  Chinese authorities have sought to ease social unrest after
smog in Beijing hit hazardous levels in January. China’s plans
to build thousands of air-quality monitoring stations by 2015 is
spurring demand for equipment. The company has about 70 percent
market share for air-quality products in Chinese cities such as
Beijing,  Shanghai , Guangdong and Wuhan, he said.  The country may also seek equipment to measure soil and
water quality, benefiting  Thermo Fisher , Muscat said.  MET One Instruments Inc. from the U.S. and China’s  Focused
Photonics Hangzhou Inc. (300203)  and Hebei Sailhero Environmental
Protection High-tech Co. are among companies that compete with
Thermo Fisher to sell environmental-monitoring systems.  The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company, which opened a
manufacturing plant in Suzhou last year and announced a $9.5
million research and development center in China today, saw
revenue from the Asian nation grow by more than 20 percent in
2012, Muscat said, without giving specifics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
