Stocks in Switzerland  advanced for a
second day, paring a monthly decline for the benchmark  Swiss
Market Index (SMI) , as a gauge of German consumer confidence predicted
sentiment will improve in July.  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  led gains after the Wall Street Journal
reported that the largest maker of cancer drugs will share
early-stage research data with AstraZeneca Plc.  Cie. Financiere
Richemont SA (CFR)  rose 2.4 percent as Bank of America Corp. said the
stock should be in the core portfolio of long-term investors.  The Swiss Market Index climbed 1.3 percent to 7,496.77 at
11:15 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge is still heading for a decline
of 5.6 percent in June that would be the biggest monthly retreat
since July 2011. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
rallied 1.3 percent today.  German  consumer confidence  will rise to 6.8 next month from
6.5 in June, Nuremberg-based research company GfK AG said today.
That would be the highest since September 2007. Analysts had
expected a reading of 6.5, according to the median of 32
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 35 percent lower than the 30-day average today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Roche Partnership  Roche  advanced 2 percent to 223.30 Swiss francs. The
company struck a partnership with AstraZeneca to share data on
early-stage drug design, WSJ reported. Under the agreement, both
companies will contribute data to a third company, U.K.-based
MedChemica Ltd., WSJ said.  Richemont gained 2.4 percent to 81.70 francs. Bank of
America’s Merrill Lynch unit added the company to its so-called
“Europe 1” list, saying it expects the owner of the Cartier
brand to continue to take market share from smaller jewelers.  Swatch Group AG, the biggest maker of Swiss timepieces,
rose 1.5 percent to 504 francs. Sales at its Omega unit may
reach 2.5 billion francs ($2.7 billion) this year, Le Temps
reported, citing an interview with Stephen Urquhart, the
president of the business. He had earlier said the target would
be reached this year or 2014. Omega accounts for a third of
Swatch’s revenue, the paper said.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  gained 1.3 percent to 65.20 francs. The
drugmaker said its omalizumab drug met all objectives in a Phase
3 safety registration study to treat chronic spontaneous
urticaria, a form of skin rash also known as hives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
