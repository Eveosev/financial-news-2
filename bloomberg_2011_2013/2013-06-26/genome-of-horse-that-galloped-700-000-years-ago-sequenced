The genome of a horse that lived
700,000 years ago in  Canada ’s Yukon Territory suggests the
common ancestor for modern horses, zebras, and donkeys dates to
4 million years ago.  The DNA discovered from the ancient horse is 10 times as
old as any DNA retrieved so far, suggesting it may be possible
to get genetic information from animals that lived as long as 1
million years ago, according to a study released yesterday in
the journal  Nature .  The finding is remarkable because DNA, the hereditary
material in almost all organisms, generally starts to fragment
after an organism’s death, the researchers said. The group made
its discovery by matching the genetic material of the horse
found in Canada against DNA sequenced from a horse that lived
43,000 years ago; a  Przewalski horse , thought to be the last
wild horse; five modern domesticated breeds; and a donkey. The
finding also means that DNA pieces retrieved from old samples
may also have information about how the current world evolved,
the study authors wrote.  “Our study has pushed the timeframe of paleogenomics back
by almost an order of magnitude,” said the authors, led by
Ludovic Orlando, Aurelien Ginolhac, and Guojie Zhang, of the
universities of Copenhagen and BGI-Shenzhen.  The DNA was partly preserved by the cold environment, the
authors wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
