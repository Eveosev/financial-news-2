Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor
Co. had their credit-rating outlook raised by Moody’s Investors
Service Inc., which cited the Japanese carmakers’ recovery from
natural disasters and the benefits of a weaker yen.  Moody’s upgraded its outlook for Toyota and Honda to stable
from negative and affirmed their credit ratings at Aa3 and A1
respectively, according to statements by the New York-based
rating company.  The change for Toyota,  Japan ’s highest-rated  issuer , comes
a month after the company doubled the amount of a bond sale, its
first in eight months. Toyota sold 60 billion yen ($615 million)
in a two-part offering on May 30, including three-year notes
priced at 0.289 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It had originally planned to raise 30 billion yen.  Weighted average coupons on outstanding bonds sold by
Toyota have fallen to 2.63 percent from 4.07 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Toyota has effectively recovered from production
disruptions stemming from the earthquake and tsunami in 2011,
and the huge level of recalls that damaged its standing in the
U.S. market in 2009,” Moody’s said in the statement today.
Moody’s expects Toyota to “successfully expand its sales and
earnings over the next 12-24 months.”  Honda’s outlook change reflects the “substantial
improvement” in its operating performance in the past year and
the expectation that it will be sustained, Moody’s said in a
separate statement.  -- Editors: Chua Kong Ho, Dave McCombs  To contact the reporter on this story:
