John Isner , the U.S. tennis player
nicknamed the ‘Marathon Man’ for playing the longest tennis
match in history, today retired from the grass-court major with
a knee injury after 15 minutes.  Isner withdrew in the third game of his second-round match
on Court 3 against Adrian Mannarino of France at the All England
Club after he tweaked his left knee.  The 18th-seeded player had been the highest-ranked American
man left in the singles draw. Isner’s draw had opened up after
the opening-round upset of two-time champion  Rafael Nadal  of
Spain. The two had been scheduled to meet in the fourth round.  Isner, who missed the Australian Open at the start of the
season because of a knee ailment, beat  France ’s Nicolas Mahut in
the first round of Wimbledon three years ago in a match that
lasted 11 hours, 5 minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
