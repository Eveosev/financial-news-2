Chinese imports of coal to generate
electricity for summer is increasing demand for shipping as its
stockpiles drop, according to Commodore Research & Consultancy.  Two Capesizes and three Panamaxes were booked to carry coal
to  China  today, compared with seven vessels during all of last
week,  Jeffrey Landsberg , New York-based managing director of the
adviser to ship owners, said in an e-mailed report today.
Stockpiles at Qinhuangdao, the country’s main coal port, fell 6
percent since the end of last week to 6.7 million tons, below
the level that officials seek to maintain, Landsberg said.  “Peak summer electricity demand season in China is in full
effect and is contributing to the decline in coal stockpiles,”
Landsberg said in the report. “The increase in Chinese demand
for imported thermal coal cargoes has provided added support to
both the Capesize and Panamax markets.”  Daily earnings for Capesizes more than doubled since the
start of the month to $13,891, the highest since December,
according to the Baltic Exchange, the London-based publisher of
shipping costs. Panamaxes gained 23 percent to $7,759 in the
same period, Baltic Exchange figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
