Rates for tankers to ship Saudi
Arabian oil to  Japan , an industry benchmark route, slid an
eighth day as demand for the vessels slowed.  Costs for very large crude carriers shipping 2 million
barrel cargoes fell 2.8 percent to 37.93 Worldscale points,
according to the  Baltic Exchange  in  London  today. The rate
equates to earnings of $9,946 a day, according to the bourse.  The “weak trend” is because  oil companies  already booked
most of the ships they need for loading during the first 10 days
of July, meaning the pace of bookings has now slowed, Fearnley
Consultants A/S, an Oslo-based shipping researcher, said in an
e-mailed report today. There isn’t “much resistance” from
owners to prevent further declines, it said.  The VLCC market has about 20 percent surplus capacity, the
biggest glut since about 1985, Fearnley estimated June 13.
Supply and demand for the carriers will both expand by about 5
percent this year, according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s
largest shipbroker.  The largest one-day move for crude tankers globally was for
vessels taking 100,000 metric-ton cargoes of Russian oil to
 Europe . Costs for those fell 8.6 percent to 63.75 Worldscale
points, according to the exchange. Tankers hauling refined
petroleum to the U.S. Atlantic Coast from the Caribbean jumped
4.1 percent to 139.5 Worldscale points, the largest one-day move
among oil-product tankers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
