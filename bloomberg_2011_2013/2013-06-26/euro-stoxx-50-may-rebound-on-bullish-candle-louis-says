Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index
yesterday drew a “bullish engulfing candle” pattern that may
suggest the securities will rebound from recent losses,
according to a technical analyst at Louis Capital Markets LLP.  The contracts may climb toward a resistance level at 2,608
and the 200-day moving average of 2,619, Andy Dodd wrote in e-mailed comments. Support levels, which may act as barriers to
declines, are at 2,509 and 2,484, he added. Euro Stoxx 50
futures expiring in September  rallied  2.2 percent to 2,594 at
2:59 p.m. in  Frankfurt  today.  “I would suggest closing the balance of shorts but selling
a rally back to the 2,608 resistance and 200-day moving average
just above,” London-based Dodd said today.  Futures on the gauge of the 50 largest companies in the
euro area rose 1.2 percent yesterday. The contracts had
retreated 12 percent from May 28 through June 24 as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may
reduce the amount it spends on bond purchases as the  U.S.
economy  strengthens.  A bullish engulfing candle forms when a security opens
below the previous day’s close and later rallies to end above
the previous day’s open. Analysts who look at charts to predict
moves in securities say this pattern implies the bulls have
taken control of a security’s price movement from the bears.
Further signs are needed to confirm a change in trend will
occur, they say.  “I wouldn’t normally trade this on its own,” Dodd said in
a phone interview. “It’s just a warning sign that something is
going to happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
