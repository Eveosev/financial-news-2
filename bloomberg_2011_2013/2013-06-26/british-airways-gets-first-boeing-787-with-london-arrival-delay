British Airways said it has taken
delivery of its first  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliner, with arrival in
the U.K. pushed back for unspecified operational reasons, adding
to delays following a global three-month ground of the jet.  “We expect our first two 787s to arrive at Heathrow within
the next few days,” Tony Cane a spokesman for the carrier, said
in an e-mailed response to questions.  The first two planes were due last month, before the
grounding related to battery flaws set back their planned
arrival to today and tomorrow. The deliveries are part of a 5
billion pound ($7.7 billion) fleet upgrade as British Airways
replaces less fuel efficient planes with additional  Boeing 777 
long-haul jets and introduces the Airbus SAS A380 from July 4.  The airline, which is a unit of  International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA (IAG) , plans to add 22 new planes before 2015. The
carrier has not yet disclosed on what routes the Dreamliners
initially will be used. BA has 24 Dreamliners on firm order.  IAG said today that six 787s are part of a collateral pool
in the placement of a $927 million asset-back bond, along with
two Boeing 777-300ER long-range jets and six Airbus SAS A320
short-haul planes due for delivery through next June.  The Class A certificates, worth $721.6 million, have an
annual coupon of 4.625 percent, with Class B certificates,
valued at $205.4 million, carrying a 5.625 percent coupon.  “This transaction marks a strategic milestone as we
diversify our sources of funding,” Chief Financial Officer
Enrique Dupuy said in a statement, adding it marks BA’s first
use of enhanced equipment trust certificates.  BA will eventually operate all three Dreamliner variants
after the airline ordered 12 of the largest 787-10s, which
Boeing began selling last week. BA also plans to buy rival
Airbus’s A350, with deliveries of the twin-engine planes from
both manufacturers stretching until 2023.  To contact the reporter on this story:
