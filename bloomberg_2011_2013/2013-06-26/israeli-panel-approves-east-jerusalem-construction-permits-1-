An Israeli municipal panel approved
construction of 69 housing units in east Jerusalem, providing a
rocky start for U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry ’s latest
effort to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.  The permits granted today will expand east Jerusalem’s Har
Homa section, city spokeswoman Brachie Sprung said by telephone.
Palestinians consider Har Homa an illegal settlement because it
was built to house Jewish residents in a part of the territory
Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and
annexed.  The approval comes a day before Kerry arrives for his fifth
visit to promote peace talks since taking office in February.
The Obama administration has asked Israelis and Palestinians not
to take provocative steps while it tries to restart peace talks
that have been frozen for almost three years.  Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas  said in an interview
with Al-Jazeera television today that he hopes Kerry brings
“something important” and new that will help narrow the gaps
with Israel and lead to fresh peace talks. Israeli Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said yesterday that he’ll engage in
peace negotiations if Palestinians indicate they’re willing to
address all substantial issues and resolve the conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
