Bear is back. The German shepherd
returned to active service today after recuperating at the
 Animal Medical Center  in  New York .  Like the proverbial dog with a bone, Bear would not detach
from the foot of a woman who kicked him twice while resisting
arrest.  Bear, who clamped down until she was handcuffed, suffered
broken teeth and a swollen snout from the tussle.  A row of police dogs and their handlers waited outside the
Medical Center as Bear, a six year old with a tragic mien, left
the building accompanied by his human companion, Officer Vincent
Tieniber.  Muse highlights include  Hephzibah Anderson  on Jeffery
Archer;  Scott Reyburn  on London art auction.  To contact the writer of this story:
