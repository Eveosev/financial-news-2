Greg Combet , Australia’s minister
for climate change, resigned after Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
lost a vote that re-established Kevin Rudd as leader of the
nation’s governing Labor Party.  “It is well known that I have been a strong supporter of
Julia Gillard,” Combet said today in an e-mailed statement  Gillard said she asked the Governor General to commission
Rudd as the new prime minister. He may need the support of
independent lawmakers in parliament if Tony Abbott, leader of
the opposition, calls a no-confidence vote.  Wayne Swan, deputy prime minister and treasurer, also
resigned his positions today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
