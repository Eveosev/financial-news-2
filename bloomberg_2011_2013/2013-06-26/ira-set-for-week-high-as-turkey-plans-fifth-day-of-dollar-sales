The lira headed for its highest
level in a week as the Turkish central bank sold $350 million to
curb currency volatility.  The  exchange rate  appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9325 per
dollar at 4:27 p.m. in Istanbul, its highest level on a closing
basis since June 19. Yields on two-year benchmark debt rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.14 percent,
extending their advance this month to 207 basis points.  The central bank lent 4.5 billion liras ($2.3 billion) in
its one-week repo auction at the policy rate of 4.5 percent.
Today’s foreign-exchange sale compares with $150 million sold at
each auction in the last two days. It has sold $1.3 billion
since June 11 as the lira hit a record low of 1.9602 per dollar
on June 24. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose for a second
day, jumping the most on a closing basis since January 2.  “Calming of global markets and selling of dollars by the
central bank” spurred the lira’s gains, Tufan Comert, a
strategist at Garanti Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed
comments. Lending at the policy rate to commercial banks in one-week repo also supported the currency, he said.  Swings expected in the lira by derivative traders hit a
one-year high on June 24, with three-month implied volatility of
the currency climbing to 13.35. It has since fallen to 13.04.  The lira depreciated 3 percent this month, the most after
the Russian ruble, among emerging markets in  Europe , the  Middle
East  and Africa as Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s
government faced the biggest protests in a decade.  “Most emerging market investors remain very reluctant,
especially of countries with large current-account deficits,
such as Turkey and  India ,” Ilan Solot, a currency strategist at
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  London , wrote in e-mailed
comments today.  Turkey’s  current-account deficit  swelled to $8.2 billion in
April, the biggest monthly shortfall since March 2011. The
Indian rupee slumped 1.8 percent to 60.7300 against the dollar,
its lowest level since at least 1973.  To contact the reporter on this story:
