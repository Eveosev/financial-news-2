A year ago, European leaders pledged
“immediate action” on growth and jobs. Since then, the  euro-area economy  has shrunk nonstop and unemployment has risen to a
record 12.2 percent from 11.4 percent.  The solution, according to a draft statement prepared for a
European Union summit starting today at 4:30 p.m. in Brussels:
“determined and immediate action” on growth and jobs.  Neither forecasters nor the euro zone’s 19 million
unemployed expect the renewed vow to turn around an economy
weighed down by the debt crisis and now endangered by rising
 interest rates  in the U.S. and  China , the world’s pacesetters.  “Just shifting the rhetoric to a focus on growth is not
going to give us growth,” said Paul Hofheinz, president of the
 Lisbon Council , a Brussels research group. “The working
assumption is that we’re going to have a traditional 1930s-style
infrastructure-based stimulus, and that’s going to give us
growth. It’s just not working.”  Two potential complications were taken off the table for
the summit early today with accords by lower-level officials on
bank-loss rules and on the bloc’s 2014-2020 budget. The seven-year subsidies package will fall to 960 billion euros ($1.3
trillion) from 994 billion euros in the current budget cycle,
the first cut in EU history.  Business Loans  On the growth-and-jobs front, the main undelivered promise
from last June’s summit involved using the  European Investment
Bank , the EU’s project-finance arm, to channel loans to smaller
businesses that were starved of credit, especially in southern
 Europe .  While governments did their part by supplying 10 billion
euros of fresh capital, the EIB is only just getting started
with its souped-up lending program, snagged by its own rules
that permit loans only to high-quality borrowers. How to loosen
or get around those standards is up for discussion at today’s
summit.  European emphasis on freeing up labor markets and cutting
health-care and pension costs reflects  Germany ’s experience with
a structural overhaul that made businesses more competitive and
relaunched an economy struggling with the burdens of unification
in 1990.  Started in 2003, the German initiative trimmed unemployment
and social benefits and made it easier to fire workers. The
effort took years to bear fruit, coming too late for the
project’s author,  Gerhard Schroeder , who in 2005 ceded the
office of chancellor to  Angela Merkel .  Merkel’s Call  Merkel used a pre-summit speech to the lower house of
parliament in Berlin today to call for European countries to go
further down the road of structural reform, praising “the
first, important signals” for job growth coming from measures
taken such as Spanish changes to the labor market.  Jobs rely on economic growth which in turn is dependent
upon solid finances, and reducing debt while spurring the
economy is no contradiction, she said. “We can do both,”
Merkel told lawmakers. Decisions taken now will shape “Europe’s
future role in the world,” she said.  Economic desperation has forced southern European countries
to do a German-style remake in a hurry. Greek Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras got a taste of the resulting frictions last week
when the Democratic Left party quit his three-party coalition to
protest his order to shut public broadcaster ERT, axing 2,600
jobs.  Greek Progress  Soon-to-be-fired TV personalities and technicians occupied
the broadcaster’s headquarters, in the sort of publicity stunt
that masked economic progress. Greece, at the origins of the
debt crisis, topped the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development’s international reform rankings for 2011-12,
followed by Ireland, the second bailed-out country during the
crisis.  Portugal ,  Spain  and  Italy  also figure in the top 10.  Not everyone buys that assessment. One critic is  Jean-Claude Trichet , who spent eight years as European Central Bank
president sparring with governments over deficits. Political
leaders have done too little to unleash the forces of growth,
squandering the benefits of low interest rates and
“unconventional” monetary stimulus, the ex-ECB chief said.  “I would put the blame on the governance of the euro
area,” Trichet said at an Institute of International Finance
panel discussion on June 25 in Paris. “There is a great
disappointment because we know what we have to do, we have a
consensus on the avenues we should go, and we do not deliver.”  Slow Recognition  European rules on the mutual recognition of professional
qualifications show how even ideas that don’t require money can
be controversial. At last June’s summit, the leaders pledged
“as soon as possible” to strengthen a 2005 EU law that, for
example, enables doctors or architects trained in one country to
work in another.  No “radical change” was intended, the  European Commission 
said when proposing the amended law in 2011. The main innovation
was a European professional card, offering portable proof of the
holder’s qualifications. Still, the wrangling dragged on. A
provisional deal wasn’t struck until this month. The rules won’t
take effect until after a  European Parliament  vote in October.  Political leaders are acting faster -- or are being seen to
act faster -- on the jobs crisis in southern Europe, where
unemployment in the under-25 age bracket is 56.4 percent in
Spain, 42.5 percent in Portugal, 40.5 percent in Italy and 62.5
percent in  Greece .  ‘Immediate Priority’  In February, the EU agreed to retarget 6 billion euros from
its 2014-2020 budget for programs to fight youth unemployment.
At the summit, the leaders will pledge to pay out that sum in
the first two years of the period, according to a draft
communique that calls youth joblessness “a particular and
immediate priority.”  Merkel, saying that the scourge of youth unemployment is a
cause of the “utmost concern,” called today for the money to
be made available “as soon as possible.” A jobs summit she
plans to host in Berlin on July 3 with attendees including
French President  Francois Hollande  will study how best to
allocate the money, she said.  Singling out youth unemployment is misplaced, partly
because the statistics overstate the problem, said  Daniel Gros ,
director of the  Centre for European Policy Studies  in Brussels.
He said teenagers and college-aged people can continue their
education, increasing their future earnings power -- an option
not available to older workers.  “You are really attacking the wrong problem if you focus
specifically on youth unemployment,” Gros said. “To the extent
you make special funding available to mitigate youth
unemployment, you have to take that money away from somewhere
else.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
