First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , a
Nigerian lender, expects the pace of loan growth to accelerate
to 25 percent in 2013, more than doubling from last year’s 11
percent increase.  Net income will grow an average of 35 percent per year over
the period from 2012 to 2015, the Lagos-based lender said today
in an e-mailed statement. Non-interest income from consumer
banking will grow more than 50 percent a year, it said.  The stock gained 3.8 percent to 4.75 naira in Lagos trading
today, the biggest increase in three weeks. FCMB’s earnings are
recovering after the financial crisis in 2009 brought  Nigeria ’s
banking industry to the verge of collapse.  FCMB posted net income of 14.8 billion naira ($91.8
million) for 2012, compared with a loss of 9.7 billion naira in
the previous year, according to figures released on April 29.
Revenue rose to 116.8 billion naira from 75.7 billion naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
