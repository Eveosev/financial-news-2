The U.S. State Department has an
“excellent” nominee to become its first inspector general in
five years, its spokesman said.  Patrick Ventrell, the spokesman, commented on progress
toward nominating a candidate for the watchdog post today, hours
after Senator  Ted Cruz , a Texas Republican, announced he would
place a “hold” on President  Barack Obama ’s nominees for all
State Department openings until the congressionally mandated
inspector general’s position is filled.  The administration has “found an excellent individual and
would like to get him nominated as soon as possible,” Ventrell
said. “We clearly want to get our full team in place.”  Cruz said in a statement that it was  “unacceptable” that
Obama hasn’t nominated an inspector general since taking office
in 2009, as deputies perform the investigations that the
inspector general’s office is supposed to provide. He said
that’s the longest any federal agency has gone without an
inspector general.  “The position has been vacant for almost 2,000 days,”
Cruz said. “This is a crucial oversight position and should be
a priority for an agency facing substantial management
challenges.” These, he said, include “deadly attacks on U.S.
diplomatic personnel in  Libya , mismanagement of security
contractors at our embassy in  Afghanistan , and hundreds of
millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars wasted for police training in
Iraq.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
