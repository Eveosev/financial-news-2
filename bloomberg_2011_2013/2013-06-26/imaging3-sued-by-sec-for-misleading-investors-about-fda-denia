Imaging3 Inc. (IMGGQ) , a medical-imaging
device firm, and its founder were sued by U.S. regulators over
claims they misled investors about Federal Drug Administration
rejection of a scanner that produced 3-D images.  Dean Janes, founder and chief executive officer of Burbank,
California-based Imaging3, falsely told investors in a November
2010 conference call that the FDA didn’t raise safety and
quality concerns in denying approval for the scanner, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said today in a complaint
filed in U.S. District Court in  California .  “Shareholders have a right to trust corporate officers to
tell them the truth about the business,” Michele Wein Layne,
head of the SEC’s Los Angeles office, said in a statement.
“When CEOs abuse that trust and make misstatements, innocent
shareholders are victimized.”  After an investor obtained the FDA’s denial letter and
posted it on the Internet in early 2011, Janes used his personal
social media page to mischaracterize the regulator’s position,
the SEC said. Janes and his company didn’t officially issue the
full text of the FDA’s denial letter until earlier this year,
the SEC said.  A phone call to Mark Richardson, an attorney for Imaging3
and Janes, wasn’t immediately returned. A phone call to Janes’
office at Imaging3 wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
