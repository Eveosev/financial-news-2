The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in Asia fell to the lowest
since the  Federal Reserve  said last week it may slow asset
purchases this year, credit-default swap traders said.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 10 basis points to 159.5 basis
points as of 8:42 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. The index is on course to fall 23.8 basis
points in two days and is headed for its lowest close since June
19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 8 basis points to
142 as of 10:51 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. The gauge is set for its lowest close since June 21,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 4 basis points to
117 basis points as of 9:44 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The index is also on track for its lowest close
since June 21, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
