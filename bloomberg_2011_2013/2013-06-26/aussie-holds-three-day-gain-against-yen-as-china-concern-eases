Australia ’s dollar held a three-day
gain versus the yen after China’s central bank reassured
investors it will stabilize money markets and ease the credit
squeeze in the world’s second-largest economy.  Australian bonds fell after Treasuries slumped on signs of
improvement in the U.S. economy, adding to the case for the
Federal Reserve to reduce monetary stimulus. New Zealand Finance
Minister Bill English said the kiwi dollar is still “a bit
overvalued” as the currency headed for a 7.7 percent drop this
quarter, the sharpest slide since the three-months ended
September 2011.  “The Aussie is finding a little bit of support and fears
easing in China are a big factor behind that,” said Janu Chan,
a Sydney-based economist at St. George Bank Ltd. “It makes more
sense if  China  wanted to tighten credit, they’d do it through
some other way rather than withholding liquidity from the money
market.”  The Australian dollar was little changed at 90.60 yen at
10:20 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, after climbing 1.2 percent
in the previous three sessions.  The Aussie slid 0.2 percent to 92.40 U.S. cents. On June
24, it touched 91.48, the lowest since September 2010.  The currency pair’s one-month implied volatility dropped 36
basis points to 14.3 percent, after surging to 15.5 percent on
June 24, the highest since December 2011.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 77.27 U.S. cents.
It was little changed at 75.74 yen. For the month, the kiwi
weakened 2.7 percent against the greenback.  Australian Bonds  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year government bond rose six
basis points to 3.85 percent. The benchmark rate reached 4.04
percent on June 24, the highest since April 2012. The three-year
rate added four basis points to 2.91 percent.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  of China’s biggest companies fell 0.3
percent yesterday, paring a plunge of as much as 6.8 percent, as
the People’s Bank of China said it will use tools to safeguard
stability in money markets and tight liquidity is set to ease.  China’s central bank has provided liquidity to some
financial institutions to stabilize money-market rates and will
use short-term liquidity operations and standing lending-facility tools to ensure steady markets, according to a
statement posted to its website yesterday.  China is the biggest trading partner for both Australia and
New Zealand.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled on June 19 the Fed
may “moderate” its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases,
known as quantitative easing, later this year and end it
mid-2014 if economic improvement continues.  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.4 percent
annualized rate in the first quarter, from 0.4 percent in the
previous three months, the Commerce Department will probably
confirm today according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
