PrinceRidge LLC hired Ray Doherty,
who left  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  last month, as a managing
director selling structured notes.  Doherty started at the firm June 24, focusing on sales of
securities tied to stocks, currencies and commodities, he said
in telephone interview from his  New York  office. He reports to
managing directors Armand Pastine in  Boca Raton , Florida, and
Joseph Castelluccio in New York.  Last month, PrinceRidge hired Christopher Listo, an ex-Cantor Fitzgerald LP salesman, as a managing director selling
structured notes.  The recent hires are part of an expansion “to help our
overall market presence” in the U.S. and overseas in dealing
with wholesalers and institutions, Pastine said in a telephone
interview.  Doherty joined Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd., which
was later acquired by Bank of America, in 1993, he said. He was
most recently a director in New York selling structured notes.  Zia Ahmed, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to
comment.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
