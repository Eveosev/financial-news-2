Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) , Colombia’s
largest cement maker, rose the most on the country’s benchmark
index after  Banco BTG Pactual SA (BPAC3)  said the stock may surge 36
percent over the next year as construction rebounds.  The  common shares  gained 3 percent to 7,550 pesos at 11:59
a.m. in Bogota, the biggest increase in three weeks on a closing
basis. The benchmark Colcap index rose 0.6 percent. Medellin-based Cemargos’s shares had dropped 25 percent this year through
yesterday.  Colombia’s building permits climbed 37 percent in April
from a year earlier, the national statistics agency reported
last week. That signals improvement for Cemargos in the second
half of the year, BTG analysts Felipe Ucros, Gordon Lee, Alonso
Aramburu and Juliana Aguilar wrote today in a research note. The
analysts raised their recommendation to buy from neutral, with a
12-month target price of 10,300 pesos.  The surge in licenses “indicate that Colombia’s
construction sector is turning a corner,” boosted by government
housing programs, they wrote. Growth in the second half of this
year “looks promising,” with cement volumes forecast to
increase 3.5 percent, compared with a prior projection of a 2.5
percent contraction, BTG said.  Cemargos in April said gray cement sales volumes in
Colombia in the first quarter fell 8.2 percent from a year
earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
