Asian stock futures rose after
slower-than-estimated growth in the U.S. economy stoked
speculation the Federal Reserve may hold back from reducing
stimulus.  American Depositary Receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, advanced 1.3 percent as the yen fell
against the dollar, boosting the earnings outlook for Japanese
exporters. ADRs of Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil producer,
gained 0.5 percent from the close in Hong Kong as crude climbed
for a third day.  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 13,010 in  Chicago  yesterday, up from 12,780
at the close in Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 13,020
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index advanced 0.4 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.4 percent. Futures on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained
0.5 percent.  “Central bank statements have combined with some softish
data to remind people that the U.S. recovery remains the weakest
in history and that policy action is not imminent,” Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of investment market research at
Perpetual Ltd., which manages about $25 billion, said by e-mail.
“The risk of tapering has not gone away.”  Futures contracts on the Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index
of mainland Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong advanced 0.8
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rose 1.5 percent in New York
yesterday.  Fed Stimulus  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, dropped 13 percent through yesterday from this
year’s high on May 20 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said policy makers may start dialing down stimulus if
the U.S. economy shows sustained improvement.  That left the gauge trading at 12.3 times average estimated
earnings compared with 14.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed. Gross domestic product expanded at a revised 1.8
percent annualized rate from January through March, down from a
prior estimate of 2.4 percent, figures from the Commerce
Department showed yesterday in  Washington . Household purchases,
which account for about 70 percent of the economy, were revised
to a 2.6 percent advance compared with the 3.4 percent gain
estimated last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
