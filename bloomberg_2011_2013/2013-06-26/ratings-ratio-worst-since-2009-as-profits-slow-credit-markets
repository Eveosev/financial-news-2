Corporate creditworthiness in the
U.S. is deteriorating at the fastest pace since 2009 with
earnings growth slowing as yields rise from record lows.  The ratio of upgrades to downgrades fell to 0.89 times in
the first five months of the year after reaching a post-crisis
high of 1.55 times in 2010, according to data from Moody’s
Capital Markets Group. At Standard & Poor’s, the proportion has
declined to 0.83 as of last week from 1 a year earlier.  The Federal Reserve has pumped more than $2.5 trillion into
the financial system since markets froze in 2008, helping
companies improve profitability by lowering their borrowing
costs. Policy makers are considering curtailing $85 billion in
monthly bond buying intended to prop up the economy as analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast earnings growth of 2.5 percent in
the current quarter, the least in a year.  “The trend of improving credit quality has slowed as
profits are slowing,” Ben Garber, an economist at Moody’s
Analytics in New York, said in a telephone interview. “As the
recovery matures, companies are liable to get more aggressive in
taking on share buybacks and dividends.”  Buybacks, Dividends  Rather than using cash to pay down debt, companies in the
S&P 500 Index are attempting to boost their share prices by
buying back almost $700 billion of stock this year, approaching
the 2007 record of $731 billion, said Rob Leiphart, an analyst
at equity researcher Birinyi Associates in Westport,
 Connecticut .  Borrowers controlled by buyout firms are on pace to raise
more than $72.7 billion this year through dividends financed by
bank loans, surpassing last year’s record of $48.8 billion,
according to S&P Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary & Data.  After cutting expenses as much as they could to improve
profitability, companies “will need to see further revenue
growth to boost earnings from here,” Anthony Valeri, a market
strategist in San Diego with LPL Financial Corp., which oversees
$350 billion, said in a telephone interview.  Elsewhere in credit markets, U.S. asset-backed bonds linked
to auto debt are poised for the worst month in more than two
years. Yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds that
guide U.S. home-loan rates headed for the first decline in six
days after reaching the highest since August 2011. The cost of
protecting corporate bonds from default in the U.S. fell for a
second day.  Mortgage Yields  A Bloomberg  index  of Fannie Mae’s current-coupon 30-year
securities declined 0.04 percentage point to 3.48 percent as of
12:10 p.m. in New York. The measure ended yesterday at 3.52
percent and is up from 2.98 percent on June 18. The  average cost 
of new 30-year, fixed-rate home loans has climbed to 4.58
percent from a record low 3.36 percent in December, according to
Bankrate.com data.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 3.6 basis points to
a mid-price of 88.7 basis points, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The benchmark ended June 24 at the highest level
since December.  Europe Benchmark  In  London , the  Markit iTraxx Europe Index , tied to 125
companies with investment-grade ratings, dropped 8.5 to 119.3.  The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves
and rise as it deteriorates. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt market stress, declined 2.9 basis points to 14.75 basis
points. The gauge typically narrows when investors favor assets
such as company debentures and widens when they seek the
perceived safety of government securities.  Bonds of  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  are the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today, accounting
for 3.04 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1 million or
more, according to data from Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Top-ranked securities tied to vehicle loans have lost 0.15
percent this month, the largest decline since the securities
fell 0.2 percent in November 2010, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index.  Downgrades, Upgrades  Investors are pulling back from auto debt, the largest part
of the asset-backed market, threatening to constrain financing
to borrowers with blemished credit histories. Subprime vehicle
debt accounted for 13.2 percent of asset-backed issuance this
year compared with 10.5 percent in 2012, Wells Fargo & Co.
analysts led by John McElravey said in a June 7 report.  Downgrades exceeded upgrades at Moody’s Investors Service
in the first five months of the year, with the New York-based
credit rater cutting rankings on 194 U.S. companies and lifting
173. That’s the weakest ratio since the firm cut 632 borrowers
and raised 126 in the first five months of 2009 as markets
struggled to recover from the failure of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.  The long-term ratings of PepsiCo were cut one step to A1
from Aa3 yesterday by Moody’s, which said increasing leverage at
the world’s largest snack food maker was inconsistent with its
prior grade. Moody’s also reduced the corporate family rating of
TransDigm Inc. one level to B2 from B1, citing the Cleveland-based aircraft component maker’s use of a proposed $700 million
term loan and a $500 million note offering to finance a
dividend.  Sales Slow  S&P, the world’s largest credit rater, has cut 138 U.S.
companies this year through June 17 and upgraded 114 companies.  Credit markets have been roiled since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress on May 22 that the central bank’s policy-setting board could start scaling back purchases of $40 billion
in mortgage bonds and $45 billion in Treasuries in its “next
few meetings” if the U.S. employment outlook shows sustained
improvement. After the Fed’s meeting on June 19, Bernanke said
the policy could end entirely by mid-2014.  With yields on 10-year Treasuries at the most in almost two
years, corporate borrowing costs have reached 4.28 percent, the
highest level since June 2012, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Index.  Issuance has slowed, following the busiest May on record,
as company yields have soared from a record low 3.35 percent on
May 2. Bond sales last week of $16.5 billion fell below the 2013
average for the fourth straight period, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Apprehensive’ Raters  Earnings growth at S&P 500 companies is poised to slow from
2.7 percent in the first quarter and 8 percent in the final
three months of last year, Bloomberg  data  show.  The ratio of cash to total assets for S&P 500 companies
stands at about 10.3 percent, close to a record high 10.4
percent reached June 19, Bloomberg data show. The ratio was as
low as 5.6 percent in March 2007.  “Companies have done a great job cleaning up their balance
sheets but now the focus has moved on to dividends and share
buybacks,” Rajeev Sharma, who manages $1.5 billion of fixed-income assets in New York at First Investors Management Co.,
said in a telephone interview. “That’s what makes the ratings
agencies get apprehensive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
