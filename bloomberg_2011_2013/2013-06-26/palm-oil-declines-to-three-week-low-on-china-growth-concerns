Palm oil  dropped to a three-week low
on speculation that slower economic growth in China, the largest
buyer after India, may damp demand for the oil used in
everything from noodles to biofuel.  The contract for September delivery lost 1.3 percent to
2,380 ringgit ($744) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives, the lowest price at close for the most-active
futures since June 4. Palm for local  physical delivery  in July
was at 2,400 ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China International Capital
Corp. this week joined banks from Barclays Plc to HSBC Holdings
Plc in paring their growth projections below the Chinese
government’s 7.5 percent goal for this year. The cuts followed a
cash crunch that sent interbank lending rates to records last
week. The central bank said it will use tools to safeguard
stability in money markets and tight liquidity is set to ease.  “The market remains bearish due to  China ’s liquidity
crisis,” analysts Lee Chen Hoay, Sim Han Qiang and Joyce Liu at
Phillip Futures Pte, wrote in a report today. While data showed
exports are rising this month, “palm oil is still on a
downtrend,” they said.  Shipments from Malaysia, the second-largest producer, rose
9.6 percent to 1.17 million tons in the first 25 days of June
from the same period a month earlier, Intertek said yesterday.  Price Decline  Stockpiles are poised to jump 21 percent to a record 9.5
million tons in 2013-2014 and demand will advance 4.4 percent,
the least in 12 years, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Futures will drop to 2,200 ringgit by the year end, a level last
seen in 2009, according to the median of 13 trader, analyst and
producer estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Soybean oil  for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to 45.63
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in November dropped 0.7 percent to $12.70 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 0.8 percent
to close at 5,878  yuan  ($956) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , while soybean oil lost 1.4 percent to 7,332 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
