Canadian  stocks  fell, retreating
from the biggest gain in two months yesterday, as gold prices
slumped to a 34-month low and phone companies plunged after
Verizon Communications Inc. bid to expand into the market.  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  and Telus Corp. dropped more
than 6.4 percent after Verizon made an offer for  Canada ’s Wind
Mobile. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer of
gold, slumped 4.7 percent after cutting staff in  Australia .
Endeavour Silver Corp. retreated 6.5 percent to a three-year low
as silver slid to the lowest since August 2010.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 29.90
points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,975.52 at 9:54 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge climbed 1.4 percent yesterday, the most since April
after  China ’s central bank said it will ensure stable money
markets and better-than-forecast U.S. data bolstered optimism
about the world’s largest economy.  Telephone stocks plunged 5.9 percent as a group to pace
losses in the S&P/TSX. Verizon has made a $700 million offer for
Wind Mobile, the Globe and Mail reported today, citing two
people familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
