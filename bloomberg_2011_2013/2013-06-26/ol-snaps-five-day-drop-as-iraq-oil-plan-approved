Mol Nyrt. advanced for the first
time in six days after  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) , the
company’s oil exploration partner, got approval for a field
development plan in the Kurdistan region of  Iraq .  Hungary’s largest refiner rose 0.8 percent, the most since
June 10, to 16,230 forint by the close in Budapest. The stock
dropped 5.3 percent in the previous five sessions. Almost 95,000
shares were traded today, about 1.3 times the three-month daily
average. The benchmark  BUX stock index,  in which Mol has a 31
percent weighting, climbed 1.4 percent.  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd.’s development plan for the
Shaikan field was approved by the Ministry of Natural Resources
in Kurdistan, the oil and gas explorer said today. The initial
production capacity at the field, in which Mol has a 20 percent
working interest, will start in the “coming weeks,” increasing
to 250,000 barrels of oil per day by 2018, Gulf Keystone said.  “We expect MOL’s share price to head north, reflecting the
positive developments, as MOL has come closer to monetizing its
assets in Kurdistan,” Helena Naffa, a Budapest-based analyst at
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , who has a buy recommendation on the stock, said
in a research report today.  Gulf Keystone shares gained 1.9 percent in London trading
today. Mol has declined 2.8 percent this quarter, lagging a 4
increase for the BUX index.  “We continue to see activities in Kurdistan as the most
interesting driver of Mol’s investment case,” Peter Szentirmai,
a Budapest-based analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in an e-mailed
note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
