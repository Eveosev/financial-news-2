Ruslan Margolin, who runs  Knight
Capital Group Inc. (KCG) ’s business of trading U.S. home-loan
securities without government backing, is leaving the firm.  Margolin, 40, will depart the Jersey City, New Jersey-based
firm at the end of the week with plans to spend time  traveling ,
he said in a note to clients. He confirmed the contents of the
message when reached by telephone, declining to comment further.  “There are roughly 260 countries in the world full of
natural/cultural/social attractions, and I’ve only been to 83 so
far,” he wrote. “Life is too short to miss out on all this.”  He joined Knight in 2012 with two others who had worked at
MF Global Holdings Ltd., which hired him as head of non-agency
mortgage trading two months before that brokerage collapsed.
Margolin, who came to the U.S. from Belarus in 1992, previously
had the same position at CRT Capital Group LLC, and earlier
worked for Braver Stern Securities LLC, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
UBS AG.  Knight, a market-maker being acquired by Getco LLC after a
computer error last year brought it to the brink of bankruptcy,
agreed in March to sell its institutional fixed-income sales and
trading business to brokerage Stifel Financial Corp. for an
undisclosed amount.  Jonathan Mairs, a spokesman for Knight, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
