The  International Monetary Fund 
completed its reviews of Romania’s progress under its second
bailout agreement after delays in economic overhauls prompted
the country to ask for a three-month extension.  The lender’s board of directors agreed to unlock the final
approximately 520.7 million-euro ($677.4 million) tranche of the
3.6 billion-euro two-year accord, the IMF said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday after a meeting in  Washington . The IMF said
Romanian authorities are “treating the arrangement as
precautionary and do not intend to draw under it.”  “The economy has stabilized.  Core inflation  remains low,
and the fiscal and current account balances are sustainable,”
Nemat Shafik, an IMF deputy managing director, said in the
statement. “However, growth is weak and downside risks exist.
Structural reforms are critical to realizing  Romania ’s growth
potential and creating jobs.”  The eastern European country’s government, which has had
two IMF-led deals since 2009, is seeking to start negotiations
for a third agreement, pending approval from the European
Commission, according to Prime Minister Victor Ponta.  Editors: Kevin Costelloe,  To contact the reporters on this story:
