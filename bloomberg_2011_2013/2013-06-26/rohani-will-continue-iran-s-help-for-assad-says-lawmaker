Iran’s President-elect Hassan Rohani
will not change the country’s policy of supporting Bashar al-Assad in  Syria ’s civil war, according to a member of the Iranian
parliament.  “The tactics may change but the strategic aims will not
change,” said Ahmad Bakhshayesh, a member of the Majlis
National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, in a telephone
interview from Tehran, describing Syria, Iran and Lebanon’s
Shiite militia Hezbollah as part of a “resistance front”
opposing Israel. “We don’t want Syria to leave the resistance
front.”  In a joint press conference U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said his
country help the rebels defend themselves. The Syrian army,
strengthened by Hezbollah fighters captured the strategic
central town of al-Qusair, gaining the upper hand.  The U.S. and 10 other nations pledged Saturday to increase
their support for the rebel forces, without providing details.
Kerry has called on Iran to pull its forces out of Syria.  The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  said it
documented the deaths of more than 100,000 people, including
50,200 civilians, in the country since March 2011.  “This is mini-world war, with Iran, Syria and Hezbollah on
one side and  Saudi Arabia , Qatar, Turkey, the U.S. and Israel on
the other,” Bakhshayesh said. “The Syrian civil war has become
a proxy war between Iran and the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
