Sugar declined in  New York  for the
first time in four days before industry group Unica reports on
the crop progress in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer. Cocoa
climbed the most in three weeks.  Unica will provide an update on how much sugar cane was
turned into ethanol and into sweetener in the first half of
June. Sugar prices have climbed 4.1 percent the past three days
on speculation rain would slow progress in Brazil.  “Since prices went up too far, the numbers from Unica
would be played down,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Rolle,
Switzerland-based Swiss Sugar Brokers, said in an e-mail message
today. “The market now is more a factor of funds short covering
versus producer pricing as a function of the currency rate.”  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.5 percent to 17.25
cents a pound by 8:07 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Cocoa gained 1.4 percent to $2,193 a metric ton, the biggest
jump since June 6. “A bit of industry buying was seen here and
there,” Marex Spectron Group Ltd. said in a report about
yesterday when prices in London rose 0.5 percent.  Arabica coffee dropped 0.1 percent to $1.2045 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
