India ’s rupee plunged to a record
60.7650 per dollar as investors favored the greenback after
latest data bolstered the U.S. economic outlook. Bonds and
stocks declined.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the U.S. currency
against 10 major trading partners, rose after data yesterday
showed U.S. new-home sales and  consumer confidence  exceeded
economists’ estimates. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said June 19 the central bank may phase out a stimulus program
this year should the  U.S. economy  improve.  “This currency weakness was not triggered by India’s
fundamentals,”  Anubhuti Sahay  and Samiran Chakraborty, Standard
Chartered economists in Mumbai, wrote in a report today. “A
weaker rupee can add to inflationary pressure, widen the fiscal
deficit and slow capital inflows, without having a positive
effect on the current-account deficit.”  The rupee slid 1.7 percent to 60.73 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It
has fallen 7 percent this month, the world’s worst performance,
and slumped 10.6 percent this quarter, the most since 1991. The
plunge will inflict “significant damage” on  India’s economy 
and the central bank’s ability to stem the drop is limited as
currency reserves are enough to cover only about seven months of
imports, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  The  Reserve Bank  of India sold dollars, two traders with
knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named as the
information isn’t public. The bank sold “small amounts” to
smooth volatility rather than protect a certain level, one of
them said. The country’s foreign currency  stockpile  was $290.7
billion as of June 14, down from an all-time high of $321
billion in 2011, official data show.  ‘Unnerved Investors’  The Bank of New York Mellon India ADR Index slipped 0.3
percent as of 10:47 a.m. in New York after the S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX) 
fell 0.4 percent to 18,552.12 at the close in Mumbai. The 50-stock CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
lost 0.4 percent to 5,588.70. Its June futures settled at
5,581.10. India VIX, which gauges the cost of protection against
losses in the Nifty, fell 0.3 percent.  “The rupee’s fall unnerved investors as 60 was a
psychological barrier,”  Gajendra Nagpal , chief executive
officer at Unicon Financial Intermediaries Ltd., said by phone
from New Delhi. “The currency weakness will deter foreigners
and any chance of a rate cut by the RBI is out of question.”  The Sensex has dropped 4.5 percent this year, reversing
gains after climbing to a two-year high on May 17, as foreign
funds extended a sell-off of local shares amid the fall in the
currency. The gauge trades at 12.4 times  projected 12-month
profits , near to the cheapest level since April, compared with
the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 9.3 times.  Bharti, Mahindra  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 68 basis points,
or 0.68 percentage point, today to 12.59 percent.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s largest mobile-phone operator,
slumped 6 percent to 277.7 rupees, its steepest drop since Aug.
9.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, slid 3.1
percent to 272.65 rupees, its seventh day of fall.  Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , India’s largest maker of sport-utility vehicles
and tractors, plunged 4.8 percent to 911.15 rupees, the most
since Jan. 30, 2012. Aluminum producer  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) 
decreased 2.4 percent to 94.7 rupees. HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s
most valuable lender, fell 1.8 percent to 622.85 rupees.  Indian bonds fell, sending yields to a two-month high, on
speculation the rupee’s plunge will limit the scope for the RBI
to further cut  interest rates . A sustained 10 percent drop in
the rupee adds 150 basis points to 200 basis points to
wholesale-price inflation, Standard Chartered estimates.  Daily Band  The yield on 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 7.79 percent in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. That is the
highest level for the note since April 17.  The jump in yield prompted the Fixed Income Money Market
and Derivatives Association of India to ease an indicative daily
band. The trading band was doubled for all maturities, said
Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at Development Credit
Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. The limit for 10-year bonds was raised to
20 basis points over yesterday’s closing yield level, compared
with 10 basis points allowed usually, he said.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose 11 basis
point to 7.54 percent, the highest level since May 26, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  ’Attractive Level’  Overseas funds have pulled $1.5 billion from domestic
shares in June, poised to become net sellers for the first month
since May 2012. They have also cut rupee debt holdings by $5.1
billion after buying in each of the previous six months. The
sell-off is the reason for the rupee’s slide, the RBI said in a
June 17 statement, as it kept interest rates unchanged for the
first time in four meetings.  “The 60 level is a very attractive level for the currency,
I don’t see much depreciation from current levels.”  Jeff
Chowdhry , head of emerging-market equities at U.K.-based  F&C
Asset Management Plc. (FCAM) , which oversees about $150 billion, told
Bloomberg TV India today. “The dollar strengthening has
affected all emerging market currencies” and fundamentals of
the Indian economy aren’t any worse than they were six months
ago, he said.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 1.5 percent to
61.50 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Offshore non-deliverable contracts declined 1.7 percent to
61.78. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set
price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
