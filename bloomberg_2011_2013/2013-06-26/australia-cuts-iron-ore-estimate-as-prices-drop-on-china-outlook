Australia, the world’s largest iron
ore exporter, lowered its price estimates for the steelmaking
raw material this year and 2014 as economic growth in China
slows while supply increases.  Prices will average $117 a ton in 2013, compared with $119
forecast in March, the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics
said in a  report . Australia may ship 571 million tons this year
and 664 million tons in 2014, compared with March estimates of
554 million tons and 662 million tons, the Canberra-based bureau
said. Exports totaled 494 million tons in 2012.  Iron ore has  tumbled  28 percent from a 16-month high in
February, slipping into a bear market in May, on concern that
economic growth in the biggest ore buyer is faltering. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. this week joined banks from Barclays Plc to
HSBC Holdings Plc in paring projections for China this year to
7.4 percent, below the government’s 7.5 percent goal.  Prices have declined “in line with changing sentiment over
 China ’s economic growth and steel output,” the report said.
“It is expected that the monthly rates of production will
moderate as the year progresses,” it said, referring to steel.  China’s steel  production  climbed to a record 67 million
metric tons in May, according to the statistics bureau. The
country will import 774 million tons of iron ore this year and
805 million tons in 2014, compared with the 773 million tons and
805 million tons estimated in March, the bureau said.  Prices will average $112 a ton in 2014, compared with $114
forecast in March, the bureau said. The bureau’s price forecasts
refer to ore with 62 percent iron content free-on-board
 Australia .  The same grade delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin
fell 2.2 percent to $114 a dry ton yesterday, according to data
from The Steel Index Ltd. Prices, which reached $158.90 on Feb.
20, have averaged $137.52 in 2013.  Iron ore can be measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore’s weight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
