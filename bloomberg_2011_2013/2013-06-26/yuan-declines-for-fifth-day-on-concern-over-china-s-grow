China ’s  yuan  declined for a fifth
day on concerns the worst cash crunch in a decade will worsen a
slowing economy.  HSBC Holdings Plc said yesterday it sees the currency
ending the year at 6.16 per dollar, 0.2 percent weaker than
current levels, as jumps in money-market rates may hurt growth
and inflation expectations. Chinese stocks fell to a four-year
low today after Goldman Sachs Group Inc., China International
Capital Corp. and DBS Bank Ltd. cut 2013 expansion forecasts in
the past week. One-year  interest-rate swaps  slid after the
central bank said yesterday it will safeguard money-market
stability. The swaps rose to a record 5.06 percent on June 20.  “The PBOC statement shows the risks are still controllable
and there won’t be any big crisis in the near term,” said Bruce Yam, a foreign-exchange strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial
Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “Yet, the room for yuan appreciation is
still limited as growth is on the downtrend. The slowdown could
be faster than what people expect.”  The yuan fell 0.04 percent to 6.1478 per dollar as of 11:29
a.m. in Shanghai, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices
showed. The People’s Bank of China lowered the currency’s  fixing
 0.02 percent to 6.1779 per dollar today. The onshore spot rate
is allowed to diverge from the reference by a maximum of 1
percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.09 percent
to 6.1455 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.06 percent to
6.3030 per dollar, a 2.5 percent  discount  to the onshore spot.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.91 percent.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
