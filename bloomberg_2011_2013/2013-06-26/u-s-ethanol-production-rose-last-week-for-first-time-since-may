U.S. ethanol production rose 1.4
percent last week, the first advance since May, Energy
Information Administration data showed.  Output rose to 885,000 barrels a day, the highest level
since May 31, while  inventories  slumped 1 percent to 16.3
million barrels, about 22 percent lower than a year ago, said
the EIA, the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical arm.  Imports of the biofuel decreased 42 percent to 38,000
barrels a day in the week ended June 21. The U.S. has imported
ethanol for consecutive weeks for the first time since March.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, compared with about 94 percent the previous
week.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 2.6 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.472 a gallon at 10:35 a.m.  New York  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
