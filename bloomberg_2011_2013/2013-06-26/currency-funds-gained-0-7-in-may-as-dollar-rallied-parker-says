Foreign-exchange funds gained 0.7
percent in May as the dollar rallied amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  may reduce asset purchases that risk debasing
the currency, according to Parker Global Strategies LLC.  Among the 40 programs that reported results, the
performance ranged from a return of about 9.4 percent to a loss
of 8.6 percent, the company said today in a statement. Twenty
funds gained money, 19 programs reported a loss and one was
flat.  “In the U.S., improving economic growth and increased
speculation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s decision to end or
slow quantitative easing prompted the dollar to strengthen,”
according to Parker, based in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
Quantitative easing refers to the Fed’s buying of bonds to
reduce interest-rates and drive up asset prices.  The greenback rallied against all 16 of its most-traded
counterparts in May. The dollar has gained 0.1 percent this
month, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index that
represents 10 major currencies weighted by liquidity and trade
flows.  The Parker FX Index is up 1.7 percent this year and 0.8
percent during the past 12 months. The index includes 43
programs managing about $41 billion by 36 firms worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
