Bryan Colangelo, who was stripped of
his duties overseeing the Toronto Raptors’ basketball operations
in May, has stepped down as team president.  The Raptors said today in an e-mailed statement that
Colangelo, a two-time National Basketball Association Executive
of the Year who joined Toronto in February 2006 as both
president and general manager, will become a consultant for the
team and Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.  Colangelo’s move out of the general manager job came at the
direction of  Tim Leiweke , who in April became president and
chief executive officer of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment,
which owns the Raptors.  “Having had a better chance to reflect on things for the
past several weeks, I have concluded that stepping away from my
position is the best course of action for the organization and
everyone involved,” Colangelo said in the team release.  Masai Ujiri, the reigning NBA Executive of the Year, on May
31 returned to the Raptors as general manager after three
seasons with the  Denver Nuggets .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
