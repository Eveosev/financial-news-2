Thunderstorms forced airlines to
cancel more than 350 flights at Chicago’s O’Hare airport, the
second busiest in the U.S., and began disrupting travel to and
from New York.  More than 100 New York-area flights were scrubbed, mostly
at  LaGuardia Airport  and New Jersey’s Newark Liberty, according
to data tracker FlightAware.com.  United Airlines (UAL)  and  American
Airlines (AAMRQ)  cut flights at their O’Hare hub, while  Southwest
Airlines Co. (LUV)  scrapped trips at its Chicago Midway base.  “We anticipate the weather impacting the operation for a
majority of the day” in Chicago, Michelle Agnew, a spokeswoman
for Dallas-based Southwest, said in an e-mail.  Cancellations at hubs such as O’Hare, which trails only
Atlanta in annual passenger totals, can ripple across the rest
of the U.S. Severe thunderstorms may break out from Chicago to
Boston today with high winds, hail and heavy rain, according to
the U.S. Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.  The scrubbed flights at O’Hare consisted of 163 departures
and 195 inbound trips at 2:20 p.m. New York time, according to
FlightAware. That was more than half the 636 cancellations in
the U.S. today, FlightAware reported.  Flights headed to Chicago were delayed an average of one
hour, according to Houston-based FlightAware.  Heavy rain across the Midwest has prompted flood warnings
and advisories in parts of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin
and Indiana, according to the  National Weather Service .  To contact the reporter on this story:
