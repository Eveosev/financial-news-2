Trek Bicycle Corp. agreed to take
over the RadioShack Leopard cycling team from Luxembourg real-estate developer Flavio Becca next year.  Waterloo, Wisconsin-based Trek, a sponsor of the team since
its inception in 2010, is in talks with “several marquee
athletes” and will start seeking partners immediately,
according to a team statement.  The team’s riders  include
Luxembourg’s Andy Schleck, Jens Voigt of  Germany  and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland.  Trek sponsored Lance Armstrong during his seven Tour de
 France  wins, and a two-year comeback. The bicycle maker ended
its association with the Texan last year after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Armstrong cheated with performance-enhancing
drugs and stripped him of his wins.  Trek Vice President Joe Vadeboncoeur said in the statement
that the Luxembourg-based team’s riders, who also include
Americans Matthew Busche and Chris Horner, are from its biggest
markets and would become “an army of ambassadors” at cycling
events around the world.  Becca said he had taken “a lot of pleasure” in running
the team and was proud to hand over to Trek. Financial terms of
their agreement weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
