Natural gas futures may extend
declines after falling to a 15-week low, according to a
 technical analysis  by  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the Energy
OverView newsletter in New York.  Gas for August delivery has followed a technical formation
known as a descending wedge since reaching an 18-month high on
May 1. The pattern, with trend lines drawn above and below the
price chart, converges to an arrow pointing lower. This sequence
indicates futures are poised to slip further after breaching
$3.75 per million British thermal units, a key support level,
Fitzpatrick said.  “The chart looks fairly clear that more losses lie ahead,
so this is a full-throated sell advisory,” he said.  Gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
fell 9 cents yesterday, or 2.4 percent, to $3.67 per million
Btu, the lowest settlement since March 6. Prices have tumbled 17
percent since May 1.  The futures may slide to $3.60 per million Btu, Fitzpatrick
said. The August contract last traded at that price in late
February, before colder-than-normal March weather stoked demand
for the heating fuel and erased an inventory surplus over five-year average supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
