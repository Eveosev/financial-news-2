Philippine stocks rallied, sending
the benchmark equities index to its biggest gain in almost five
years, after valuations tumbled to a seven-month low.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  jumped 5.7 percent to
6,118.94 at the close of trading in Manila, the largest advance
since Nov. 25, 2008. The gauge entered a  bear market  yesterday
after falling more than 20 percent from a record 7,392.20 set on
May 15. The slump erased $65 billion in market capitalization
from the nation’s shares.  “Valuations have reached reasonable and attractive levels
that are hard to pass up,” said Allan Yu, who helps manage $10
billion at Manila-based Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. Still,
“the market will remain volatile as investors remain concerned
over the U.S. tapering its stimulus and the slowdown in  China .”  The index traded at 16.1 times projected 12-month earnings
yesterday, the cheapest since Nov. 23, down from a record 20.8
times on May 15. That compares with the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index’s 9.4 times. The Philippine gauge’s 30-day  volatility 
climbed to 42.7 today, the highest since December 2008.  The 14-day relative strength index for half of the
measure’s 30 stocks has dropped to less than 30, a  level  some
investors see as a signal that shares are poised to rise. Eight
stocks are at 52-week lows, the most since September 2011.  Jollibee Foods Corp. (JFC) , the nation’s largest restaurant
operator, climbed 9.9 percent. Manila Water Co., which services
half of the capital, jumped 12 percent, the steepest climb since
Nov. 3, 2008.  ‘Good Time’  SM Investments Corp. (SM) , owner of the nation’s biggest bank by
assets and the largest shopping mall operator, jumped 6.4
percent, the largest gain since Feb. 2, 2012.  Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) ,
the country’s largest property developer, climbed 7.4 percent,
the sharpest rise since Sept. 9, 2010.  Philippine stocks slumped from a record as overseas
investors sold shares after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said on May 22 the central bank could consider paring
stimulus if the U.S. employment market showed sustainable
improvement. Higher money-market rates in China this month
signaled tighter liquidity may hurt the nation’s growth outlook.  Foreign funds sold a net $42.9 million of Philippine shares
yesterday, extending this month’s sell-off to $387.3 million,
heading for a record monthly outflow. Overseas investors have
still purchased a net $1.35 billion of local stocks this year.  It’s a “good time” to start buying as stocks may be
“bottoming out,” Eduardo Francisco, president at BDO Capital
Corp., one the nation’s biggest arrangers of bond and share
sales, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
