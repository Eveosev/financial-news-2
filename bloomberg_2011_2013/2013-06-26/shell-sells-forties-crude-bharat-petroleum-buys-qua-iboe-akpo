Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold two
cargoes of  North Sea  Forties at the highest price in five weeks.
The company failed to buy CPC Blend in  Europe  at a smaller
discount than the previous trade.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. bought via a tender 1 million
barrels each of Nigerian Qua Iboe and Akpo crude for August
loading from China International United Petroleum & Chemical
Corp., known as Unipec, according to four traders who
participate in the market.  North Sea  Shell sold Forties cargo F0707 for July 7 to July 9 to
Mercuria Energy Trading SA at a premium of 15 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent,  a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. This is the
highest since May 16 and compares with a premium of 5 cents for
three shipments sold yesterday.  Shell also sold Forties lot F0710 for July 13 to July 15 to
 Total SA (FP)  at 40 cents a barrel less than the cash cost of North
Sea crude for August, the survey showed.  Eni SpA (ENI)  withdrew its offer for July 11 to July 13 at a
premium of 15 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, while
Total’s bid for July 16 to July 22 at parity to the benchmark
was canceled, according to the survey.  For Ekofisk, Total failed to buy a shipment for July 8 to
July 13 at 60 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to
the survey. This compares with a premium of 75 cents for a cargo
the company bought yesterday.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was 5 cents more than Dated Brent, compared with a
premium of 21 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $100.82 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $101.75 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $100.48 at the same time today, a discount of 34
cents to August.  The Aasgard oil and gas field was evacuated after a gas
alarm was triggered yesterday at about 8:30 p.m. local time,
Stavanger Aftenblad reported, citing  Statoil ASA (STL) ’s spokesman Ola
Anders Skauby.  Production was automatically shut down and all personnel
were evacuated except for some with emergency response duties,
according to the report.  Mediterranean/Urals  No bids or offers were made for Urals in Europe for a third
session. Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 3 cents to a
discount of 22 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. In northwest Europe, the  grade  was at 17 cents
a barrel more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 19
cents yesterday.  Shell failed to buy 85,000 metric tons of CPC blend for
July 11 to July 19 loading at 85 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent, the survey showed. The grade was last sold at a discount
of $1.05 on May 9.  West Africa  Nigerian Benchmark Qua Iboe fell 2 cents to $2.20 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Angola  will keep crude exports in August unchanged at 56
cargoes, according to a final loading program obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Exports will be 53.69 million barrels, or 1.73 million
barrels a day, the plan shows. That compares with revised
shipments of 53.81 million barrels, or 1.74 million barrels a
day, in July.  The final plan has one more August cargo than a preliminary
schedule released on June 17 after one shipment of Pazflor was
added.  An earlier July program was revised, adding one Palanca
cargo for loading on July 9 to July 10, bringing that month’s
tally to 56 as well, said three traders with knowledge of the
loading program, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
