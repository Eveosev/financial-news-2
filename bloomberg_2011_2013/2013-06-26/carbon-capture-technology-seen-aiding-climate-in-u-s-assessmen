The U.S. has 36 underground basins
that could store 3,000 metric gigatons of carbon dioxide,
according to a new assessment released by the  U.S. Geological
Survey  today.  Those reserves could be used for carbon-capture technology
from coal-fired power plants to reduce carbon emissions. By
comparison, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said the
U.S. emitted 5.5 metric gigatons of energy-related carbon
dioxide in 2011.  “If enough of this capacity also proves to be
environmentally and economically viable, then geologic carbon
sequestration could help us reduce carbon-dioxide emissions that
contribute to  climate change ,” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
