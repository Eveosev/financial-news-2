Zack Wheeler, who won his Major
League Baseball debut eight days ago, got no decision last night
as he allowed four runs on four hits in 5 1/3 innings in the  New
York  Mets’ 5-4 loss at the  Chicago White Sox .  Wheeler, 23, walked three and struck out one at U.S.
Cellular Field in  Chicago . In his debut on June 18, Wheeler
pitched six scoreless innings and got the win in the Mets’ 6-1
victory at the  Atlanta Braves .  The Mets (30-43) tied the game 4-4 in the top of the ninth
when second baseman Gordon Beckham allowed an infield popup to
fall for an error, allowing a run to score with two outs.  Alexei Ramirez’s run-scoring single with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth gave the White Sox (32-42) the win.  LaTroy Hawkins (2-1) got the loss, allowing one run on two
hits in two-thirds of an inning. Addison Reed (3-0) got the win
after blowing the save. White Sox starter Chris Sale gave up
three runs on four hits and struck out 13 in eight innings.  Also yesterday, the Mets traded Collin Cowgill to the  Los
Angeles Angels  for Kyle Johnson in an exchange of outfielders.  Cowgill, 27, was the starting center fielder for the Mets
on opening day and became the second player in franchise history
to hit a grand slam in the season opener. He was batting .180
with two home runs and eight runs batted in when he was sent to
the minor leagues on June 18.  Johnson, 23, was taken in the 25th round of the 2012 draft
and was batting .310 with two home runs and 30 stolen bases in
67 minor-league games this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
