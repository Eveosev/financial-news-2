Tin sales from  Indonesia , the
world’s largest supplier, may decline to the lowest level in
seven years as the country raises purity standards for shipments,
increasing the global deficit and boosting prices.  Exports will probably drop 20 percent this year to 79,000
metric tons as new rules take effect from July 1, according to
the median of estimates from seven smelter executives and one
analyst compiled by Bloomberg. That’s lower than in every year
back to 2007, when the Trade Ministry started checking sales,
and less than the 80,000 tons in a survey published May 7.  Tin fell into a bear market last month, following copper
and lead, on concern a slowdown in Europe and  China  would cut
demand. Indonesia will impose the rules as planned, raising the
minimum grade to 99.9 percent from 99.85 percent and cutting
lead and cadmium levels, the Trade Ministry said June 19. The
global shortage may exceed 4,000 tons in 2013, said Peter Kettle,
research manager at St. Albans, England-based group ITRI Ltd.,
whose members represented 60 percent of output last year.  “We see the market returning to deficit in the second half
of this year as a result of lower Indonesian sales and some
improvement in electronics sector demand,” Kettle said in an e-mail June 21. He estimates the 2012 deficit at 3,000 tons.  Futures, which rose 1.1 percent to $19,925 a ton on the
London Metal Exchange today, may climb to $24,000 in the second
half because of the regulations, President Director Sukrisno of
PT Timah, the third-biggest producer, said June 19. Tin has
dropped 15 percent this year, about the same as the decline in
the LME  index  of six metals.  Strict Enforcement  The rules “will result in a big drop in shipments in July
and August,” said Kettle. “If the new regulation continues as
it is and is strictly enforced for more than three months, we
will see higher LME prices.”  Some smelters in Bangka Belitung province, Indonesia’s main
producer, are in a “wait and see” mode, expecting a delay or
easing of the rules, Hidayat Arsani, president of the Indonesian
Tin Mining Association, said June 17. While most smelters can
meet the purity level of 99.9 percent, some find it hard to
comply with reduced levels for lead and cadmium, he said. Only
13 percent of 40 independent smelters would be able to comply
with the standard at the start, he said.  Timah (TINS) , which can comply with the rules, has met surveyors
in a bid to ensure that the purity standard is properly applied
from the beginning, said Sukrisno, who expects shipments may
drop as much as 24 percent to 75,000 tons this year.  “Depending on the severity of supply reductions, tin may
see some rally when the regulations take effect on July 1,”
Barnabas Gan, a Singapore-based analyst at OCBC Bank, said by e-mail June 24. Gan expects LME prices to stay above the $20,000
level next month.  Exports from Indonesia climbed the most in eight months in
May as smelters boosted shipments before the rules take effect.
Sales surged 18 percent from April to 9,242 tons, raising the
total 17 percent in the first five months to 43,900 tons from a
year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
