Indian stocks swung between gains
and losses before the expiry of monthly derivatives contracts
tomorrow.  The S&P BSE Sensex added 0.2 percent to 18,642.24 at 9:45
a.m. in Mumbai, after changing directions at least five times.
 Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the nation’s largest mobile-phone operator,
tumbled the most in a week.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  declined for the
seventh day. Power utility NTPC Ltd. climbed for the first time
this week, after agreeing to sign a fuel supply pact.  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL)  rose to a one-week high.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained for the first time in
three days today after better-than-forecast U.S. data boosted
the outlook for the world’s biggest economy. Indian Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said yesterday revisions to
some of the caps placed on foreign direct investment in  India 
should be in place by the second or third week of July, a move
that will help money flow back into the country, he said.  Foreign investors are on course for the first monthly net
sales of  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks since May 2012. Overseas funds pulled
$256 million from domestic shares on June 24, a 10th day of
outflows, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That pared this
year’s purchases to $13.8 billion, still a record for the
period, the data show.  Indian derivative contracts end on the last Thursday of
every month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
