Synthetic chemicals manufactured to
mimic the effects of marijuana and other illegal drugs are
proliferating worldwide, prompting the  United Nations  to issue a
warning in its latest  World Drug Report .  “New harmful substances have been emerging with unfailing
regularity on the drug scene,” the  UN Office on Drugs and Crime 
said today. “The international drug control system is
floundering for the first time under the speed and creativity of
the phenomenon.”  New recreational drugs, sold under labels like “Spice,”
“Meow-Meow” and “Bath Salts,” for the first time outnumbered
controlled substances like ecstasy, marijuana, and opium, the UN
said. The new synthetic drugs on the market rose more than 50
percent, to 251, compared with the 234 traditional drugs already
subject to international control.  “This is an alarming drug problem,” the Vienna-based UN
body said in a press release. “But the drugs are legal. Given
the almost infinite scope to alter the chemical structure of new
psychoactive substances, new formulations are outpacing efforts
to impose international control.”  Synthetic cannabinoids, the main compounds in “Spice,”
mimic tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, an active ingredient in
marijuana. They are second in popularity to pot among teenagers,
the  National Institute on Drug Abuse  said. Several artificial
cannabinoids and other synthetic drugs were banned in the U.S.
 Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 , which President
 Barack Obama  signed into law a year ago.  Marijuana continues to be the world’s no. 1 illegal drug of
choice, according to the UN data. The number of pot smokers
since rose to 180 million worldwide in 2011, the UN says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
