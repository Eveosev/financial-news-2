Residential Capital LLC, the
bankrupt former mortgage company, will ask a judge today to
approve a $2.1 billion deal with its parent  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) 
before unveiling a report into the disputes they settled.  The companies and their allies among ResCap’s creditors
will be in federal court in  Manhattan , seeking approval of a
plan support agreement that requires them to back the proposed
deal.  If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn makes public an $80
million investigative report about ResCap’s pre-bankruptcy
relationship with Ally too early, the deal could fall apart, the
companies say.  The settlement, reached last month, helps Ally move closer
to repaying a U.S. bailout by dodging lawsuits and other claims
that ResCap creditors said could be as much as $25 billion.
ResCap’s creditors want to avoid a long court fight that would
delay their repayment and which Glenn compared to “nuclear
war.”  The company that requested the report, Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., the holding company run by the billionaire  Warren Buffett ,
wants Glenn to unseal the report, saying creditors who are not
part of the deal need it to decide whether to support or oppose
the settlement.  ‘Disgruntled Creditor’  ResCap called Berkshire a “disgruntled creditor” that is
trying to leverage its name and position to get interest that
has accrued since ResCap filed bankruptcy last year.  The settling parties spent weeks working with a mediator
trying to work out a deal. The report, which none of the parties
has seen, pushed them to settle, ResCap said in court papers.
They were so concerned about what it might say that they agreed
that if the report was made public before the plan support
agreement was approved by Glenn, then any of the parties could
back out of the deal, according to court papers.  Under the settlement, Ally will pay $1.95 billion in cash
to the ResCap bankruptcy estate, plus $150 million in insurance
proceeds, according to a court filing today. The money will be
added to $4.5 billion ResCap raised by selling its mortgage-servicing business and a loan portfolio and eventually
distributed to creditors owed at least $6.3 billion under a
reorganization plan supported by Detroit-based Ally.  Ally Guarantee  Settling creditors include ResCap noteholder Paulson & Co.,
MBIA Insurance Corp. and a group of securitization trusts that
sued for losses tied to bad mortgages. Under the accord, Ally
will be guaranteed full repayment of the $1.13 billion it claims
ResCap owes it, Ally said in a statement.  The settlement is more than twice the $750 million that
Ally agreed to pay when ResCap filed bankruptcy a year ago.
Unsecured creditors attacked that proposed payment as too low.  ResCap, based in  New York , filed for bankruptcy partly to
help it resolve lawsuits brought by purchasers of mortgage bonds
backed by home loans. The investors claimed the bonds lost value
because many of the loans were bad. Such losses account for much
of the $25 billion in unsecured debt that the creditors
committee claimed ResCap may owe.  ResCap, Ally and unsecured creditors came to an agreement
after weeks of negotiating with the help of a mediator, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck. On May 13, word of a settlement
leaked out as a former bankruptcy judge, Arthur J. Gonzalez,
prepared to make public the results of his investigation into
Ally’s pre-bankruptcy relationship with ResCap.  The settling parties persuaded Glenn to temporarily seal
the investigative report at least until the deal comes before
the court for final approval.  Gonzalez examined claims that Ally exerted so much control
over ResCap that the auto lender could be forced to pay the
unsecured debts of its mortgage unit.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-bk-12020,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
