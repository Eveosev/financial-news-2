Libyan militiamen from the western
mountain town of Zintan attacked the Tripoli headquarters of the
country’s oilfield guards in an attack that left six people
injured and highlights growing risks to the sector.  The incident occurred yesterday when the Zintani unit,
tasked with guarding the Sharara Oil Fields in the south,
surrounded the building and opened fire, leading to a battle
between the two groups, according to a statement issued by the
Petroleum Facilities Guards, which gave no reason for what
triggered the violence. Three PFG guards were wounded, it said.  “The PFG will not tolerate any such criminal acts and
intends to take strict disciplinary actions against any who wish
to disturb law, order, security and endanger the lives of
civilians,” said the PFG, which is controlled by the Defense
Ministry.  Two years after the 2011 war that swept the late Muammar Qaddafi from power, government efforts to revive an economy
dependent on oil are being stymied by feuding militias and
protests at oil facilities that have cost Libya about 250,000
barrels per day in lost output, Oil Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi
said June 11.  There have been numerous demonstrations and attacks on
Libyan oil and gas facilities. The Zueitina oil terminal has
been shut down at least four times since November, and in March
the Italian company  Eni SpA (ENI)  halted gas exports to Europe through
its Greenstream pipeline for a week after clashes between rival
militias at its Mellitah gas plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
