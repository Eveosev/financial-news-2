Scotland  will be able to increase
capital spending by an inflation-adjusted 13 percent in the
2015-2016 financial year under new borrowing powers for the
semi-autonomous government in Edinburgh, U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne said today.  Spending on projects such as roads, hospitals and schools
will rise by more than 400 million pounds ($615 million) to 3.3
billion pounds, Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said in an e-mailed statement today. Capital spending for the U.K. as a whole
will increase 1.3 percent on the same basis.  Regular budget spending that year will fall 1.5 percent
from the previous year to 25.7 billion pounds on an inflation-adjusted basis, compared with a 2.5 percent drop for the U.K.
government, according to Osborneâ€™s  spending review .  The Scottish government, which is headed by First Minister
Alex Salmond and will hold an independence referendum next year,
has been pressing the U.K. for more money to spend on what it
calls shovel-ready projects to help boost economic growth.  Under legislation passed by U.K. lawmakers last year, the
Scottish government can borrow as much as 296 million pounds in
2015-2016 to spend on infrastructure. It is the first year the
new powers come into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
