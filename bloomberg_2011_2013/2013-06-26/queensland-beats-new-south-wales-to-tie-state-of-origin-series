Queensland beat New South Wales 26-6
to force a deciding match in rugby league’s State of Origin as
it seeks a record-extending eighth straight series victory.  Darius Boyd scored two tries last night at Brisbane’s
Suncorp Stadium as Queensland rebounded from a 14-6 loss in Game
1 of  Australia ’s annual interstate contest. Sam Thaiday and Greg Inglis also touched down for the Maroons and Johnathan Thurston
kicked 10 points.  Queensland, which started its unprecedented streak of
series victories in 2006, will try to extend the sequence on
July 17 at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium.  New South Wales, which is on a three-game winning run at
the Sydney arena, got a try from Brett Morris that was converted
by James Maloney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
