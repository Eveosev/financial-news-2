Liverpool made its fourth off-season
acquisition by signing Belgian international goalkeeper Simon Mignolet from English Premier League soccer rival Sunderland.  Mignolet, 25, signed a long-term contract after passing a
physical yesterday, Liverpool said, without disclosing financial
terms of the trade. The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that
Liverpool will pay Sunderland 9 million pounds ($13.8 million).  Mignolet, who had 11 shutouts in 38 starts for Sunderland
last season, joins Pepe Reina and Brad Jones as goalkeepers in
Liverpool’s squad. Manager Brendan Rodgers has also added
defender Kolo Toure and Spanish forwards Luis Alberto and Iago Aspas since Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and
failed to win a trophy.  “Competition can only be a good thing,” Mignolet said in
comments on Liverpool’s website. “It’s a challenge but that’s
what you want. You want to play in the big games, you want to
play for a big club and to play with pressure.”  Manchester City agreed to sell Argentine striker Carlos Tevez to Juventus for as much as 12 million pounds, the  BBC 
reported. Tevez, 29, is set to undergo a medical in  Italy  today
and will discuss a proposed three-year contract, the BBC added.  The clubs reached an agreement yesterday in  London  on a
deal that will save City about 27 million pounds when the
transfer fee is combined with wages and bonuses due Tevez in the
final year of his contract, the BBC added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
