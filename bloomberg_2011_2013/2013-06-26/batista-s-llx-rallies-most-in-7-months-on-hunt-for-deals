LLX Logistica SA, billionaire  Eike Batista ’s port startup, rallied the most in almost seven months
after announcing it hired consultants to aid its search for
investors.  LLX, based in Rio de Janeiro, rose 28 percent to 1.28 reais
at 11:58 a.m. in Sao Paulo, making it the biggest gainer on the
Bovespa Small Cap index, which added 1.6 percent. It was the
stock’s biggest intraday gain since Nov. 29.  “LLX has engaged financial advisers to evaluate possible
business opportunities and corporate transactions involving the
company’s assets and its securities,” the company said in a
statement late yesterday, without naming the consultants.  Batista plans to use LLX’s Acu port in Rio de Janeiro state
as a base of operations for his oil company  OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes .  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , his shipbuilder, is building a
yard at the port to manufacture oil-production vessels. OSX rose
as much as 6.6 percent today after it raised 183 million reais
($83.29 million) in a capital increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
