South African corn futures declined
for a fourth day after a report from the government’s Crop
Estimates Committee showed that production was higher than
anticipated by analysts.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
dropped 0.4 percent to 2,258 rand ($223) a metric ton, for the
longest losing streak for the contract since April 5. The white
variety for delivery in the same month was little changed at
2,288 rand a ton by the midday close on the South African
Futures Exchange.  “The crop estimate yesterday was a little more than some
people expected,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd.,
wrote from  Pretoria  in an e-mailed response to queries today.  The median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
the week before the report suggested that the nation might
produce 11.3 million tons of corn this season. The CEC report
published yesterday showed that farmers may reap 11.38 million
tons, still less than the 11.4 million tons predicted on May 23.
The committee’s spokeswoman, Marda Scheepers, said dry
conditions earlier in the season hurt yields.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal from the white variety is a staple food while the yellow
kind is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July fell 0.3 percent to 3,520 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
