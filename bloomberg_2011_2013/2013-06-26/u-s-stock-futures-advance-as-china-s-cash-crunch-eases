U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  higher for a second day, as  China ’s cash crunch eased and slower-than-forecast economic growth fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus.  Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. rose at least 0.7 percent as financial stocks rallied. Boeing Co. and Microsoft Corp. jumped more than 2 percent to pace gains in the the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . Barrick Gold Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp. fell more than 5.9 percent, leading a selloff in precious-metal producers as gold and silver slumped to 34-month lows.

The Dow climbed 149.83 points, or 1 percent, to 14,910.14 today.

The gauge has still retreated 4 percent from a record high reached May 21 as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may start paring quantitative-easing measures this year if the recovery continues to improve in line with forecasts.  Central bank stimulus has helped fuel a rally in stocks worldwide, with the benchmark U.S. index surging as much as  147 percent  from its March 2009 low.  Fed Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he expects the U.S. expansion to remain “sluggish” for “a couple more years,” and today’s downward revision to first-quarter growth is in line with his outlook. Lacker, who doesn’t vote on the  Federal Open Market Committee  this year, said he sees growth of about 2.25 percent in 2014.  ‘Disappointing Rate’  “The economy is telling us this is about all we’re capable of right now,” Lacker said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Peter Cook . “We’re going to continue to get growth at a fairly disappointing rate going forward.”  Stocks advanced in  Asia  and  Europe  today as the cost of locking in China’s interest rates slid for a fourth day and money-market rates fell.
