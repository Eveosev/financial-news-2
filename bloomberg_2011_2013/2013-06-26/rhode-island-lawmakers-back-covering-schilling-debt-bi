Rhode Island lawmakers backed using
$2.5 million next year to cover a payment on $75 million of
bonds that drew ex-Boston Red Sox Pitcher  Curt Schilling ’s
failed 38 Studios LLC video-game company to Providence.  Members of the  House of Representatives  will reconvene
later today to continue debate on a fiscal 2014 budget after a
move to strip the payment from the plan failed by a vote of
20-54. The margin was four votes more than are needed to include
the money in the final spending measure.  Moves to avoid covering the payment led Moody’s Investors
Service to put the state’s Aa2 credit rating under review for a
cut, saying that an unwillingness to make good on bonds backed
by the state’s “moral obligation pledge” would erode the
credit quality of more than $2 billion in debt.  “It’s going to have a huge ripple effect on all of us,”
if  Rhode Island  reneges on the obligation, Representative Linda
Finn, a Middletown Democrat, said on the House floor during the
debate. Even talking about not making the bond payments “is
such a bad reflection on our state,” she said.  The Rhode Island Economic Development Corp. issued the
revenue securities in 2010 to get Schilling to move the company
to Rhode Island from Maynard,  Massachusetts , bringing the
promise of hundreds of jobs. About two years later, 38 Studios
entered Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation amid allegations of
mismanagement and unmet obligations. About 400 people lost their
jobs as a result.  To contact the reporter on this story:
