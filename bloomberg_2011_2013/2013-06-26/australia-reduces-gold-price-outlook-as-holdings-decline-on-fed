Gold is forecast to drop 13 percent
this year and extend losses into 2014 as investor holdings
tumble amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will reduce
asset purchases, according to  Australia ’s government forecaster.  Prices may average $1,444 an ounce in 2013 and $1,340 in
2014 from $1,668 last year, the Canberra-based Bureau of
Resources and Energy Economics said in a  report . The forecast
for this year compares with an estimate in March for an average
price of $1,638 in 2013. Since January, spot bullion has
averaged about $1,530, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold has plunged 26 percent this year, entering a  bear
market  in April, after some investors lost faith in the metal as
a store of value. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this month
that the central bank, which buys $85 billion of Treasury and
mortgage debt a month, could trim purchases this year and end
the program in 2014 should the  U.S. economy  continue to improve.  The price drop “may be attributed to a change in investor
sentiment towards gold in response to indications that the U.S.
Federal Reserve may end its quantitative-easing program earlier
than expected,” the bureau said. That change “contributed to a
capital outflow from gold into other asset classes,” it said.  Gold for immediate delivery dropped as much as 2.6 percent
to $1,244 an ounce, the cheapest since September 2010, and was
at $1,247.27 at 11:25 a.m. in  Singapore . It’s heading for the
worst quarterly drop since 1920.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest
exchange-traded product backed by bullion, fell to 969.5 tons
yesterday, the lowest since February 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold output in Australia, the world’s second-biggest
producer, may increase to 263 tons in the year starting July 1
from 252 tons this year. Exports may reach 304 tons in 2013-2014
from 281 tons a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
