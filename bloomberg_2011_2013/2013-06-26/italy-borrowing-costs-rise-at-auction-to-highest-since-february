Italy’s borrowing costs rose at a
sale of 8 billion euros ($10.4 billion) of bills as bonds of
European peripheral countries remain under pressure amid concern
about a withdrawal of liquidity from central banks.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8 billion euros of 186-day
bills at 1.052 percent, the highest since Feb. 26 and up from
0.538 percent at the previous auction May 29, when investors
appetite was still fueled by the  European Central Bank ’s pledge
to buy bonds of countries in distress.  Investors bid for 1.36 times the amount offered, down from
1.58 last month. Yesterday Italy paid the most since September
to place a new 2015 zero-coupon bond.  Sovereign securities around the world have tumbled since
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 U.S. policy makers may
begin paring asset purchases this year and end them in mid-2014.  The widening of spreads is probably temporary, Italy debt
chief Maria Cannata said at a conference in  London  yesterday.
Italy has now more U.S. investors than a year ago and that is a
“good sign of confidence,” she said.  Italy returns to the market tomorrow, when it plans to
auction as much as 5 billion euros of five and 10-year bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
