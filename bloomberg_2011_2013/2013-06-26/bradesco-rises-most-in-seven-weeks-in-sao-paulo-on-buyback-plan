Banco Bradesco SA, Latin America’s
second-biggest lender by market value, rose the most in seven
weeks after saying it renewed a stock buyback program to
repurchase as many 15 million shares over the next year.  The shares  rose  1.6 percent to 28.45 reais at 12:51 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo  after gaining 2.9 percent in the steepest intraday
advance since May 7. The benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV)  added 0.5 percent.  Bradesco purchased 742,180 shares under the buyback
program’s initial period, according to a regulatory filing late
yesterday. The bank’s decision to extend the term through the
next 12 months is a sign that management considers the stock
cheap after recent declines, according to  Pedro Galdi , the chief
strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora.  “It also helps to increase liquidity, which is good for
investors too,” Galdi said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  Bradesco has lost 11 percent this year, compared with a 16
percent drop by the MSCI Brazil Financials index during that
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
