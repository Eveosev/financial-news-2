Governor  Chris Christie , a Republican who last year rejected a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey, said the U.S.  Supreme Court ’s rulings yesterday on the issue were misguided.  The high court justices ignored the will of a Democratic president and a Republican-led Congress that enacted the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which denied benefits to married same-sex couples, Christie said. The candidate for re-election in November spoke on the issue yesterday on a call-in program broadcast on Townsquare Media LLC’s WKXW-FM station in Ewing.  Justice  Anthony Kennedy ’s opinion was “demeaning” to lawmakers who had cast votes on the measure, Christie said. The court struck down the U.S. law by a 5-4 vote. Such marriages are allowed in 12 states and the  District of Columbia , while they’re not allowed in  New Jersey .  The Garden State (STONJ1)  permits same-sex civil-unions under a 2006 law. Seven gay couples sued in 2011, claiming in New Jersey Superior Court that the statute has made them a separate legal class whose rights aren’t fully understood or recognized. The legislature, run by Democrats, passed a same-sex marriage bill in February 2012, which Christie vetoed.  New Jerseyans  backed gay weddings 62 percent to 30 percent, a record level of support, in a Rutgers-Eagleton telephone poll of 923 adults taken April 3-7. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.  Remaining Options  Lawmakers could try to pass a bill similar to the 2012 measure and try to override a veto, though Democrats, including Assemblyman Tim Eustace, who lives in Maywood with his male partner of 30 years, have said they lack enough votes.  “For the thousands of same-sex couples and their families still struggling for equality in their states, including New Jersey, I hope this will serve as a beacon of hope that eventually justice will prevail,” Eustace said yesterday in a statement about the court rulings.  Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, an openly gay Democrat from Trenton, sponsored a bill to put the question before voters in November. Leaders of his party, including Senate President Steve Sweeney of West Deptford and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, from  East Orange , have said the matter involves a civil right that shouldn’t be subject to a popular vote.  Christie said he’d support putting the subject before voters, and blamed “politics” for keeping such a measure off the ballot.  Ballot Question  “I’ve said I wouldn’t object to it,” the governor said of giving the state’s voters the opportunity to decide the issue. He said he personally would vote against making same-sex marriage legal, though he would uphold the law if it passed.  In a separate ruling yesterday, the Supreme Court effectively ended a ban on gay weddings in  California , the result of passage of a ballot measure there. The justices didn’t rule on the merits of the California law, only a procedural matter that made its legality moot.  Same-sex marriage derailed Christie’s May 2012 nomination of  Bruce Harris  to the state Supreme Court. Harris, an openly gay Republican and a finance lawyer, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would recuse himself from same-sex marriage matters. Panel members cited the statement and his lack of courtroom experience in rejecting Harris.  Christie called the move a “political assassination.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Elise Young in Trenton, New Jersey, at  eyoung30@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Merelman at  smerelman@bloomberg.net
