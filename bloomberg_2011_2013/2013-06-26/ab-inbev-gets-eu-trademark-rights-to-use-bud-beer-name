Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  was formally
granted the European Union-wide trademark right for the word
“Bud” for beer after an EU agency registered the intellectual
property right.  The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market, the
EU’s trademark authority, registered the Bud trademark, the
brewer said in an e-mailed statement today. The step follows AB
InBev’s victory in a trademark clash with Czech competitor
Budejovicky Budvar NP at the  EU General Court  in Luxembourg.  “While we have national rights for Bud and Budweiser in
many European Union member states, it fills in the remaining
gaps that we had,” Frank Hellwig, global legal director at AB
InBev, said in a statement. “We now have more countries covered
by Bud or Budweiser trademark registrations than we have had at
any point in time in the 137 year history of the brand.”  AB InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, and Czech rival
Budvar have been entangled in disputes over the use of the Bud
brand for more than a century, as each brewer won and lost the
rights in different rulings. Anheuser-Busch, founded by German-born American Adolphus Busch, said it started using the
Budweiser name in 1876, 19 years before Budvar was formed.  The Czech brewer didn’t appeal the EU court decision from
January. The EU trademark office approved the Bud registration
on June 14, AB InBev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
