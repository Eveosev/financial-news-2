The benchmark  gold contract  on
China’s largest spot bullion market declined for a 10th day to
the lowest level in more than three years, heading for the
longest losing run on record.  Bullion of 99.99 percent purity fell as much as 3.1 percent
to 251  yuan  a gram ($1,269.80 an ounce) on the  Shanghai  Gold
Exchange, the cheapest since April 23, 2010. Prices have fallen
for 10 days, the longest decline since 2002, when the bourse
began trading, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contract traded at 251.86 yuan at 11:29 a.m. in Shanghai.  Gold has extended declines since U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last week that the central bank,
which buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt each month,
may begin paring purchases this year should the economy continue
to improve. Investors have reduced holdings in  exchange-traded
products  at a record pace this year.  “Gold has been hurt by expectations that easy money may
soon be over,” said Wang Xiaoli, chief investment strategist at
CITICS Futures Co., a unit of  China ’s biggest listed brokerage.
“China gold prices are taking direction from the international
market. Physical buying is robust, but we won’t see the kind of
rush like the last time as more people take a wait-and-see
approach, perhaps waiting for further declines.”  Volumes for the 99.99 percent contract climbed to 19,178
kilograms yesterday, more than four times the daily average in
2012. They reached a record 43,272 kilograms on April 22 after a
price plunge stoked a buying frenzy across the country.  China may overtake  India  as the largest gold consumer this
year as regulators make investing in the metal easier, according
to the China Gold Association. The world’s second-largest
economy approved its first two domestic ETPs backed by the metal
this month.  To contact the reporter for this story:
