A U.S. sale of $35 billion of five-year notes drew the strongest demand in more than three years
from an investor class that includes foreign central banks after
weaker-than-estimated economic data eased speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will soon reduce monetary stimulus.  Indirect bidders  purchased 53 percent of the notes, the
most since January 2010, at the offering yesterday. That
compared with an average of 41.7 percent at the past 10 sales.
The auction of five-year debt due in June 2018 drew the lowest
overall demand since 2009. It  yielded  1.484 percent, the highest
since July 2011, versus a forecast of 1.472 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed 21 primary dealers.  “People were really concerned about this particular
maturity after the selloff we’ve seen,” said Tom Simons, an
economist in New York at Jefferies LLC, which as a primary
dealer is obligated to bid in U.S. debt sales. “This looked
like the flashpoint where you could have had a bad auction, but
there was demand at these levels.”  The  current  five-year note yield fell seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.42 percent yesterday in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, halting five days of
increases. The yields have more than doubled since reaching a
2013 low of 0.65 percent on May 2.  U.S. GDP  Treasuries gained yesterday, pushing 10-year yields down
for the first time in eight days, as Commerce Department data
showed the  U.S. economy  grew at a slower rate in the first
quarter than previously estimated. Gross domestic product rose
an annualized 1.8 percent from January through March, instead of
the 2.4 percent previously calculated, the figures showed,
easing concern the Fed is moving closer to slowing bond buying.  Ten-year (USGG10YR)  yields reached 2.66 percent on June 24, the
highest level since August 2011, after Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said last week policy makers may reduce bond purchases
this year and end them in mid-2014 if economic growth is in line
with their projections. Policy makers are forecasting growth of
as much as 2.6 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014.  The Fed has been buying $85 billion of bonds every month to
put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  At yesterday’s auction, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 2.45 percent, the least since September 2009. The
average for the past 10 auctions was 2.84.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 3.6 percent of the
securities, the lowest level since November 2009. The average at
the past 10 auctions was 16.9 percent.  ‘Slightly Weak’  “Despite the weak bid-to-ask, the overall street demand
was still acceptable given the volatile markets,”  George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy at the primary dealer
Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a note to clients. “All things
considered, this is a slightly weak auction, which we award a B-minus on our grade scale.”  Five-year notes are at almost the cheapest they’ve been in
nearly two years, according to the  butterfly chart  spread formed
by Treasury two-, five- and seven-year yields.  The spread, which measures how well the five-year note is
performing against the two other securities, is about 49 basis
points, almost the highest since July 2011. A positive reading
indicates investors are more bearish on the middle security,
making it relatively cheap versus the others. The average over
the past five years has been 37 basis points.  Note’s Loss  Five-year notes have lost 2.8 percent this year through
June 25, versus a drop of 3.1 percent by the broad Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
five-year debt has dropped 1.9 percent since the June 19 Fed
meeting.  The auction was the second of three note offerings this
week totaling $99 billion. The government sold $35 billion of
two-year notes on June 25 and will auction $29 billion of seven-year debt today.  The sales will raise $40.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $58.3 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporter on this story:
