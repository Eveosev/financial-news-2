Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s non-operating Quigley
Co. can end almost nine years in bankruptcy under a plan that
will resolve most asbestos claims against the  world’s largest
drugmaker  and its former maker of insulation products.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in  Manhattan  today
approved a Chapter 11 plan under which Pfizer will contribute
assets worth $964 million. He rejected a prior plan almost three
years ago, saying Pfizer was improperly using Quigley’s
bankruptcy to shield itself from asbestos claims.  Bernstein found in September 2010 that Pfizer’s proposed
$216.2 million contribution to a prior plan wasn’t enough
considering court testimony that Quigley may face $4.45 billion
in claims over 42 years, and that asbestos claimants could have
fared better by suing the company under civil tort law. A
company reorganizing in bankruptcy is shielded from lawsuits,
including tort, or wrongful-injury claims. Once it emerges, it
is a new legal entity, and often can no longer be sued.  Quigley, which made asbestos-containing products from the
1940s to the 1970s, including Insulag, a powdered insulation,
was bought by Pfizer in 1968. It stopped most operations in 1992
and filed for bankruptcy in 2004, facing 160,000 lawsuits. Many
also named Pfizer, whose name appeared on Insulag packaging.  Pfizer has said throughout the case that it never made or
sold Quigley’s products and it doesn’t have liability for them.
Asbestos, once widely used as an insulator, was later shown to
cause cancer.  U.S. Objection  The U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog for the  Justice
Department , sought to have the case thrown out in 2010, saying
that while it’s pending, creditors with alleged asbestos-related
health problems have been unable to sue New York-based Pfizer,
and many have died.  Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer was the sole objector to the
current plan. The Woodbridge, New Jersey-based law firm called
it yet another flawed plan after “nine years of afflicted
deals” in which Pfizer has tried to buy votes.  The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-bk-15739,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan). The appeals
case is 11-2635, 11-2767,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
