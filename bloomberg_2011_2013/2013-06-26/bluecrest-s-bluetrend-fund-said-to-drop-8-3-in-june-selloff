BlueCrest Capital Management LLP’s
$14 billion hedge fund that uses computer models to follow
trends in asset prices lost 8.3 percent this month as bonds and
currencies fell, according to a report sent to investors.  The BlueTrend fund has dropped 9.2 percent in the year
through June 21, according to the note obtained by  Bloomberg
News . The hedge fund has produced an average annual return of
12.9 percent since its inception in 2004 and has never had a
calendar-year loss.  Trend-following  hedge funds  have been hurt after comments
by Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  that the central
bank may begin curtailing fixed-income purchases triggered a
selloff for bonds and currencies around the globe. Cantab
Capital Partners LLP’s $4.5 hedge fund, which also relies on
computer algorithms, has fallen 19 percent this year.  Ed Orlebar, a spokesman for London-based BlueCrest,
declined to comment on the fund’s performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
