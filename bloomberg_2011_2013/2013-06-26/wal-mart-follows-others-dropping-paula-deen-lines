Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, said it will cut ties with Paula Deen, making
it at least the third business to sever connections with the
celebrity chef after she admitted using racial remarks.  Wal-Mart said in a  statement  on its website that it will
not place new orders with Paula Deen Enterprises beyond what it
has committed for any of Deen’s products, which include
southern-themed cookware, place settings and floral aprons.  In addition to Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest hog
producer, the Food Network, part of  Scripps Networks Interactive
Inc. (SNI) , said last week it will sever ties with the chef. The star
of “Paula’s Home Cooking” and “Paula’s Best Dishes” became
embroiled in controversy when she said in court documents made
public last week that she has used a derogatory term for black
people.  The cooking show personality has since made a series of
YouTube apologies and made a tearful appearance on NBC’s
“Today” show with Matt Lauer this morning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
