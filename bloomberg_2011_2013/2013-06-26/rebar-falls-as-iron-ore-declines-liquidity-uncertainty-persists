Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell as iron ore declined for the third day and as
uncertainty persisted over liquidity in the Chinese economy.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined as much as 0.9 percent to 3,426 yuan ($557) a
metric ton before trading at 3,433 at 10:40 a.m. local time.  Iron ore  prices for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
 China  fell for the third day yesterday, dropping 2.2 percent to
$114 a dry ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd. Iron ore is a
major steel-making ingredient. Investors were still gauging the
impact on bulk commodities of reduced liquidity that pushed up
money market rates last week and this week dragged the country’s
 equities  into a bear market, said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at
Beijing CIFCO Futures Co.  “Bearish factors currently outweigh positive ones as the
tight liquidity problem doesn’t look like it will be solved
anytime soon,” Wang said in an e-mailed report today. “We have
more volatility ahead.”  The average spot price for rebar in China fell 0.3 percent
to 3,379  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
