Wealth management firms predict more
mergers and acquisitions in their industry amid pressure on
margins and increased regulatory and tax scrutiny, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Subdued client activity, the elimination of commission paid
to fund distributors and the growing cost of implementing
regulation or paying fines are prompting some firms to reduce
costs or sell operations, the accounting firm said in a report
published today.  “Significant consolidation has been forecast, continues to
be forecast, and is actually stepping up,” Steve Crosby, a New
York-based senior managing director at PwC who advises private
banks, said in a telephone interview. “You will see firms both
growing abroad and also acquiring institutions over the next
several years.”  Wealth managers previously focused on growth without
acquisitions given the small number of sellers, high asset
prices and integration risks, PwC said in the report. This trend
will be replaced in the next two years by “significant
consolidation,” according to more than a third of the 200
survey participants.  Some banking and insurance firms in whole or part sold
their private banking and wealth management units after the
financial crisis to raise capital amid pressure from regulators,
according to the report.  “Both buyers and sellers now have a number of years of
post-financial crisis results with which to re-establish
business valuations and this may increase deal closure rates in
the future,” PwC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
