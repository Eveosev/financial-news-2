Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  boosted its plan for buybacks and lifted its dividend by 50
percent after Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee sold assets to
simplify the insurer. The stock rallied in New York trading.  The  repurchase  authorization was increased to $1.25 billion
from $500 million, according to a statement today from Hartford
which is based in the Connecticut city of the same name.  McGee has sold a life insurer to  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) 
and divested a broker dealer as he focuses on property-casualty
coverage. He also used hedges to guard against currency
fluctuations and stock-market declines on annuities issued in
prior years after the company retreated from the market.  “The financial position, capital flexibility and risk
profile of the company have continued to improve,” McGee, 58,
said in the statement.  Hartford  jumped  2.8 percent to $29.99 at 4:03 p.m., the
biggest increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index.
The company has advanced 34 percent this year.  The  quarterly dividend  will be 15 cents a share, up from 10
cents. Hartford cut its dividend to 5 cents in 2009 as losses
tied to the financial crisis drained capital and the company
took a U.S. rescue that it later repaid. The quarterly payout
was as high as 53 cents a share in 2008.  The sales of Hartford’s individual life, retirement,
annuities-distribution and broker-dealer businesses have freed
up more than $2 billion of capital. Hartford said in February it
would reduce debt by about $1 billion and repurchase as much as
$500 million in stock by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
