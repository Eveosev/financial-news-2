U.S. stocks and commodities rallied
amid better-than-estimated economic data and assurances from
 Federal Reserve  officials that the central bank will continue to
spur growth if needed. Italian and Spanish bonds rose as
European finance chiefs agreed on how to handle failing banks.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.6 percent to
1,613.2 at 4 p.m. in  New York  and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
jumped 0.7 percent. The S&P GSCI  gauge  of 24 raw materials added
0.8 percent as oil surged 1.6 percent, while gold dipped to a
34-month low below $1,200 an ounce. Ten-year Treasury yields
lost six basis points to 2.47 percent and the rate on  Italy ’s
 bonds  dropped 14 basis points to 4.57 percent. The yen lost 0.6
percent to 98.33 per dollar and  China ’s seven-day repurchase
rate fell for a fifth day.  U.S. consumer spending rebounded, pending home sales jumped
to the highest level since 2006 and jobless claims declined last
week, reports showed today. Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said the central bank may prolong
its asset-purchase program if the economy’s performance fails to
meet the Fed’s forecasts.  “The data continues to show that the economy is growing at
a very slow pace and that unemployment is improving at a very
slow pace,” Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG Defensive
Beta Fund and president of Suffern, New York-based Gary Goldberg
Financial Services, said in a phone interview. The firm manages
about $650 million. “It means the likelihood of the Federal
Reserve changing course on its monetary policy this year is very
low and that further solidifies the case that last week’s
correction was emotionally driven and an overreaction.”  Global equities  have lost more than $3 trillion this month
as the Fed said it may pare asset purchases and investors
speculated that rising Chinese funding costs will curb growth.  Increased Spending  The  S&P 500 ’s three-day advance of 2.6 percent is its best
rally since the beginning of the year. The index trimmed its
June decline to 1.1 percent. The benchmark gauge of American
stocks is up 2.8 percent in the second quarter and 13 percent in
2013.  All 10 of the main industry groups in the S&P 500 advanced
today except for commodity producers. ConAgra Foods Inc. jumped
5.1 percent, the most since September, after quarterly earnings
topped analysts’ estimates as acquisitions drove sales in its
consumer foods unit. Hewlett-Packard Co., Boeing Co. and
UnitedHealth Group Inc. climbed at least 2 percent to lead the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  up 114 points to 15,024.49.  Market Leaders  An S&P index of  homebuilders  jumped 2.9 percent for a third
day of gains, as 10 of its 11 members advanced. D.R. Horton Inc.
and Lennar Corp. surged almost 4 percent and Home Depot Inc.,
the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer, added 0.8 percent.
The index of pending home sales jumped 6.7 percent to 112.3, the
highest since December 2006, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed.  Financial stocks  in the S&P 500 jumped 1.3 percent as a
group to lead the advance, with JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup
Inc. and American Express Co. climbing at least 1.2 percent
each.  A Commerce Department report showed household purchases,
which account for about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.3
percent after a 0.3 percent decline the prior month that was the
biggest since September 2009. Incomes advanced 0.5 percent, more
than projected.   Jobless claims  decreased by 9,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended June 22 from a revised 355,000 the prior period, the Labor
Department reported. The Bloomberg survey median called for
345,000 claims.  ‘Higher Pace’  “If labor market conditions and the economy’s growth
momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC’s outlook --
and this is what has happened in recent years -- I would expect
that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for
longer,” Dudley said in remarks prepared for delivery today in
New York. He serves as vice chairman of the  Federal Open Market
Committee  and has never dissented from a monetary policy
decision.  Fed Governor Jerome Powell said that while the central
bank’s asset purchases may be scaled back later this year if
growth holds up, and any such trimming depends on economic data
rather than the calendar. The Fed may wait “before moderating
purchases or even increase them” if the economy weakens, while
the program “may be moderated somewhat more quickly” should
the economy strengthen faster than anticipated, Powell said
today in the text of remarks prepared for delivery in
 Washington .  Quarter End  Investors should expect about $13 billion in selling of
equities and buying of bonds as pension fund managers rebalance
their portfolios at the of the second quarter, Ramon Verastegui,
a derivatives strategist at Societe Generale SA in New York,
wrote in a June 25 note. The S&P 500 has outperformed  government
bonds  since the end of March with a total return of 2.7 percent
through yesterday compared with 5.1 percent loss for 10-year
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.  U.S.-listed bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds saw
record monthly redemptions of $61.7 billion through June 24,
according to TrimTabs Investment Research, amid concern the Fed
may scale back its unprecedented stimulus. Mutual funds that
invest in U.S. stocks had $463 million in outflows in the five
days that ended with the Fed’s policy statement on June 19,
according to data from the  Investment Company Institute  released
today. Redemptions since May 16 total $7.3 billion.  “The flows coming out of fixed income need to go
somewhere,” Bill Schultz, chief investment officer who oversees
about $1.1 billion at McQueen Ball & Associates in Bethlehem,
 Pennsylvania , said by phone. “ Money market funds  don’t offer
anything, bonds are less attractive, so U.S. domestic equities
on a relative scale look like the most attractive asset going
forward.”  Treasury Volatility  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch  MOVE index  fell for a second day yesterday. The
measure dropped to 103.46 after reaching 110.98 on June 24, the
highest since November 2011. It has averaged 62.25 this year.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Sovereign Plus Index lost 2 percent this quarter
through yesterday, set for the worst performance since the three
months through Dec. 31, 2010. While the average yield on the
securities has climbed to 1.74 percent from 1.43 percent on
March 31, it is still below the mean of 2.06 percent for the
past five years.  European Markets  The number of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 4.6 percent less than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has retreated
4.8 percent this month and 2.5 percent this quarter, trimming
its annual increase to 2.4 percent.  Italian bonds rose for a second day as the nation sold 5
billion euros ($6.5 billion) of five- and 10-year securities,
matching its maximum target.  Spain ’s 10-year yield dropped six
basis points to 4.78 percent and the rate on similar-maturity
German bunds slipped four basis points to 1.72 percent.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose for a third day,
adding 2 percent and paring this quarter’s loss to 11 percent
and declines for the year to 13 percent. That compares with a
quarterly gain of of 0.3 percent for the MSCI World Index of
developed countries, which is 7.4 percent higher in 2013.  Korea, India  South Korea ’s Kospi gauge jumped 2.9 percent, the most in
nine months, after the current-account surplus widened to a
record in May and the government raised its economic growth
forecast.  India ’s Sensex advanced 1.8 percent and the rupee
gained after the country’s current-account gap narrowed more
than forecast.  China’s seven-day repo rate fell 55 basis points to 6.74
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. It reached a record 12.4
percent on June 20 and rose 193 basis points this month.  West Texas Intermediate oil rose 1.6 percent to $97.05 a
barrel, leaving it little changed for the quarter. Nickel jumped
1.8 percent and lead climbed 1 percent to help lead the advance
in commodities.  The slide in gold came as better-than-estimated economic
data eroded the metal’s appeal as a store of value.  Gold futures for August delivery dropped 1.5 percent to
$1,211.60 an ounce and touched $1,196.10, the lowest since
August 2010. The metal headed for a record quarterly drop amid
an equity rally and muted inflation.  The dollar was down 0.2 percent at $1.3043 per euro while
the  Dollar Index , a gauge of the currency against six major
peers, was little changed after a six-day gain, its longest
rally in 13 months.  The pound fell for a third day against the dollar, losing
0.4 percent to $1.5261, as a report showed disposable income in
the U.K. plunged the most in 25 years in the first quarter.  The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index slipped to 11.18
percent after touching 11.96 percent on June 24, the highest
since June 2012. The average for 2013 is 9.18 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
