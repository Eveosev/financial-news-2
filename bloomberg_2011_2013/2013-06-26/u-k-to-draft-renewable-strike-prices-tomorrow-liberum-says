The U.K. government will publish
draft strike prices tomorrow outlining how much renewable
project developers will earn for each megawatt-hour of power
they produce, a Liberum Capital Ltd. analyst said.  The draft prices will not include nuclear  power plants  or
 carbon capture  and storage projects,  Peter Atherton , an analyst
for the London-based investment bank, said in an e-mailed note.  The prices will be paid under so-called contracts for
difference that Britain is introducing to guarantee payments for
power from low-carbon sources. The government aims to get 30
percent of its electricity from clean sources by 2020, up from
about 12 percent now. It has a target of deriving 15 percent of
all energy from renewables by the end of the decade.  The Department of Energy and Climate Change will also
publish details on the design and timetable for a capacity
market, which will pay generators for providing reliable
capacity at times of peak demand, Atherton said.  The British Geological Survey is due to release a report on
the potential value of shale gas deposits in the nation.  A spokesman at DECC said in an e-mail that Energy and
Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey and Business and Energy
Minister  Michael Fallon  will hold a press conference tomorrow
morning to outline a package of announcements aimed at
stimulating growth in the energy sector.  To contact the reporters on this story:
