Green REIT Plc said it’s seeking to
raise about 200 million euros ($260 million) in an initial
public offering and would become Ireland’s first real estate
investment trust.  Green REIT will mostly own commercial real estate in the
Irish capital, the company said in a statement today. The
company’s management will seek shareholder returns of 10 percent
to 15 percent a year when fully invested, according to the
statement. The shares would be listed on the London and Irish
stock exchanges.  “The establishment of Ireland’s first REIT is positive for
the Irish commercial-property market, providing stability with
long-term capital, and represents a significant commitment to
Ireland by an established team,” Gary Kennedy, chairman of
Green REIT, said in the statement.  Green REIT said its sole investment manager will be Green
Property REIT Ventures Ltd., which is led by Stephen Vernon and
Pat Gunne. Vernon was managing director of Green Property Plc
from 1993 until it was bought 2002, and he has since been
chairman of the closely held company, according to the
statement.  Green REIT will begin trading on July 18, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
