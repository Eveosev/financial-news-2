Ford Motor Co. (F) , the fastest-growing
major foreign automaker in  China  this year, said its sales gain
will outpace the industry in 2013 as customers buy new models.  “We don’t see the growth rate backing off for the rest of
this year,” John Lawler, head of Ford in China, said today at a
briefing in Shanghai, without giving figures. “We’re seeing
great reception of our new vehicles.”  Ford sales surged 48 percent in the first five months of
the year in China, beating foreign peers including Toyota Motor
Corp. and Volkswagen AG, on demand for the Focus compact and
EcoSport and Kuga sport-utility vehicles. The Dearborn,
Michigan-based automaker, whose China passenger-car deliveries
have climbed three times as fast as the industry in 2013, will
introduce the Mondeo sedan in China this year, Lawler said.  China’s  passenger-vehicle sales  may increase 8.5 percent to
about 16.8 million units in 2013, according to the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Commercial-vehicle
sales will probably rebound from last year’s 5.5 percent
contraction, gaining 1 percent to about 3.85 million units.  Ford will introduce the Sync AppLink  -- an interactive
feature that allows drivers to use smartphone applications
through voice commands -- in China next year, said Edward Pleet,
the company’s director of connected services for Asia Pacific,
 Africa  and Europe.  The automaker will work with Chinese companies including
 Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  and  Sina Corp. (SINA)  to customize the mobile apps for
Chinese consumers, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
