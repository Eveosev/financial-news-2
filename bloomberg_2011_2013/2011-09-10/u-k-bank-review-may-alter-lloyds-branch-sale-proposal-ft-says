A review of the U.K. banking system
may alter a previous proposal that  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
should sell more than 632 branches, the  Financial Times 
reported, citing people close to the government’s Independent
Commission on Banking it didn’t identify.  The bank is being forced to sell the branches under
European Union state aid rules, the FT said today. The ITC had
previously proposed selling a larger number because it would
improve competition, the newspaper reported.  Instead of having to sell more than the EU rules
stipulated, the commission will propose on Sept. 12 that the
locations due to be sold should go to another bank that already
has branches in the U.K. to create a stronger competitor, the
report said.  ITC Chairman  John Vickers  will also define how lenders
should ring-fence businesses including mortgage lending and
deposit taking, protecting them from riskier  investment banking ,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
