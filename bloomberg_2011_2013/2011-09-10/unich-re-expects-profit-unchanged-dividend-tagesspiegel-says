Munich Re  expects to post a profit
this year and keep dividend payments to shareholders unchanged,
 Tagesspiegel  reported, citing management board member Torsten Jeworrek.  The German reinsurer should be able to pay shareholders a
dividend of 6.25 euros ($8.55), the same as in 2010, unless
“something very bad” occurs, Jeworrek told the newspaper in an
interview that will be published tomorrow. Still, Munich Re is
bracing for a “high number” of hurricanes this year, he said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
