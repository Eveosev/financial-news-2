The  Islamic Development Bank 
said it will sign a memorandum of understanding with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to boost
cooperation.  The agreement to be signed today in Marseille,  France ,
focuses on economic development and syndicated finance in
Arab countries that need money to fund reconstruction
projects following the recent political unrest, the Jeddah-
based IDB said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  IDB President Ahmed Ali Mohammed will participate in
other meetings with finance ministers and heads of
financial institutions to follow up on decisions made at
the Group of Eight summit in May, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
