Chilean Economy Minister Pablo Longueira supports a permanent increase in corporate tax rates
to boost government revenue without hurting economic growth,  El
Mercurio  reported.  The minister, whose opinions don’t necessarily reflect
those of President Sebastian Pinera or other ministers, told the
Santiago-based newspaper in an interview that he would raise the
tax rate to 20 percent from 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
