Japan’s Finance Minister Jun Azumi
asked U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  to understand
the risks posed by the yen’s strength when they met this morning
in Marseille, France.  Azumi said he is concerned the currency’s appreciation
might hamper the recovery from the earthquake, tsunami and
radiation disaster that struck the nation this year, a senior
Japanese finance ministry official said on condition of
anonymity because of the ministry’s policy.  The official declined to say how Geithner responded, in
line with rules for the bilateral meeting, which took place
after Group of Seven finance chiefs and central bankers met
yesterday.  The yen touched the strongest level in 10 years against the
euro on Sept. 9 as concern about Greece’s fiscal health
intensified. Countries including  Japan  and Switzerland have had
to contend with gains in their currencies as a slowing U.S.
economy and deepening sovereign-debt woes in  Europe  boost
investor demand for save-haven assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
