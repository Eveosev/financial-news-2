A Berlin court issued arrest
warrants for two suspected bomb plotters who were taken into
custody Sept. 8 after the men allegedly ordered materials that
could be used to cause an explosion, a police spokesman said.  Arrest warrants were issued late yesterday for a 24-year-
old German of Lebanese descent and a 28-year-old Palestinian on
grounds the two suspects were “planning a serious act of
violence against the state,” Klaus Schubert, a spokesman for
 Berlin Police , said today by telephone.  “The warrants were issued because of risks of an escape
attempt,” Schubert said, declining to be more specific.  One suspect is alleged to have acquired a large amount of
cooling pads which contain gel that can be turned into a highly
explosive material when mixed with an acid,  Der Tagesspiegel 
newspaper reported Sept. 8. Two companies that supply the pads
independently contacted police, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
