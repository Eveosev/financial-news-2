German bund yields fell to record
lows, while Dutch and Finnish bonds jumped amid concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis is deepening as growth slows, underpinning demand
for safer securities.  Greek  government bonds  slumped, pushing two-year yields
above 56 percent, and the cost of insuring the nation’s debt
rose to all-time highs as bondholders weighed whether to
participate in a debt exchange that’s crucial to a second
bailout package. Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds declined for
a third week as the countries prepared for bond sales. The
 European Central Bank  left its main refinancing rate on hold at
1.5 percent and cut its growth forecasts.  “Bunds are bid because of the same concerns that we’ve
been seeing for a while, the political leaders in Europe have
dropped the ball,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist
at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “Financial markets don’t
like being constantly unsettled, there’s a lack of confidence.
There are a lot of large debt auctions next week and those will
be the focus.”  German 10-year bund yields fell 24 basis points this week
to a record low 1.77 percent at 4:49 p.m. in London yesterday.
The 2.25 percent security, due September 2021 rose 2.22, or
22.20 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,372) face amount, to 104.39. Two-
year note yields fell 14 basis points to 0.39 percent, after
reaching a euro-era low of 0.377 percent.  Dutch Bonds  Dutch 10-year yields also fell to a euro-era record low, of
2.226 percent yesterday, and yields on similar-maturity Finnish
debt declined to 2.266 percent, the least since the euro began
in 1999.  Ten-year German, Finnish and Dutch rates have dropped in
eight of the past 10 weeks as concern that the sovereign debt
crisis is intensifying fueled demand for the perceived safety of
top-rated government debt.  Italy  plans to sell 18.5 billion euros of debt on Sept. 12
and 13, while  Spain  will auction securities maturing in 2019 and
2020 on Sept. 15. The ECB began purchasing Spanish and Italian
bonds on Aug. 8 to curb a surge in yields as contagion from the
debt crisis that engulfed  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  spread to
the region’s third- and fourth-largest economies.  Italian 10-year bonds fell for a third week, pushing the
yield on the securities up 10 basis points to 5.39 percent.
Spain’s 10-year bond yield advanced four basis points to 5.16
percent.  Debt Insurance  Greek two-year notes slumped for a seventh week, the
longest streak of declines since before the euro began in 1999.  The cost of insuring Greek government debt soared to a
record 3,238 basis points yesterday, according to CMA prices for
credit-default swaps. The five-year contracts show investors
reckon there’s a 91 percent chance the nation will be unable to
meet its debt commitments.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Greece
won’t get its next bailout installment unless it meets goals
under the aid package. At a closed-door meeting in the week, he
told lawmakers that the Greek government’s budget reforms are
failing, placing the country’s financial situation “on a
knife’s edge,” according to a report in parliament’s HIB
bulletin.  German government bonds have handed investors a gain of 7.4
percent this year through yesterday and Dutch bonds have
returned 6.8 percent, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg. Greece’s have declined 30 percent, Italy’s have
dropped 1.1 percent and Spain’s have increased 5.4 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
