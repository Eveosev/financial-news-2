Lakshmi Mittal almost sold his
stake in soccer team Queens Park Rangers this summer after
disagreements about how the English club should be run, the
 Financial Times  reported, citing an interview with Mittalâ€™s son-
in-law Amit Bhatia.  He considered selling his 33 percent interest after the
disputes with then co-owners  Bernie Ecclestone  and Flavio Briatore, Bhatia was quoted as saying by the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
