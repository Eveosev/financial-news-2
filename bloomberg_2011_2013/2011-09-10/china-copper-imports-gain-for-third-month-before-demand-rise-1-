Copper imports by  China , the
biggest user, climbed for a third month in August as buying of
the metal in London and selling in Shanghai increased ahead of
an expected rise of demand.  Inbound shipments of the refined metal, copper alloy and
products increased 11 percent to 340,398 metric tons from
306,626 tons in July, the General Administration of Customs said
on its  website  today. August imports were the highest since
January, and 10 percent less than the 379,527 tons of a year
earlier.  Demand for the metal used in cables and wires usually
increase in the September-to-November period after China’s
summer, when tight electricity supplies limit use by fabricators
and end-consumers. A further gain in shipments to China would
support copper prices in  London , where the metal has fallen 8
percent this year.  “The rising arrivals in recent months is a confirmation
that China needs to return to the market after domestic
stockpiles depleted in the first half, but the pace of imports
may be hampered by an overall slowdown in economic activities,”
said Jia Zheng, a trader at Shanghai East Asia Futures Co.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed to a 10-month high of 177,365 tons in March
before falling more than 50 percent to 80,792 tons in June.
Inventory totaled 113,300 tons as of yesterday.  Imports of copper and products fell 21 percent in January-
August to 2.35 million tons, according to the customs office.  Tightening Cycle  China’s industrial production in August grew 13.5 percent
from a year earlier, the smallest gain in three months,
according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. This
compares with the 13.7 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 28 economists and a 14 percent increase in the
previous month.  The People’s Bank of China increased  interest rates  five
times and the reserve requirement ratio nine times since the
second half of last year to fight inflation. The central bank
also decided last month to broaden the base of reserves it
requires commercial lenders to deposit at the central bank.  Consumer prices rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier in
August, retreating from a three-year high of 6.5 percent in July,
data from the statistics bureau showed. Fighting inflation will
remain the top priority in the second half of this year and
monetary policy will remain “prudent,” the central bank said
in its quarterly monetary policy report on Aug. 12.  ‘Clouds to Consumption’  “All these tightening measures should have a lagging
impact on metals demand, so this adds some clouds to the
consumption side this coming fall,” said Wang Zhouyi, an
analyst at  Shanghai  CIFCO Futures Co.
Copper inventories in China’s bonded warehouses, where storage
is exempt from tariffs and value-added tax, were probably at
380,000 tons, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report dated Sept.
5. The stockpiles combined with about 100,000 tons of
inventories in the exchange-monitored warehouses will probably
allow China to “wait before buying on the international
market,” analyst Bonnie Liu said.  Scrap copper imports totaled 380,000 tons in August,
falling 12 percent from 430,000 tons a month earlier. Total
scrap arrivals increased 7.3 percent in January-August to 3.01
million tons, customs data showed.  Imports of unwrought aluminum and products totaled 70,983
tons last month, while exports of unwrought aluminum were at
62,227 tons, according to the customs.  -- Helen Sun . Editors:  Jim McDonald   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
