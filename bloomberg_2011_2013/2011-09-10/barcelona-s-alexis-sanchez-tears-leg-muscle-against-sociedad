Barcelona striker  Alexis Sanchez 
tore a muscle in his right leg during today’s 2-2 tie at Real
Sociedad.  Sanchez, who joined Barcelona from Udinese in July for 37.5
million euros ($51 million), was stretchered off the field in
the first half of the game in San Sebastian.  The Chile internaitonal is expected to miss six to eight
weeks, though he’ll undergo further tests tomorrow to determine
the full extent of the injury, Barcelona said on its website.  Barcelona took a 2-0 lead on goals from  Xavi Hernandez  and
Cesc Fabregas in the opening 11 minutes. Imanol Agirretxe and
Antoine Griezmann then scored two minutes apart in the second
half to earn Sociedad the draw.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
