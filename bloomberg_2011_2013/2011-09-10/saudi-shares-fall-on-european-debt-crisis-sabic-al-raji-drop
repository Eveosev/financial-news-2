Saudi Arabian shares led by banks
climbed for a second day, reversing earlier losses.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest publicly traded lender
by market value, advanced the most in two weeks.  National
Industrialization Co. (NIC) , the petrochemicals company known as
Tasnee, and  Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co. (YANSAB) , gained more than
1 percent.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  strengthened 0.2 percent to
6,138.06, the highest level since Sept. 4, at the 3:30 p.m.
close in  Riyadh , extending its monthly gains to 2.7 percent. The
148-company gauge dropped as much as 1.2 percent at 11:55 a.m.  “Banks and mid-cap names helped squeeze out a modest
increase,” said Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst at Riyad
Capital. “Lately banks have been oversold and investors may be
tempted by attractive entry points ahead of the earnings
season.”  Al Rajhi  added 1.4 percent, the largest gain since Aug. 24,
to 70.75 riyals. Tasnee rose 1.3 percent to 38.50 riyals while
Yansab rallied 1.5 percent to 46.60 riyals, its highest price
since Aug. 13.  “Crude pulled back on a strengthening dollar which bodes
well in terms of import costs for Saudi companies, if the trend
continues,” said Bukhtiar, the Riyad Capital analyst.  Oil dropped the most in a week in  New York  as the euro
tumbled against the dollar. Crude for October delivery dropped 2
percent to $87.24 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
yesterday.  Saudi Arabia  holds one-fifth of the world’s proven
oil reserves.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  each lost 2.7 percent yesterday and the Stoxx Europe 600
Index fell 2.6 percent.  National Shipping Co. added 0.4 percent to 11.85 riyals
after the Saudi operator of crude oil and chemical tankers said
its National Chemical Carriers Ltd. Co. unit has received a new
chemical tanker. The financial impact is expected to be felt
starting in the third quarter.  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , the company controlled by Saudi
billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, rallied 0.7 percent to
7.45 riyals, after it said the group planning to buy Zain
Kuwait’s stake in Zain Saudi Arabia expects to complete due
diligence by the end of this month. The group intends to
complete the proposed acquisition, Kingdom said.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
