China , the world’s biggest buyer of
 iron ore , boosted purchases 8.3 percent in August to the highest
in five months as demand and prices rose.  Imports totaled 59.09 million metric tons last month, up
from 54.55 million tons in July and the most since March,
according to China’s General Administration of Customs. Imports
jumped 32 percent from 44.61 million tons a year earlier.  China’s steel production may rise from August as power
restrictions ease, boosting demand for raw materials including
iron ore, according to researcher Custeel.com. The average price
of iron ore rose 2.5 percent in August to $177.45 a ton,
according to the Steel Index.  “Demand was very strong in August,” Hu Kai, a Shanghai-
based analyst with Umetal.com, a research affiliate of
Custeel.com, said before the announcement. “Iron ore prices may
stay high this month. Still, the import volume won’t increase a
lot because of tight supplies from  India .”  India, the third-biggest iron-ore exporter after Australia
and  Brazil , usually experiences heavy rain from June to
September, disrupting infrastructure and deliveries to ports.  Iron ore inventories held at Chinese ports increased 27
percent this year to 98.6 million tons as of Sept. 2, according
to data from Shanghai Steelhome Information. That’s enough for
34 days of steel production in the nation, a record high, Hu
said.  Imports jumped 11 percent from a year earlier to 447.57
million tons in the first eight months, the General Customs
office said today.  Steel-product exports dropped 5.6 percent to 4.19 million
tons last month, from 4.44 million tons in July, according to
the data. Shipments rose 6.5 percent from a year earlier to
32.94 million tons in the first eight months, customs said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
