Brazil  will miss its target to
create 3 million formal jobs this year because of global
financial turmoil, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing Labor
Minister Carlos Lupi at an event in Rio de Janeiro yesterday.  The country generated an estimated 200,000 jobs in August,
which was higher than the number for July and less than that of
August 2010, the newspaper said. The ministry is likely to
revise the target for 2011  job creation  after it finalizes the
August figures next week, the newspaper said, citing Lupi.   The nation is likely to generate more jobs in September and
October than in August, O Estado said, citing Lupi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
