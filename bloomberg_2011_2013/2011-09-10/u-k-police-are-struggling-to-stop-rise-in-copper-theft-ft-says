The U.K. police force is struggling
to stop an increase in copper thefts as the price of the metal
rises, the Financial Times reported today, citing Paul Crowther,
deputy chief constable of the British Transport Police.  Scrapyards that buy used copper to be barred from paying
cash because that would make the metal harder for the thieves to
sell, Crowther said.  The copper-recycling industry has yearly sales of about 5
billion pounds ($7.9 billion), of which 1 billion pounds is
bought and sold in cash, the newspaper said.  Gangs are targeting railway sidings, electricity
substations and scrapyards, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
