German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
Bavarian allies want euro-area countries that fail to comply
with membership criteria to exit the single-currency union,
German  ARD  television reported, citing a document.  “Euro-member states that get the monetary union into
difficulties must be prepared to be forced to leave the monetary
union,” ARD quoted from a draft motion of the Christian Social
Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel’s  Christian
Democratic Union , drawn up for the party leadership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
