Yemeni government troops have
recaptured Zanjibar from militants who took control of the
southern city in May, the state-run Saba news agency said.  President Ali Abdullah Saleh earlier congratulated the army
on its victory against “suspected al-Qaeda-linked” fighters in
the southern province of Abyan, Saba reported. Saleh has faced a
six-month popular uprising as well as militant activity across
the Arab world’s poorest country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
