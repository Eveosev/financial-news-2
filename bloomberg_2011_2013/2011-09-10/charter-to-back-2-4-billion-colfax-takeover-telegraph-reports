Charter International Plc. (CHTR)  is close
to recommending a 1.5 billion-pound ($2.4 billion) takeover bid
from  Colfax Corp. (CFX) ,  The Daily Telegraph  reported, citing people
it didn’t name.  The companies may announce next week that the board of
Dublin-based Charter, a welding company and maker of air- and
gas-handling equipment, has recommended an offer from the
Fulton, Maryland-based manufacturer of pumps and specialty
valves that values the business at 900 pence a share, the
newspaper said.  Jonathan Glass, partner at Brunswick Group’s London office,
which represents Charter, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
