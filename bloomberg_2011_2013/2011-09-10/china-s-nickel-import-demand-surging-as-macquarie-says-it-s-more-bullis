Nickel import demand in  China  is
“surging” because of a shortage of nickel pig iron, Macquarie
Group Ltd. said, citing unidentified sources.  Nickel pig iron, usually a cheaper alternative to refined
nickel, is now more expensive, Macquarie said in a report dated
Sept. 12. A trading company in China may be building nickel
stockpiles to start a nickel exchange-traded fund, Macquarie
said, citing reports without identifying the authors. “These
factors make us more bullish about the nickel price outlook in
the short run, even though we maintain a forecast of a large
2012 surplus,” Macquarie said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
