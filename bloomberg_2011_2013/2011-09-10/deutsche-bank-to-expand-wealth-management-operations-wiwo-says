Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  may hire staff in
its home market to expand business with wealthy investors,
 Wirtschaftswoche  reported, citing Pierre de Weck, head of the
lender’s wealth management operations.  Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank may increase the number of
its advisers and add locations to focus on investors with funds
in the single-digit million-euro range, the magazine quoted de
Weck as saying in an article to be published in next week’s
edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
