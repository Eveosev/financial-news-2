Arab League  Secretary-General Nabil el-Arabi said yesterday that he and Syrian President Bashar al- Assad have agreed on a series of measures to apply political
reforms in  Syria , Al Arabiya television reported.  The measures will be presented to an Arab foreign ministers
meeting in Cairo, el-Arabi said during a brief news conference
at Cairo airport after returning from a meeting in Damascus. He
