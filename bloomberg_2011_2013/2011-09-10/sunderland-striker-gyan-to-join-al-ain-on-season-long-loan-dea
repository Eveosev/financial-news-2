Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan
will joined Al-Ain in the  United Arab Emirates  on a season-long
loan, the Premier League club said on its website.  Gyan, 25, scored 11 goals in 37 appearances last season
after joining Sunderland from Renne for a club record 13 million
pounds ($21 million). Al-Ain wanted to sign the Ghana
international on a permanent deal, but the Black Cats only
agreed to the loan move.  “Anyone who has seen Asamoah play will now that he hasn’t
been himself in recent months,” Sunderland manager  Steve Bruce 
said. “This option suits him at the present and the club is
well-protected in the deal.”  Gyan moved to Sunderland after scoring a team-high three
goals at the 2010  World Cup  as  Ghana  reached the quarterfinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
