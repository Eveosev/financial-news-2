Former U.K. Prime Minister and
international peace envoy  Tony Blair  denies that military
intervention in the  Middle East  has radicalized Muslims and
encouraged terrorism, the BBC reported, citing interviews.  “The reason why these people are radicalized is not
because of something we’re doing to them,” the BBC said Blair
told Radio 4’s Today program. “Understand one thing -- they
believe in what they believe in because they believe their
religion compels them to believe in it.”  Killing al-Qaeda leader  Osama Bin Laden  was “immensely
important,” the BBC cited Blair as saying in a separate
interview with Reuters. “It dealt a huge psychological blow to
their movement, but it doesn’t alter the fact there are still
large numbers of people out there who buy the narrative of this
terrorist movement.”  The war on terror won’t end until the ideology is defeated
“by a better idea,” he said. “And we have it, which is a way
of life based on openness, democracy, freedom and rule of law.”  He said Sept. 11, 2001, “was not just a terrorist attack
of extraordinary magnitude, but one that had to change global
policy.”  Blair defended his government’s decision to restore
relations with  Libya  in 2004 and said military force should be
considered to stop  Iran’s nuclear program . He said he once
almost ordered an unresponsive passenger jet to be shot down
over U.K. airspace.  To contact the reporter on this story:
