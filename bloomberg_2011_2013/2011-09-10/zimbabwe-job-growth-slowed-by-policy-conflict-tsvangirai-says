Zimbabwe’s economic recovery is
being slowed by policy conflict in the unity government with
President Robert Mugabe, said Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai .  Policy differences are jeopardizing efforts to create new
jobs, Tsvangirai told supporters of his Movement for Democratic
Change while celebrating the party’s 12th anniversary in the
capital, Harare.  “Mugabe comes out and tells investors ‘your investment is
safe’” and then Indiginization Minister Saviour Kaskuwere says,
“‘I want to close this and that mine,’” Tsvangirai said.
“This kind of policy conflict cannot inspire confidence.”  Tsvangirai and Mugabe entered into a power-sharing deal in
February 2009. The MDC is pushing for a new constitution,
guarantees on press freedom and for foreign election monitors to
be deployed for six months before any vote.  Zimbabwe’s next elections must have the support of the
 Southern African Development Community  and the  United Nations ,
Tsvangirai said, adding that the polls must be conducted in a
free and fair environment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
