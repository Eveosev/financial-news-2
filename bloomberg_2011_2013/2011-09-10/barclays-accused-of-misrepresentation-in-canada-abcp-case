Barclays Plc (BARC)  said it was accused by
an Ontario judge of fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of
faith in dealings with a Canadian issuer of asset-backed
commercial paper.  The  Financial Times  reported today that Justice Frank Newbould of the Ontario Superior Court accused the bank of
failing to disclose information to Devonshire Trust during the
2007 collapse of  Canada ’s asset-backed commercial paper market.
The court upheld a Devonshire claim to C$600 million ($602
million) in collateral in the trust and C$100 million in cash,
the newspaper said.  “We are disappointed in and disagree with the court’s
decision and are evaluating our grounds for an appeal,”
Barclays spokesman Michael O’Looney said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
