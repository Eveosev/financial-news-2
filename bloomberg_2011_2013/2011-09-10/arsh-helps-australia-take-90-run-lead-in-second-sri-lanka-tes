Centuries from  Michael Hussey  and
Shaun Marsh helped Australia to a 237-run lead over Sri Lanka on
day three of the second cricket Test in Kandy.  Hussey scored 142 runs and Marsh made 141 in his Test debut
as the visitors reached 411-7 in reply to Sri Lanka’s first
innings 174 before rain stopped today’s play after just 40.3
overs.  The two teamed for a 258-run stand for the fourth wicket
before Hussey was caught by  Kumar Sangakkara  from Thilan
Samaraweera. Suraj Randiv claimed three wickets for Sri Lanka.  Australia won the opener of the three-match series by 125
runs. It can move above Sri Lanka to fourth in the International
Cricket Council Test rankings by winning the series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
