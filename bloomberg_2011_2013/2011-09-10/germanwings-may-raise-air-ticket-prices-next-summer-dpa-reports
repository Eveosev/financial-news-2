Germanwings GmbH may increase
prices next summer as the airline faces rising kerosene costs
and an aviation tax,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Winkelmann.  The low-cost unit of  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  will publish its
new flight schedule for the summer of 2012 next week and offer
“slightly higher” fares than a year earlier, the newswire
quoted Winkelmann as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
