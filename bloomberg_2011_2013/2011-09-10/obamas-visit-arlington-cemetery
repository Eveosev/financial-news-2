President  Barack Obama  and the
first lady visited Arlington National Cemetery today to honor
military personnel killed in Afghanistan and  Iraq  in the decade
following the Sept. 11 attacks.  The Obamas met with two families in Arlington’s Section 60,
which is reserved for military casualties since the attacks. The
families weren’t notified of the visit and White House officials
had no further information.  Obama also met with his senior national security team this
morning to “review ongoing efforts to mitigate potential
terrorist threats” ahead of the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11
tomorrow, according to a statement e-mailed to reporters from
the White House press office.  John Brennan , assistant to the president for homeland
security and counterterrorism; Robert Mueller, director of the
 Federal Bureau of Investigation ; Attorney General Eric Holder;
and General David Petraeus, the director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, were among those attending.  Obama and his family later went to work at the DC Central
Kitchen to commemorate the September 11th National Day of Service
and Remembrance. The kitchen, which trains the unemployed,
provides meals for the hungry including homeless and elderly
people in the Washington area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
