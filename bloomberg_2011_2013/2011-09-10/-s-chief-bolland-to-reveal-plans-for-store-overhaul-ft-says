Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  Chief
Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  will reveal plans to overhaul the
retailer’s stores on Sept. 12, the Financial Times said, citing
people familiar with the matter that it didn’t identify.  Distinguishing the brands Per Una, Limited Collection and
Autograph more clearly will be among his plans, the newspaper
said. He will also introduce fresh delicatessen counters into
the retailer’s food departments, the Financial Times said.  Bolland said in May he intended to spend hundreds of
millions of pounds improving Marks & Spencer stores, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
