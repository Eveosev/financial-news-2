Switzerland ’s external trade is
under “enormous pressure” and that will be reflected in a
“massive” increase in reduced working hours, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, citing Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann.  While the domestic market is still “healthy,” the country
will “feel the crisis in any case,” Schneider-Ammann said in
an interview published in today’s  newspaper . Some jobs will
probably be moved abroad, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
