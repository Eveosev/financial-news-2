Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NLY) 
offered to buy the shares of  Crexus Investment Corp. (CXS)  it doesn’t
already own for about $839 million, representing a 13 percent
premium over the mortgage-finance firm’s last closing price.  Annaly, a New York-based real estate investment trust, owns
about 12.4 percent of Crexus, it said in a statement. The
$12.50-a-share deal would allow Annaly, which invests primarily
in government-backed mortgage securities, to expand its
commercial-property loan business.  “Given the current market, we believe it is prudent to
diversify a portion of our investment portfolio,” Annaly Chief
Executive Officer Wellington Denahan said in a separate
statement. “A powerful step in that direction is the proposed
acquisition of Crexus.”  An Annaly subsidiary, Fixed Income Discount Advisory Co.,
manages the investment in Crexus, and two FIDAC employees are on
Crexus’s board of directors, Annaly said. Crexus probably will
create a special committee of independent directors to consider
the proposal and negotiate terms, Annaly said.  The deal “could be beneficial to all constituents,”
Denahan said in a Nov. 9 letter to the Crexus board that was
distributed today.  Annaly has hired  Bank of America Corp. ’s Merrill Lynch unit
as a financial adviser, and K&L Gates LLP as legal counsel to
assist with the acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
