Bilfinger SE offices were raided
last month by prosecutors from  Germany  and other countries
probing possible corruption in Eastern Europe.  Prosecutors from Landshut, Germany, are investigating four
people over bribery allegations linked to projects in
 Hungary  and Slovakia. Three of the suspects are Germans who
worked on the projects at a Bilfinger unit in Passau, Germany,
said Markus Kring, head of the business crime unit of Landshut
prosecutors.  “The case has been pending since 2010 and we’re
cooperating with prosecutors from Austria, Slovakia and Hungary,
who in part are conducting their own cases,” Kring said in an
interview. “We are looking at potential bribery payments” of 5
million euros ($6.36 million) to 6 million euros.  The company is cooperating with the authorities, Sascha Bamberger, a spokesman for Germany’s second-largest construction
company by revenue, said in an e-mailed statement today. He
declined to provide more details.  Bilfinger said last year the U.S. Department of Justice is
probing it over alleged bribery payments in Nigeria. Frankfurt
prosecutors are also conducting a probe over the Nigeria
allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
