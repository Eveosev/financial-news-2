Olympic downhill champion  Lindsey Vonn  has been admitted to hospital in Vail, Colorado with an
“undisclosed illness,” the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association
said on its website.  The 28-year-old American is in Colorado to prepare for an
alpine World Cup race on Nov. 24-25 in Aspen.  Vonn,a four-time World Cup overall champion, skipped last
weekend’s slalom races in Levi, Finland to prepare for the U.S.
swing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
