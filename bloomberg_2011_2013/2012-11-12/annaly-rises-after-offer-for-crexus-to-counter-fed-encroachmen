Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NLY) , the
largest real-estate investment trust that buys mortgage debt,
fell in New York trading after saying it plans to buy the shares
of Crexus Investment Corp. it doesn’t own for $838.8 million.  The REIT  dropped  0.7 percent to $14.87 as of 4:15 p.m.,
while Crexus, which is managed by a unit of Annaly,  advanced  12
percent to $12.43. Annaly offered $12.50 for each of the 67.1
million shares, or 12.4 percent, of the company it doesn’t
already hold.  Chimera Investment Corp. (CIM) , another REIT managed by
Annaly, gained 8.6 percent. The firms are all based in New York.  Annaly announced its bid to buy Crexus, a commercial-
mortgage investor, as part of a broadening of its strategy after
Federal Reserve purchases of government-backed residential debt
reduced yields in a market it has focused on since its 1997
initial public offering. It now may allocate as much as 25
percent of shareholder equity to other investments, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Wellington Denahan said in a statement.  “A powerful step in this direction is the proposed
acquisition of  CreXus (CXS) ,” Denahan, who this month assumed sole
control of the top role at the company after the death of
founding chief Michael A.J. Farrell, said in the statement.  Annaly  tumbled  13 percent through last week, assuming
reinvested dividends, after the Fed announced on Sept. 13 it
would expand its buying of agency mortgage bonds by $40 billion
a month to bolster the economy. The REIT had  $141.6 billion  of
assets on Sept. 30.  Crexus, which Annaly started in 2009, had $968.4 million of
assets as of the end of September. Chimera, a New York-based
investor in so-called non-agency housing debt started by Annaly
in 2007, rose today to $2.77 a share. It had $9.7 billion of
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
