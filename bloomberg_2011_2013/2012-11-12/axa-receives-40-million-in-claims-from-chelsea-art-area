Axa SA (CS) , the French insurer that
underwrites more than $1 billion of art in  Manhattan ’s Chelsea
district, said it has received $40 million in claims from
 Hurricane Sandy  and has already sent checks to policyholders.  “The magnitude of the situation is completely manageable
for Axa Art,” Christiane Fischer, the president and chief
executive officer for the Americas ov Axa unit  Axa Art , said
today in an e-mailed statement. “Fortunately, our clients took
a lot of preventative action before the storm hit the region.”  Sandy caused as much as $50 billion in economic damage,
according to Eqecat Inc., a provider of catastrophic risk
models. The U.S. death toll stands at more than 100. The storm
flooded dozens of art galleries.  Fischer said the company was able to start the recovery
actions “the morning after the storm.” Axa Art started sending
out checks as advances last week and settled its first claim
today.  Staff members went to view damage in Chelsea, where the
company insures 66 galleries, and in downtown Manhattan. If an
artwork could be restored to original condition, there would be
no loss in value, Fischer said.  “If the cost of conserving the work is higher than the
market value of the work, we’ll consider it a total loss,” she
said during a conference call on Nov. 3.  While Axa Art won’t cancel existing policies, it will
reconsider the risk of each client’s location at the time of the
policy renewal, Fischer said.  Muse highlights include  Greg Evans  on  television , David
