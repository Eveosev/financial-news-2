France’s farm and food exports, the
world’s fifth-biggest by value, fell for the first time in four
months in September as shipments of grain declined.  Exports fell 4.3 percent to 4.69 billion euros ($6 billion)
from 4.9 billion euros a year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry 
wrote in an online  report  today. Grain shipments dropped on
lower volumes of soft wheat and corn, it said.  France is the European Union’s biggest grain exporter. The
country had a current-account surplus of 11.6 billion euros in
farm products and food trade last year, the highest since at
least 1995, according to the ministry’s data.  “Exports to the EU are down for all products, while toward
third countries, the sales of beverages maintained their
growth,” the ministry wrote. “Exports of soft wheat dropped by
99 million euros and those of corn by 14 million euros.”  Farm products and food contributed to a current-account
surplus of 1.01 billion euros in September, dropping from 1.08
billion euros in the year-earlier month.  France ’s grain exports excluding rice fell to 515 million
euros from 576 million euros, the data showed. Soft-wheat
cargoes to Algeria, Libya and Yemen dropped, the ministry said.
Oilseed and protein-crop sales fell to 96 million euros from 123
million euros.  Wine and champagne shipments rose to 676 million euros from
668 million euros. Total beverage exports gained to 1.23 billion
euros from 1.17 million, the report showed.  France imported 3.68 billion euros of agricultural goods
and food in September from 3.82 billion euros a year earlier,
the ministry said.  Food and farm exports increased to 42.2 billion euros in
the first nine months of 2012 from 41.6 billion euros a year
earlier, while the current-account surplus widened to 8.02
billion euros from 7.95 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
