UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest
lender, obtained a license to operate as a bank in Brazil after
seeking authorization for more than two years, a person with
direct knowledge of the decision said.  Brazil President  Dilma Rousseff ’s approval could be
published in the nation’s official newspaper, Diario Oficial, as
soon as this week, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the decision isn’t public yet.  The decision allows Zurich-based UBS to conduct proprietary
trading in Brazil as well as make real-denominated loans, raise
money in Brazilian markets, and underwrite stocks and local
bonds. UBS decided to establish a Brazilian unit after selling
its Banco Pactual SA unit in 2009 for $2.5 billion to
billionaire  Andre Esteves  and his partners, who created Banco
BTG Pactual SA.  A bank license allows UBS to “offer broader products and
services to its international and local clients,” including
real-related loans and bonds issued in local markets, Ricardo
Almeida, a finance professor at Insper business school in Sao
Paulo, said yesterday in a phone interview. “The bank can say
to investors and shareholders that it has a presence in Brazil,
the biggest market in  Latin America .”  In addition to the banking license, UBS also won approval
from the central bank to buy Brazil brokerage Link
Investimentos, an acquisition that’s been awaiting approval
since the deal was reached in April 2010, the person said.  UBS declined to comment, said an official who asked not to
be named in accordance with company policy. The government also
declined to comment, according to a press official at Rousseff’s
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
