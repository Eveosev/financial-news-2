The European Union and Mexico should
look for ways to go “much further” to remove barriers to
services commerce, EU Trade Commissioner Karel  De Gucht  said.  Agriculture trade also could improve if the EU and Mexico
are able to update existing agreements, De Gucht said in a
speech to a business summit in Queretaro, Mexico. He also
affirmed the EU’s intent to ink other North American deals.  “I expect to conclude a comprehensive agreement with
Canada very soon,” De Gucht said. “Even more crucially, it is
possible that we will start talks for a deep free trade
agreement with the United States, if our leaders agree on this
in the New Year.”  While De Gucht was in Mexico, EU companies called for
increased effort to hammer out better trade terms with Japan.
BusinessEurope, a federation of employers, today sent to De
Gucht and EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  a list of non-tariff
barriers that they said hamper their operations.  Japan has “numerous restrictions and regulatory
privileges” that make it hard for companies from other nations
to gain  market access , the employers group said. Legal
investment barriers, such as limits on mergers and acquisitions,
and “opaque” government contract rules also hurt EU companies,
the trade group said.  The EU supports the wish list from the employers group, as
talks begin toward an EU-Japan free trade agreement,  John
Clancy , a spokesman for De Gucht, said by an e-mail. “This is
in line as we always aim for deep and ambitious FTAs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
