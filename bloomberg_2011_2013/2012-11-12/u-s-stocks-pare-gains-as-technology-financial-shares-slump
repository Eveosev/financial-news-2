U.S. stocks trimmed gains as
technology and financial shares weighed down the market after an
earlier rally boosted by takeover activity.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index increased less than 0.1
percent to 1,380.34 at 10:25 a.m. New York time, after gaining
as much as 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost
1.15 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,814.24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
