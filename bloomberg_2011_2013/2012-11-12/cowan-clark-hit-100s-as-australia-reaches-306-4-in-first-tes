Ed Cowan  and Michael Clarke hit
centuries as Australia reached 306-4 in reply to South Africa’s
first-innings 450 in their opening cricket Test in Brisbane.  The pair, who came together with the home team struggling
at 40-3 yesterday, just fell short of batting through the first
two sessions on day four at the Gabba, where the entire second
day’s play was rained out. Clarke was 126 not out at the tea
interval with Mike Hussey on 1.  Cowan, whose highest score in 12 previous Test innings was
74, made 136 before he was run out shortly before the interval
when bowler Dale Steyn finger-tipped a drive from Clarke onto
the stumps with the opener out of his crease. Steyn earlier
failed to take a catch off a Cowan top edge in the outfield when
he was distracted by the nearby Jacques Rudolph.  Cowan shared a 259-run stand with Clarke, who brought up
his 20th Test century with a scrambled single in the over before
the afternoon drinks break.  South Africa would retain the No. 1 spot in the
International Cricket Council’s Test rankings by avoiding defeat
in the best-of-three contest.  Australia , which is unbeaten at
the Gabba in Test matches since 1988, can overtake the Proteas
atop the rankings with a series victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
