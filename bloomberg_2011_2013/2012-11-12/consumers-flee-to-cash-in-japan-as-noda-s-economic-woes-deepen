Japanese consumers are closing their wallets as the economy’s outlook darkens, making it harder for Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  to stave off the nation’s third recession in four years.  Households are holding the most cash since 2005, shunning risk as they grow gloomier,  Bank of Japan  data shows. Sliding private consumption contributed to an annualized 3.5 percent decline in gross domestic product in the past quarter, a Cabinet Office report showed yesterday.  While Noda may have avoided a fiscal cliff as the opposition agreed to a deal on deficit-financing legislation, the consumer malaise highlights the challenge of reviving growth in the world’s third-largest economy. At the same time as he tries to rebuild relations with China to support exports, Noda may need to come up with more incentives for consumer purchases at home.  “The Japanese government has no choice but to implement additional measures to shore up the economy,” said  Junko Nishioka , chief economist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd and a former BOJ official. “The dispute with China, the decline of the stock market, and confusion over the political situation in Japan are hurting confidence.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  closed down 0.2 percent in Tokyo, its seventh day of decline and 15.5 percent below this year’s high in March.  Weak Sentiment  Sentiment on the economic outlook was the weakest last month since the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, a government survey showed, with the end of car subsidies and a looming  sales-tax  increase also making people more pessimistic.  Japan risks its third textbook-definition recession since 2008, meaning two straight quarters of contraction. The median forecast in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News is for an annualized 0.4 percent contraction in the September to December period. Japanese recessions are officially defined by a government-charged panel that considers data beyond GDP figures.  “We need a firm response considering the grim outlook for the Japanese economy,” Economy Minister  Seiji Maehara  told reporters today. He declined to comment on the size of any new fiscal stimulus measures.  Consumption in the third quarter dropped at an annual rate of 1.8 percent after a 0.4 percent fall in the previous three months, the first back-to-back decline since the global financial crisis, yesterday’s report from the Cabinet Office showed.  Conditions Worsening  The main index in the government’s Economy Watchers Survey, which looks at how people feel about the outlook for the next two to three months, fell to 41.7 in October, the lowest level since the aftermath of last year’s earthquake. A figure under 50 indicates that more people see conditions deteriorating than improving.  Respondents to the survey included a travel agent in the Tokai region of central Japan, who complained that territorial disputes with China and  South Korea  were deterring people from traveling abroad. A car salesman in Shikoku, southern Japan, said the end of government subsidies for fuel-efficient cars was hurting business, while a supermarket manager in the same region noted concerns among shoppers over a planned doubling of the sales tax.  In other economic releases today, Japan’s September  industrial production  fell the most since last year’s earthquake, a final reading showed. In a separate report released today, Philippine exports gained in September at the fastest pace in 21 months as demand from Asian economies including Japan and  Hong Kong  rose.  Global Economy  Spain, Italy and the U.K. will announce price data for October. France will probably announce that non-farm payrolls fell 0.2 percent in the third quarter, the second straight decline, according to a  Bloomberg news  survey.  Brazil retail sales probably rose 0.2 percent on month in September, matching the previous month’s gain, according to a survey of 39 economists.  The Japanese government announced on Oct. 26 a 750 billion- yen ($9 billion) stimulus package to shore up growth, the scope of which was limited by the political standoff that was blocking legislation to allow borrowing to pay for this year’s deficit. The measures compare with more than 20 trillion yen in spending to boost the economy and pay for rebuilding budgeted after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  Political Paralysis  “The government has few tools to boost the economy as its term will end soon, the  budget deficit  is so huge and political paralysis means it’s hard to agree on measures,” said  Hiroaki Muto , a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.  The opposition Liberal  Democratic Party  reached a deal with the ruling Democratic Party of Japan to end a stalemate over legislation to fund the rest of this year’s budget, LDP policy chief Akira Amari told reporters in Tokyo today.  Worsening sentiment may be filtering through to the investment market, with  BOJ data  for this year showing that holdings of securities such as stocks, bonds and  investment trusts  as a proportion of household assets  are at the lowest since 2005 .  “People have no incentive to take risks,” said  Masamichi Adachi , a senior economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. in Tokyo and a former central bank official. “They are just putting money into banks, and it’s very unlikely they will move to securities in the future.”  Job Losses  Companies are cutting jobs and trimming pay as profits fall.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the world’s largest micro- controller maker, plans to cut thousands of jobs, while  TDK Corp. (6762) , a manufacturer of electric components, will shed 1,000 domestic positions.  Sharp Corp. (6753) ,  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  and  Sony Corp. (6758)  posted record losses last year, and are cutting jobs and production lines in a bid to return to profitability.  Large businesses cut winter bonuses by 2.7 percent from last year to 781,396 yen, according to a report last week by the Keidanren, a business lobby.  Machinery orders , an indicator of  capital spending , fell the most in four months in September, and exports dropped 10.3 percent in the same month. Net exports, or shipments less imports, subtracted 0.7 percentage point from GDP on a quarterly basis, the biggest decline in three quarters.  Noda this year pushed legislation through parliament to double the sales tax to help fund welfare spending in the world’s oldest society, and has said he will not call a general election unless a framework for revamping the social security system is established.
