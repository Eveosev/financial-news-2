Faurecia (EO) ,  Europe ’s largest maker of
car interiors, plans to cut about 3,000 jobs in its home region,
or 7.5 percent of the workforce, by the end of next year as it
retrenches in lackluster European markets.  Faurecia intends to cut about 1,500 jobs next year, the
same number eliminated in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Frank Imbert said in an interview in London today. The restructuring
will lead to about 100 million euros ($127 million) in charges
this year and 90 million in 2013, the company said.  “Our objective is to stop the bleeding in Europe next
year,” Chief Executive Officer Yann Delabriere said today at a
meeting with investors. “We have lost significant  cash flow  in
Europe, and we have to adapt.”  The French manufacturer, 57 percent-owned by PSA Peugeot
Citroen, last month cut its 2012 profit outlook, forecasting a
decline in fourth-quarter European sales on a “significant”
slowdown in auto production. The Nanterre-based partsmaker is
seeking to expand outside Europe as the region’s car market
heads for a fifth straight annual decline, with carmakers
Peugeot,  Fiat SpA (F)  and  Renault SA (RNO)  leading the drop.  Faurecia  rose  as much as 2.4 percent to 11.75 euros and was
up 1.9 percent as of 2 p.m. in Paris. The stock has declined 20
percent this year, valuing the company at 1.29 billion euros.  Growth Strategy  Faurecia plans to grow by 6 percent to 7 percent per year
and reach sales of 22 billion euros by 2016, Delabriere said.
The company’s growth strategy will focus on boosting the share
of sales outside Europe to 55 percent in 2016 from 37 percent
last year.  The French manufacturer plans to lift its operating profit
margin to at least 5 percent of sales by 2016, two years later
than previously planned, as the sovereign-debt crisis saps
demand in its home region. Faurecia said the slowdown will
require additional restructuring with a “gradual” recovery not
expected to start until 2014.  Industrywide European auto sales will decline 10 percent
this year, the most since 1993, according to ACEA, the region’s
automotive-industry association.  General Motors Co. (GM)  said Oct. 31
it will eliminate 2,600 European jobs by the end of 2012. Ford
Motor Co. will shut two plants in  England  next year and one in
 Belgium  in 2014, cutting 6,200 jobs, while Peugeot is
eliminating 8,000 positions and closing a factory near Paris to
reduce costs.  “The very weak European environment impacted our operating
margin, which resulted in a delay” of the target, Delabriere
said at meeting with investors today in London. “We expect a
further drop of the European car market next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
