OAO Transneft,  Russia â€™s oil pipeline
operator, loaded the first tanker from a new pier in the port of
Kozmino at the end of the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean link as the
country seeks to boost exports to Asia.  The 100,000-metric-ton cargo of ESPO crude was loaded on
Nov. 10, the port said in a statement on its website today.  The new pier is part of the second phase of the pipeline,
which extends the link from Skovorodino near the border with
 China  to the Pacific coast and will double annual capacity at
Kozmino to 30 million tons (600,000 barrels a day). The new
section of the pipeline is undergoing tests.  ESPO crude exports are scheduled to reach a record 1.6
million tons this month and 1.8 million tons in December,
loading programs obtained by Bloomberg show.  The first pier at Kozmino opened in December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
