Woongjin Holdings Co. (016880)  advanced to a
four-week high in  Seoul  stock trading after it won court
approval for the sale of a controlling stake in water-purifier
maker Woongjin Coway Co. to a private equity firm.  Woongjin Holdings jumped by the daily limit of 15 percent
to 2,940 won in Seoul, its highest close since Oct. 12.  Woongjin
Energy Co. (103130)  also advanced 15 percent to 2,435 won as the
benchmark Kospi index fell 0.2 percent. Investors expect the
financial situation of companies in the Woongjin group to
improve after the sale, according to Chung Yoo Seok, an analyst
at  Kyobo Securities Co. (030610)  in Seoul.  Woongjin Holdings will sell its 31 percent stake to MBK
Partners Ltd. on Jan. 2 for 1.2 trillion won ($1.1 billion)
after winning court approval on Nov. 9, the Seoul-based company
said in a regulatory filing today. The sale was halted after
Woongjin Holdings and its unlisted construction unit filed for
bankruptcy protection in September.  “Woongjin companies could’ve struggled because they had a
lot of debt group-wide, but that may be resolved somewhat thanks
to the decision to sell Coway,” Chung said by phone today.
“The group stocks will all do pretty well from here.”  Woongjin agreed to sell its stake to MBK Partners in August
to reduce debt that swelled after the group took over Kukdong
Engineering & Construction Co. and expanded into the solar power
business. Woongjin’s creditors and MBK Partners agreed to
complete the sale by the end of January and submitted the plan
to the court on Nov. 8 for approval.  Woongjin Chemical Co. (008000)  advanced 3.1 percent to 629 won,
while Coway slid 0.4 percent to 37,950 won.  Coway shareholders will meet on Nov. 27 to approve the sale
plan, Coway said in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
