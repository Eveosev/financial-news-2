Turkey will spend about 10 billion
liras ($5.6 billion) over the next five years on the Southeast
Anatolia Project, a chain of hydro-electric dams and irrigation
systems in the mainly Kurdish southeast.  The plan would increase land under cultivation in the
region more than sixfold, Sadrettin Karahocagil told reporters
in the southeastern city of Sanliurfa on Nov. 10. The project,
widely known by its Turkish acronym GAP, will increase farm
areas to 2 million acres (809,000 hectares) when completed in
2017, Karahocagil’s office said today by telephone.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government will start
allocating money for the project from the budget in 2013, ending
the practice of transfers from the unemployment benefit fund.
Three decades of war with autonomy-seeking Kurdish militants in
the southeast has retarded economic development.  The project is also expected to create more than 3 million
jobs in the southeast, where the government is offering
incentives such as cheaper energy, free land and cuts in payroll
taxes paid by employers, Karahocagil said.  Pinar Sut Mamulleri
Sanayii AS (PNSUT)  is among companies planning to invest in Sanliurfa,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
