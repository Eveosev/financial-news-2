The  New York  Stock Exchange said it
has completed the recovery of a computer that matches orders and
processes trades.  The exchange said there were still eight of 60 customer-
connect gateways waiting to be connected back to the so-called
matching engine, according to an e-mail at 10 a.m. New York
time. All other CCGs were functioning properly, the exchange
said.  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  had said earlier that about 216 stock symbols
were affected by the issue, including companies such as
Travelers Cos.,  Nucor Corp. (NUE)  and Discover Financial Services.  NYSE Euronext had called it a “critical issue” in an e-
mail alert and said all other trading systems were functioning
normally. The Nasdaq Stock Market had declared a “self help”
against the NYSE, meaning the exchange could ignore some bids
and offers on the Big Board until the malfunction was resolved.  T  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
