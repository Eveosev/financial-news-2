Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the world’s
largest consumer-products maker, and Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. won European Union approval for a joint venture
to sell over-the-counter medicines.  The European Commission said the  deal  didn’t raise
competition concerns because the combined market share for pain
killers and cough medicine would remain relatively low and P&G
would continue to face rivalry. It said it approved the deal as
P&G’s proposed acquisition of Teva’s over-the-counter business.  Paul Williams , a spokesman for Teva, said P&G will have a
51 percent stake in the venture, PGT Healthcare, and Teva will
hold the remainder.  “This is a joint initiative that has ongoing involvement
from the two parties,” Williams said in by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
