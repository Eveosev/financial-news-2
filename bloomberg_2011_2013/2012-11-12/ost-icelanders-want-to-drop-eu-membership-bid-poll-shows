A majority of Icelanders want to
withdraw the island’s bid to join the European Union, according
to a poll by  Capacent Gallup .  The poll showed that 53.5 percent of voters don’t want to
proceed with the application, compared with 36.4 percent who
want the island to complete the accession process. About 9.9
percent were undecided, according to the poll conducted for
 Heimssyn , a group opposed to joining the EU, and published in
newspaper Morgunbladid.  Capacent Gallup conducted the poll in September and October.
The newspaper didn’t say how many voters were polled or provide
a margin of error.  Iceland started EU membership talks in July 2010 and may
vote on accession late next year, according to Foreign Minister
Ossur Skarphedinsson. Of a total of 35 negotiating chapters for
membership, Iceland has opened 21 and completed 10. The primary
challenges facing the negotiations will be in matters relating
to agriculture, environment and fisheries, according to EU
Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
