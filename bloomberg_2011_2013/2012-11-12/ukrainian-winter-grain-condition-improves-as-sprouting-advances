Ukrainian winter grains’ condition
improved compared with year-earlier levels as more plants
sprouted, researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Sprouts covered 7.2 million hectares (17.8 million acres)
as of Nov. 9, or almost 90 percent of the planted area, the
Kiev-based researcher said today in an e-mailed statement.
Almost 59 percent of emerged winter grains were in good
condition and the portion classified as weak declined to 8.9
percent, the statement showed.  “This year winter grains’ condition is much better than in
2011,” UkrAgroConsult said. “By the same time last year winter
grains had sprouted on 71 percent of the planted area. Only 30
percent of emerged crops were in good condition, and 31 percent
were weak.”  Winter rapeseed conditions also improved, the researcher
said. The oilseed emerged on 986,500 hectares, or 99.3 percent
of the planted area, and crops were in good condition on 654,100
hectares, according to UkrAgroConsult.  To contact the reporter on this story:
