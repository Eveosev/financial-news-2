Oil may fall below $80 as futures
approach a “death cross” formation in which a shorter-term
moving average crosses below a longer-term average, according to
 technical analysis  from EOXLive.  December futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  may
approach the intraday low of $79.12 reached on June 28 if the
50-day moving average, at $91.45 a barrel on Nov. 9, falls below
the 100-day average at $91.08, the analysis by Tom Pawlicki,
director of market research at the Chicago-based commodity-
trading firm, showed.  “When there is a cross to the downside, we are about to
see some additional selling,” Pawlicki said. “It indicates
that we could probably move down to the June low.”  The last time the contract’s 50-day average crossed below
the 100-day was May 23, after which oil fell 15 percent to the
June low.  Oil for December delivery gained 98 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to settle at $86.07 a barrel Nov. 9 on the Nymex. Futures have
dropped 13 percent this year. Prices slid to $84.44 on Nov. 7,
the lowest settlement since July 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
