China’s stocks  rose, driving up the
benchmark index for the first time in six days, after the
nation’s export growth exceeded forecasts and regulators
announced steps to boost investment into equities.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (601919) , the world’s largest operator of
dry-bulk ships, advanced the most in almost two weeks after data
showed the country’s overseas shipments increased 11.6 percent
in October.  GF Securities Co. (000776)  gained 1.9 percent, leading
brokerages higher as the securities regulator said it will allow
more yuan raised overseas to be invested in local stocks and
bonds. The equity market’s gains were capped by a report showing
new bank loans unexpectedly declined 14 percent in October.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.5 percent to 2,079.27
at the close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 0.5 percent to 2,251.85.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  slipped 0.1 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US
55 Index (CH55BN)  added 0.3 percent in New York on Nov. 9.  “October economic data including exports have confirmed
the economy is stabilizing,” said Wu Kan, a fund manager at
Dazhong Insurance Co. in Shanghai, which oversees $285 million.
“The program to attract more yuan investment is positive news
and it will boost stock performance in the long term. The market
is waiting for further catalysts.”  The Shanghai Composite fell 2.3 percent last week as the
Communist Party started a meeting to decide a new generation of
leaders. The index trades at 9.9 times estimated profit for
2012, compared with the 17.9 average multiple since Bloomberg
began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006. It remains down 5.5
percent this year on concern economic growth will decelerate.  Export Growth  Trading volumes in the gauge were 16 percent lower than the
30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Thirty-day
volatility was at 15.9, lower than this year’s average of 17.2.  China Cosco retreated 1.5 percent to 4.11  yuan , the biggest
drop since Oct. 30.  China Shipping Container Lines Co. (601872) , the
country’s second-largest carrier of sea-cargo boxes, added 1.3
percent to 2.28 yuan.  October export growth compared with the 10 percent estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists and was the fastest
rate since May. Imports rose 2.4 percent, the same pace as the
previous month. The  trade surplus  widened to $32 billion, the
biggest in almost four years.  October data on industrial production, fixed-asset
investment and retail sales all exceeded economists’ forecasts
while declines in producer prices eased, the statistics bureau
said on Nov. 9.  Yuan Loans  New local-currency lending was 505.2 billion yuan ($81.1
billion) in October, the People’s Bank of China said. That
trailed the median 590 billion yuan estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists and 586.8 billion yuan a year earlier.  Guangzhou-based GF Securities, the nation’s third-biggest
brokerage by market value, climbed 1.9 percent to 12.51 yuan.
 Citic Securities Co. (600030) , the largest, gained 0.7 percent to 10.86
yuan.  Regulators agreed in principle to increase the quota for
the  Renminbi  Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor program by
200 billion yuan,  Guo Shuqing , chairman of the securities
regulator, said at a briefing in Beijing yesterday. The current
quota is 70 billion yuan.  China also plans bigger  tax deductions  on dividends for
long-term investors, the Xinhua News Agency reported over the
weekend.  The securities regulator sped up the approval process for
initial public offerings last week, China Business News reported
today, citing an unidentified person. A total of 792 companies
were awaiting approval as of Nov. 8 and 91 approved companies
haven’t yet sold initial public offering shares, the newspaper
said, citing CSRC data.  Consumer Spending  A measure of consumer-staple stocks in the CSI 300 dropped
1.3 percent, the most among 10 industry groups, on concern a
slowdown in economic growth will curb consumer spending.  Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, fell 1.4 percent to 231.46 yuan,
trimming its gain to 20 percent this year.  Jiangsu Yanghe
Brewery Joint-Stock Co. (002304)  lost 4.2 percent to 108.75 yuan.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 0.2 percent on Nov. 9 to
$36.46 for a weekly drop of 2.7 percent, the most since the end
of August.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
