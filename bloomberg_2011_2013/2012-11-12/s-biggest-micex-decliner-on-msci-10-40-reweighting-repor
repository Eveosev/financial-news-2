OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s
biggest mobile phone operator, dropped for a second day on
speculation investors may sell the shares after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 
reviews its Russia 10/40 Index.  MTS slid as much as 2.7 percent and closed down 0.3 percent
at 229.04 rubles in Moscow, the lowest level since Oct. 26. The
amount of shares traded was 991,910, equivalent to 78 percent of
the three-month daily average. Russia’s benchmark Micex Index
rose 0.5 percent to 1,407.90.  MTS and AFK Sistema, which share the fourth position in
MSCI’s Russia 10/40 Index may swap places with lower-ranked OAO
Surgutneftegas’s ordinary and preferred shares, after a
rebalancing on Nov. 26, according an e-mailed note from VTB
Capital. Surgut’s stock would need to outperform MTS and
Sistema’s shares by 2 percent on average to take the fourth spot
and the change may trigger $209 million in fund outflows for
MTS, VTB said.  Sistema fell as much as 0.8 percent before closing up 0.1
percent at 22.029 rubles. Surgutneftegas ordinary shares fell
0.2 percent, while its preferred stock dropped 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
