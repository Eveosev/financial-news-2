Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan,
 Canada ’s third-largest retirement fund, tripled its holdings of
 Nexen (NXY)  Inc., the Calgary-based energy producer that’s the target
of a takeover by  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  of  China .  Ontario Teachers’ increased its holdings to 6.82 million
Nexen shares from 1.72 million, raising its stake by about
$143.7 million in the third quarter, according to a filing with
U.S. regulators.  “You would be holding Nexen right now on the belief that
the deal is going through,” said Sam La Bell, an energy analyst
at Veritas Investment Research Corp. in Toronto, who rates the
stock a “buy.”  Nexen is awaiting Canadian government approval of a
takeover by Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil and natural gas
producer. The state-owned company is confident its proposed
$15.1 billion takeover of Nexen will be completed by the end of
the year, Chairman Wang Yilin said last week.  Deborah Allan, the retirement fund’s Toronto-based director
of communications and media relations, didn’t immediately return
an e-mail seeking comment today.  The retirement fund had C$117 billion ($117 billion) of
assets at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
