Romania plans to lower its budget
deficit to 1.7 percent of gross domestic product next year,
 Ziarul Financiar  reported, citing Deputy Finance Minister Liviu Voinea.  The country seeks to continue a fiscal adjustment program
in 2013 and reduce the gap from an estimated 2.2 percent of GDP
this year, without cutting wages of public employees or
increasing a value-added tax, Voinea said, according to the
Bucharest-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
