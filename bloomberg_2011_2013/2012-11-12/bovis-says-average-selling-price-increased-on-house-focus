Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) , the U.K.’s
second smallest homebuilder by market value, said the average
selling price of homes to be built this year rose 5.5 percent
after the company favored houses over apartments.  The price increased to 190,000 pounds ($287,000), compared
with 180,100 pounds a year earlier, the Longfield, England,
company said in a statement today.  “Subject to stable market conditions, the group is
confident that it can deliver further growth in revenue with
strong increases in profit margins,” the homebuilder said.  Britain’s uncertain recovery from a double-dip recession
and a dearth credit has curbed demand for homes. House prices
fell for a fourth month in October, Halifax said Nov. 6. Prices
may fall as much as 2 percent next year as values in every part
of the country drop for the first time since the financial
crisis, broker Knight Frank LLP said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
