European Union carbon permits rose
above 9 euros a metric ton for the first time since March as the
European Commission said it would publish a proposal to withhold
permits from the market later today.  The benchmark contract for December gained as much as 8.6
percent to 9.05 euros a ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange at 4:32 p.m. That’s the biggest increase since April 5.
The EU Commission will publish its proposal on delaying a
quantity of permits from auctions as of 2013 at 8 p.m. Brussels
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
