Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) ,  Germany ’s
largest residential landlord by market value, raised its
forecast for funds from operations by about 8 percent after
adding apartments and collecting more rent.  FFO excluding sales, a measure of a property company’s
ability to generate cash, will be at least 65 million euros ($83
million) this year, the Frankfurt-based company said in a
statement today. That’s up from an August forecast of 60 million
euros. Deutsche Wohnen reported a 31 percent increase in FFO
excluding sales to 52.4 million in the first nine months.  Deutsche Wohnen owns 73,000 apartments in cities including
Berlin and  Frankfurt  and is benefiting from growing demand for
housing in large urban areas. The company in May agreed to buy
Barclays Plc’s Baubecon portfolio of 23,500 homes in a deal
valued at 1.24 billion euros.  “They performed a little better than expected on the
rental income,” said Torsten Klingner, an analyst at Warburg
Research with a buy rating on the stock. Profit from the main
business of renting apartments increased 14 percent to 135.4
million euros.  Deutsche Wohnen rose 2 percent to 14.21 euros at 12:54 p.m.
in Frankfurt, raising the company’s market value to 2.1 billion
euros. The shares have gained 43 percent this year, while the
 FTSE/EPRA Nareit Germany index  has climbed 29 percent.  Share Sale  FFO excluding sales for 2011 amounted to 47.5 million
euros. Deutsche Wohnen increased the number of homes it owns by
more than half in 2012. The property company will ask
shareholders on Dec. 4 to approve a share sale that will raise
money for more home purchases, according to an Oct. 24
statement.  Deutsche Wohnen has bid for 38,000 apartments in Dresden
being sold by  Gagfah SA (GFJ) , Chief Executive Officer Michael Zahn
said in an interview on Oct. 9. The Dresden homes are valued at
1.8 billion euros, according to Gagfah.  Deutsche Wohnen’s market value could climb to 5 billion
euros within four years, Zahn said.  Bayerische Landesbank’s 33,000 Bavarian homes valued at
about 2 billion euros, also for sale, will probably be too
expensive for Deutsche Wohnen, although the properties would fit
well into its portfolio, Zahn said on a conference call with
analysts today.  “Here we expect to see strong competition with a big
impact on prices, so I don’t see Deutsche Wohnen in the driver’s
seat for this deal,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
