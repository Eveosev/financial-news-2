The  Czech Republic (SPTT) ’s
Telecommunications Office started an auction for radio
frequencies with four bidders taking part in the process, the
regulator’s spokesman Frantisek Malina said by phone today.  Telefonica AS, T-Mobile Czech Republic AS, Vodafone Czech
Republic AS and PPF Mobile Services AS are taking part in the
auction, Malina said. The auction closes on Dec. 20, when the
regulator will announce the distribution of the radio
frequencies among winners, according to its website.  The telecommunications office is offering radio frequencies
in the 800 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2,600 MHz ranges. The auction
should help develop high-speed mobile broadband services, ensure
an effective usage of frequencies and boost competitiveness on
the market by an entry of a new provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
