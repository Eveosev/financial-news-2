D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) , the largest U.S.
homebuilder by volume, fell after its chief executive officer
cautioned that employment growth will remain weak next year,
potentially hurting sales of new houses.  “I still don’t see a lot of jobs being created,” CEO
Donald Tomnitz said during a conference call today. “And I also
see the fact that there are potential layoffs in a number of
industries, especially the defense industry.”  D.R. Horton fell 5.8 percent to $19.40 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since June 1. The 11-member  Standard &
Poor’s  1500 Homebuilding  index  fell 4.1 percent. Atlanta-based
 Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH) , which isn’t part of the index, fell to 17
percent to $13.77 after reporting a wider-than-expected fiscal
fourth-quarter loss.  The U.S.  unemployment  rate was 7.9 percent last month, up
from 7.8 percent in September, according to Labor Department
data. Demand for new houses has revived as buyers, seeking to
take advantage of low  interest rates  and a decline in property
prices, find a tight supply of existing homes to choose.  “We favor DHI’s balance sheet and conservative land-
acquisition strategy, but remain cautious regarding the strength
of the housing recovery,”  Michael Souers , a Standard & Poor’s
analyst, said in a note to investors today, referring to D.R.
Horton by its ticker symbol. He maintained his hold rating on
the builder’s shares.  Net income at  Fort Worth , Texas-based D.R. Horton rose to
$100.1 million, or 30 cents a share, for the three months ended
Sept. 30, compared with $35.7 million, or 11 cents, a year
earlier, it said in a statement today. The average estimate of
20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for earnings of 28 cents.  Sales Increase  Sales of  new homes  rose to an annual pace of 389,000 in
September, the highest since April 2010, the Commerce Department
reported on Oct. 24. Housing  starts  surged 15 percent in
September to an annual pace of 872,000, the fastest since July
2008.  D.R. Horton’s net new orders totaled 5,276, with a value of
$1.3 billion, compared with 4,241 homes valued at about $900
million a year earlier. The company’s fiscal 2012 profit was the
most in six years and the company expects to earn more money
next year, Tomnitz said.  “We feel comfortable that we’ll have a much better 2013
than we did 2012,” he said.  Horton’s shares rose 63 percent this year through Nov. 9,
compared with an 80 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s
homebuilding  index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
