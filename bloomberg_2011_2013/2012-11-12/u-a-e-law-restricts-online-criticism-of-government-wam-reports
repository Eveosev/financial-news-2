The  United Arab Emirates  issued
regulations for  Internet users  that makes some online behavior a
criminal offense punishable by imprisonment, the official
Emirates News Agency, known as WAM, reported.  The publication of material that would “endanger the
security of the state and its supreme interests” contravenes
federal law,  WAM reported . Calling for regime change,
threatening the legal system and organizing demonstrations are
punishable with prison sentences, it said.  The European Parliament in October called for the U.A.E.
government to respect human-rights, to conduct thorough and
unbiased investigations into allegations of assault and to
release immediately prisoners of conscience and activists. The
U.A.E. arrested more than 60 people tied to the domestic
Islamist group known as Islah and some of the detainees may have
been tortured and denied legal representation, the EU assembly
said.  The regulation will punish those who use the Internet or
information technology to offend Islam, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
