“Halo 4,” the latest installment
in  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s video-game franchise, took in more than
$220 million in its first 24 hours on sale, setting a record for
the title.  The  game , a sci-fi shooting adventure, will surpass the
previous “Halo” record of $300 million in worldwide sales in
its first week, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today
in an e-mailed statement.  “Halo,” exclusive to the company’s Xbox 360 console,
ranks among the 10 top-grossing video-game franchises of all
time. Various versions have generated more than $3 billion in
revenue, according to Microsoft, and have helped the company
weather an industry drop in sales of games at retail. The Xbox
has been the No. 1 console in the U.S. for almost two years,
according to researcher NPD Group Inc.  Microsoft, which released the first ‘Halo’ title in
November 2001,  fell  2.1 percent to $28.22 at the close in  New
York . The shares are up 8.7 percent this year.  “Halo 4’ faces competition tomorrow from  Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , which releases the next installment of another
all-time leader, the ‘‘Call of Duty’’ shooter game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
