India’s rupee fell to a two-month
low, reversing an earlier gain, as reports showed industrial
production unexpectedly contracted and the trade deficit widened
to a record.  Factory output  in Asia’s third-largest economy declined 0.4
percent in September from a year earlier, according to a
statement from the Central Statistical Office, compared with a
2.8 percent increase predicted by economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The nation’s exports fell 1.6 percent last month while
imports rose 7.4 percent, leaving a trade deficit of $20.96
billion, Commerce Secretary S.R. Rao said in a separate
statement in New Delhi today.  “The industrial output numbers were quite disappointing,”
said Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at  ING Vysya Bank Ltd. (VYSB)  in
Mumbai. “The drop in exports is a cause for concern and will
continue to pressure the rupee.”  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 54.8750 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
55.1250 earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 13, when the
government began a slew of policy changes to improve public
finances and attract investment.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 40 basis points, or 0.40
percentage point, to 10.50 percent.  Importers stepped up dollar purchases to meet payments
before local markets shut for a two-day holiday starting
tomorrow, according to Pramit Brahmbhatt, chief executive
officer at Alpari Financial Services  India  Ltd. in Mumbai.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 55.87 per
dollar, compared with 55.64 on Nov. 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.92 versus 55.58. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
