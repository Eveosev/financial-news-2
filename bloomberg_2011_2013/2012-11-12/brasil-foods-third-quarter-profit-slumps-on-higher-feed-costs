BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , the country’s
largest  maker  of TV dinners and frozen pizza, said profit slid
in the third quarter, missing analysts estimates, after higher
costs for grain used to feed its chickens and swine squeezed
margins.  Net income dropped to 90.9 million reais ($44.3 million) in
the period, Sao Paulo-based  Brasil Foods  said in a regulatory
filing late yesterday. The result missed analysts’  estimates  for
a gain, excluding one-time items, of 107.8 million reais, the
average of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A year earlier
the company had net income of 365 million reais.  Costs of goods sold rose 21 percent to 5.67 billion reais
in the quarter. Prices for corn and soybean, two main
ingredients used to feed Brasil Food’s chickens and swine,
climbed 12 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, after the
worst U.S. drought in half a century scorched fields.  Brasil Foods raised prices on hot dogs and hamburger
patties in the quarter, which wasn’t enough to offset an
increase in grain costs, Ricardo Boiati, an analyst with  Banco
Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , said in a Nov. 1 note to clients. He rates the
stock equivalent to buy, which means the stock is expected to
exceed  Brazil ’s Bovespa stock index by more than 10 percent.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, declined to 7.9 percent of sales, from
12 percent a year ago, Brasil Foods said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
