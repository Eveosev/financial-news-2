Australian  home-loan approvals  rose
in September for a second month as buyers responded to the
central bank’s  interest-rate cuts .  The number of loans granted to build or buy houses and
apartments gained 0.9 percent from August, when they increased a
revised 2.1 percent, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 16 economists
was for approvals to gain 1 percent.  Today’s data follow a government report last week showing
Australian employers added more workers in October than
economists forecast. The nation’s central bank has reduced the
overnight cash rate target five times since Nov. 1, 2011, to
help extend a 21-year run without a recession.  “Conditions are generally looking up in the housing
market, as lower rates have improved home buyer appetite,”
Katrina Ell, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in Sydney, said
before the report.  The Australian dollar was little changed, buying $1.0394 at
11:35 a.m. in Sydney compared with $1.0393 before the report.  House prices in  Australia ’s eight state capital cities
jumped 1.4 percent in September, the biggest increase since
March 2010, according to a report from RP Data Ltd. and Rismark
International.  Today’s report showed the total value of loans rose 3.8
percent to A$21.2 billion ($22 billion) in September from a
month earlier.  Investment Lending  The value of lending to owner-occupiers gained 1.5 percent,
the report showed. The value of loans to investors who plan to
rent or resell homes advanced 8.6 percent.  First-home buyers accounted for 19.3 percent of dwellings
that were financed in September, up from 18.6 percent in August
and the highest proportion since January, the report showed
today.  Investors are pricing in a 62 percent chance Reserve Bank
of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens will cut the benchmark rate
0.25 percentage point to 3 percent next month, swaps data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Australian employers hired 10,700 workers in October,
compared with economists’ forecasts for an increase of 500, and
the unemployment rate unexpectedly held as the nation weathered
a global slowdown.  To contact the reporters on this story:
