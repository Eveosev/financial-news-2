U.K. natural gas for within-day
delivery erased an earlier gain after flows resumed from South
Hook LNG Terminal Co.’s facility in  Wales .  Day-ahead and next-month gas were little changed, according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Flows from South Hook rose
to 23 million cubic meters a day after falling to zero at about
4 a.m. London time,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  The Shagra tanker docked at South Hook from  Qatar 
yesterday, the first delivery since Oct. 1, according to the
Milford Haven Port Authority. A second vessel, the Al Mayeda, is
due to arrive from the emirate later today.  Gas for today  was unchanged at 65 pence a therm at 4:41
p.m. London time. Month-ahead gas climbed 0.3 percent to 66.22
pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.51 per million British
thermal units and compares with $3.52 per million Btu of front-
month U.S. gas.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 257
million cubic meters, below the seasonal normal of 262 million,
according to National Grid data. The  delivery network  will
contain 337 million cubic meters at the end of the period, about
the same as at the beginning, grid data show.  Gas accounted for 32 percent of U.K. power production at
4:40 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 41 percent, nuclear 14
percent and wind 5.6 percent.  Day-ahead electricity rose 0.5 percent to 47.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.  Next-month power  added 1.1 percent to 49.20
pounds a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
