RenCredit MFB Ltd., the Nigerian
consumer-finance unit of Moscow-based Renaissance Group, opened
operations in sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy.  “We plan to lend about 1 billion naira ($6.3 million) over
the next six months, but much of our lending will be based on
business needs,” Chief Executive Officer Segun Akintemi said in
an interview in Lagos today.  Renaissance Group, headed by Stephen Jennings, is attracted
by Nigeria’s growing economy and an expanding middle class with
little access to credit, Akintemi said. The economy of Africa’s
most populous nation of 160 million people is forecast to grow
6.8 percent next year compared with 6.5 percent in 2012, Finance
Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said on Aug. 10.  Nigerian banks have limited credit to small and medium-
sized enterprises following a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009
triggered by lending to stock market speculators and oil
importers. Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi fired
the CEOs of eight of the country’s 24 banks, and the government
set up the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria to buy the debts
and stabilize the industry.  RenCredit is focusing on “middle income” earners and
“small and medium enterprises” that want loans to complement
their working capital, Akintemi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
