Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said euro area finance chiefs may have to return to
Brussels later this week to finalize a decision on Greek rescue
aid.  “I certainly do not rule that out,” Dijsselbloem told
reporters as he entered today’s talks. “We’ll not put ourselves
under time pressure. If more time is needed, we’ll take it. If I
have to travel back and forth another two or three times before
we come to a decision, I will do that.”  Greece  faces a 5 billion-euro bill redemption on Nov. 16.
Dijsselbloem said this deadline wouldn’t force euro-area finance
ministers to rush a decision.  “The Greeks have left a lot of things until the last
minute, so we’ll also take the time to consider where we are.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
