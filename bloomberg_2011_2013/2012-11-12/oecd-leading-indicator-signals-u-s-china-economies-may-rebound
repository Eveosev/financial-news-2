The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said that its leading economic
indicator suggests that the U.S., Chinese and Italian economies
may be approaching a recovery after slowing in previous months.  The composite leading indicator for the U.S. climbed to
100.9 in September from 100.8 in August, the Paris-based OECD
said today in an e-mailed statement. The reading for  Italy  rose
to 99 from 98.9,  its second consecutive gain, while  China ’s
reading was unchanged for a third month at 99.4.  The stabilization underlines the fragile state of the world
economy at a time when U.S. President  Barack Obama  is beginning
negotiations with lawmakers on how to avoid saddling the world’s
largest economy with tax increases known as the “fiscal cliff”
and European policy makers seek to revive growth after three
years of a sovereign debt crisis. The reading for all OECD
countries stood at 100.2.  “Signs of stabilization are emerging in  Canada , China and
the U.S.,” the OECD said today in a monthly statement.
“Compared to recent months where the composite leading
indicator has pointed to a deteriorating outlook, tentative
signs of stabilization are also emerging in Italy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
