Croatia  plans to offer the bay of
Kupari near Dubrovnik, its most-visited Adriatic Sea resort, for
development, with a value of as much as 250 million euros ($318
million).  Kupari, 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) east of Dubrovnik’s
Renaissance-era city walls, will be offered “in the next few
weeks” for development of hotels, villas and a conference
center, partly through concession and partly through property
sales, the  Tourism Ministry  said by e-mail in response to
Bloomberg questions.  Croatia, which is set to become the 28th member of the
European Union in July, needs foreign investment to revive its
economy after three years of recession and stagnation. The
Adriatic Sea nation gets one-fifth of its gross domestic product
from tourism, developed along its 5,880 kilometers of coastline.  Kupari, a 300,000-square-meter bay with a crescent-shaped
pebble beach, used to be a Yugoslav-era military resort before
it was heavily damaged in the 1991 war for Croatian
independence. Abandoned since then, shell-scarred ruins of the
four concrete-and-steel hotels from the socialist era today are
overgrown with Mediterranean vegetation.  “The location of the project is extraordinary,” Vedrana
Likan, managing director of the Croatian branch of  Colliers
International , said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg
questions. “A concession model could be the right form of
investment, as long as the concession period is long enough and
incentives for private partners are provided.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
