Winter crops in southern Russia, the
world’s third-biggest  wheat exporter  last season, were helped by
intensive rain last week, according to the national weather
center.  Rain fell from Nov. 7 through Nov. 10 across the Southern
and North-Caucasus federal districts, the  Federal Hydro-
meteorological Center  said on its website yesterday. The two
districts accounted for almost 35 percent of Russia’s national
crop last year, harvesting 32.6 million metric tons of grains,
according to state statistics.  The Stavropol region and North Caucasus republics, where
some districts had been suffering moisture deficits, received
20-30 millimeters (0.8-1.2 inches) of rain and “conditions for
sprouting and growth of winter grains have improved
significantly” there, the center said.  Weather conditions were due to be mainly satisfactory for
further development of winter crops in most parts of European
 Russia  in the 10 days through Nov. 20, the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
