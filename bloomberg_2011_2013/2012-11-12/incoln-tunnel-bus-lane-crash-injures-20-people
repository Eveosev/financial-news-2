Two buses in a Manhattan-bound
express lane to the Lincoln Tunnel collided in  New Jersey ,
injuring about 20 people, and an eight-vehicle accident closed a
westbound tube.  The crash between a Martz Trailways bus and a New Jersey
Transit bus occurred at about 7:15 a.m. on the Route 495 ramp
approaching the tunnel, said Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the
 Port Authority  of New York and New Jersey. Two people were
seriously injured.  The second accident occurred at about 12:30 p.m. in the New
Jersey-bound north tube, injuring five people. That tube was
closed, and the center tube was opened for traffic leaving
Manhattan, Marsico said. He said he didn’t know whether the tube
would be reopened for the evening commute.  “It’s been a rough day at the Lincoln Tunnel,” he said.  The Star-Ledger  reported  that the Martz bus rear-ended the
No. 168 NJ Transit bus originating from Paramus, causing damage
to both vehicles. The paper cited John Durso Jr., a spokesman
for NJ Transit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
