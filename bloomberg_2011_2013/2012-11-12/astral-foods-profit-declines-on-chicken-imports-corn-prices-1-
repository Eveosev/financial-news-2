Astral Foods Ltd. (ARL) , a South African
poultry producer, said fiscal full-year earnings dropped 23
percent as chicken imports from  South America  and Europe
increased and the local price of corn rose.  Net income declined to 329 million rand ($38 million) in
the year through September from 429 million rand a year earlier,
the Pretoria-based company said today in a statement.  Earnings
per share of 8.64 rand beat the 8.41-rand median  estimate  of
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The poultry industry was put to the test on many
fronts,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Schutte said in the
statement, referring to corn exports from  South Africa , record-
high poultry imports, escalating international grain prices and
inflation-beating increases in energy costs.  Astral cut 150 jobs in August and froze pay for its 12,000
employees on Oct. 18 as it struggled with rising feed costs. The
generic contract price of yellow corn has risen to 2,513 rand a
metric ton from its year-low of 1,930 rand on May 7 in
Johannesburg trading. Inflation accelerated an annual 5.5
percent in September, compared with 5 percent a month earlier.  Astral’s sales jumped 13 percent in the year to 8.16
billion rand. The  shares  rose 0.7 percent to 103.20 rand as of
10:33 a.m. in Johannesburg, gaining for a fifth trading day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
