Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is counting on holders of the country’s restructured
debt to argue in a New York court that Argentina shouldn’t pay
owners of defaulted debt when it makes interest payments on more
than $3 billion of restructured bonds next month, El Cronista
said.  David Martinez, owner of New York-based Fintech Advisory
Inc., and Gramercy Advisors LLC, a hedge fund in Greenwich,
Connecticut, are among the 15 institutional investors expected to
back the country’s arguments against a so-called pari passu
clause, which requires that all bondholders should be treated
equally, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said today, without
disclosing how it got the information.  On Nov. 16, Judge Thomas Griesa will hear the parties ahead
of deciding whether Argentina is obliged to pay so-called
holdouts. Argentina also wants other institutions such as the  Bank
Of New York (BK)  Mellon Corp, trustee of the notes, to support its
case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
