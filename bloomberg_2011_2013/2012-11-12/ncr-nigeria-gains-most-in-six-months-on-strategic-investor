NCR Nigeria Plc (NCR) , which sells
computers and support services, rallied the most in more than
six months as a “strategic investor” took a position in the
stock, Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. Ltd. said.  The  shares climbed  5 percent to 13.74 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the biggest gain since
April 27.  “The stock moved due what appears to be a deliberate
purchase by a strategic investor,” David Adonri, chief
executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth, said by phone today.
“I went through the transactions on the stock today and found
out that only five trades, with four at unusually high volumes,
have been done.” he said. Generally, that level of trades
“should not propel a stock into full bid,” Adonri explained.  The company “can be easily acquired so it’s a good one
for anyone who wants to poach,” Raheem Mohammed, chief
operating officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said by phone from
Lagos. “The company pioneered the computerisation of salaries
in Nigeria, and it still has a lot of prospects in that area.”  NCR’s shares have risen 48 percent this year, compared with
a 26 percent gain for the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  A call to NCR’s office in Lagos and e-mailed questions to a
company e-mail address weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
