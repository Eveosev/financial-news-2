The euro touched two-month lows
against the dollar and Swiss franc as European finance ministers
struggled to agree on how to provide additional aid for  Greece .  The 17-nation currency erased losses versus the greenback
as U.S. stocks rose amid an increase in risk appetite.  New
Zealand ’s dollar declined after retail sales unexpectedly fell.
The yen gained against most major peers after euro-area policy
makers said they would give Greece two extra years to lower its
 budget deficit .  Brazil ’s real slid on bets the central bank will
continue intervening to weaken it.  “Greece expectations have been priced in and are weighing
on the euro,” said Dan Hwang, the New York-based chief currency
trader for Gallant Capital Markets, an online foreign-exchange
brokerage. “The euro-dollar should continue trading between the
100- and 200-day moving average for the next couple of weeks
until the next tranche of aid.”  The euro was little changed at $1.2704 at 5 p.m.  New York 
time after touching $1.2662 earlier, the weakest level since
Sept. 7. Its 100-day moving average is $1.2644, and the 200-day
average is $1.2815. The shared currency declined 0.2 percent to
100.84 yen, weakening for a fifth day. The Japanese currency
appreciated 0.2 percent to 79.38 per dollar.  The seven-day relative strength index for the euro versus
the dollar was 18.9. A reading below 30 indicates an asset may
have fallen too far, too quickly, and be due for a correction.  The euro reversed losses as the  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index
rose as much as 0.6 percent when Home Depot Inc. led a rally in
retailers after reporting better-than-forecast earnings. The
gauge later erased gains to end the day down 0.4 percent.  Kiwi Falls  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced against
all of its 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg
before erasing gains as retail sales adjusted for inflation
declined 0.4 percent in the third quarter, versus a Bloomberg
News survey’s forecast for a 0.4 percent gain. The kiwi weakened
0.2 percent to 81.60 U.S. cents.  Europe ’s common currency has lost 6.3 percent in the past
12 months, the worst performance among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The yen slid 2 percent, and the dollar rose 1.3 percent.  Euro-area finance ministers will reconvene next week in an
“extraordinary meeting” to discuss Greece’s financing needs,
according to a statement read out by Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker  at the conclusion of a gathering in Brussels
late yesterday. International Monetary Fund Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  said after the meeting Greece’s creditors had
“different views.”  Lagarde Disagrees  The finance ministers put off until Nov. 20 a decision on
how to cover additional Greek needs of as much as 32.6 billion
euros ($41 billion). Lagarde disagreed with a decision by the
officials to postpone the goal of getting Greece’s debt down to
120 percent of GDP by two years, until 2022.  “Greece has not really gone away,”  Fabian Eliasson , head
of U.S. currency sales at  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  in New
York, said in an interview. “They’re still trying to chip away
with their austerity measures. But if you don’t get the red
headlines that it’s deteriorating for the moment, you see that
as an improvement.”  A gauge of German investor sentiment unexpectedly fell. The
ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim said its
index of  investor confidence , which is designed to predict
economic developments six months in advance, dropped to minus
15.7, from minus 11.5 in October. Economists in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast an increase to minus 10.  Swiss Franc  Switzerland ’s franc appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.2036 per
euro, the strongest level since Sept. 12.  ICAP Plc’s EBS electronic foreign-exchange platform will
reduce the number of intervals at which participants can trade
the  Swiss franc  against the euro to “discourage disruptive
behavior.”  Traders will only be able to exchange the currency at so-
called half pips, or intervals of 0.00005, from Nov. 26, instead
of trading at 0.00001 steps, or “tenths”, EBS said in a
statement distributed by e-mail today.  Brazil’s real weakened for a fifth day versus the dollar in
its longest stretch of losses since August on speculation the
central bank will continue to intervene.  The  real  fell 0.4 percent to 2.0584 to the greenback and
touched 2.0741, the weakest level since June 28. Brazil’s
central bank has sold reverse currency swaps to keep the real
weaker than 2 per dollar to support exporters. It sold $1.4
billion of contracts Oct. 25, $1.6 billion Oct. 23, $1.3 billion
Oct. 5, $5.7 billion Sept. 12 through Sept. 17 and $350 million
Aug. 21. The August reverse swaps were the first since March.  Aussie Outlook  The Australian dollar may weaken to its lowest level since
Oct. 8 after it was unable to advance beyond the resistance area
from $1.0475 to $1.0480 last week,  Niall O’Connor , a  New York- 
based technical analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote today in
a client note. If the currency falls below key support levels of
$1.0328 and $1.0355, it may depreciate to $1.0149, he said.  Resistance is an area on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered, and support is an area where there may be buy orders.  The Aussie dollar was little changed against its U.S.
counterpart at $1.0435.  Implied volatility  among major currencies, which signals
the expected pace of price swings, fell to 7.24 percent,
according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. gauge of Group-of-Seven
currencies. That’s the lowest since October 2007. Traditionally,
when volatility declines, riskier currencies appreciate. The
five-year average is 12.36 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound advanced versus most major peers after a report
showed U.K. inflation accelerated more than economists forecast
in October. Britain’s currency gained as much as 0.4 percent to
79.70 pence per euro before trading little changed at 80.05
pence. It traded against the greenback at $1.5871.  U.K. consumer prices rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 2.2 percent in September, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in  London  today. Inflation was forecast to
quicken to 2.4 percent, based on the median of 36 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
