Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of Deutsche Telekom AG, rose to the highest in a month
after  Nepszabadsag  reported the government may be giving up on
plans to start a competing mobile network provider.  The shares rose 1.5 percent to 419 forint by 11:20 a.m. in
Budapest, the strongest since Oct. 10 on an intraday basis. The
benchmark BUX stock index slipped less than 0.1 percent to
19,039.  While the government said in October it still wanted to
encourage the opening up of the telecommunications industry to
reduce prices for consumers, the Cabinet may now decide to
abandon the plan, Nepszabadsag said, citing unidentified people.
A Budapest court in September voided a tender that awarded a
license to a group of state-owned companies to compete with
Magyar Telekom and the Hungarian units of Vodafone Group Plc and
Telenor ASA.  “We expect some positive reaction in Magyar Telekom
shares” to the report, Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst
at KBC Groep NV, wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
