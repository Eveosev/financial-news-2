European Union carbon advanced to
its highest for more than eight months before the European
Commission publishes details of a plan to temporarily delay
supply.  The benchmark contract for December gained 9 percent to
close at 9.08 euros ($11.54) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the most since Feb. 27. That’s the
biggest one-day gain since April 5.  The Commission will publish its plan on delaying supply
from auctions as of 2013 at 8 p.m. Brussels time.  Gains may last only “a couple of days,”  Trevor Sikorski ,
an analyst in London for Barclays Plc, said by phone today
before the Brussels-based commission brought forward the
announcement of its plan by two days.  Supplies sold at auctions between now and the end of the
year will surge to unprecedented levels of as much as 25 million
tons a week, Sikorski said today in an e-mailed research note.
Prices may decline to 8 euros a ton by the end of the month, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
