British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  sold
its first bonds in euros for a year as European credit risk was
little changed before the region’s finance ministers meet to
discuss Greek aid.  Europe’s largest cigarette maker priced 750 million euros
($953 million) of securities due January 2023 to yield 75 basis
points more than the midswaps rate, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, tighter than initial guidance of 80 to 85 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default
swaps linked to the debt of 50 mostly junk-rated companies rose
2.3 basis points to 536 at 4:28 p.m. in  London , having earlier
fallen as much as 4.5 basis points.  BAT’s sale is the company’s first in the common currency
since it raised 600 million euros of 10-year bonds on Nov. 9,
2011 at a yield of 123 basis points more than swaps, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Europe’s finance ministers are
seeking to prevent a 5 billion-euro Greek bill redemption on
Nov. 16 from triggering an accidental default.  “There’s still a lot of money around waiting to be
allocated, ” said Oliver Woyda, a  money manager  at Deka
Investment GmbH in  Frankfurt .  Will Hill, a spokesman for BAT in London said the company
was selling bonds to refinance upcoming debt maturities and for
general corporate purposes. “We have a number of refinancing
requirements in 2013, including a euro bond redemption in July,
and have decided to take advantage of favourable market
conditions,” he said in an e-mailed statement.  IBM Deal  Also in  capital markets  today,  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  priced 1 billion euros of seven-year bonds at 20
basis points more than swaps, the tight end of an initially-
marketed range of 20 to 25. It was the New York-based company’s
first sale in the currency in four years, Bloomberg data show.  In derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of
credit-default swaps on 125 investment-grade companies rose 0.25
basis points to 132, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
Bank credit risk also rose, with the Markit iTraxx Financial
Index of swaps tied to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers
up three basis points at 182.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
