Philadelphia Eagles quarterback
Michael Vick sustained “a pretty significant concussion” in
the team’s 38-23 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, coach Andy Reid
said in a  press briefing .  Vick, who was injured on an incomplete pass in the second
quarter of yesterday’s loss, is resting at home. Reid said if he
is cleared to play, he’ll return to the starting lineup.  “I think we’ll know here in the next couple days,” Reid
said, according to the team’s website. “The thing I’m telling
you now is I think it’s a pretty significant concussion.”  Nick Foles  came off the bench to complete 22 of 32 passes
for 219 yards, with a touchdown and an interception.  Reid said Foles, a 6-foot-6, 243-pound rookie from the
University of  Arizona , will take all the snaps with the first
team this week and prepare to start against the Washington
Redskins in Landover,  Maryland , on Nov. 18.  “Michael’s our quarterback, so I don’t want to slight that
part, but at the same time, I’ve got confidence that Nick will
do a nice job if given that opportunity,” Reid said.  Philadelphia, 3-6, has lost five straight, while the 3-6
Redskins have dropped three in a row.  To contact the reporter on this story:
