Ousted Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s last prime minister, Baghdadi Mahmudi, is slated to
appear in court in Tripoli today on charges that include
ordering mass rape during last year’s uprising.  Mahmudi, who would be the highest ranking former official
to stand trial so far, faces charges of “prejudicial acts
against the security of the state” and ordering mass rape in
the city of Zuwara, Taha Baara, a spokesman for the prosecutor-
general, said in a statement distributed to the media.  Mahmudi is also accused of ordering the transfer of dead
bodies to buildings hit by Western airstrikes to give the
appearance that the strikes resulted in civilian casualties,
Baara said.  The start of the trial comes two days before a new Cabinet
is scheduled to be sworn in, the first government to be approved
by the democratically elected parliament. An earlier list
submitted by Prime Minister Ali Zaidan’s predecessor was
rejected by lawmakers, who subsequently withdrew confidence from
the then-premier.  Libya repeatedly sought Mahmudi’s extradition from Tunisia,
where he fled in September 2011. He was returned to Libya in
June, and his lawyers say he was beaten by Libyan security
officers. Libyan officials deny he was abused while in custody.  To contact the reporters on this story:
