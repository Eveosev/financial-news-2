Indonesia ’s bonds rose, sending the
10-year yield to an eight-month low, on speculation the
Southeast Asian nation’s relatively high  interest rates  will
attract overseas investors.  Global funds boosted holdings of local-currency sovereign
debt by almost 15 trillion rupiah ($1.6 billion) this quarter to
255.6 trillion rupiah on Nov. 8, finance ministry data show.
Bank Indonesia has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at
5.75 percent since February. Central bank rates are at 2.75
percent in Thailand and South Korea and at 3 percent in China.
The rupiah dropped, adding to four weeks of declines.  “Indonesian bonds are rising because foreign funds are
buying the debt for better yields relative to those in other
countries in the region,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “The demand for bonds will
help limit the rupiah’s weakness in the short-term.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2022 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 5.52 percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. That’s the lowest level since March. The
notes still pay almost 4 percentage points more than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries.  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 9,638 per dollar as of 3:23
p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency lost 0.1 percent last week.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.80 percent, the
lowest level since September 2008.  Bank Indonesia  may gradually raise the rate it pays lenders
on overnight deposits while keeping the benchmark unchanged,
Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said in an interview in Jakarta
on Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
