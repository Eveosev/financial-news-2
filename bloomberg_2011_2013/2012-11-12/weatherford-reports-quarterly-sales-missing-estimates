Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT) , the
world’s fourth-largest oilfield-services provider, reported
quarterly sales that missed analysts’ estimates.  Third-quarter revenue of $3.82 billion was less than the
$3.9 billion average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
Geneva-based company reported pretax net income of $191 million,
a decline from the restated profit of $270 million a year
earlier, according to a statement today.  The company reports results on a pretax basis after finding
“material weakness” in its accounting of income taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
