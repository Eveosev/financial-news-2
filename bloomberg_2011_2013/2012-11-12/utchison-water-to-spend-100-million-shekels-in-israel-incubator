Hutchison Water, a unit of Hong
Kong-based  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , bought an Israeli incubator
known as Kinrot Venture and plans to invest 100 million shekels
($25 million) in it during the next eight years.  Kinrot, founded in 1993 as part of the government’s push to
encourage innovation, holds more than 10 companies focused in
water and clean-technology development. Hutchison bought the
company through an Israeli unit from Aqua Agro Fund LP, which
owned the incubator since 2010, according to an e-mailed
statement.  Israel  has several companies in the water industry, since
the country has limited natural water resources and has seen
municipal water demands rise three-fold since 1970.  Israel’s water reserves have been depeleted by six years of
below-average rainful. The nation plans in the next 40 years to
spend about $58 billion upgrading “what is already one of the
world’s most advanced water-management programs,” according to
Alasdair Wilson, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
