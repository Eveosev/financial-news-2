(Corrects and updates bond pricing in last paragraph.)  Mexico’s peso fell for a fourth day,
the longest stretch of losses in a month, as the overseers of
euro-area bailouts cited risks in  Greece , stoking concern that
 Europe ’s crisis will weigh on markets for the Latin American
country’s exports.  The currency slid 0.1 percent to 13.2113 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, the weakest level on a closing basis since
Aug. 30. The peso pared its 2012 rally to 5.5 percent.  The peso declined as an assessment by Greece’s creditors
obtained by  Bloomberg News  indicated that plans to give the
nation two more years to meet deficit-reduction targets would
open up financing gaps of 15 billion euros ($19 billion) through
2014 and 17.6 billion euros in 2015-2016. European finance
ministers meet today after Greek lawmakers passed a 2013 budget
needed to unlock bailout funds.  “It definitely doesn’t appear that there’s a solution to
the problems that have had the currency depreciating,” Eduardo
Rodriguez, a currency trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB, said
in a phone interview from Guadalajara, Mexico. Compared with
other currencies, the peso “is a bit more susceptible because
positions in its favor were very large.”  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a gain in the peso, versus those
betting on a decline, is shrinking, figures from the Washington-
based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. Net longs fell
by 11,587 contracts to 114,422 last week. They rose in September
to 141,256, the highest level since at least 1995.  Concern over the impact of Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
helped make the peso  Latin America ’s worst-performing major
currency in 2011.  U.S. Budget  The peso has also weakened as U.S. lawmakers try to reach
an agreement to avoid $607 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts scheduled to start Jan. 1, according to Rodriguez. Mexico’s
northern neighbor is its biggest trading partner.  The yield on  Mexico ’s peso-denominated bond due in 2024 was
little changed at 5.42 percent today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The price increased 0.09 centavo to 140.62
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
