Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo,
 Brazil ’s second largest power generator, fell to the lowest in
more than three years after earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  Cesp, as the Sao Paulo-based utility is known, slumped 6.5
percent to 16.05 reais, the lowest closing price since May 11,
2009. The shares are down 51 percent this year, compared with a
0.5 percent gain on the benchmark Bovespa index.  Cesp reported third-quarter net income of 149.6 million
reais ($73 million) excluding some items after markets closed on
Nov. 9, short of an estimated 162.5 million reais, the average
of six analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The bottom line fell slightly short of our estimate,”
Banco Itau SA analysts Marcos Severine and Mariana Coelho said
in a report to clients today. “Lower average energy prices in
both the regulated and free markets” pared sales, they said.  Brazilian utilities have tumbled this year after President
Dilma Rousseff in September announced a plan to reduce
electricity rates by as much as 28 as the government seeks to
cut costs for manufacturers to make them more competitive. The
package announced by Rousseff will reduce prices as part of
renewals for concessions set to expire in 2015 and 2017.  Cesp’s decline this year makes it the  sixth-worst performer 
on the 818-member MSCI Emerging Market Index this year.  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , or Eletrobras, and Eletropaulo
Metropolitana Eletricidade de Sao Paulo SA, Brazil’s largest
distributor, are also among the 10 worst performers on the index
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
