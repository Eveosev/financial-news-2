The Slovenian government should pay
Croatian citizens with deposits at Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.’s
predecessor 150 million euros ($190 million), after the  European
Court of Human Rights  verdict becomes final,  Jutarnji List 
reported yesterday, citing Zdenko Rogic, a financial expert
involved in NLB-related talks between the two nations.  About 130,000 Croatians who saved at the Slovenian bank
before the breakup of former  Yugoslavia  should get their money
back without having to file a separate lawsuit, Rogic said,
according to Jutarnji.  The Strasbourg, France-based court on Nov. 6 ruled in favor
of two Bosnian citizens who sued Slovenia for lost savings,
setting a precedent for other former Yugoslav savers outside
Slovenia who have been trying to recoup their money. Slovenia
said it will appeal the verdict.  Rogic and France Arhar, his Slovenian counterpart, have
been seeking to solve another aspect of the dispute.  Croatia ,
which took over the debt of 300,000 Croat savers, is seeking
from Slovenia 270 million euros ($344 million) of former
deposits. Slovenia said last month it will ratify Croatia’s
European Union entry, planned in July next year, only after the
Zagreb government withdraws the lawsuits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
