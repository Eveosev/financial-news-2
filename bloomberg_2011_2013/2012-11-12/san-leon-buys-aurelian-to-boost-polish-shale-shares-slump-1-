San Leon Energy Plc (SLE)  bought  Aurelian
Oil & Gas Plc (AUL)  with an issue of new shares to create the biggest
foreign holder of shale licenses in  Poland , sending the
company’s stock down by the most in almost a year.  San Leon will pay about 61.6 million pounds ($98 million)
in stock for Aurelian, a 13 percent premium to last week’s
closing price, the Dublin-based company said in a statement in
London. Aurelian investors will hold 34 percent of the enlarged
company and San Leon shareholders will have 66 percent.  Prospects for finding shale gas in Poland on a commercial
scale prompted ConocoPhillips to buy a stake in licenses in the
western Baltic Basin this year. Exxon Mobil Corp., the world’s
biggest company, returned some licenses after disappointing
drilling results.  San Leon fell 13 percent, the most since Nov. 22 in  London .  “A merger with Aurelian makes perfect sense for the
shareholders,” said Oisin Fanning, the executive chairman of
San Leon, who will maintain his role. “The combined entity
offers shareholders material conventional and unconventional
plays in stable and highly import-dependent countries.”  Aurelian was advised by Greenhill & Co. International LLP
and Oriel Securities Ltd. San Leon was advised by Fox-Davies
Capital Ltd. and Westhouse Securities Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
