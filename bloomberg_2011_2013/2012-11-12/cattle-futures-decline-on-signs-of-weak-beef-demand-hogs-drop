Cattle futures fell on signs of weak
demand for U.S. beef. Hogs also dropped.  Wholesale  beef  touched $1.9187 a pound on Nov. 9, a four-
week low, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Meatpackers
processed 631,000 cattle last week, down 2.3 percent from a week
earlier, USDA figures show.  The volume of beef  shipments  in the
nine months through September fell 12 percent from a year
earlier, the U.S. Meat Export Federation said today.  “I’m not impressed with the beef fundamentals,”  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial Services, said in a
telephone interview in  Chicago . “It’s a poor time of year for
beef demand going into Thanksgiving,” celebrated on Nov. 22
this year, he said.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
close at $1.2535 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price is still up 3.2 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.2
percent to $1.4595 a pound in Chicago.  The Veterans Day holiday observed today in the U.S. means
some slaughterhouses may be closed, reducing demand for animals,
said Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group.
About 113,000 cattle were processed today, down 4.2 percent from
last week, and meatpackers slaughtered 8.1 percent fewer hogs,
USDA data show.  “It’s going to be a lighter kill week,” Kane said in a
telephone interview from  Yates City ,  Illinois . “That would
somewhat explain a little bit of setback on the cash bid right
now.”  Hog futures for December settlement slid 0.5 percent to
close at 80.325 cents a pound on the CME. Prices climbed 3.9
percent last week, the biggest gain since June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
