Russian police detained six members
of a banned Islamic group who were distributing extremist
literature in mosques in Moscow and seized an arsenal of weapons
including grenades and guns.  The group, the Party of Islamic Revival, was banned as a
terrorist organization by the  Supreme Court , the  Interior
Ministry  said in a statement on its website today.  President  Vladimir Putin  vowed in August to combat
Islamic extremists, who have been waging increasing attacks in
Russia’s mainly Muslim southern regions. The violence spread
also to Tatarstan, in central Russia, where militants wounded
the top Muslim cleric and killed his deputy in July.  Police battling an Islamist insurgency in North Caucasus
regions are using heavy-handed security tactics that are
exacerbating grievances linked to unemployment and corruption,
according to Alexei Malashenko, an analyst with the Carnegie
Moscow Center.  Russia has suffered a series of terrorist attacks in recent
years. A suicide bombing claimed by Islamic militants at
Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport, the busiest air hub in Russia,
killed at least 37 people in January 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
