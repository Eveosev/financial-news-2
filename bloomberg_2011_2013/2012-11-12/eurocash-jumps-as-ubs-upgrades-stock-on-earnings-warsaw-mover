Eurocash SA (EUR) , Poland’s biggest
distributor of non-durable consumer goods, rose to a two-month
high as UBS AG recommended buying its shares, citing “strong”
third-quarter earnings.  The stock gained 1.8 percent to 41.5 zloty by the close in
Warsaw, the highest since Sept. 11. Turnover amounted to 96
percent of the daily average in the last three months. Eurocash
has surged 45 percent  this year , while the benchmark WIG20 Index
advanced 8.9 percent.  UBS raised its recommendation on Eurocash to buy from
neutral and increased its share-price estimate to 48 zloty from
41 zloty. Net income almost doubled to 66.7 million zloty ($20
million) in the third-quarter from 36.5 million zloty a year
earlier, Eurocash said in a regulatory filing on Nov. 9.  “We expect Eurocash to continue to take share from its
competitors, and see the difficult environment as likely to
create opportunities and accelerate market consolidation.”
Michal Potyra, a Warsaw-based analyst at UBS, said in a note
today.  Eurocash will probably be “one of the consolidators” next
year as  Poland ’s “fast-moving” consumer goods retail and
distribution markets are “still very fragmented,” Potyra said.  The Komorniki, Poland-based company plans to continue
paying dividend from this year’s profit, Parkiet reported today,
citing Chief Executive Officer Luis Amaral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
