Romanian President Traian Basescu
said that foreign institutions suspect the Balkan nation is
unable to organize transparent elections following fraud
investigations after a July 29 referendum.  Romania , which will hold parliamentary elections on Dec. 9,
will probably have observers from the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, and other groups during the
ballot, Basescu said in a televised speech from Bucharest today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
