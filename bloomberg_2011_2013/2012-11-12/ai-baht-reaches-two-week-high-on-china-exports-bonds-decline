Thailand’s baht advanced to a two-
week high as better-than-expected data from China improved the
Southeast Asian nation’s export outlook.  Government bonds  fell.  Chinese  overseas sales  increased 11.6 percent in October
from a year earlier, according to official figures released Nov.
10. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a 10
percent gain. The world’s second-biggest economy is Thailand’s
largest export market, taking 11.7 percent of its shipments in
the first nine months of this year.  “ China’s economy  is beginning to improve, which is
positive for other Asian countries,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief
currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Good
data from China also improves risk sentiment among investors.”  The baht appreciated 0.1 percent to 30.63 per dollar as of
8:46 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 30.59 earlier, the strongest level since Oct. 29.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  Thailand’s  exports  increased 0.2 percent in September,
compared with a 7 percent drop in August, official data show.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due May 2015 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.85 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
