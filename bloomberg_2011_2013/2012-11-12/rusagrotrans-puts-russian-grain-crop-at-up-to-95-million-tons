Grain production in  Russia , the
third biggest  wheat exporter  last season, may be 75 million to
95 million metric tons in the 2013-14 marketing year, according
to ZAO Rusagrotrans, the nation’s top grain rail carrier.  Winter planting may be 16.4 million hectares (40.5 million
acres), Igor Pavensky, head of the analytical department at
Rusagrotrans, said by e-mail today. That’s up almost 700,000
hectares from last year, according to his estimates. Spring
grain planting may be up 1 million hectares to 31.4 million
hectares in 2013 because of higher prices, he said.  Dry weather has the potential to curb output in Russia’s
three main grain exporting regions, in Rostov, Stavropol and
Krasnodar, according to the Institute for Agricultural Market
Studies, a research company in Moscow. Up to a quarter of winter
crops failed to sprout after drought in all three areas this
year, it said. Under moderate weather conditions, Russia’s crop
may be about 83 million tons, Pavensky said.  Last year, Russia’s harvest was 94.2 million tons, while
this year farmers have harvested about 73 million tons by Nov.
7, according to Agriculture Ministry data.  Russia will export 10 million tons of wheat this season,
making it the fifth largest shipper of the grain after the U.S.,
 Canada , the European Union and  Australia , the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates. That is down from record wheat exports of
21.6 million tons a year earlier, making it the third biggest
shipper, USDA data show.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $8.805 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 10:25 a.m. Moscow time.
Prices have climbed 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
