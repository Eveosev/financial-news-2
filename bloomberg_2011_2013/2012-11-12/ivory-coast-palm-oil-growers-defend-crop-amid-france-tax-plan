Ivory Coast’s palm-oil industry
protested a French proposal to raise taxation of the food
ingredient fourfold, saying the oil crop is the victim of a
“powerful disinformation campaign.”  Palm oil is rich in carotene and vitamin E, and is consumed
in  Africa  and Asia “without any trouble,” industry group AIPH
wrote in an e-mailed statement today. Palm oil production
requires less land than soybean oil or rapeseed oil, and Ivory
Coast doesn’t clear forest to grow the crop, it said.  The French plan to increase tax on palm oil by 300 percent
was  proposed  by the Senate’s social-affairs committee last week
as an amendment to  France ’s 2013 social-security budget
legislation. The proposed law will be the subject of a vote by
the lower chamber of parliament next month, and the amendment
may be included.  “In Ivory Coast, palm oil production provides the
livelihood of 2 million people, that is 10 percent of the
population,” AIPH wrote. “One precision: there are no
orangutans in Africa.”  Greenpeace has said palm-oil expansion in  Indonesia  is
destroying the habitat of Sumatran tigers and orangutans.  Palm oil is rich in saturated fats, and is used to make
margarine and as frying oil, according to the Senate committee.
The oil contains 50 percent saturated fats, compared with 65
percent for butter, according to the AIPH.  “No scientific study has ever demonstrated that palm oil
is harmful to health,” the group wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
