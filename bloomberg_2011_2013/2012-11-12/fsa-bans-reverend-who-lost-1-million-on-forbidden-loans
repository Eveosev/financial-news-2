The U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  banned Reverend Carmel Jones for approving unlawful
loans while serving as chairman of The Pentecostal Credit Union,
which resulted in losses of 670,000 pounds ($1 million).  Jones approved 14 loans to a separate church organization,
breaching rules that forbid credit unions to lend to other
corporations. The FSA told Jones on three occasions that the
loans were unlawful, the agency said in a statement on its
website today. As a result of the ban, Jones can no longer hold
a post at a financial firm regulated by the U.K. regulator.  “This is a disgraceful case of a credit union putting the
interests of another organization before those of its members,”
Tracey McDermott, FSA director of enforcement and financial
crime, said in the statement. “The FSA will not tolerate this
conduct.”  The credit union escaped a fine because of the detrimental
impact a financial penalty would have on the firm’s members, the
FSA said. The credit union, which has 1,600 members and a loan
book worth about 5.5 million pounds, replaced its entire
management at the watchdog’s request.  “The previous directors made a number of mistakes in
relation to the granting of loans and the credit union has
suffered financially as a result,” Leslie Laniyan, the new
chairman at the credit union, said in an e-mailed statement.
“We apologize unreservedly to our members for these actions and
thank them for exercising goodwill towards TPCU.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
