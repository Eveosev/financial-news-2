Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, hired  Clare Spottiswoode  as non-
 executive director  for its European unit.  Spottiswoode will join the lender’s London-based RBC Europe
unit on Dec. 1, Royal Bank said in an e-mailed statement.
Spottiswoode has more than 20 years’ experience in the public
sector, energy markets and financial services including her role
as director general of Ofgas, the U.K. gas regulator.  Royal Bank said Sir Andrew Foster, who served as deputy
chairman of RBC Europe since 2003, will retire in November. His
role will be taken over by Jim Pettigrew, who joined the RBC
European board in 2009, the Toronto-based lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
