(Corrects quote in second paragraph.)  Spain ’s Economy Minister Luis de
Guindos said the government will narrow the fiscal deficit by
more than 2.5 percentage points this year, compared with a
targeted 3.1 percentage point reduction.  “The forecasts aren’t written in stone,” he told
lawmakers in Brussels. “Our forecasts for Spain are more
optimistic” than those from international organizations.  “The government has been prudent in its forecasts, and
they are based on conservative assumptions” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
