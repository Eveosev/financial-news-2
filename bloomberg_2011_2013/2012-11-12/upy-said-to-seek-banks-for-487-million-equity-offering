Tupy SA (TUPY4) , the largest foundry in
 Latin America , is seeking investment banks to lead an equity
offering of 1 billion reais ($487 million), three people with
direct knowledge of the matter said.  Tupy, whose initial public offering was in 2002, envisions
the sale for sometime next year as a so-called re-IPO that
boosts trading volume by increasing the number of shares
outstanding, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private.  Investors in Tupy, the world’s largest maker of cast-iron
cylinder blocks,  traded  as few as 100 shares with a total value
of 3,160 reais on Feb. 9 this year, and the average daily value
for 2012 is 483,000 reais ($235,000), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with an average daily trading value
of $9.5 million for  Kurimoto Ltd. (5602) , the Tokyo-based foundry
that’s less than  half the size  of Tupy based on market
capitalization.  Tupy, based in Joinville, Santa Catarina, has a market
value of 2.68 billion reais with a so-called free float of 4
million shares out of the total 56.8 million outstanding, the
 data  show. The shares, which gained 67 percent this year through
Nov. 9, rose 2.5 percent to 47.85 reais at 5:05 p.m. in Sao
Paulo trading.  Because liquidity for the existing shares is so low, the
current share price isn’t considered a benchmark for where the
new offering would be priced, the people said.  Biggest Investors  Previ, the pension fund for employees of government-owned
 Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) , and BNDES Participacoes SA, a unit of the
Brazilian  development bank , are the controlling shareholders of
Tupy, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. They each have
stakes of almost 36 percent.  Tupy has two manufacturing plants. One is in Joinville with
a production capacity of 445,000 metric tons per year and the
other is in Maua, in the greater Sao Paulo area, with capacity
for manufacturing 95,000 metric tons annually, according to the
company’s website. It has 9,000 employees.  Tupy this year completed the acquisition of two metal
processing plants in the Mexican cities of Saltillo and Ramos
Arizpe from Grupo Industrial Saltillo for about $439 million,
the company said in a regulatory filing.  Tupy declined to comment on a proposed stock sale in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
