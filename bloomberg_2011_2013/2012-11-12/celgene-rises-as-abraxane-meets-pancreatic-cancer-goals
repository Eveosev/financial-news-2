Celgene Corp. (CELG) , the fourth-largest
biotechnology company, gained the most in almost three years
after the drugmaker reported its medicine for pancreatic cancer
met goals of a late-stage study.  Celgene rose 8.9 percent to $77.84 at 9:33 a.m. New York
time, after earlier climbing to $78.46 for the biggest intraday
increase since December 2009. The shares of the Summit, New
Jersey-based company had increased 5.8 percent this year through
last week.  The medicine, Abraxane, was shown to help patients with
pancreatic cancer live longer when given with the chemotherapy
drug gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone, Celgene said
in a statement Nov. 9 after markets closed. The results, from
the third and final stage of trials generally required for
marketing clearance, will provide the basis of filing for
approval, the company said.  “Given solid efficacy, acceptable tolerability, and the
dearth of treatment options, our conviction that Abraxane plus
gemcitabine will become the new standard of care in pancreatic
cancer is high,”  Eric Schmidt , an analyst with Cowen & Co.,
wrote in a research note today.  Schmidt estimates Abraxane may draw global sales of $2
billion a year for pancreatic cancer. The disease is diagnosed
in 240,000 to 270,000 new patients each year, and is the fourth-
leading cause of cancer deaths despite lower prevalence compared
with other tumors, he wrote.  Abraxane was approved in the U.S. in 2005 for treatment of
breast cancer after chemotherapy, and cleared in October of this
year for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The drug
generated $385.9 million in 2011 revenue. Celgene acquired it in
its 2010 purchase of Abraxis BioScience Inc. for $2.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
