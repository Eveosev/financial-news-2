Nordic power for the first quarter
of 2013 rose to the highest in more than a week as drier weather
was forecast in the hydropower-dependent region.  Weather forecasts point to a reduced glut of water
supplies. The surplus compared with the seasonal average may
fall by 25 percent to 6.4 terawatt-hours in the next two weeks,
Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg show. The area meets more than
half its power needs by running  water through turbines .  Electricity for delivery from January through March rose as
much as 1.2 percent to 40.80 euros ($51.85) a megawatt-hour on
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo, the highest
since Oct. 31 , and traded at 40.70 euros at 8:53 a.m.  Nordic nuclear reactors, which supply a fifth of the
region’s power use, were producing at 96 percent of their
combined capacity at 7:33 a.m., unchanged from Nov. 9, data from
the operators showed. The Oskarshamn-1 unit, the only reactor
which is not operating, may start on Nov. 19, EON AG said on
Nov. 6 in a filing with the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
