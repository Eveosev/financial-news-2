Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  won an order from the
state-owned Oman Power and Water Procurement Co. to build a
desalination plant in Oman with Malakoff Corp. Berhad of
Malaysia and Cadagua SA of Spain.  The plant, scheduled to start operations in September 2014,
will supply water for daily use equivalent to the amount
consumed by about 800,000 people, the Japanese trading company
said in a  statement  today.  The project is expected to cost as much as 30 billion yen
($377 million) and is planned to be funded by Japanese financial
institutions through  project financing , it said.  Sumitomo and Malakoff, an independent water and power
producer, will each have a 45 percent stake in the project
company, according to the statement. Cadagua will build the
plant with  VA Tech Wabag Ltd. (VATW) , an India-based water engineering
company in which Sumitomo has a stake, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
