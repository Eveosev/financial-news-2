Genel Energy Plc (GENL) , the Iraq-focused
oil company run by former  BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward, increased its interests in fields in Kurdistan and
Somaliland.  Genel will take an extra 49 percent of Miran, leaving it
with 100 percent of the field that holds 10.5 trillion cubic
feet of gas, as repayment for a $294 million loan to  Heritage
Oil Plc (HOIL)  issued in August, the company said in a statement in
London. Separately, it said it will buy a stake in a Somaliland
block.  Hayward is bolstering production in Kurdistan as the region
can now sell its fuel for export following an agreement on
revenue with the central government in  Baghdad . He’s also
expanding outside of Kurdistan with a cash pile of about $1
billion to spend on acquisitions.  Genel said today it will buy a 50 percent interest in the
Odewayne block in Somaliland from  Jacka Resources Ltd. (JKA)  for
$657,000. Genel will become operator of the block and carry the
costs of seismic work and drilling an exploration well.  “Such frontier exploration opportunities, with a very
realistic possibility of finding large volumes of hydrocarbons,
are increasingly rare,” said John Hurst, chief operating
officer for Genel in  Africa . “We look forward to commencing our
exploration program which will lead to spudding of our first
well by mid-2014.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
