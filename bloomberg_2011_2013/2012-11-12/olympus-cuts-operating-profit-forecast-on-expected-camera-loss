Olympus Corp. (7733) , the camera and
endoscope maker that admitted an accounting fraud, rose the most
in three months in Tokyo trading after raising its annual net
income  forecast  following cost cuts and the sale of assets.  Olympus jumped 7.7 percent to 1,340 yen as of 9:45 a.m.
local time, heading for its biggest gain since July 26. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.4 percent.  Net income will be 8 billion yen ($101 million) in the 12
months ending March, up from an earlier forecast of 7 billion
yen, Tokyo-based Olympus said in a statement yesterday. The
company posted first-half profit of 8 billion compared with a
loss of 32.3 billion yen a year earlier.  While the company raised its net income forecast, it
lowered expectations for full-year operating profit to 38
billion yen from a previous forecast of 50 billion yen.  The  stock  has more than doubled in the past year following
a plunge of as much as 81 percent after Olympusâ€™s  board  in
October 2011 fired President Michael Woodford, who had
questioned fees paid by the company for takeovers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
