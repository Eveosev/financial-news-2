Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the largest
wind-turbine maker, hired  Chris Brown  as president of its
Americas unit.  Brown, 52, was most recently chief operating officer for
the city of Detroit, the Aarhus, Denmark-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. He replaces Martha Wyrsch, who
will leave the company next month.  “I look forward to meeting the people behind the company’s
success in the next few weeks and months,” Brown said in the
statement.  Wyrsch began at Vestas in 2009 and “led a team that
increased its installed base of wind turbines in the region by
more than 4.7 gigawatts,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
