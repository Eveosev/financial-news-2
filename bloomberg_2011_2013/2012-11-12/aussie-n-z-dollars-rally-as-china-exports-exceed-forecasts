The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose against their U.S. counterpart after a bigger-than-
estimated trade surplus in  China  improved sentiment for growth
in commodity exports.  The South Pacific currencies rose against all of their
major peers after the Chinese customs administration said the
nation’s  exports  exceeded  imports  by $32 billion in October,
compared with a $27.3 billion trade surplus estimated by
economists survey by Bloomberg. China is Australia’s biggest
trading partner and New Zealand’s second-largest export market.  “Asian economic data remains of particular interest as
markets continue to use the Australian dollar to proxy trade the
region,” Greg Anderson, the North American head of Group of 10
currency strategy at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  in New York, wrote yesterday
in a note to clients. “Recent improvements in Chinese data flow
have helped buoy the Australian dollar.”  Australia ’s currency appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.0428
yesterday in New York after rising as much as 0.5 percent. It
rose 0.4 percent to 82.90 yen.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, increased 0.4
percent to 81.75 U.S. cents after gaining as much as 0.6
percent, the most since Nov. 1. The kiwi climbed 0.4 percent to
64.99 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 4.5 percent this
year, the biggest gain among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie
has gained 1.1 percent, and the greenback is down 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
