Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said a 1 percent inflation goal introduced in February
is still distant, underscoring the central bank’s struggle to
reverse a decade of deflation.  “The bank is committed to continuing with aggressive
monetary easing,” as the price goal is not yet in sight,
Shirakawa said today in a  speech  in  Tokyo . The BOJ will continue
with its policy until 1 percent inflation is in view, he said.  The bank has added to monetary stimulus four times this
year, including the first back-to-back monthly stimulus
expansion -- in September and October -- since 2003. Pressure
remains on it to do more to to boost growth and end deflation as
the nation’s economy shrank the most since last year’s
earthquake in the third quarter and consumer prices excluding
fresh food fell for a fifth month in September.  Two weeks ago the BOJ announced 11 trillion yen ($138
billion) in additional asset purchases, an unlimited new lending
support program, and signed a  joint statement  with the
government on overcoming deflation. The bank  forecast  last month
that prices would rise 0.8 percent in the fiscal year starting
in April 2014.  “CPI may turn positive in fiscal 2014, however, it will
probably very far from the BOJ’s price goal,” said  Hiroaki Muto 
, a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management, in
Tokyo. “The BOJ may need to apply more monetary stimulus at its
December meeting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
