Kansas State claimed the No. 1 spot
in college football’s Bowl Championship Series rankings after
the University of Alabama’s 29-24 home loss to  Texas A&M .  Kansas State (10-0) moved up one place and has a .967
rating out of 1.000 in the standings, which are determined using
the USA Today coaches’ poll, Harris Interactive poll and six
computer rankings.  The University of Oregon (10-0) is second in the BCS with a
.950 rating, followed by  Notre Dame  (10-0) at .940. Reigning
national champion Alabama (9-1), which had been No. 1 in the
first four weeks of the BCS rankings, fell to fourth.    The top two teams in the final BCS standings on Dec. 2 will
play in the national championship game on Jan. 7 in Miami.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
