Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to a 14-
month high as data indicating a pickup in the Chinese economy
brightened the outlook for the island’s exports.  Government
bonds  were little changed.  Retail sales  growth in Asia’s largest economy accelerated
to 14.5 percent in October from 14.2 percent the previous month,
while exports rose 11.6 percent, compared with a 9.9 percent
increase in September, official figures showed on Nov. 9 and
Nov. 10.  China  is Taiwan’s largest export market. Europe’s
finance chiefs will try to reach an agreement on maintaining
Greek solvency at a meeting today.  “The Taiwan dollar is stronger in response to the Chinese
data,” said Suan Teck Kin, an economist at United Overseas Bank
Ltd. in Singapore. “The risk-off sentiment is still around. In
Europe, the situation hasn’t cleared up.”  The  Taiwan dollar  climbed 0.2 percent to NT$29.09 against
the greenback, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency was
0.6 percent up a minute before close of trading and reached
NT$28.959 earlier, the strongest level since Sept. 1, 2011. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, dropped 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage
point, to 4.3 percent.  Taiwan’s central bank has intervened to stem advances in
the currency in the final minutes of trading on most days in the
past five months, according to traders who asked not to be
identified. Central banks intervene in  currency markets  by
arranging purchases or sales of foreign exchange.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras secured support from a
majority of lawmakers for the nation’s 2013 budget, which is
needed to unlock an international bailout.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was 1.124 percent, compared with 1.120 percent on
Nov. 9, according to Gretai Securities Market. The overnight
 interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.387 percent, a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
