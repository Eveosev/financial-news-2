HBOS Plc, a U.K. bank bailed out
amid the 2008 financial crisis, took notice of a warning from a
regulator in 2004 that its pace of expansion was an “accident
waiting to happen,” former Finance Director Mike Ellis said.  Ellis presented the Financial Services Authority’s risk
assessment at a January 2004 board meeting, which said the
“group’s growth outpaced its ability to control risk,” he told
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards today.  HBOS’s assets more than doubled to 681 billion pounds ($1.1
trillion) from 2001 to 2008 as the U.K.’s biggest mortgage
provider increased lending to entrepreneurs and real estate
developers. About 40 percent of the bank’s 117 billion-pound
corporate loan book was allocated to real estate and commercial
property.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which purchased HBOS in
2008, had to seek a 20 billion-pound bailout that gave the
government a 43 percent stake.  “The FSA’s early warning signal” was “taken extremely
seriously and a number of steps were taken to address the points
they raised,” said Ellis, who was finance director of HBOS from
2001 to 2004 and from 2007 to 2008.  The bank’s reliance on wholesale funding markets was also
recognized by the lender as a “potential strategic risk” by
2004, said Ellis.  ‘Achilles Heel’  The gap between deposits and lending got bigger by the time
of his return in 2007, increasing the bank’s dependence on
wholesale funding, said Andrew Turnbull, the panel’s chairman.  “That indeed was the Achilles heel that brought you
down,” said Turnbull. It was identified as a “weakness”
though wasn’t responded to with urgency, he said.  Later in the hearing, Peter Hickman, who was group risk
director from 2007 to 2008, said the lender’s loan-to-deposit
ratio and its property investments meant “stories were more
likely to be believed by the market” about HBOS’s financial
weakness, allowing short-sellers to profit.  A sharp drop in the bank’s share price in March 2008
“certainly had all the hallmarks of a deliberate attempt to
undermine the share price, presumably to make money from the
sharp movement down,” he said. “They could have threatened the
bank’s existence.”  HBOS fell 32 percent in the three weeks to March 19, 2008.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Edward Evans  To contact the reporter on this story:
