Natural gas will overtake oil as the
most-used fuel in the U.S. by 2030 as the country’s supplies
balloon, the International Energy Agency said.  So-called unconventional gas, extracted from sources
including shale rock and coal beds, will account for almost half
of the increase in global output of the fuel by 2035, the Paris-
based adviser to 28 industrialized nations said today in its
World Energy Outlook. U.S. production will rise 23 percent and
supply most of the growth along with China and  Australia .  A boom in supplies of natural gas trapped in shale has
reduced prices to a 10-year low of $1.902 a million cubic meters
in April on the New York Mercantile Exchange. U.S. producers
including  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  have proposed liquefied natural
gas export terminals to meet demand in Asia.  “The place that’s going to be cheapest for gas exports is
the U.S. and  Canada ,” Thierry Bros, an analyst at Societe
Generale SA in Paris, said today by phone.  The U.S. will begin exporting around 2018, Fatih Birol, the
IEA’s chief economist, said today at a press conference in
London. Its external shipments will reach 19 billion cubic
meters in 2020, compared with imports in 2010 of 76 billion
cubic meters, the agency estimated in the report. North American
exports will be 35 billion cubic meters, it said.  U.S. production will rise to 800 billion cubic meters in
2035 from an estimated 650 billion this year, the IEA said.  “The U.S. Department of Energy is waiting to review the
results of a price impact study before dealing with the pending
export applications,” the IEA said.  U.S. Exports  The agency assumes 93 percent of the U.S. gas remains
available to meet domestic demand, with prices reaching $5.50
per million British thermal units by 2020. Front-month gas was
at $3.52 per million Btu in New York today.  Diversifying sources of supply, can “accelerate movement
toward more diversified trade flows, putting pressure on
conventional gas suppliers and on traditional oil-linked pricing
mechanisms for gas,” the IEA said.  Asia will ultimately seek lower prices for LNG, which is
currently linked to oil in some sales contracts, and that
pressure will be felt by the end of the decade, the IEA said.  The margin achievable by U.S. exporters to  Japan  in 2020
will shrink to $4.30 per million Btu, from $6.10 per million Btu
in 2011, according to the report.  Global gas consumption may rise 19 percent by 2017 from
2010 levels as demand surges in Asia and the U.S. while  Europe ’s
usage drops 1.6 percent, the agency said in June. China’s gas
consumption will more than quadruple from last year’s level by
2035, boosted by regulatory reforms and policy support, the IEA
said. Demand will also rise in  India  and the Middle East while
growth in Japan is limited by higher prices and a focus on
renewable sources and energy efficiency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
