Soybeans fell for a fourth session
in  Chicago  to the lowest price since June after the U.S.
government raised estimates for global ending stockpiles on
higher yields in the country than forecast last month.  World stocks will be 60 million metric tons before the 2013
Northern Hemisphere harvest, 4.3 percent more than forecast in
October on a bigger-than-expected U.S. crop, the nation’s
Department of Agriculture said Nov. 9. That beat the average
57.5 million-ton analyst prediction in a Bloomberg survey.  “In soybeans the numbers surprised the most, with a yield
estimate above traders’ expectations,” Paris-based farm adviser
Agritel wrote in a market comment. “In this context ending
stocks are increased, both in the U.S. and the world.”  Soybeans for delivery in January declined 1.8 percent to
$14.255 a bushel by 2:40 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The oilseed reached $14.2125, the lowest level for a
most-active contract since June 29, after climbing to a record
$17.89 in September on concern the worst U.S. drought in half a
century would shrink global supply.  The USDA raised its yield forecast for the country by 4
percent to 39.3 bushels an acre, adding about 3 million tons to
national production.  “Risks of critically tight soybean inventories continue to
fade quickly,” Damien Courvalin, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., said in a report dated Nov. 9. He cut the bank’s
three-month price forecast to $16.50 a bushel from $18.75.  Corn for delivery in March was unchanged at $7.42 a bushel
and wheat for delivery in December slid 1 percent to $8.775 a
bushel. Milling wheat for delivery in January traded on NYSE
Liffe in Paris fell 0.8 percent to 274.75 euros ($349.54) a ton.  The USDA unexpectedly increased its estimate for global
wheat inventories to 174.2 million tons from 173 million tons
while paring its outlook for demand by 3 million tons on reduced
feed use. Analysts had predicted stockpiles of the grain would
slip to 171.5 million tons, according to the average estimate in
a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
