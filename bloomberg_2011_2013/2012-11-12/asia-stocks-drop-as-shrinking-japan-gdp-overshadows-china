Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index headed for its lowest close in a month, after
 Japan ’s economy shrank at the fastest pace since last year’s
earthquake, outweighing an acceleration in  China ’s exports.  Yokohama Rubber Co. sank 6.3 percent after posting earnings
that missed estimates and as rubber prices fell to a two-month
low after the Japan GDP report.  QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  sank
8.3 percent, the most in 11 months, after  Australia ’s No. 1
insurer by market value said claims from U.S. super storm Sandy
will dent full-year profit. Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of
clothes and toys to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., climbed 1.1 percent as
China’s exports grew at the fastest rate since May.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  lost 0.4 percent to 120.82 as
of 7:14 p.m. in  Tokyo . About two shares fell for each that rose.
The gauge gained 11 percent through the end of last week from
this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added stimulus to
spur growth and data showed a slowdown in China may be
bottoming.  “I don’t think anyone’s relying on a massive pickup in
Japanese growth to drive things,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing
director at Sydney-based White Funds Management, which oversees
more than $350 million. “If the data continues to deteriorate,
it becomes another problem area and it will come on to
investors’ radar screens.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific gauge traded at 13.3 times estimated
earnings as of Nov. 9,  compared  with 13.3 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Another Recession?  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 0.9 percent as a
report showed  gross domestic product  shrank an annualized 3.5
percent in the three months through September. The median of 23
analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 3.4
percent contraction. Economists are expecting a second straight
quarter of contraction through December, meeting the technical
definition of a recession.  Yokohama Rubber lost 6.3 percent to 518 yen., the biggest
drop on the Nikkei 225. The company indicated third-quarter
operating profit of 6.4 billion yen, less than 10.1 billion yen
estimates by three analysts. Citigroup Inc. cited the quarterly
results as “weak,” saying that profits probably hurt by lower
shipments and higher production costs.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  slid 0.3 percent and South
Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.2 percent. Taiwan’s  Taiex Index 
slipped 0.4 percent and  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index was
little changed.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.2 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite climbed 0.5 percent, with Li & Fung advancing
1.1 percent to HK$12.52. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. led
carmakers higher in Hong Kong, gaining 3.3 percent to HK$3.72
after Chinese passenger-vehicle sales increased in October.  Lower Volume  Equity-trading volume was lower than average. The value of
shares traded on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
was the lowest since Aug. 27. Volume on the Hang Seng Index was
41 percent below the 30-day average for the time of day.  China’s overseas shipments increased 11.6 percent from a
year earlier, the Beijing-based customs administration said in a
statement today. That compared with the 10 percent estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Imports rose 2.4 percent,
level with the month before. The trade surplus widened to $32
billion, the biggest in almost four years.  New  yuan  loans in China fell 14 percent in October from a
year earlier, Beijing-based People’s Bank of China said on its
website today.  Futures on the S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent after slipping as
much as 0.2 percent earlier today. The gauge posted its biggest
weekly decline since June last week as President  Barack Obama ’s
re-election set up a budget showdown with Republican lawmakers.  Lynas Fundraising  Lynas Corp. (LYC) , builder of the world’s biggest rare-earth
refinery in  Malaysia , fell 11 percent to 72 Australian cents in
Sydney after selling A$150 million ($156 million) of new shares.  QBE retreated 8.3 percent to A$11.80, the biggest drop
since January. The insurer said its profit margin will drop to
around 8 percent this year, down from an August forecast for
better than 12 percent. Losses from Sandy total $350 million to
$450 million, QBE said in a statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
