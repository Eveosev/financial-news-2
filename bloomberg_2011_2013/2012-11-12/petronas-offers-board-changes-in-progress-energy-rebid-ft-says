Petroliam Nasional Bhd. offered to
appoint more independent directors to  Progress Energy Resources
Corp. (PRQ) ’s board to help win Canadian approval for its takeover,
the Financial Times said, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Shamsul Azhar Abbas.  The CEO of the Malaysian state-owned energy company known
as Petronas also stressed its arms length operations from the
government in the Southeast Asian nation, telling the newspaper
it behaves as a publicly traded company.  Canada rejected Petronas’s C$5.2 billion ($5.2 billion)
takeover of Calgary-based  Progress Energy  on Oct. 19, saying the
proposal wasn’t in the nation’s national interest. Petronas
intends to continue pursuing approval for the proposed
transaction and extended the deadline to complete the deal by 30
days, the company said in a statement Oct. 29.  Petronas is seeking to convince Canadian authorities of its
operational independence with Shamsul saying that the firm
operates like a publicly-listed company in terms of corporate
governance and transparency, according to Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
