Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K.’s
second-largest homebuilder by volume, met its target for home
completions through 2012, led by private sales of residential
real estate.  The order book stands at 1.11 billion pounds ($1.7 billion)
of homes for the 19 weeks through Nov. 12 compared with 1.02
billion pounds compared with a year earlier, the London-based
company said in a statement today.  “We continue to take a cautious approach, given the
uncertainty in the wider economy, conditions within the U.K.
housing market remain stable,” the homebuilder said.  The U.K.’s fragile recovery from a double-dip recession and
low credit availability has curbed demand for homes.  House
prices  fell for a fourth month in October as the economy’s
weakness hurt demand in the  property market , Halifax said Nov.
6. Prices may fall as much as 2 percent next year as values in
every part of the country drop for the first time since the
financial crisis, Knight Frank LLP said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
