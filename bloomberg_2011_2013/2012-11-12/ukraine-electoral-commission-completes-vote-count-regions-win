Ukraine’s central electoral
commission completed counting ballots for parliament elections,
who weeks after the ruling Party of Regions of President  Viktor Yanukovych  claimed victory.  The Party of Regions got 30 percent of votes in party
lists, with 100 percent of votes counted, according to its
website. Opposition parties, united under jailed former Prime
Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko and led by Arseniy Yatsenyuk, got
25.54 percent.  The commission counted 100 percent of ballots in 220
single-seat constituencies, while Parliament decided last week
to hold a repeated vote in five single-seat constituencies on
fraud concerns. Half of Ukraine’s 450-member legislature is
elected as single-seat candidates.  The Party of Regions won 113 parliament seats in single-
seat constituencies and Tymoshenko’s Batkivschyna got 39 seats.  The leader of Batkivschyna, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, world boxing
champion Vitali Klitschko’s UDAR and the right-wing Svoboda
party have pledged to join forces in the next Parliament. UDAR
had 13.96 percent on party lists and six single-seat winners,
while Svoboda had 10.44 percent and 12 single seats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
