The white powder that caused the
evacuation of the U.S. embassy in  Sweden  on Oct. 17 was not
toxic, TT reported today, citing Security Police spokeswoman
Sirpa Franzen.  The U.S. mission in  Stockholm  was temporarily evacuated
after white powder leaked from a letter sent to the embassy.
Initial test showed the substance was toxic. However, the powder
proved to be harmless after further analysis and the sender
didnâ€™t intend for it to seem dangerous, Franzen told the news
wire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
