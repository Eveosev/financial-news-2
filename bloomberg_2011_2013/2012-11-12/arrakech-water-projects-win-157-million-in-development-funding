Marrakech, one of the most popular
tourist sites in  Morocco , won $157 million of loans from the
African Development Bank’s board to help finance water and
sanitation improvements.  The two loans receiving approval are meant for projects to
meet water demands of residents and tourists as well as ensure
potable water for 3 million people and the needs of Morocco’s
phosphate industry, the AfDB said in a statement. It said the
French development agency AFD will contribute to the funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
