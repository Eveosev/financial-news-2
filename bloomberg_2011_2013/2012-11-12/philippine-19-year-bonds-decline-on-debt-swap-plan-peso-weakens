Philippine 19-year bonds advanced
for a seventh day, reversing an earlier decline, after the
government said it may delay a planned debt swap. The peso fell.  The government may offer new notes in exchange for less-
frequently traded securities in January instead of December,
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola told reporters today.
Typically, debt exchanges involve offering longer-dated bonds
for shorter-tenor notes.  “With the swap probably moved to January, prospects of
additional supply of long-dated bonds are taken out for now,”
said Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice president at Chinatrust
 Philippines  Commercial Bank Corp. in Manila.  The yield on the 8 percent notes due July 2031 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.58 percent at the
close in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services. The
rate was up one basis point before Mendiola’s comments.  The Philippines will offer $500 million of dollar-
denominated securities due 2023 in the local market this month
to take advantage of onshore demand, Treasurer Rosalia de Leon
said today. The government may lend the funds to the Power
Sector Assets & Liabilities Management Corp., she said.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 41.08 per dollar, data
from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. One-month implied volatility,
which measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
