Japanese  stock futures  were little
changed as European governments gave Greece two extra years to
cut its  budget deficit . Australian equities fell.  Shares of  Hitachi Cable Ltd. (5812)  may move as the Nikkei
reported that the electronic-equipment manufacturer may merge
with Hitachi Metals Ltd.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  shares may move as the
camera and endoscope maker that admitted an accounting fraud cut
its operating profit forecast by 24 percent.  Futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring next month

bay,” said Stan Shamu, Melbourne-based market strategist at IG

and commodities. “There are no fresh catalysts to sway
investors significantly in either direction.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped less
than 0.1 percent changed today. The  S&P 500  closed yesterday
little changed, with fewer than 292 million shares of New York

canceled trading and closing auctions in 216 securities after an
outage in a computer that matches orders and processes
transactions.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index gained 11 percent through
yesterday from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks added
stimulus to spur growth and data showed a slowdown in China may
be bottoming. The gauge traded at 13.2 times estimated earnings
as of Nov. 9,  compared  with 13.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Deadline Extended  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in New York was little changed at 92.78
yesterday.  European Finance ministers granted  Greece  until 2016 to cut
the deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product while putting
off until next week a decision on how to cover additional Greek
funding needs of as much as 32.6 billion euros ($41 billion).  In the latest compromise in three years of crisis fighting,
creditors led by  Germany  opted to keep money flowing to Greece
instead of risking a default that could lead to a Greek exit
from the euro and stir more turmoil for countries left in it.  Euro-area finance ministers will meet again Nov. 20 to
discuss Greece, Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Jean- Claude
Juncker, who heads the group of euro-area finance ministers,
told reporters in Brussels.  “Together with the review of the Greek adjustment program
the eurogroup will further discuss financing needs and debt
sustainability at an extraordinary meeting that will be convened
on 20 November,” the ministers said in a statement, read out by
Juncker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
