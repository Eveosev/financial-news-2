Canadian crude oils rose in light
trading as holidays recognizing military service were observed
on both sides of the border.  Western  Canada  Select, a blend of heavy oils produced
primarily from oil sands, rose 90 cents to a discount of $26 a
barrel to the U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, as
of 1:30 p.m. New York time, according to  Net Energy Inc ., a
physical oil broker based in Calgary.  Syncrude, an upgraded light oil produced from the oil
sands, rose 50 cents to trade at a discount of $5.25 a barrel
against WTI.  Trading was lighter than normal because of observations of
Veteran’s Day in the U.S. and Remembrance Day in Canada, Net
Energy said.  Light  Louisiana  Sweet’s premium to WTI gained 95 cents to
$22.20 a barrel at 1:35 p.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bonito Sour, from fields off the coast of
Louisiana, gained $1.75 to a $19 premium.  Bakken crude delivered in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , increased
$1.25 to a $6.75 discount over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
