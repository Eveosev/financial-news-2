Egypt’s talks with the  International
Monetary Fund  for a $4.8 billion loan should be frozen because
the negotiations are secretive and lack popular support,
according to a letter released by 17 political parties, civil
organizations and labor groups.  The loan negotiations process has “lacked transparency”
from the government and IMF, talks continue in the absence of a
parliament and public consultations have been “inaccessible,”
according to the letter from the Popular Campaign to Drop
Egypt’s Debt, an umbrella group, and addressed to Prime Minster
Hisham Qandil and IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde .  An IMF mission is in Cairo to discuss the country’s
economic and social program, as the government seeks help to
bridge the  budget deficit  and to win support from other lenders
and donor nations. The 17 groups are scheduled to hold a protest
today to underline their message.  “With little transparency and no clear economic program,
the potential loan agreement continues to lack the ‘critical
mass’ of support that the IMF requires as a necessary condition
for financial assistance,” the letter said.  Among the signatories are three political parties
affiliated with former presidential candidates, and a party set
up by Muslim Brotherhood’s youth wing. The April 6th Movement,
which took a leading role during last year’s revolution, has
signed the letter, as well as unions active in  Egypt ’s labor
movement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
