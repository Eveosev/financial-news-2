Retail chains in the  Czech Republic 
including Koninklijke Ahold NV will probably reduce their profit
margins rather than increase prices after value-added tax
increases by one percentage point next year,  Hospodarske Noviny 
reported, citing company spokesmen.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  hasnâ€™t yet decided whether it will raise prices
or absorb the cost, the newspaper said, citing company spokesman
Jan William Dvorak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
