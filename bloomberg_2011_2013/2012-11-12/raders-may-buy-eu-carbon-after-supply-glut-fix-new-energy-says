Traders may buy carbon permits
tomorrow after the European Commission proposed to temporarily
delay the sale of 900 million metric tons of allowances in the
three years through 2015, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “There could some speculative buying in the morning
in response to this,” Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst for
Bloomberg New Energy Finance in  London , said today in an e-mail.
“The bullishness is however likely to be short-lived due to
rising market supply.”  There is 12.7 million tons of auctioning supply arriving in
the four days through Nov. 16, which “could start to weigh down
on prices later tomorrow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
