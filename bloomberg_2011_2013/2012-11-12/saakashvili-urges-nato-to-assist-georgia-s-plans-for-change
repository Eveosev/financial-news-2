President Mikheil Saakashvili urged
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to help ensure that his
country’s reform plans continue, more than a month after his
ruling party was defeated by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s
political coalition.  “My country is more ready than ever to fulfill its
membership obligations,” Saakashvili told members of the NATO
Parliamentary Assembly today at its 58th annual Plenary Session
in  Prague , according to an e-mailed statement from his office.  Saakashvili met Secretary General Anders Fog Rasmussen
today after the alliance’s leader earlier expressed concern
about trials that have taken place in  Georgia  since the Oct. 1
legislative elections. Prime Minister Ivanishvili is set to meet
Rasmussen this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
