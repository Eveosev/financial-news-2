Greece  beat its deficit target in
the first 10 months of 2012 as spending fell 13.2 percent and
revenue rose.  The budget gap, which excludes outlays by state-controlled
enterprises, narrowed by 42 percent to 12.3 billion euros ($15.7
billion) from 21.1 billion euros in the same period a year
earlier, preliminary figures from the Athens-based  Finance
Ministry  showed today. The government target was 13.6 billion
euros. The primary deficit, which excludes debt-service costs,
was 1.2 billion euros versus a goal of 2.4 billion euros.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras earlier today won
parliamentary approval for a 2013 budget that aims to unlock
bailout funds and avert a financial collapse that could drive
the country from the euro.  Net revenue rose 1.4 percent to 41.7 billion euros in the
January to October period, exceeding a target of 41.5 billion
euros, the ministry said. Spending fell to 54 billion euros from
62.2 billion versus a target of 55.1 billion euros. Greece has
revised spending and revenue estimates for the whole of 2012 to
align them with targets included in the 2013 budget, according
to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
