The U.K. pound may extend declines
to a 10-week low against the dollar should it drop through its
200-day moving average, Credit Suisse Group AG said, citing
trading patterns.  Sterling has “broken to a fresh lower low, and is now set
to test the 78.6 percent retracement” of its advance from Aug.
28 to Sept. 21, according to technical strategist Cilline Bain
in  London , referring Fibonacci analysis.  “We continue to be bearish” on the pound versus the
dollar, Bain said. “It continues to trade in a steady
downtrend. The market is probably going to have a look at that
200-day moving average in the next 48 hours.”  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5880 at 12:34 p.m. London
time after sliding to $1.5870, the weakest level since Sept. 5.
The 200-day moving average was at $1.5851. The last time
sterling traded at $1.5772 or lower was on Aug. 30.  Britain’s currency may first weaken to a “support
cluster” around its 200-day average between $1.5873 and $1.5851
and if that fails to hold it will extend its drop to trend-line
support at $1.5772, according to Credit Suisse.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Support refers to an area where buy orders maybe clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a security, currency
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
