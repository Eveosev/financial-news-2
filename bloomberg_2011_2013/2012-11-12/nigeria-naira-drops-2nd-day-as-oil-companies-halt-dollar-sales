Nigeria ’s naira fell for a second
day as  oil companies  were said to refrain from selling dollars
in the market.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer slipped 0.1
percent to 157.6 a dollar by 12:18 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital. The naira has increased 3 percent this year, the
second-best performer in Africa, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Expected dollar sales from the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp. “haven’t come through,” Jide Solanke, an analyst at
First Securities Discount House Ltd., said by phone from Lagos
today. “The central bank hasn’t been selling much.”  Oil-producing companies, which sell dollars to meet
domestic expenses, are the second-biggest source of foreign
currency after the central bank, which sells dollars on Mondays
and Wednesdays to keep the naira within a 3 percent band around
155 per dollar.  The Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold  $79.9 million 
at its two scheduled auctions last week, the lowest since
December 2009, according to data on the bank’s website.  The yield on the 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022
fell one basis point to 12.65 percent, according to Nov. 9
prices compiled by the Lagos-based Financial Markets Dealers
Association. Borrowing costs on the nation’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due January 2021 retreated three basis points to 4.4
percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was little changed at 1.8795 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
