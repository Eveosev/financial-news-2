Michael Clarke  hit a double-century
and  Ed Cowan  scored his first Test hundred to lift  Australia  37
runs ahead of  South Africa  going into the final day of their
series-opening cricket match in Brisbane.  Clarke was unbeaten on 218 with Mike Hussey 86 not out as
Australia ended day four on 487-4 in reply to top-ranked South
Africa’s first-innings 450. It was the third time Australia
captain Clarke scored 200 runs or more in 2012.  Clarke and Cowan’s 259-run partnership for the fourth
wicket rallied the Australians from 40-3 and made the draw the
favored result with one day left, according to bookmakers. The
match is the first of three between the teams that will decide
the No. 1 Test ranking.  Cowan, whose highest score in 12 previous Test innings was
74, made 136 before he was run out shortly before the tea
interval when bowler  Dale Steyn  finger-tipped a drive from
Clarke onto the stumps with the opener out of his crease. Steyn
earlier failed to take a catch off a Cowan top edge in the
outfield when he was distracted by the nearby Jacques Rudolph.  Cowan was the only batsman to get out today as Hussey then
combined with his captain for an unbeaten 188-run partnership
until stumps. The home team had begun the day’s play at 111-3.  Clarke’s 350-ball knock featured 22 boundaries as he and
Hussey pushed Australia’s run rate to more than four an over.
The innings also made him the first batsman to reach 1,000 Tests
runs in 2012.  South Africa would retain the No. 1 spot in the
 International Cricket Council ’s Test rankings by avoiding defeat
in the best-of-three contest. Australia, which is unbeaten at
the Gabba in Test matches since 1988, can overtake the Proteas
atop the rankings with a series victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
