Soybeans fell, extending a slump to
a four-month low, on signs of increasing supplies in the U.S.
Midwest and South America. Corn dropped to the cheapest in six
weeks.  World soybean  inventories  will be 60 million metric tons on
Oct. 1, 4.3 percent more than forecast in October, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said on Nov. 9. The U.S.  harvest  will
be 2.97 billion bushels, up 3.9 percent.  Rain  in northern  Brazil 
will aid crop development, while drier weather accelerates
planting in  Argentina ,  World Weather Inc.  said in a report
today.  “There is a growing consensus that supplies are more
plentiful, which will slow buying from end-users,” Greg Grow,
the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Generally favorable
weather in South America is keeping pressure on the markets.”  Soybean futures for January delivery tumbled 3.2 percent to
close at $14.05 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $14.02, the lowest for a most-
active contract since June 29. The oilseed, used to make animal
feed and cooking oil, is 21 percent below the record $17.89 set
on Sept. 4.  Corn futures for March delivery declined 2.7 percent to
$7.2225 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $7.1625, the lowest
since Sept. 28. The grain has fallen 15 percent from the Aug. 10
record at $8.49.  Prices also fell as speculators reduced bets on a rally as
supply concerns eased, Grow said.  In the week ended Nov. 6, hedge funds reduced  bets  on
higher soybean prices by 5.5 percent to 164,528 futures and
options from a week earlier, the lowest in almost eight months,
government data showed on Nov. 9. Net-long positions in corn
have slumped 31 percent from a 16-month high on Aug. 21.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
