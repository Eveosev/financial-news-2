Ziff Davis Inc., the 85-year-old
publishing company that chronicled the rise of the computing
industry, will be sold to Internet-services provider  J2 Global
Inc. (JCOM)  for $167 million.  The cash deal gives J2 Global PCMag.com and other online
sites, including Toolbox.com and Geek.com that reach more than
50 million people, the company said in a statement.  Ziff Davis, which used to own broadcast television stations
and more recently was known for its technology-focused titles,
has expanded online as print publishers face declines in
advertising sales. Closely held Ziff Davis is based in New York.  J2 Global, based in Los Angeles, provides Internet-related
corporate services, including e-mail, phone, fax and online
marketing to small businesses. The company, which reported $93.3
million in sales in the most recent quarter, said the deal will
increase earnings immediately and contribute about $60 million
to 2013 revenue.  J2 Global gained 2.8 percent to $30.18 at the close in New
York. The shares have risen 7.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
