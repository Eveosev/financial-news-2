Lebanese President Michel Suleiman
ordered the arrest of those responsible for the clash between
Sunni and Shiite Muslim gunmen in the southern city of Sidon
that left three people dead.  Suleiman warned against the “dangers of sliding toward
internal conflict,” the official National News Agency said
today. His comments came a day after the clashes that pitted
followers of hardline Sunni cleric Sheik Ahmad al-Assir against
members of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah.  The fighting erupted after Hezbollah fighters put up
banners on the occasion of Ashura, which marks the death 14
centuries ago of a Muslim leader, Imam Hussein, the prophet
Muhammad’s grandson, in Sidon. The dead included two of al-
Assir’s bodyguards and an Egyptian man, according to NNA. It
said a Hezbollah official was among two men injured in the
violence.  Earlier this year, al-Assir and his supporters set up tents
in Sidon as part of a sit-in that lasted more than a month to
protest against Hezbollah’s weapons arsenal. The Iranian-backed
group has declined to disband following the end of Lebanon’s
1975-1990 civil war, saying it needs its arms to defend against
Israeli attacks.  Tensions between Sunnis and Shiites in Lebanon have been on
the rise since the start of the uprising against Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. Sectarian clashes
have erupted in the northern city of Tripoli and in the capital
 Beirut . Most Sunnis back the rebels fighting Assad, while
Shiites tend to support the president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
