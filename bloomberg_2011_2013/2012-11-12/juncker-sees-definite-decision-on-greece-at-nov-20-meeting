Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker, who heads group of euro-area finance
ministers, said he expects a definite decision on  Greece  at the
finance chiefs’ meeting on Nov. 20.  “Greece has done a big part of what it was supposed to do,
adopted an ambitious reform program and a budget for 2013 that
is impressive,” Juncker told reporters in Brussels today. “A
few more things have to be checked, because not everything that
was promised to be done, has been done. But these are more minor
things that can be tackled administratively and not legally. I
expect that we’ll be able to take a definite decision about the
disbursement of the next tranche at the Nov. 20 meeting.”  Juncker said he also expects a final decision on an
extension of Greece’s deadlines at the meeting.  “We started today to discuss different options that could
be considered,” Juncker said following a meeting of the finance
ministers. “It makes no sense now to pick one or the other.
What seems clear to me is that the public sector, meaning states
themselves, won’t be called on to do this, but all the other
options and possibilities remain open and that’s what we started
to discuss today. And we’ll finish discussing this Nov. 20.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
