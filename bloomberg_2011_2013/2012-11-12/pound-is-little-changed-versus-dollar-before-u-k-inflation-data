U.K.  government bonds  rose before
the  Bank of England ’s latest growth and inflation projections
this week amid speculation the report will provide room for
further asset purchases to boost growth.  Ten-year gilt yields fell for a second day before European
finance chiefs meet to discuss a program to maintain Greek
solvency. The pound reached a two-month low against the dollar
as investors await the Bank of England’s quarterly report, due
on Nov. 14. The central bank refrained from adding more stimulus
at its most recent policy meeting, minutes from which are due
next week.  “Despite the Bank of England’s pause, we think another
round of quantitative easing can’t be ruled out especially if
the economic outlook deteriorates,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “That possibility and the renewed concern about
 Greece  will underpin high-quality government bonds including
U.K. gilts.”  The 10-year yield fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.72 percent at 10.38 a.m. London time. The 1.75
percent bond due September 2022 rose 0.13, or 1.30 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,591) face amount, to 100.27. Two-year yields
slid one basis point, to 0.24 percent.  Gains may be limited before a report tomorrow that will
show  consumer prices  rose 2.4 percent in October from the year
before, according to the median estimate of 36 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Retail prices  also climbed 0.2 percent,
according to another survey.  Pound-Dollar  The pound was little changed at $1.5904 after touching
$1.5880, the weakest since level since Sept. 5. Sterling was at
79.94 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency has gained 1.2 percent this year
