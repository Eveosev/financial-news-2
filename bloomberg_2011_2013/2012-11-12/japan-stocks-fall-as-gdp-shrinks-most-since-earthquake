Japanese  shares  declined, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average capping its longest losing streak in
four months, after the gross domestic product contracted in the
third quarter by the most since last year’s earthquake.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest consumer-electronics exporter,
fell 2.6 percent after being cut to the lowest investment grade
at Moody’s Investors Service.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
gets almost a third of its sales in  Europe , slid 1.3 percent
before the region’s finance ministers meet to discuss Greece’s
bailout. Yokohama Rubber Co. led tiremakers lower after posting
quarterly earnings that missed analysts’ estimates and as rubber
prices fell to a two-month low.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent to 8,676.44 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , declining for a sixth day. Volume on the gauge
was about 30 percent below the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX) 
Index lost 1.1 percent to 722.58, with more than four shares
dropping for each that gained.  “As Japan’s GDP shows, the economy earlier had relatively
positive growth but it’s running out of breath,” said Goya
Nakao, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa
Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($63
billion). “Manufacturers relying on overseas demand are
stagnating. They’re being propped up by domestic support but
this can’t sustain them.”  The Topix has risen 0.5 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started a global wave of stimulus to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank of Japan 
following suit. Shares on the equity gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  GDP Shrinks  Japan’s economy shrank an annualized 3.5 percent in the
three months through September as exports tumbled and  consumer
spending  slumped, the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo.
Economists had estimated a 3.4 percent contraction. GDP will
probably shrink 0.4 percent this quarter, according to
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . That would be the third
technical recession since 2008.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.2 percent today. The gauge
added 0.2 percent on Nov. 9 after data showed  consumer
confidence  climbed to a five-year high, outweighing concern
about a looming budget showdown.  European finance ministers from the 17-member currency
union will meet today in Brussels following an agreement by
Greek lawmakers to make cuts in pensions and benefits. While the
ministers are unlikely to finalize an updated aid package for
Greece, a European official said Nov. 9 that they’ll find a way
to overcome a gap in the country’s financing this week.  “Investors are moving to a risk-off stance because they’re
cautious about the situation in Europe,” Sompo Japan Nipponkoa
Asset’s Nakao said.  Euro Weakens  Exporters to Europe fell after the euro depreciated to as
low as 100.93 yen today in Tokyo, compared with 101.62 at the
close of  stock trading  Nov. 9. A stronger yen cuts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Canon lost 1.3 percent to 2,453 yen. Nintendo Co., a video-
game console maker that gets a third of its revenue from Europe,
sank 3.3 percent to 9,500 yen.  China central bank Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  yesterday
highlighted the effects of what he termed five years of crisis,
adding to officials’ cautions on the economic outlook even after
export growth rebounded in October. The nation’s trade surplus
swelled to $32 billion, the highest in almost four years, data
showed on Nov. 10.  Sony slipped 2.6 percent to 856 yen after its  credit rating 
was cut one level to Baa3 from Baa2 at Moody’s, which cited
falling demand for its televisions and cameras. The ratings
company also assigned the exporter a negative outlook.  Tiremakers declined the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups after rubber for delivery in April lost as much as 1.9
percent on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange today, the lowest level
since Sept. 14.  Yokohama Rubber  Yokohama Rubber plunged 6.3 percent to 518 yen, the biggest
decline on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , after reporting third-quarter
operating profit of 6.4 billion yen, less than the 10.1 billion-
yen analyst estimate. Citigroup Inc. called the results
“weak,” saying profit was hurt by falling orders and higher
production costs. Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. sank 3.5
percent to 838 yen.  Among stocks that rose, Suzuki Motor Corp. climbed 4.5
percent to 1,835 yen after first-half net income rose 31 percent
to 41.9 billion yen, beating its forecast for a 20 percent gain
on growing domestic auto sales. The company gained the most on
the Nikkei 225, followed by  Bank of Yokohama Ltd. (8332)   Bank of Yokohama  jumped 4.4 percent to 378 yen after saying
it will spend as much as 10 billion yen to buy back up to 2.22
percent of its outstanding shares. The lender also raised its
net-income forecast 1.8 percent to 56 billion yen for the year
ending March 31, reflecting a change in accounting methods for
fixed-asset depreciation.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  sank 6.9 percent
to 17.96, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.1 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
