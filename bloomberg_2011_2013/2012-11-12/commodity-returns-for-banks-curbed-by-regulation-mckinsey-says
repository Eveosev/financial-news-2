Commodities will become less
profitable for banks because of tightening global regulation of
 capital markets , according to McKinsey & Co.  Return on equity in commodities is projected to drop to 8
percent from 20 percent, McKinsey said in its annual review of
the banking industry last month.  “More complex and burdensome” rules will have a
“significant” impact on banks, making it harder to raise
capital and to support growth in lending, according to the e-
mailed report. “Regulation will fundamentally deteriorate
economics of capital markets products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
