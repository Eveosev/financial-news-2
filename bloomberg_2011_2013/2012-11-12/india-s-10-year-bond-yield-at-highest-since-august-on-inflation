India ’s bonds gained, lowering the
10-year yield from the highest level since August, as an
unexpected drop in factory output spurred bets the central bank
will loosen policy to support growth.  Industrial production  decreased 0.4 percent in September
from a year earlier, compared with a 2.8 percent gain predicted
in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The benchmark  wholesale-
price inflation index  rose 7.9 percent in October from a year
earlier, the most in 2012, according to the median of 28
estimates in a separate survey before data due Nov. 14. Indian
markets will be shut the next two days for holidays.  “It was an ugly print and is likely to raise expectations
of earlier action by the  Reserve Bank  of India, especially if
accompanied by weaker inflation,” said  Anubhuti Sahay , an
economist at  Standard Chartered  Plc in Mumbai. “However, it is
important to remember industrial production data have been
erratic in the past. We will focus on the wholesale-price
inflation number.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 8.21 percent as of 12:15 p.m. in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate touched 8.22 percent
earlier, the highest level since Aug. 31.  The  Reserve Bank of India  has kept its repurchase rate at 8
percent since April, citing price pressures. The monetary
authority raised its inflation forecast for March 2013 to 7.5
percent last month from an earlier estimate of 7 percent.
Standard Chartered predicts the central bank will cut  interest
rates  in the first quarter of 2013 to support growth.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.77 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
