Iran ’s alleged meddling in the
regional internal affairs is a concern to the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council, Secretary-General Abdul Latif Bin Rashid Al
Zayani told reporters in Dubai today.  “That’s always an issue that’s always considered and
discussed,” Al Zayani said. “You know because that
interference continues and it’s of concern to all. We don’t
interfere in any others’ internal affairs and we don’t expect
others to” interfere in ours.  Saudi Arabia  and  Bahrain  have accused Iran of fomenting
protests by Shiites in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia’s eastern
province. Iran denies the allegation and accuses Sunni rulers in
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain of discriminating against Shiites. Al
Zayani said the council will discuss the Iranian interference at
its next meeting in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
