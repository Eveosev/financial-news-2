Madison Square Garden will host the
2014 East Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association men’s basketball tournament, the event’s first
appearance in the  New York  venue in 53 years.  The arena, two-third of the way through a  $1 billion
renovation , was one of 25 preliminary round sites picked for the
2014 and 2015 tournament, which decides the national champion.  “The bid process was as competitive as ever,” Dan Gavitt,
NCAA vice president of men’s basketball, said in a press
release. “We are excited about the tournament returning to the
world’s most famous arena.”  Madison Square Garden hosted 71 tournament games between
1943 and 1961. Only three arenas have hosted more tournament
games, the NCAA said.  New York is one of three states chosen to host games in
three different cities in 2014 and 2015. Buffalo will be the
site of second- and third-round games for a fifth time in 2014,
while Syracuse, a 10-time host, will be the site of the 2015
East Regional.  In  Ohio , Dayton, Columbus and  Cleveland  will each host
games. The tournament will start at the University of Dayton in
2014 and 2015, as it has done since 2001. Columbus will serve as
a second- and third-round site in 2015, while Cleveland will
host the Midwest Regional that year.  California will also host games in three cities. Second-
and third-round contests will be played in San Diego in 2014,
while Anaheim will host the West Regional the same year.  Los
Angeles , site of the 2013 West Regional, will assume the same
roll two years later.  North Carolina ,  Florida  and Texas each had two cities
selected to host preliminary round games, while Indianapolis,
home of the NCAA, will host the 2014 Midwest Regional in advance
of the 2015 Final Four.  To contact the reporter on this story:
