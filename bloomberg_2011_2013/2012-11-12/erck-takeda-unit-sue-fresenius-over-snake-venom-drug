Merck & Co. (MRK)  and  Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. (4502) ’s Millennium unit sued subsidiaries of
Fresenius SE for infringing three U.S. patents for a human
blood-thinner made from  rattlesnake  venom.  U.S. units of Fresenius, based in Bad Homburg, Germany,
plan to market a generic version of anti-clotting  Integrilin 
before the patents expire in 2015, according to a complaint
filed Nov. 9 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  In applying to the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration  for
permission to sell the drug, Fresenius “acted without a
reasonable basis for believing that it would not be liable for
infringing,” the drugmakers said in the complaint. The sales
would cause “irreparable injury,” the companies said.  Integrilin can be used to prevent clots when doctors
perform artery-clearing angioplasty procedures on heart-attack
patients and install coronary stents to prop open clogged blood
vessels.  Matthias Link, a Fresenius spokesman, didn’t immediately
reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit after regular
business hours in  Germany .  Merck is based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. Takeda is
based in  Osaka , Japan.  The case is Merck v. Fresenius, 12-cv-1410, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 5,807,825; 5,747,447; 5,968,902.  To contact the reporter on this story:
