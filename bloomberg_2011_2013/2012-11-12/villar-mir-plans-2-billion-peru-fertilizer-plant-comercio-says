Grupo Villar Mir is in talks with
gas companies to secure supply for a $2 billion fertilizer
complex in  Peru , El Comercio reported.  The Madrid-based company’s Fertiberia unit is studying
possible locations for the plant in the Andean country, which
would produce ammonia and urea for local and South American
markets, the Lima-based newspaper said, citing company advisor
Ricardo Vega.  Peru’s President  Ollanta Humala  supports the project, which
Juan Miguel Villar Mir, the company’s president, discussed with
senior government officials in May, El Comercio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
