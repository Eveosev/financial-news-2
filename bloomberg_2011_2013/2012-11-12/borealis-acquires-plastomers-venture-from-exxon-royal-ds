Borealis AG agreed to buy a
plastomers joint venture that generates annual revenue of about
180 million euros ($229 million) from  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and
 Royal DSM NV. (DSM)   The agreement to buy DEXPlastomers, jointly owned by the
two partners, is expected to close in the first quarter,
Heerlen, the Netherlands-based DSM said in a statement. Valence
Group helped  manage  the sale, while HSBC Holdings Plc advised
the buyer.  The transaction highlights efforts by feedstock-rich
petrochemical and plastics companies in the Middle East to
expand globally. Borealis is 64 percent owned by International
Petroleum Investment Co. of Abu Dhabi, with  OMV AG (OMV)  of Austria
holding the remainder.  For DSM, the sale marks the latest step by Chief Executive
Officer Feike Sijbesma to distance the company from its
commodity past. The Dutch maker is focusing on nutritional
ingredients and high-technology materials, including baby-food
supplements and lightweight plastics used in car airbags.  To contact the reporter on this story:
