Turkish central bank Governor Erdem Basci said he’s ready to cut  interest rates  as early as this
month to prevent a surge in the lira after the country’s debt
was raised to investment grade.  The central bank is monitoring its  index of the lira’s real
exchange rate , measured against the currencies of its main trade
partners, Basci told the state-run Anatolia news agency in a
televised interview. The index rose to 117.4 last month from
116.3 in September and Basci said it currently stands at 119.  A level of 120 would signal an over-valued currency, and
“we may respond in the short term,” Basci said. If the measure
passes 125 then “a stronger policy response” would be needed,
he said. “At the moment, measured steps are sufficient.”  Basci last year adopted an interest-rate corridor that
allows him to adjust rates daily. He has responded to slowing
economic growth this year by bringing the band’s top end down to
9.5 percent, and keeping bank borrowing costs near the lower
limit of 5.75 percent in recent months.  Turkey  won its first investment-grade rating in almost two
decades from  Fitch Ratings  last week, prompting predictions of
an increased flow of international investment to the country.  The lira weakened 0.3 percent to 1.796 per dollar at 12:50
p.m. in Istanbul. Yields on benchmark  two-year lira bonds 
extended their record low, falling 21 basis points to 6.36
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
