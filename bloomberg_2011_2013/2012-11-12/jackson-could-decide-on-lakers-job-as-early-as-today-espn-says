Phil Jackson  could decide whether
he’ll rejoin the Los Angeles Lakers for a third stint as head
coach as early as today, ESPN reported, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the situation.  Jackson, 67, met two days ago with General Manager Mitch Kupchak and Executive Vice President Jim Buss, who are seeking a
replacement for  Mike Brown , who was fired after a 1-4 start to
the National Basketball Association season. The Lakers have won
two straight games under interim coach Bernie Bickerstaff,
including last night’s 103-90 win against the Sacramento Kings.  “If he feels like he can come here and give what he
demands of himself, I think he’ll be interested,” Lakers All-
Star guard  Kobe Bryant  said of Jackson at a news conference.  Jackson is the top target of the Lakers, who yesterday
interviewed Mike Dunleavy, ESPN reported. Dunleavy coached the
Lakers in 1990-92 and also coached the Milwaukee Bucks, Portland
Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Clippers. His interview came a day
after the Lakers had a phone interview with former Phoenix Suns
and New York Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni .  Jackson led the Lakers to five of his record 11 NBA
coaching titles. He left the Lakers and was replaced by Brown
following the 2010-11 season in which the club went 57-25 and
lost in the Western Conference semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
