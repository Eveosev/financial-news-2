Kapsch TrafficCom AG (KTCG)  posted the
third-biggest decline in the Austrian ATX Prime Index today
after the maker of road toll systems said it will sell its stake
in a Russian joint venture.  The shares dropped as much as 2.6 percent to 42.28 euros,
the lowest intraday price in two weeks. The stock was down 2.5
percent at 11:48 a.m. in Vienna, taking the  total decline this
year  to 26 percent.  Kapsch is selling its 33 percent stake in United Toll
Systems to joint-venture partner OAO  Mostotrest (MSTT)  for 6 million
euros ($7.6 million), the Vienna-based company said in a
statement today. Kapsch plans to focus on implementing and
operating toll systems, rather than operating roads, it said.  “The foundation of the joint venture was to utilize
potential synergies, that is to have a door opener to future
large-scale orders,” said Daniel Damaska, an analyst at
Raiffeisen Centrobank who has a hold recommendation on Kapsch,
said in an e-mailed note. “It has to be assumed that Kapsch
TrafficCom does not see these synergies anymore, which means a
return to the beginning in the Russian market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
