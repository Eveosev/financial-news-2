OAO  Veropharm (VRPH)  surged to a two-month
high after billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK Sistema won
approval to acquire the Russian drugmaker.  The shares gained as much as 11 percent and closed up 8.5
percent at 858.50 rubles in Moscow, the strongest price since
Sept. 19. The number of shares traded reached 32,455, equivalent
to about 8.5 times the stock’s three-month average.  Russia ’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service granted Sistema
permission to acquire all of the Veropharm, the watchdog said in
a statement today. OAO Pharmacy Chain 36.6, Russia’s biggest
drugstore chain, rallied 4.2 percent to 34.75 rubles, after
rising as much as 11 percent. The company aims to sell its 51.8
percent stake in Veropharm to pay down debt, Vedomosti reported
Nov. 2.  “Minority investors are hoping Sistema will buy them out
at a premium,” Mikhail Terentiev, an analyst at Otkritie
Capital in Moscow, said by phone. “The federal approval is just
the first step, now the price discussions begin.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
