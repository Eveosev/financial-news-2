Managers of Farmal d.d., the
Croatian unit of German drugs manufacturer Dermapharm AG, were
arrested today on suspicion of corruption, Health Minister Rajko Ostojic said.  The managers of the Ludbreg, Croatia-based company
allegedly bribed physicians in  Croatia  to prescribe the
company’s products, Ostojic said by phone. The investigation
conducted by the  Office for Suppression of Corruption and
Organized Crime , or USKOK, has also included about 350 doctors,
according to Ostojic.  Farmal became a member of the Munich-based group in 2011,
according to its  website .  Phone calls to the company’s offices in Ludbreg were not
answered. USKOK’s spokesman Vuk Djuricic confirmed by phone that
the operation is under way. He declined to give details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
