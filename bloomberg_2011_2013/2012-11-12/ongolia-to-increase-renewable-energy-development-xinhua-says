Mongolia plans to increase the
amount of energy produced from renewable sources, the country’s
President Tsakhia Elbegdorj said Monday, according to  China ’s
official Xinhua News Agency.  The country expects to produce 20 percent to 25 percent of
its electricity from wind, solar and other renewable resources
by 2020, Elbegdorj said at the Northeast Asia Renewable Energy
Resources Cooperation Forum. He didn’t say how much renewable
energy is produced now.  Mongolia has the potential to meet its entire domestic
energy demand with renewable power, Elbegdorj said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
