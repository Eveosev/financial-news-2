The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held near the highest in more than a month,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was little
changed at 27 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate
at 10:15 a.m. in  London , data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
measure is the most expensive since Oct. 1.  The one-year basis swap was 28 basis points, or 0.28
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 27 on Nov. 9.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending at in euros, was set at a record low 0.192 percent from
0.193 percent on Nov. 9. The benchmark is derived from a daily
survey of banks for the European Banking Federation.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held at the lowest in four days. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as
the Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 12 basis points.  The EBF’s euro overnight index average, or Eonia, of
unsecured lending deals was set at a record low 0.072 percent on
Nov. 9, from 0.087 the day before. The Eonia swap, an estimate
of average overnight borrowing costs over the next three months,
was 7.2 basis points from 7.5 on Nov. 9.  The  volume  of overnight lending as measured by the EBF in
Brussels rose to 21.8 billion euros ($27.7 billion) of
transactions on Nov. 9, the highest since Oct. 30, from 18.2
billion euros the day before. Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at
the European Central Bank to 249 billion euros from 258 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
