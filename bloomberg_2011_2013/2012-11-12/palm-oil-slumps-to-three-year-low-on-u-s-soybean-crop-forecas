Palm oil  rebounded from the lowest
level in three years as stockpiles in Malaysia, the largest
producer after  Indonesia , climbed less than expected in October.  The contract for January delivery advanced 0.4 percent to
close at 2,324 ringgit ($758) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange. Futures earlier slumped as much as 4.2
percent to 2,220 ringgit, the lowest price for the most-active
contract since November 2009. The price retreated 7.2 percent
last week, the most since the five days ended Sept. 28.  While  reserves  rose 1.1 percent to a record 2.51 million
tons from the previous month, according to Palm Oil Board data,
they were less than the median estimate of 2.7 million tons in a
Bloomberg survey. Output fell 3.3 percent to 1.94 million tons
from a record of 2 million tons in September, the board said.
Exports surged 16 percent to 1.76 million tons.  “The data today curbed negative expectations on stocks,”
said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz Risk
Management Services Pvt. in Mumbai. “That’s leading to short-
covering, more than anything else. There’s even some bargain-
hunting as people have come in to buy.” Short-covering refers
to investors reversing bets on declining prices.  Output typically peaks between July and October before
tapering off from November onwards.  “Given that November, December output should drop, we
think that prices have pretty much bottomed out already,” said
 Ben Santoso , an analyst at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore .  Soybean Forecast  Soybean oil  for December delivery slid as much as 2.6
percent to 46.52 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest level for the most-active contract since October
2010, as the U.S. government raised its forecast for soybean
output. The U.S. harvest will total 2.971 billion bushels (80.86
million tons), up 3.9 percent from 2.86 billion estimated in
October, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Nov. 9.
Soybeans are crushed to make oil which competes with palm for
use in food and fuel.  Soybeans for January declined as much as 2.1 percent to
$14.2125 a bushel, the cheapest price for the most active
contract since June, before trading at $14.27.  Palm oil for May delivery lost 2.3 percent to close at
6,554  yuan  ($1,052) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , the
lowest closing level for the most active contract since July
2010. In intraday trading, futures fell by the maximum daily
limit of 4 percent from the previous settlement.  Soybean oil for the same month fell 3.1 percent to end at
8,348 yuan a ton, the lowest price since September 2010. The
contract also fell earlier by the daily limit of 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
