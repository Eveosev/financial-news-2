The rate of Serbian defaults fell in
June from the previous month as the Balkan nationâ€™s economy
recovers, the Association of Serbian Banks said.  The average net rate of late payments, defined as 15 days
or more behind for corporate clients and at least 60 days late
for individuals, fell 0.2 percentage points to 11.3 percent, the
Belgrade-based institution said in a  report  today. The result
was one percentage point above the level at end-December.  Total loan volume stood at 1.81 trillion dinars ($25.6
billion), up 3.8 percent from May, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
