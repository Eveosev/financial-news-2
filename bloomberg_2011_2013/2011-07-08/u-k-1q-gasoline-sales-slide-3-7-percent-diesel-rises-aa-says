U.K. motorists bought 3.7 percent
less gasoline between January and March this year, as last
year’s rise in fuel costs curbed demand, according to the
Automobile Association.  Retail sales dropped by 132,000 metric tons to 3.42 million
tons in the first quarter of this year, the AA said in an e-
mailed statement, citing data from the Department of Energy and
Climate Change. Diesel retail sales rose 0.5 percent to 3.22
million tons in the same three-month period.  “The first three months of this year saw the equivalent of
13.5 days of U.K. petrol sales wiped out,” said Edmund King,
president of the AA, in a statement.  Demand for gasoline looks set to drop until the economy
improves, potentially pushing prices down, the motoring group
said. U.K. economic growth slowed to a virtual standstill in the
second quarter, the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research said yesterday.  “Prices will keep falling until the economy starts to
pickup,” Luke Bosdet, a Basingstoke, England-based spokesman
for the AA, said by phone. U.K. gasoline prices have fallen 5.3
percent over the past two weeks. They rose 18 percent last year
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
