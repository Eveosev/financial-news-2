Serbia ’s government will probably
establish a national  development bank  by the end of 2011 to help
bolster economic growth.  The  Finance Ministry  will complete a feasibility study next
month, which should lead to the bank’s creation in the fourth
quarter, Labor Minister Rasim Ljajic told a news conference
today in Belgrade.  Serbia’s economy expanded 3.4 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, driven by exports that the government sees
as essential for sustained growth after a recession in 2009. The
bank would consolidate state support to business, provided at
present through the  Development Fund  and  Export Credit and
Insurance Agency . Only Serbia’s northern Vojvodina province has
a  development bank .  “The feasibility study will determine the amount of
capital needed,” Ljajic said. This year, the Development Fund
will disburse 17.7 billion dinars ($249 million), mostly to
export-oriented industries, while the government will provide
35.5 billion dinars through “various incentives,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
