Negotiations on a global agreement to
make derivatives markets more transparent and to regulate them
more tightly are being hampered by tensions over the shape the
new regime should take, the Financial Times reported, citing
officials and bankers.  New rules are supposed to be in place by the end of next
year, but there is discord over details and timing, the
newspaper said.  Edouard Vieillefond, who heads regulation policy and
international affairs at  France ’s Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said that, while there’s 90 percent agreement with
the U.S., consensus has yet to be reached on the list of
derivatives for central clearing and on matters such as capital
and collateral requirements for uncleared bilateral derivatives,
the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
