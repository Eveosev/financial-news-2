Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FLOURMIL) , which
processes grains and sells cement, closed at an 11-week low
after reporting a 44 percent decrease in profit.  The stock lost 4.42 naira, or 5 percent, to 84.18 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, its lowest since April 21.  Net income fell to 9.45 billion naira ($61 million) for the
full year through March, from 16.94 billion naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based company said in a statement published
by the Nigerian Stock Exchange yesterday.  “The decline was much more significant than we expected,”
Adedoyin Adelakun, a consumer-goods analyst at Vetiva Capital
Management Limited, said by phone from Lagos today. “We
expected a single-digit decline.”  Flour Mills stock has risen 22 percent this year, compared
with a retreat of less than 2 percent in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index  in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
