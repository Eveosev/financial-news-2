Deutsche Bahn  AG wants to hire 5,000
to 7,000 new employees annually in the next years, Berliner
Zeitung reported, citing an interview with management board
member Ulrich Weber.  Deutsche Bahn is seeking to hire at all levels of
expertise, the German newspaper said in the preview of an
article for tomorrowâ€™s edition. About 40 percent of its current
workforce is older than 50, which will lead to increased
retirement numbers in the near future, Weber was cited as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
