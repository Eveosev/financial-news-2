Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
second-biggest grower of the crop after  Ethiopia , climbed 58
percent in June because of a good new harvest amid high prices,
according to the country’s Coffee Development Authority.  Shipments in the month rose to 370,924 60-kilogram (132-
pound) bags, from 234,956 bags a year earlier, an official who
declined to be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak
for the authority said today by phone from the capital, Kampala.  Exports surpassed an earlier target of 265,000 bags and the
253,270 bags shipped in May because of good yields in the
western and southern regions, the official said. Farmers in the
southern and western regions are harvesting their main crop,
while the central and eastern regions are picking a secondary
crop whose yields are lower than usual, according to the agency.  Exports in the 12 months through September may decline to
2.6 million bags, from an earlier forecast of 3.1 million bags,
the authority said April 13. Some 2.67 million bags were shipped
last season, according to the authority.  East  Africa ’s third-largest economy after Kenya and
Tanzania experienced a dry spell from December to April, which
the government blames on  climate change . More than 95 percent of
Uganda’s crop is grown by small-scale farmers whose plants are
predominantly rain-fed, according to the authority.  Uganda earned $243.6 million from the sales of the beans
last season, down from $291.3 million a year earlier. Robusta
beans account for about 85 percent of annual output. The country
consumes less than 3 percent of its annual output, according to
the Eastern African Fine Coffee Association.  The country, where yields declined from 4.4 million bags in
1996-97 partly because of crop damage from coffee wilt disease,
plans to increase production to 4.5 million bags a season by
2015 through a replanting program, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
