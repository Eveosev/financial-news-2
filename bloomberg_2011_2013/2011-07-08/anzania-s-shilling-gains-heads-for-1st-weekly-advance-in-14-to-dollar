Tanzania’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar and headed for the first weekly gain in 14.  The currency of East Africa’s second-biggest economy
appreciated for a fourth day, adding 0.2 percent to 1,599.5 per
dollar at 11:41 a.m. in Dar es Salaam. The increase extended the
currency’s rally this week to 1.3 percent, the first advance
since the five days through April 1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
