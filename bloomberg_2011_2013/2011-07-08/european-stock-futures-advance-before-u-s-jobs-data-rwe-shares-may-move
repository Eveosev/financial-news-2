European stocks dropped, pushing the
benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index to a weekly loss, as a report
showed the  U.S. economy  added fewer workers in June than
predicted, indicating that the economic recovery is faltering.  British Sky Broadcasting Plc fell 7.6 percent after the
U.K. said it will take “some time” to consider responses to
 News Corp .’s proposed takeover.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , tumbled 7.9
percent, as bank shares retreated across Europe with a gauge of
lenders on the Stoxx 600 slumping 2.3 percent.  Banco Santander
SA (SAN)  dropped 3.8 percent.  The Stoxx 600 declined 0.8 percent to 273.76 at the 4:30
p.m. close in  London . The gauge retreated 0.4 percent this week.
The benchmark measure has slumped 6 percent from this year’s
high on Feb. 17 on concern that the euro area’s sovereign-debt
crisis will derail its economic recovery.  “Non-farm payrolls disappointing will create uncertainty
about future indicators,” said Anders Nellemose, chief
strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen, before the U.S.
Labor Department published its jobs report. “Even less-bad
macro news will destabilize sentiment going forward.”  European stocks plunged as the Labor Department reported
that employers added fewer workers in June than economists had
predicted. Payrolls rose by 18,000 workers last month, missing
the average estimate for an increase of 105,000. The Labor
Department also revised down the number of workers hired in May
to 25,000 from 54,000. The  unemployment rate  climbed to 9.2
percent, exceeding economists’ forecast that it would remain at
9.1 percent for a second month.  National benchmark indexes dropped in all but one Western
European country today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slid 1.1
percent,  France ’s CAC 40 Index lost 1.7 percent and  Germany ’s
DAX Index slipped 0.9 percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB Index decreased
3.5 percent to its lowest level in a year.  Adecco, Mining Companies  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, dropped 3.7 percent to 53.60 Swiss francs. The company
generated 19 percent of its revenue from  North America  in 2010.  Mining companies retreated as base metals declined on the
London Metal Exchange.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  slumped 4.3 percent
to 1,973 pence and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  decreased 4.5 percent to
1,424 pence.  BHP Billiton Plc (BLT) , the world’s biggest miner,
dropped 2.7 percent to 2,454 pence.  BSkyB tumbled 7.6 percent to 750 pence, its biggest drop
since October 2008, after News Corp. decided to close its News
of the World tabloid newspaper after a phone-tapping scandal.
News Corp. needs the U.K. government’s approval before it can
buy the BSkyB shares that it doesn’t already own.  Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI) , the publisher of the U.K’s Daily Mirror
newspaper, surged 4.2 percent to 50 pence.  Bank Stress Tests  UniCredit sank 7.9 percent to 1.23 euros as Italy’s bonds
slid for a fifth straight day, pushing yields to a nine-year
high.  Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl (PMI)  dropped 6.1 percent to 1.53
euros and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  retreated 4.6 percent to 1.65
euros.  European regulators moved to staunch the euro area’s
banking crisis by requiring companies to publish greater details
of their assets and future profitability, giving them six months
to make up any capital shortfalls.  Lenders will be required to disclose their capital levels,
estimates for profitability in 2011 and 2012 and their holdings
of sovereign debt, the London-based European Banking Authority
said in a statement today. Banks will also have to disclose how
much additional capital they will need to raise.  “The crisis is not finished,” said Jacques Porta, a
Paris-based  fund manager  at Ofi Patrimoine, who helps oversee
about $425 million in stocks. “The next target seems to be
Italy, and that’s a big target. This is contagion.”  Santander, BBVA Fall  In  Spain , Santander retreated 3.8 percent to 7.56 euros and
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  dropped 4 percent to 7.52
euros.  RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-biggest utility, fell 4 percent to
37.02 euros after the Financial Times Deutschland reported that
the company’s supervisory board may debate a share sale at an
extraordinary meeting at the beginning of August. The newspaper
cited Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Grossmann .  Grifols SA (GRF)  rose 1.8 percent to 14.40 euros after Exane BNP
Paribas named the Spanish plasma maker its top pick among
medical-technology companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
