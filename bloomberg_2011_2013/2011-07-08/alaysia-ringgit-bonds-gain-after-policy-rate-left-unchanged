Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened by
the most in more than a week on speculation the central bank may
still raise borrowing costs this year after unexpectedly leaving
its benchmark rate unchanged. Bonds advanced.  The currency was poised for a second weekly gain after  Bank
Negara Malaysia  kept its overnight rate at 3 percent in an
announcement at 6 p.m. yesterday. Ten of 15 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg expected a quarter of a percentage point increase.
The central bank said it would consider “further policy moves”
in a statement after the decision. Malaysia will raise its
benchmark rate to 3.5 percent by year-end, according to a
Bloomberg poll.  “ Bank Negara ’s policy statement suggests the lender has
not strayed from normalizing  interest rates  and people are
reacting to it,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency
strategist at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The
ringgit’s strength may be capped on concerns that the U.S. non-
farm payrolls may miss forecasts.”  The ringgit rose 0.5 percent to 2.9958 per dollar as of
9:41 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency advanced 0.4 percent from a week ago. It
reached 2.9950 on July 4, the strongest level since June 6.  Bank Negara also ordered Malaysian lenders to set aside
more cash yesterday, by raising the statutory reserve-
requirement ratio to 4 percent from 3 percent effective July 16.
In its policy statement, it cited “higher downside risks to
growth” amid  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing U.S. growth,
which have damped the outlook for exports, as the reason for
holding the policy rate.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 105,000 in June,
compared with an advance of 54,000 the previous month, according
to the median estimate of 85 economists in a Bloomberg survey
before data due today.  Malaysian bonds gained. The yield on the 4.262 percent
security due September 2016 fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.52 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.
The treasury will auction 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) of
the 2016 notes on July 13, the central bank announced on its
website yesterday.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
