The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:34 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.9 percent to 13,726.98, the lowest
since August, while the Colcap Index dropped 1 percent to
1,656.42 as stocks sank on slower-than-forecast U.S. job growth
that spurred concern the economic recovery is in jeopardy.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest publicly
traded retailer, fell 1.9 percent to 23,100 pesos. The company
fell for a third consecutive day after Exito shareholders
approved plans to raise as much as $1.4 billion by selling new
shares and buy a stake in Uruguayan supermarkets from majority
shareholder Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA, according to a July 6
regulatory filing.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
rose 0.7 percent to 70.5 pesos, after earlier gaining as much as
2.1 percent. The U.S. House Ways and Means and Senate Finance
Committees passed a trade accord with Colombia in a preliminary
“non-mark up” process yesterday before the bill is formally
submitted to Congress.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 0.7 percent
to 46,000 pesos as crude dropped after the U.S. added fewer jobs
than forecast in June and the  unemployment rate  climbed, damping
optimism for the economic rebound and fuel demand growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
