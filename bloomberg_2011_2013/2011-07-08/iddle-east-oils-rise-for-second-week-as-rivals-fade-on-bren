Middle East  crude oils for sale to
 Asia  gained for the second week as a rising Brent benchmark
placed a premium on rival supplies from the Atlantic basin.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose $4.89, or 4.6
percent, this week to $111.11 barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August climbed $4.89, or
4.6 percent, from last week to $110.85. Abu Dhabiâ€™s light Murban
grade increased $4.80, or 4.4 percent, for the week to $115.15.  Brent crude is set for its second weekly advance in  London ,
making Atlantic basin cargoes more expensive for buyers in Asia,
compared with supplies from the Middle East. The premium of
Brent futures to Dubai crude swaps rose 30 cents to $6.05 a
barrel, the highest since June 22, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates, a broker. The Atlantic basin includes West
Africa, the Mediterranean and the  North Sea .  Futures contracts for Oman crude, the most widely traded
spot grade in Asia, settled at $112.14 a barrel for  September ,
up $3.23, the Dubai Mercantile Exchange said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
