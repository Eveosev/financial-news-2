The dollar fell the most in three
weeks versus the yen after the government’s payrolls report
showed employers added fewer jobs in June than economists
forecast and the  unemployment rate  increased to 9.2 percent.  The yen and Swiss franc rose against most of their major
counterparts as evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is
stalling spurred demand for a refuge.  “This number shows that yields in the U.S. are going to
remain very low for much longer than the market anticipated, and
that is going to weigh on the dollar continuously,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at the online currency trader
GFT Forex in New York. “The dollar was going to rally against
Swiss and yen on a good number, and now those trades are off the
table.”  The dollar slid 0.7 percent to 80.71 yen at 8:44 a.m. in
 New York , from 81.25 yesterday. The greenback depreciated as
much as 0.8 percent, the most since June 17. The U.S. currency
appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.4308 against the euro, from
$1.4364. The euro dropped 1.1 percent to 115.43 yen.  Payrolls expanded by 18,000 in June after a revised
increase of 25,000 in the previous month, the Labor Department
reported today. The median forecast of 85 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for 105,000 more jobs. The
unemployment rate had been projected to hold at 9.1 percent.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said following the
central bank’s June 21-22 meeting that unemployment will
come down “very painfully slowly” even after the pace of
economic growth picks up starting in the second half of 2011.  Fed on Employment  The central bank predicted the unemployment rate would
average 8.6 percent to 8.9 percent in the final three months of
2011, compared with 8.4 percent to 8.7 percent projected in
April. The economy will expand 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent this
year, down from forecasts ranging from 3.1 percent to 3.3
percent in April, according to the Fed.  Policy makers have kept the target lending rate at a record
low zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to support the
economy. The  European Central Bank  raised its benchmark rate by
a quarter-percentage point to 1.5 percent yesterday. The  Reserve
Bank  of  Australia  has raised its cash rate target seven times
since the financial crisis began to ease.  The 17-nation euro fell earlier against the dollar as a
European Union document on bank stress tests deepened concern
that the region’s debt crisis may intensify.  EU Stress Tests  Banks that fail this year’s round of EU stress tests may
need to present plans for making up their capital shortfall by
the end of September, according to the internal EU document
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Firms may be given a further three months to implement
these plans and raise the additional capital they need,
according to the document.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which
measures the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, gained 0.1 percent to 75.031, from 74.957.  The gauge of the U.S. currency fell 0.7 percent on June 3,
when the Labor Department reported that employers added fewer
jobs than economists forecast. The index increased 0.9 percent
on May 6, when more positions were added than projected.  A report last week showed strength in manufacturing. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s index rose to 55.3 in June
from 53.5 in the previous month, the Tempe, Arizona, group
reported July 1. Readings above 50 indicate growth.  The dollar is the second-worst performer this year among
10 developed-nation currencies, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, having fallen 5.2
percent. The biggest loser is the yen, down 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
