Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced for a
second day after global funds boosted holdings of the nation’s
assets to benefit from growth in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest
economy.  The currency climbed a second week after exchange data
showed offshore investors purchased $291 million more Indonesian
shares than they sold in the first four days of the week. Gross
domestic product will rise by as much as 6.6 percent this year
after increasing 6.1 percent in 2010, Bank Indonesia Deputy
Governor Hartadi Sarwono told parliament on July 4.  “Indonesia’s fundamentals are stable and that’s attracting
capital inflows,” said  Anton Gunawan , a Jakarta-based chief
economist at PT Bank Danamon.  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 8,519 per dollar as
of 3:53 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency advanced 0.2 percent this week.  Government bonds  rose for an eighth day after  foreign
holdings  of the nation’s debt increased 1 percent to 237.1
trillion rupiah ($27.8 billion) in the first three days of the
week, debt-management office data show.  The yield on the 8.25 percent securities due July 2021
declined 10 basis points to 7.27 percent, according to prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The rate fell 26 basis
points this week. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The central bank will leave its benchmark lending rate
unchanged at 6.75 percent on July 12, according to all 12
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
