Daily exports of Azeri Light crude
from a port in Turkey will drop 4.8 percent next month,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The August program comprises 28 cargoes totaling 21.7
million barrels, or 700,000 barrels a day, the plan showed.  The 1,768-kilometer (1,100-mile) Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline carries Azeri Light crude from Baku, in the Azeri
section of the  Caspian Sea , through Georgia to the port of
Ceyhan, on Turkeyâ€™s Mediterranean coast.  BP Plc (BP/)  holds a 30
percent stake in the pipeline.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
