History suggests that  Derek Jeter ’s
3,000th hit for the  New York Yankees  will be a single.
Oddsmakers overwhelmingly agree.  Jeter is two hits shy of becoming the 28th player in Major
League Baseball history to reach the 3,000-hit mark after
getting a double in last night’s loss at Yankee Stadium against
the  Tampa Bay Rays .  Seventeen of the previous 27 players with 3,000 career hits
reached the mark with a single and 79 percent of Jeter’s hits
this season have been singles. That’s led sports gambling
website  Bodog  to set 1-4 odds Jeter will be celebrating at first
base after his milestone hit.  “You think about it just because everywhere you go there’s
signs and people mention it,” Jeter said after getting his
2,998th hit leading off last night.  Three of Jeter’s four hits since coming off the disabled
list on July 4 have been doubles. The odds of his 3,000th hit
being a double are 4-1, according to Antigua-based Bodog. Seven
players have reached the 3,000-hit milestone with doubles, most
recently Rafael Palmeiro with the  Baltimore Orioles  in 2005.  “I feel pretty good,” Jeter said last night. “I’ve
driven a few balls, which is always a good sign.”  The only player in major-league history to hit a home run
for his 3,000th hit was former Yankee Wade Boggs, who did it in
1999 while with  Tampa Bay . Jeter has two homers in 280 at-bats
this season and Bodog set 10-1 odds of a home run being hit No.
3,000 for the Yankees’ captain.  Triple Odds  Odds of Jeter reaching the mark with a triple are 15-1,
meaning a winning $10 bet would return $150 plus the initial
wager. Paul Molitor was the only player with a triple as his
3,000th career hit, in 1996 for the  Minnesota Twins .  The details of Cap Anson’s 3,000th hit aren’t known,
according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Anson played in the late
1800s and is credited as the first player to reach 3,000.  Jeter would be the first player to do it as a member of the
Yankees and the first to reach 3,000 while playing shortstop as
his only defensive position.  Jeter, who turned 37 on June 26, could also become the
fourth-youngest player to reach the mark.  Ty Cobb was the youngest, at 34, while  Hank Aaron  and Robin Yount got their 3,000th hits at 36. Pete Rose, baseball’s all-
time leader with 4,256 hits, got No. 3,000 21 days after his
37th birthday.  Bodog is also offering odds on who will congratulate Jeter
first after the milestone hit and whether the entire Yankee team
will come out of the dugout to celebrate with him.  The Yankees and Rays play Game 2 of their four-game series
tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
