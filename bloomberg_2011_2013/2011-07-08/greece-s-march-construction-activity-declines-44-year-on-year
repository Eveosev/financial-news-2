Greek public and private building
activity, measured by the number of permits issued, was almost
44 percent lower in March than a year earlier, the  Hellenic
Statistical Authority  said.  The number of permits fell 43.9 percent to 2,747. The
surface area of planned buildings dropped 45 percent to 471,900
square meters and their volume fell 40 percent to 1.7 million
cubic meters, the agency said today in an e-mailed  statement .  Building slowed most in the western Macedonia region of
northern  Greece  and in the southern region of Peloponnisos. In
Athens and its metropolitan area, construction dropped almost 40
percent. Private building activity in the country as a whole was
down 44 percent.  Greece’s property crisis will last for another two or three
years, according to 56 percent of Greek real-estate agents. The
figure is contained in a July 4 report by the  Athens University
of Economics and Business .  Austerity measures the government agreed to last year in
return for 110 billion euros ($157 billion) of emergency loans
have deepened Greece’s recession, as unemployment has risen and
people have bought less. Last month, parliament approved further
budget cuts to obtain more financial aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
