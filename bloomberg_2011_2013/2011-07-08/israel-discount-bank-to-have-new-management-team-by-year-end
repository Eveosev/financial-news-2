Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , the
country’s third largest lender by assets, will complete hiring a
new management team by the end of this year, Chairman Joseph
Bachar said.  “We are in the process of change,” Bachar, a former
director general of Israel’s  Finance Ministry  who joined the
bank in January 2010, said at a conference in London yesterday.  Israel Discount Bank posted a 53 percent drop in quarterly
profits last August and Chief Executive Officer Giora Offer
stepped down in January.  Bachar has appointed seven new members to the management
team since he took over, including Chief Executive Officer
Reuven Spiegel.  The bank reached an agreement with its employees’ union
last month that it estimates could save as much as 330 million
shekels ($96.9 million) by the end of 2012.  The bank also plans to cut costs by reducing
“duplication” of roles including legal advisor and risk
manager, Bachar said in an interview during the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
