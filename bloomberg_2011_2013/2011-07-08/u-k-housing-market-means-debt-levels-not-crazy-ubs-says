U.K. households’ high debt levels
relative to borrowers in other countries such as  Germany  are
justified because the structure of Britain’s housing market
makes it reasonable to borrow, UBS AG economist Amit Kara said.  Britons’ total household debt is about 110 percent of gross
domestic product, “well above” levels for other countries, and
the “overwhelming share” is mortgage borrowing, Kara wrote in
a research note today. The U.K. home-ownership rate is about 70
percent, compared with about 40 percent in Germany.  U.K. households borrow to ensure they can live rent-free in
retirement, Kara wrote. People in other countries such as
Germany don’t do this because they tend to bet their pension
income will be enough to pay rent once they stop working. They
also benefit from measures such as rent controls, he said.  “The U.K. household is anything but crazy” to have such
high borrowing levels, Kara wrote. “By buying a home, the
household is protecting itself from any mismatch between its
pension income and rent payments; the household is, in other
words, behaving prudently.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
