International Data Corporation raised
its 2011 forecast for global sales of tablet computers by 6.2
percent to 53.5 million units on the strength of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPad and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system.  Though sales in the first calendar quarter fell 28 percent
from the prior quarter, Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC
raised its forecast for the year citing increased competition
between tablets. Samsung Electronics Co. and Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc. continue to lag behind Apple because unlike the
iPad maker they require customers to buy a data plan, IDC said
in a statement today.  The share of Android-based devices grew 8.2 percentage
points to account for 34 percent of the tablet market, IDC said.  “Like the PC market, media tablets had a bit of a
challenging quarter in Q1, as concerns about general
macroeconomic issues and the post-holiday letdown took a toll on
demand,” IDC vice president Bob O’Donnell said in a release.
“We expect the rest of the year to be much stronger.”  The decrease in the first quarter indicates the tablet and
e-reader markets are maturing and not as influenced by “media
hype” as they once were, the research company said. Sales of e-
readers such as  Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) ’s Nook and Amazon Inc.’s
Kindle also fell in the first quarter, though IDC forecasts
sales to increase 24 percent over 2010 due to more diverse
offerings, including color devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
