China ’s finance ministry failed to
sell all of the debt offered at an auction for the third time
this year as a cash crunch damped demand from banks.  The ministry sold 11.76 billion yuan ($1.82 billion) of
182-day bills, falling short of its 15 billion yuan target,
according to traders at financing companies required to bid at
the auctions. The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures
interbank funding availability, has almost doubled in the past
month to 6.25 percent after the central bank pushed lenders’
reserve-requirement ratios to a record 21.5 percent on June 14.  “Demand has declined as a cash shortage continues,” said
Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in  Shanghai .
“The cash crunch will probably last at least until the middle
of this month.”  The average yield at the sale was 3.70 percent, said the
traders who wouldn’t be identified. That compares with
yesterday’s 3.30 percent rate for similar-maturity existing
securities, according to data compiled by Chinabond, the
nation’s biggest debt-clearing house. The highest winning-bid
yield was 3.85 percent, they said.  Demand for short-term debt is also cooling after the
central bank raised its benchmark one-year lending and deposit
rates yesterday for the third time this year to help quell
inflation. Data tomorrow is expected to show consumer prices
climbed 6.2 percent in June from a year earlier, the most in 34
months, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Bonds Fall  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bond due May 2012
rose four basis points to 3.35 percent as of 11:18 a.m. in
Shanghai, according to the Interbank Funding Center. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The  finance ministry  failed to sell all the bonds offered
at a June 17 auction of one-year notes, as well as at sales of
182-day bills and one-year debt on May 13.  The finance ministry in January published a list of 59
underwriters required to bid at its debt sales, including
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
China Citic Bank Corp., Postal Savings Bank of China, Industrial
Bank Co., Guotai Junan Securities Co. and BOC International
