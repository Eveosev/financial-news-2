Romanian industrial output growth
accelerated for the first time in three months in May as demand
for the country’s manufactured and mining products spurs an
economic recovery after a two-year recession.  Production grew a seasonally adjusted 8 percent from a year
earlier after a 6.3 percent rise in April, the Bucharest-based
National Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement
today. Output advanced 1.6 percent on the month.  Romania ’s industry, which grew 10 percent in the first
quarter and 4.1 percent in 2010, and surging exports boosted by
western European demand for products including Dacia SA cars,
will probably help the economy grow 1.5 percent this year,
according to  International Monetary Fund  and government
forecasts. The economy contracted 1.3 percent in 2010.  Production of manufactured goods rose 7.8 percent in May on
the year, while output of mined and drilled goods jumped 16
percent. Production of electricity and thermal energy increased
6.2 percent, the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
