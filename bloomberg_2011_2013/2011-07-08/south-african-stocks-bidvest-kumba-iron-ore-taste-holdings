The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
snapped two days of losses, climbing 81.53, or 0.3 percent, to
31,926.55 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest producer
of the metal, gained 3.08 rand, or 3.1 percent, to 102.43 rand,
the highest closing price since June 6. Gold futures, little
changed in  New York , may rise on mounting demand for a haven
amid  Europe ’s escalating debt crisis.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-
largest producer of the metal, rose for a second day, adding
1.46 rand, or 1.6 percent, to 90.70 rand.  Iliad Ltd. (ILA SJ), a producer of building supplies,
retreated 80 cents, or 13 percent, to 5.50 rand, its lowest
point since November 2008. Iliad said costs associated with
realigning some of its businesses will have a “significant
adverse impact” on interim results.  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  , the operator of the world’s
deepest platinum mine, fell for an eighth day, losing 41 cents,
or 1 percent, to 39.10 rand.  South Africa ’s National Union of
Mineworkers said it has declared a dispute with Northam over
pay.  Petmin Ltd. (PET)  , South Africa’s largest anthracite
coal miner, reversed yesterday’s gains, dropping 10 cents, or
3.23 percent, to 3 rand. FirstRand Bank Ltd. now owns 5.2
percent of the company’s ordinary shares, Petmin said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
