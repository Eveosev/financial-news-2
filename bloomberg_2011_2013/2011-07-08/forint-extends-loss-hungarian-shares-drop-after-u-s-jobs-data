The forint extended declines against
the euro and  Hungary ’s benchmark stock index dropped after the
U.S. Labor Department said the world’s largest economy added
fewer jobs than expected in June and the  unemployment rate  rose.  The Hungarian currency depreciated as much as 0.7 percent
after the U.S. report and traded 0.5 percent weaker at 263.67
per euro as of 2:50 p.m. in Budapest. The BUX equity gauge slid
0.3 percent, erasing earlier gains, led by a 1.3 percent drop at
oil refiner Mol Nyrt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
