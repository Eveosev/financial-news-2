Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,
Slovenia’s biggest lender by assets, received a syndicated loan
of 350 million euros ($502 million) from a group of banks
including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to refinance debt and to generate
loans.  The two-year loan carries interest of 150 basis points
above the European Interbank Offered Rate, excluding other
costs, the Ljubljana-based lender said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  Nova Ljubljanska borrowing costs became more expensive
after the bank had its debt and deposit rating cut three levels
to Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service on concern over its bad
loans. The  European Central Bank  raised its benchmark rate to
1.50 percent yesterday, adding to the costs.  “The interest rates are comparable to the circumstances
and the conditions of our macroeconomic environment, so they are
not too expensive but not cheap either,” Ani Klemencic,
Chairman of the board of Kranj-based brokerage Gorenjska
borznoposredniska druzba d.d. said in an email. “I doubt the
economy will benefit from this, but companies that will have
their own debt extended by NLB probably will.”  NLB, in which the government holds an indirect majority, is
seeking a second 250 million-euro capital boost this year to
strengthen its finances.  The syndicated loan comes from 16 banks, including
Commerzbank AG,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
 BNP Paribas (BNP) ,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   -- Editors:  Chris Peterson , Peter Branton  To contact the reporter on this story:
