Turkmenistan’s President Gurbanguly
Berdymukhammedov held a special meeting of the cabinet and
national  security council  after a fireworks warehouse outside
the capital Ashgabat exploded yesterday.  The explosives ignited because of hot weather, and forced
evacuations from the city of Abadan, according to a  statement 
posted today on the Turkmen government website. There were no
casualties, according to the website.  The president instructed military and law-enforcement
officials to search for any explosives that hadn’t ignited,
according to the statement. Abadan is about 20 kilometers (12
miles) from Ashgabat. The Central Asian nation borders
Afghanistan, Iran and Uzbekistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
