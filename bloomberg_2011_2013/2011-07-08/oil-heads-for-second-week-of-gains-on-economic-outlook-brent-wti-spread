Oil plunged in  New York  after data
showed U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast in June,
stoking concern that fuel demand will be curtailed in the
world’s largest consumer of crude.  Futures fell as much as 2.1 percent. U.S. employers added
18,000 workers in June, the fewest in nine months, data from the
Labor Department in Washington showed. The unemployment rate
unexpectedly climbed to 9.2 percent, the highest level this
year. Crude supplies fell 0.3 percent to 358.6 million barrels
last week, the Energy Department said yesterday, remaining above
their five-year average of 345 million.  “The U.S. data surprised to the downside massively,” said
 Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG
in Frankfurt. “Lower payrolls, higher  unemployment rate  and no
wage growth do not bode well for commodities, so we expect a
further slide ahead.”  Crude for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell as much as $2.09 to $96.58 and was at $96.93 at
1:40 p.m. London time. The contract climbed yesterday to $98.67,
the highest since June 14. The price has risen 2.1 percent this
week. Brent oil for August settlement fell 91 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $117.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The contract surged 4.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
