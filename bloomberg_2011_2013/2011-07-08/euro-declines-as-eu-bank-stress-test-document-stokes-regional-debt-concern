The dollar dropped the most in a
month against the yen after the June payrolls report showed
employers added the fewest jobs in nine months and the
 unemployment rate  increased to the highest level this year.  The yen and Swiss franc gained versus all of the other
major currencies as signs of U.S. weakness spurred demand for a
refuge.  Canada ’s dollar and  Mexico ’s peso tumbled on concern the
nations’ largest trading partner is faltering. The euro slid as
regulators sought to contain debt turmoil with more stringent
disclosure among lenders and after Italian bank stocks sank.  “The number was not strong, and the market was caught on
the wrong foot,” said Lane Newman, director of foreign exchange
at ING Groep NV in New York. “With people not wanting to be in
the dollar, people are buying things like Swiss franc and yen.”  The dollar decreased 0.8 percent to 80.64 yen at 5 p.m. in
 New York , from 81.25 yesterday, a weekly drop of 0.2 percent.
The greenback earlier fell 0.9 percent, the most since June 3,
when it tumbled as much as 1.1 percent on disappointing May
payrolls figures. The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.4265, from
$1.4364. The shared currency dropped 1.4 percent to 115.03 yen,
from 116.70.  Payrolls expanded by 18,000 in June after a revised
increase of 25,000 in the previous month, the Labor Department
reported today. The median forecast of 85 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for 105,000 more jobs. The
unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 9.2 percent.  ‘Horribly Below’  “This number is so horribly below what people expected,”
said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at the online
currency trader GFT Forex in New York. “Yields in the U.S. are
going to remain very low for much longer than the market
anticipated, and that is going to weigh on the dollar.”  Treasury 10-year note yields fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 3.03 percent after touching 3.01 percent,
the lowest level since June 28.  The dollar is the worst performer this year among 10
developed-nation currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Currency Indexes, having fallen 5.6 percent. The euro
has increased 1.3 percent, and the yen had dropped 5 percent.  Mexico’s peso declined for the first time in three days
versus the  U.S. dollar , depreciating 0.7 percent to 11.6256, and
fell 1.5 percent to 6.935 yen. Mexico’s central bank held its
overnight rate at 4.50 percent for a 20th straight meeting.  The Canadian currency slid 0.4 percent to 96.27 cents
versus the greenback. It earlier touched 95.66 cents, the
strongest level since May 11, after the government reported that
Canada’s employers added more jobs last month than economists
forecast. Canada’s dollar dropped 1.2 percent to 83.77 yen.  ‘Big Winner’  “The yen is obviously the big winner, and the commodity
currencies are slipping, especially the Canadian dollar,” said
 Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co .
in New York.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, dropped 2.3
percent to $96.45 a barrel. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
decreased 0.7 percent.  The Swiss franc appreciated 0.9 percent to 83.69 centimes
versus the dollar and gained 1.6 percent to 1.1937 against the
euro. The franc rallied to a record 1.1806 versus the shared
currency on June 24.  The  New Zealand dollar  rose 0.5 percent to 83.78 U.S. cents
after touching the record high of 83.82. The Australian dollar
dropped 0.1 percent to $1.0763.  Obama on Jobs  President  Barack Obama  said today’s job report shows that
“we still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do to give
people the security and opportunity they deserve.” Obama is
summoning top congressional Republicans and Democrats to a July
10 meeting at the White House to begin “hard bargaining” on a
broad debt-reduction deal.  The euro fell 1.8 percent this week versus the dollar, its
biggest drop in almost a month, as European regulators tried to
end the region’s banking crisis by forcing firms to publish
details of capital shortfalls in a more stringent and detailed
set of stress tests.  The cost of insuring against default on Portuguese, Irish
and Greek government debt rose to records. Contracts on  Portugal 
climbed 38 basis points to 1,016, signaling a 58 percent
probability of default within five years, according to CMA
prices in  London .  Italian banks, including  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo
SpA (ISP) , tumbled in Milan, spurring Bank of  Italy  Governor  Mario Draghi  to say he’s certain the nation’s lenders will pass
European stress tests by a “significant” margin.  “There’s a lot of concern about the Italian banks,” said
 Mark McCormick , a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
& Co. in New York. “This is something that’s weighing on the
euro. It gets back to the heart of the euro-zone debt crisis.”  Lenders will have to disclose capital levels, estimates for
profitability in 2011 and 2012 and their holdings of sovereign
debt in the July 15 results, the London-based European Banking
Authority said in a statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
