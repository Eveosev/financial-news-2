Germany ’s upper house of parliament,
where the 16 states are represented, will probably approve the
government’s plan to impose a bank levy for a rescue fund for
the industry, Handelsblatt said, citing negotiators including
Bavarian Finance Minister Georg Fahrenschon.  It’s still unclear which banks will be spared from having
to pay the fee, Handelsblatt said. While Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  wants to exempt the first 250 million euros
($359 million) on any bank’s balance sheet, the states are
pressing for as much as 350 million euros, Handelsblatt said.  The bill, once through the Bundesrat, will exempt small
savings banks and cooperative banks from any payments, the
newspaper said. Banks with a balance sheet of more than 300
billion euros have to pay a fee of 0.0006 percent on the
adjusted balance sheet total, up from an original proposal of a
rate of 0.0004 percent, Handelsblatt said.  The states want to limit the fee a bank has to pay in any
given year to 18 percent of annual profit. Banks would need to
contribute retroactively into the fund for years when making
losses, with the amount calculated as a five-year average in
which losses are counted as zero, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
