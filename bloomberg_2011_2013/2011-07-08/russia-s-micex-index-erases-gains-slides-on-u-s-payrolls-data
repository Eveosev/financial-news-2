Russian stocks slipped by their most
in more than two weeks as oil dropped after the U.S. added fewer
jobs than forecast and the  unemployment rate  climbed.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks retreated 0.9 percent to
1,724.57 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier
advance of as much as 0.5 percent. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest
oil producer, and OAO Gazprom, the natural gas export monopoly,
slid by 1 and 1.3 percent, respectively. OAO Sberbank, the
country’s largest lender, declined by 2.3 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index dropped 0.9 percent to 1,958.4.  Crude oil for August delivery sank by as much as 2.5
percent, to $96.16 a barrel in  New York  after the Labor
Department said U.S. employers added the fewest workers in nine
months and the unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent, the
highest level this year. The contract yesterday climbed to
$98.67 the highest settlement since June 14.  Yulia Bushueva, managing director at Arbat Capital
Management, which is soon to launch its New Kremlin fund,
predicts Russian equities will suffer “a 10 to 15 percent”
correction by the end of July.  “It’s a perfect storm now with  China ’s increasing rates,
poor U.S. economic data and  Europe ’s debt crisis,” Bushueva
said by phone. “Shorting Russian stocks now would be a good
move.” A short position is a bet that an asset’s value will
fall.  Copper, tin, nickel and zinc retreated on the London Metal
Exchange. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s biggest mining
company, slid 0.6 percent to 7,499 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
