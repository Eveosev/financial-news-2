VTB Group, Russiaâ€™s second-biggest
bank, said it obtained a $3.13 billion loan in the largest
syndicated deal for a Russian lender.  The three-year  term loan  was led by  ING Groep NV (INGA)  and
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and will pay interest of
130 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, according to a statement from the Moscow-based bank. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The facility was increased from the $2.7 billion originally
targeted from a group of 18 banks as more institutions joined
the transaction, bringing the total to 27.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch,  Barclays Capital , BNP
Paribas SA, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., China Development
Bank Corp., Citigroup Inc., Commerzbank AG, Credit Agricole CIB,
Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Mizuho Financial Group UFJ Ltd., Morgan
Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Societe Generale SA
and Wells Fargo & Co. joined the deal as book runners, according
to the statement.  The 19 bookrunners agreed to provide $150 million each,
three people with knowledge of the situation said last month.
Nine further banks participated in the wider syndication,
bringing the total to $3.13 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
