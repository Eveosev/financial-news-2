Britain’s  Mark Cavendish  won the
seventh stage of cycling’s Tour de  France , as Norway’s Thor Hushovd kept the race-leading yellow jersey.  Cavendish, of the HTC-Highroad team, won a sprint at the
end of the 218-kilomter (135-mile) stage from Le Mans to
Chateauroux, beating out Italy’s Alessandro Petacchi of Lampre-
ISD and German Andre Greipel of Omega Pharma-Lotto.  It was the second stage win in three days for Cavendish and
his 17th overall at the Tour. It came on the same road in
Chateauroux that he won his first stage in 2008.  “It’s a very, very special day for me,” Cavendish said in
an interview with Eurosport. “I think out of all the stages
this was the one I wanted because of all the sentiment.”  Garmin-Cervelo’s Hushovd finished in seventh place to
maintain his one-second lead over Australian  Cadel Evans  of BMC
Racing, who also finished in the main pack.  Britain’s Bradley Wiggins withdrew from the race after
breaking his collarbone in a crash with about 40 kilometers
remaining. He held his arm in pain as he got up and was taken
away in an ambulance.  “It happened so quick,” Team Sky head coach Shane Sutton
told Eurosport. “He was in really good form. Hopefully we can
repeat that next year.”  Wiggins entered today’s stage in sixth place, 10 seconds
behind Hushovd. He finished fourth in the 2009 Tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
