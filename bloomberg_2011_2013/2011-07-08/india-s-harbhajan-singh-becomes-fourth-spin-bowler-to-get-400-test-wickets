Harbhajan Singh  became the 11th
player in Test cricket to claim 400 wickets as India dismissed
West Indies for 204 before reaching 8-0 on day two of the final
Test in Dominica.  India paceman Ishant Sharma finished with 5-77 to lift his
tally to a series-leading 21 wickets. India’s openers faced four
overs without loss before rain and bad light ended play early.
Only 80.3 of the scheduled 180 overs have been bowled on the
opening two days.  Harbhajan, 31, removed Darren Sammy and Carlton Baugh to
become the fourth spin bowler in 134 years of elite Tests to
reach the 400 wicket mark, following Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan,  Australia ’s Shane Warne and former  India  captain
Anil Kumble.  Top-ranked India, which leads the best-of-three contest
1-0, has never won two Tests in a series in the Caribbean.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
