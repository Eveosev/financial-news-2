Copper fell the most in almost two
weeks after U.S. payrolls rose less than forecast in June,
damping growth prospects.  U.S. employers added 18,000 workers last month, the fewest
in nine months, and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed,
Labor Department data showed today. Economists expected a gain
of 105,000, the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
U.S. is the world’s largest copper consumer after China.  “The market is selling off on a very disappointing jobs
report,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “There’s a reassessment of the
economic recovery in the U.S.”  Copper futures for September delivery declined 3 cents, or
0.7 percent, to close at $4.412 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the biggest loss for a most-active contract
since June 27. The metal still gained 2.5 percent this week and
has climbed 46 percent in the past year.  Prices have dropped 5.3 percent from a record of $4.6575 on
Feb. 15 as manufacturing slowed in  China .  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months lost $79, or 0.8 percent, to $9,661 a metric ton ($4.38 a
pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also fell in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
