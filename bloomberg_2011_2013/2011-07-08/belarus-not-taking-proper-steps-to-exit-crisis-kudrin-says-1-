Belarus isn’t taking “sufficient
steps” to exit its financial crisis and needs a “market”
exchange rate to lift the economy, Russian Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin said.  “The central bank and in part the government aren’t taking
sufficient steps to come out of the crisis,” Kudrin told
reporters in  London  today. Russia “can’t always be paying for
the sins of the government” of Belarus.  Belarus has been importing “substantially more” than
exporting, which led to a current account gap of 16 percent of
gross domestic product, according to Kudrin. The government used
outside loans including from the  International Monetary Fund  to
mask this imbalance instead of gradually devaluing the national
currency over the past three years to correct it, he said.  “Negative trends” in all segments of the domestic
foreign-currency market are easing after the Belarusian ruble
was devalued in May, the Minsk-based central bank said in a
statement on its website today.  The Russia-led Eurasian Economic Community sent $800
million to Belarus on June 21 and may grant $2.2 billion more
over the next three years. Belarus’ international gold and
foreign currency reserves surged by $588 million in June to
$4.15 billion after receiving a bailout loan, the central bank
said in a statement on July 7.  “Help will only be granted after Belarus itself will begin
to take measures to stabilize its own economy,” Kudrin said,
referring to aid from  Russia  and the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
