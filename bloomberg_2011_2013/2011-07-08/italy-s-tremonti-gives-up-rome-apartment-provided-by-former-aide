Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  said he moved out of a Rome apartment provided by Marco
Milanese, a former aide and member of Parliament whose arrest is
sought by prosecutors in Naples.  “I had accepted the offer made by Milanese for the
temporary use of part of the property,” Tremonti said in an e-
mailed statement late yesterday. “After learning the judicial
developments concerning the property, as of this evening I will
change my arrangements.”  On June 26 Milanese resigned from his position at the
 Finance Ministry  as a political adviser to Tremonti after being
interviewed by prosecutors investigating relations between
politicians, businessmen and members of  Italy ’s finance police.  Prosecutors must obtain permission from Parliament’s lower
house to carry out the arrest warrant for Milanese.  To contact the reporter on this story:
