U.K. inflation probably held at more
than double the  Bank of England ’s 2 percent target in June as
higher commodity prices fed price pressures in the economy.  Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier, the
same pace as in May, according to the median forecast of 30
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The  Office for National
Statistics  will publish the data at 9:30 a.m. on July 12.  Centrica Plc today became the second U.K. utility to raise
prices to recoup higher wholesale energy costs and the Bank of
England expects inflation to reach 5 percent in coming months.
Policy makers nevertheless kept their benchmark interest rate on
hold yesterday amid signs that economic growth slowed in the
second quarter.  “We’re looking for the first rate increase in February,”
said  Brian Hilliard , an economist at Societe Generale SA in
London. “There’s a risk they raise rates later, as we need to
see more evidence that the recovery is sustainable.”  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  has said the decision
to maintain emergency stimulus is justified as inflation will
subside and economic activity remains weak.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. economist Malcolm Barr today pushed
back his forecast for the bank to raise borrowing costs to
February from November.  The economy probably grew just 0.1 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three months, the National Institute
for Economic and Social Research said yesterday. Data from the
statistics office show output stagnated over the fourth and
first quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
