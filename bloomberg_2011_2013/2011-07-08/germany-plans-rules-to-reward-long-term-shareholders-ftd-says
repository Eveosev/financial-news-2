Germany ’s governing coalition plans
to introduce rules that reward long-term shareholders with
higher dividends, to achieve more continuity in corporate
governance, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
Patrick Sensburg, a Christian Democrat politician.  The rules may set a threshold of two to three years or
allow for dividend increases proportional to the time shares are
held, the newspaper said. Managers may be required to hold their
companies’ shares for a fixed period, according to the report.  The regulation may either be enacted at national level, or
be part of a European Union framework law, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
