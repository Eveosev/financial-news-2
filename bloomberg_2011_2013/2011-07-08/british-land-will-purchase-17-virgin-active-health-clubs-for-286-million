British Land Co., the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, bought 17 properties
occupied by Virgin Active health clubs from Societe Generale SA
for 179 million pounds ($286 million).  Virgin Active will take out new, 25-year leases on the
properties pending its purchase of smaller competitor Esporta
Plc, London-based British Land said today in a statement. The
developer will gain annual rental income of 13 million pounds.  “This acquisition demonstrates British Land’s ability to
work with banks to unlock opportunities to create incremental
value,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Grigg said in the
statement. “We expect more opportunities will continue to
emerge in the coming year.”  The purchase brings British Land’s spending in the past 18
months to 784 million pounds, generating additional rental
income of 46 million pounds a year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
