Norway , the second-biggest exporter
of natural gas, said production of the fuel fell 26 percent in
June from a year earlier as oil production rose 5 percent.  The country pumped 1.611 million barrels a day of oil, up
from  1.531 million  a year earlier, while gas output dropped to
6.3 billion cubic meters for the month from 8.5 billion,
according to preliminary figures today from the  Norwegian
Petroleum Directorate . Norway produced 277,000 barrels a day of
condensate and gas liquids.  “The low production in June is due to planned maintenance
on several fields,” the directorate said in the statement. Oil
production is “somewhat lower” than the NPD’s forecast for
June, but higher than the outlook for the year to date.’’  Norway, the world’s seventh-biggest oil exporter discovered
oil 40 years ago and many fields are being depleted. Output
peaked in 2000 and is forecast to drop 6 percent this year to
about 1.7 million barrels a day, according to a directorate
estimate.  Following is a table of final data for Norway’s production
in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
