Japan ’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency will be completely separated from the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry following the Fukushima nuclear
crisis, said the minister in charge of the government’s response
to the disaster.  The first stage of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s road map for
containing three reactor meltdowns at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant is expected to be completed on time by mid July, nuclear-
crisis-management minister Goshi Hosono said at a briefing in
Tokyo today.  The road map will be updated July 19, Hosono said. The
government wants to release more information on radiation
emitted from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi station and may do so on the
same day, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
