The cost of insuring against default
on Portuguese, Irish and Greek government debt rose to records,
leading a gauge of the regionâ€™s sovereign risk to an all-time
high, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on  Portugal  climbed 38 basis points to 1,016,
signaling a 58 percent probability of default within five years,
according to CMA prices at 3:30 p.m. in London. Swaps on Ireland
jumped 59 basis points to 914,  Greece  surged 25 to 2,175, and
the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 10 to 256.  Swaps on Italy increased 27.5 basis points to 245, the
highest level since Jan. 11, while  Spain  climbed 7.5 to 310 and
Belgium was up 13 at 174. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The cost of insuring corporate bonds also rose after a
report showed U.S. employers added fewer workers than forecast
in June. Payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, less than the
105,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
 unemployment rate  rose to 9.2 percent, the highest this year.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of contracts linked to 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped 11 basis
point to 421, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings climbed 3 basis points to 112. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers rose 7.5 basis points to 171 and the subordinated
index increased 14 to 303.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
