Rebels in the besieged Libyan city of
Misrata said they captured a village on the outskirts of the
government-held town of Zlitan after three days of fighting.  Rebel forces entered the village, Souk Tulet, where they
were “welcomed by the people,” Radio Misrata reporter Nidal Al
Hassan reported today. The claim could not be independently
confirmed because foreign journalists have been blocked from
visiting frontline areas around Misrata.  The sound of shells exploding every few seconds was heard
today for several hours in Misrata, coming from the direction of
the western front. Zlitan lies about 40 miles (64 kilometers)
from Misrata along the highway to Tripoli, and rebel forces have
launched unsuccessful attacks against it for the past six weeks.  Warplanes from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
carried out strikes July 6 on positions held by Qaddafi
loyalists in the central oil town of Brega, including what it
identified as refueling equipment. The strike on infrastructure
related to  Libya ’s oil assets was the first of its kind, an
alliance official who declined to be identified according to
NATO policy said today from Naples,  Italy .  A battalion of 500 fighters arrived in Misrata from other
parts of rebel-held Libya, boosting the rebel brigades in the
city, said a spokesman for the rebel force, Ibrahim Betalmal.  Six rebel fighters died and more than 30 people were
wounded, some of them civilians, by rockets fired from
government lines into eastern parts of the city, Misrata’s Hikma
hospital said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
