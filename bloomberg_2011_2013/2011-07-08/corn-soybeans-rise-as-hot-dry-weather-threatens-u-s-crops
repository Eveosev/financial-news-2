Corn rose, capping the first weekly
gain since May, and soybeans climbed on concern that hot, dry
weather in the next two weeks will erode crop prospects in the
U.S., the world’s biggest producer and exporter.  Temperatures will approach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38
Celsius) next week from  Nebraska  to southwestern  Indiana  with
overnight lows expected to be above average, increasing stress
on crops, Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a report. Dry, hot
weather will continue from July 19 to July 23, the forecaster
said.  “The U.S. forecast is a little more threatening today,”
said  Dax Wedemeyer , a broker at U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West
Des Moines . “Heat will rob yield potential from crops.”  Corn futures for December delivery jumped 21.5 cents, or
3.5 percent, to close at $6.37 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active contract gained 6.7
percent this week, the first advance in seven weeks, and is up
61 percent in the past year.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 8.75 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $13.465 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached
$13.495, the highest for a most-active contract since June 22.
The oilseed rose 2.6 percent this week, capping the first two-
week rally since May.  Grain prices also got a boost from a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report yesterday showing exports of corn, the main
ingredient in livestock feed, to  China , the world’s leading pork
producer.  U.S. exporters sold 540,000 metric tons to China and an
additional 300,000 tons to unknown destinations for delivery in
the year that begins Sept. 1.  China may buy as much as 5 million tons from the U.S.,
 Argentina  and other suppliers to replenish inventories,
Wedemeyer said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
