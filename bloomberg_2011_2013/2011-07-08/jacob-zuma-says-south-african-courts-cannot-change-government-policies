South African President  Jacob Zuma 
warned the country’s judiciary not to involve itself in policy
determination, saying this was the sole preserve of the
government.  “Once government has decided on the appropriate policies,
the judiciary cannot, when striking down legislation or parts
thereof on the basis of illegality, raise that as an opportunity
to change the policies as determined” by the government, Zuma
said in a speech in Johannesburg today. “In as much as we seek
to respect the powers and role conferred by our Constitution on
the legislature and the judiciary, we expect the same from these
very important institutions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
