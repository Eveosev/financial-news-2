Colombia ’s peso rose to a two-month
high amid increasing investment flows into the South American
nation.  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 1,758.73 per dollar at
11:43 a.m. New York time, from 1,760.90 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,756.50, the strongest level since May 9. The peso has
gained 0.1 percent so far this week and 3.3 percent in the past
three months, the best performance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Significant flows are coming into Colombia,” said Daniel
Lozano, an analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota. “There’s
strong appetite from foreign investors in having exposure to
Colombia, given positive fundamentals such as growth and
controlled inflation.”  Foreign investment into stocks and bonds jumped eight-fold
to $841 million in the first five months of 2011 compared to a
year earlier, according to trade balance figures from the
central bank. Foreign direct investment jumped to $5.75 billion
in the same period, with 86 percent going into oil and mining,
according to the central bank. That compares to $3.68 billion in
the first five months of 2010.  Colombia’s central bank will likely discuss further
currency measures in the July 29 monetary policy meeting,
according to Lozano.  Currency Measures  The peso has been strengthening “at a fast pace,” said
Lozano. “More measures are a possibility.”  In a bid to ease the peso’s rally, Finance Minister Juan
Carlos Echeverry said in April that the government would create
an overseas fund with as much as $1.2 billion from dollars
bought in the local market through the end of 2011, and forgo
repatriating funds from abroad for the rest of the year. Since
Sept. 15, the central bank has bought a minimum of $20 million
daily in the  currency market , and plans to keep up the purchases
until at least Sept. 30.  Banco de la Republica may seek to impose limits on foreign
borrowing, said Lozano.  In minutes published last week of its June 17 monetary
policy meeting, the central bank said it discussed the peso’s
appreciation and that one board member called on the 25 basis
point increase in the overnight lending rate to 4.25 percent to
be the last in order to avoid widening the difference between
Colombian and U.S. rates.  The rise in the rate differential has led to an
“alarming” increase in overseas borrowing, the board member
said, according to the minutes.  Overseas loans jumped to $3.9 billion in the first five
months of the year, up from $2 billion a year earlier, according
to the central bank.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.75 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price declined 0.424
centavo to 118.050 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
