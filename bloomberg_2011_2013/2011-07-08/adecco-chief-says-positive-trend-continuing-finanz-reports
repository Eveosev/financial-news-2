The “positive trend” of the first
quarter is continuing,  Adecco SA (ADEN)  Chief Executive Officer Patrick De Maeseneire was quoted as saying by Finanz &  Wirtschaft.  Bolt-on acquisitions of up to 150 million euros ($214
million) are “possible” this year, De Maeseneire was quoted as
saying by the Zurich-based newspaper in a copy of an article to
be published tomorrow. Adecco is interested in companies
