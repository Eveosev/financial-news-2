Rwanda ’s central bank kept unchanged
its key lending rate, after inflation in urban areas slowed for
the first month in seven.  The Policy Interest Rate was maintained at 6 percent,
 National Bank of Rwanda  Governor Claver Gatete told reporters in
the capital, Kigali, today.  Rwanda’s inflation rate in urban centers fell to 4.54
percent in May from 4.98 the month before as food prices
declined, the Kigali-based  National Institute of Statistics of
Rwanda  said on June 15.  The National Bank of Rwanda left the benchmark interest
rate unchanged at its last meeting on April 12, following three
reductions the year before, to encourage banks to offer clients
more affordable lending and spur economic growth.  Expansion in the coffee-producing nation is expected to
slow to 7 percent this year from 7.5 percent in 2010 as dry
weather crimps farming output, according to both government and
International Monetary Fund estimates. The country is aiming to
bring inflation below 7.5 percent by year-end, Gatete said on
May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
