Canada ’s dollar touched the highest
level since May after a government report showed employers added
more jobs last month than economists forecast.  “It’s a bit of a sister kisser,”  David Watt , senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital unit,
said by phone from Toronto. “It’s fairly neutral,” Watt said,
referring to the Canadian dollar.  The Canadian currency was little changed at 95.88 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 7:12 a.m. in Toronto, compared with 95.87
yesterday, after touching 95.66 cents, the strongest level since
May 11. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0426.  Canada’s economy added 28,400 jobs in June after boosting
payrolls by a net 22,300 positions in the previous month,
 Statistics Canada  reported today. The median forecast of 27
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 15,000.
The jobless rate held at 7.4 percent.  The  Bank of Canada  has held the benchmark overnight rate at
1 percent since September after raising it three times in 2010.
Governor  Mark Carney  reiterated last month in Vancouver that
borrowing costs will “eventually” rise as the economy returns
to full capacity.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 2.1 percent this
year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The

increase in May that was the smallest in eight months, according
to the median forecast of 85 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey before the Labor Department’s report today. The
 unemployment rate  is projected to stay at 9.1 percent.  Companies added more workers in June than forecast, a
report from ADP Employer Services based on payrolls indicated
yesterday. An increase of 157,000 followed a revised gain of
36,000 in the previous month.  Canada’s dollar has weakened 1.1 percent this year versus
the currencies of nine developed nations in the fourth-worst
performance, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
