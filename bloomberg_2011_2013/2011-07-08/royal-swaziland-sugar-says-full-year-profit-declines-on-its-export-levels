Royal Swaziland Sugar Corp. posted a
52 percent decline in full-year profit to 78.8 million
emalangeni compared with a year earlier as a stronger currency
against the dollar and euro reduced income from exports.  Net income fell from 164 million emalangeni, the company
said in a statement published in the Mbabane-based Times of
Swaziland today.  Sugar production dropped 2.8 percent to 414,010 metric
tons, the company said. Royal Swaziland Sugar produces about
two-thirds of the countryâ€™s sugar, according to its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
