China SCE Property Holdings Ltd. (1966)  said
it may post a first-half loss due to a significant increase in
finance costs after the sale of 2 billion yuan ($309 million) of
U.S. dollar debt in January.  The loss was also attributed to the lack of completion of
property development projects in the first six months of the
year, the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. China SCE said it posted a net profit in the same
period last year.  The property company said its financial position and
operations remain “sound and healthy,” and unaudited
contracted sales for the six months rose “significantly” from
the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
