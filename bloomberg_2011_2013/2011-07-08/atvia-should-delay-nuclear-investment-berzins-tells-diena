Latvia should delay a planned
investment in a nuclear power plant in  Lithuania  because the
country’s debt level is too high, President Andris Berzins said
in an interview with the  Diena  newspaper.  Latvia’s debt level is about 45 percent of gross domestic
product, which won’t allow investment in the nuclear plant in
the “coming years,” Berzins said, according to the Riga-based
newspaper. Berzins, who was sworn into office today for a four-
year term, said adding a few billion lati of debt for investment
in the nuclear plant would be “technically not possible,”
Diena reported.  Lithuania, Latvia and  Estonia  have been planning to jointly
invest in the construction of a nuclear power plant to replace a
Soviet era one that was shut down in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
