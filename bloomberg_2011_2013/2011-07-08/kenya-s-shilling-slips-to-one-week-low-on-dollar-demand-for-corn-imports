Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to the
lowest in more than a week against the dollar as companies
bought the U.S. currency on speculation the shilling will weaken
further as the country increases corn imports.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slipped as
much as 0.6 percent to 90.20 per dollar and traded 0.5 percent
down at 90.10 per dollar by 11:55 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital,
extending its drop this week to 1.6 percent. A close at this
level will be the weakest since June 28.  “The shilling is under pressure as businesses seek to
accumulate dollars on anticipation of further weakening in the
coming days driven by importers buying,” Jeremiah Kendagor head
of trading at Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in
a phone interview today. “We expect it to trade within the
89.70 to 90.35 per dollar in the coming days.”  Kenya’s government received a shipment of 8,000 metric tons
of corn, the nation’s staple food, on July 6 to help ease
shortages in the drought-affected country, Diamond Lalji,
chairman of the Cereal Millers Association, said yesterday.
Another shipment is expected next week, with plans to import
54,000 tons from Zambia and Malawi this year, Lalji said.  The shilling depreciated to the weakest in 17 years against
the dollar on June 22, raising the cost of imports. Kenya is
feeling the effects of rising global commodity prices as a
drought forces the country to import more food than it exports.
Corn prices have increased 50 percent over the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
