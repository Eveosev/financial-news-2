A $132.6 million loan backed by the
 PGA National Resort & Spa  in Palm Beach Gardens,  Florida , was
sent to a special servicer today because of imminent default,
according to  Fitch Ratings .  The master servicer is  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and the special
servicer is Situs Co., the debt-rating company said today. The
loan, sponsored by closely held  Walton Street Capital LLC , is
scheduled to mature on Sept. 1 following three 12-month
extensions, according to a July 2010 report by Fitch.  Loans secured by more than 1,540 hotels with a total
outstanding balance of $39.2 billion have gone into or are at
risk of default throughout the U.S., Realpoint LLC, a credit-
rating company that tracks commercial mortgage-backed
securities, said in April. Loans are put on the Horsham,
Pennsylvania-based company’s watch list because of late payments
and declining occupancies or cash flow.  The Palm Beach Gardens  resort  has 379 rooms, suites and
cottages; a 40,000-square-foot (3,700-square-meter) spa; a
39,000-square-foot conference center; and seven restaurants and
lounges. It also features five golf courses, including ones
designed by  Jack Nicklaus  and  Arnold Palmer .  A “significant” portion of the resort’s income is
generated by golf and tennis operations, according to Fitch’s
July 2010 report. When the loan was issued, resort activities
accounted for about 38 percent of total revenue.  Eric Mogentale, a managing principal at Chicago-based
Walton Street, didn’t immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
