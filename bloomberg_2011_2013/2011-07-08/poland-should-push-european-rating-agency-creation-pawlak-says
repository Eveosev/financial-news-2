Poland should use its presidency of
the European Union, which began July 1, to push for the creation
of an independent European rating agency, Economy Minister
Waldemar Pawlak said.  “An independent agency would be a shield to protect
against speculators,” Pawlak said today in an e-mailed
statement. Existing ratings companies can “wipe out” a
European country from one day to another, he added.  Pawlak said he will seek to include the initiative in the
EU’s agenda for the second half of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
