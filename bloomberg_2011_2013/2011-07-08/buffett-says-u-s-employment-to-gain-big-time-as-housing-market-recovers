Billionaire  Warren Buffett  said U.S.
employment will surge with the eventual rebound of the housing
market.  “We will come back big time on employment when residential
construction comes back,” Buffett told Bloomberg Television’s
Betty Liu on the “In the Loop” program today, in an interview
from Sun Valley, Idaho. The unemployment rate will drop to 6
percent “within a few years,” he said.  Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  added about 3,000 jobs
last year after cutting more than 20,000 positions in 2009. The
company employed about 260,000 people at units from insurance
and shipping to consumer goods and energy, Berkshire said in
February. Employment gained last year at Berkshire units
including car insurer Geico and railroad Burlington Northern
 Santa Fe . Staffing fell at carpet-maker Shaw Industries.  “Jobs come with demand,” Buffett said today. “We’re
seeing demand a lot of places but we’re not seeing it in the
construction field.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
