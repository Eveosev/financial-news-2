biggest airline, declined 1 shilling, or 2.9 percent, to 34
shillings, the lowest close since April 13, on concern the
company has yet to provide details on a capital-raising plan of
as much as 23 billion shillings ($255 million).  “The planned capital-raising, most likely through a rights
issue, is causing a lot of uncertainty among investors because
there has been a delay in giving further information,” Eric
Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FLOURMIL)  , which processes
grains and sells cement, fell 4.42 naira, or 5 percent, to 84.18
naira, the lowest level since April 21, after reporting a 44
percent decrease in profit to 9.45 billion naira ($62 million)
for the full year through March, from 16.94 billion naira a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
