Palm oil  climbed for a second day to
the highest level in a week as crude advanced, lifting the
appeal of vegetable oils as a biofuel feedstock, and on gains in
rival soybean oil.  The contract for September delivery climbed as much as 1.8
percent to 3,110 ringgit ($1,039) per metric ton on the  Malaysia 
Derivatives Exchange, the highest level since June 30. The most-
active contract was at 3,080 ringgit at 5:20 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures are up 1.5 percent this week, heading for the
first weekly gain in six.  Palm oil is getting “support from firmer crude oil and
soybean oil last night,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at
LT International Futures (M) Sdn., said by phone from  Kuala
Lumpur . “The market is correcting upwards, from the sharp fall
in the last five weeks.”  Crude oil for August delivery gained as much as 0.3 percent
to $98.97 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was last at $98.15. The contract
yesterday climbed 2.1 percent to $98.67, the highest since June
14. Prices are 3.4 percent higher this week.  Palm oil declined 11.7 percent in the past five weeks
through July 1 on concern that increased production may expand
stockpiles in Malaysia, the second-largest grower. Inventories
climbed 5.8 percent to 2.03 million tons in June, while output
gained 2.3 percent to 1.78 million tons, a Bloomberg survey of
three analysts and two plantation companies showed this week.
The Malaysian Palm Oil Board will release output, inventory and
export data for June on July 11.  There may be some “short covering ahead of next week’s
data, everyone’s expecting it to be bearish,” said Chandran.
Short-covering refers to investors reversing bets on declining
prices.  ‘Soy Complex’  Soybean oil  for delivery in December climbed as much as 0.2
percent to 57.76 cents a pound, extending yesterday’s 2.2
percent gain. Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 1.5
percent on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the biggest
gain since June 2. The oilseed rose as much as 0.3 percent today,
before trading at $13.38.  “Soybean oil led the gains in the soy complex due to firm
cash markets and expectations for increased demand for
biofuel,” Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Mumbai-based
Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt., said in a report today.
“Some  weather forecasts  are calling for warmer and drier
weather in the Midwest.”  Temperatures will be above normal in the next seven days in
the Midwest and the next two weeks across the southern U.S.,
increasing stress on crops, according to  T-Storm Weather LLC  in
 Chicago . About 39 percent of the growing region for soybeans and
corn got less rain than usual in the past two weeks, leaving
soil with moisture deficits, the forecaster said.  January-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
climbed as much as 1.6 percent to 8,980 yuan ($1,389) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month gained as much as 1.2
percent to 10,234 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
