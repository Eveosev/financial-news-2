The Czech Republic’s benchmark equity
index dropped for a third trading day after a U.S. report showed
the world’s largest economy added fewer jobs than expected in
June and unemployment rose.  The PX gauge of 14 companies retreated 0.9 percent to
1,219.6 by its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague. It lost 1.3 percent
this week, the most since the five days ended June 10. The
market was closed July 5 and 6 for a public holiday.  Stocks and commodities sank worldwide while Treasuries rose
after the U.S. Labor Department data dented confidence in the
global economic recovery. In Czech trading, power utility  CEZ AS (CEZ) 
slid 1.1 percent and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  fell 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
