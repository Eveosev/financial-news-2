Slovenia is likely to spend 493
million euros ($708 million) to fund financial companies in a
proposed revised budget, Finance newspaper  reported,  citing a
government draft document.  Itâ€™s unclear how the money will be used, according to the
Ljubljana-based newspaper. Slovenia needs a budget review after
voters rejected pension changes in a June referendum that were
designed to control spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
