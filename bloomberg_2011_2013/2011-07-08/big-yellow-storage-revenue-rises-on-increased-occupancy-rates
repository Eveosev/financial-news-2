Big Yellow Group Plc (BYG) , the U.K.’s
largest operator of self-storage warehouses, said fiscal first-
quarter sales increased as customers rented more storage space.  Revenue at Big Yellow’s 52 wholly owned outlets rose 6.3
percent to 15.3 million pounds ($24.4 million) in the period
ended June 30, from 14.4 million pounds a year earlier, the
London-based company said in a statement distributed by the
Regulatory News Service today. Sales for 11 “partnership”
stores increased 75 percent to 1.4 million pounds.  Total occupancy of the company’s storage space rose by
162,000 square feet during the quarter, while rent per square
foot was little changed, as some new customers benefited from
special deals, the company said. Big Yellow opened one new store
in  London  in the period, and has seven under development.  “Given the continuing uncertainties in the macroeconomic
environment it is right to remain cautious,” Chief Executive
Officer James Gibson said in the statement. “We are however
encouraged by the continuing positive performance of this
business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
