Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s shareholders are in a
win-win situation as the world’s largest drugmaker considers
whether to spin off or sell its baby-food unit as part of a
corporate overhaul.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a comparable spinoff has
paid off at  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) , which got out of the
infant-formula business by distributing its stake in  Mead
Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN)  in December 2009.  Mead Johnson has climbed about five times as much as
Bristol-Myers since the split, as depicted in the chart. The
companies went their separate ways 10 months after an initial
public offering of the unit’s shares.  Pfizer’s holders may fare even better if the company exits
 baby food  through a sale instead, according to Seamus Fernandez,
an analyst at Leerink Swann LLC.  “Demand would be high” and a sale would be relatively
straightforward, Fernandez wrote yesterday in a report. He
estimated that the unit’s price tag would be about $10 billion,
or 5 times sales.  Anyone looking for a spinoff may have to set their sights
on Pfizer’s animal-health unit, the report said. The drugmaker
said yesterday that it would divest that business, along with
baby food, while keeping units that make consumer health-care
products and off-patent prescription drugs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
