Exports of the North Sea Forties
crude for August will total 16 cargoes, seven less than this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments next month will total 9.6 million barrels, or
309,677 barrels a day, according to the plan. That’s down 30
percent from July.  The July program originally comprised 18 cargoes. Over the
past month, one shipment was dropped, two were added and four
were deferred from June to July, resulting in a total of 23
consignments for the month.  Forties is one of four North Sea oil grades used to price
crude from the  Middle East , Africa and  Russia . The other blends
are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil company, will shut the
Forties Pipeline System from Aug. 1 to Aug. 5 for planned
maintenance and the removal of an unexploded World War II mine
found in March, Mark Salt, a London-based spokesman for the
company, said in an e-mailed statement on May 31.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
