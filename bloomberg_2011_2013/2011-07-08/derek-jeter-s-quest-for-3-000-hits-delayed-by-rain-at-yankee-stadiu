Derek Jeter ’s quest for his 3,000th
hit was delayed tonight when the  New York  Yankees canceled their
game against the  Tampa Bay Rays  because of thunderstorms.  The 37-year-old shortstop is two hits shy of becoming the
28th player in Major League Baseball history and the first
Yankee to reach the milestone. The Yankees have two more home
games scheduled this weekend against the Rays before the All-
Star break.  If Jeter doesn’t reach the milestone before the break, he
may not get it at Yankee Stadium, as New York has an eight-game
road trip in Toronto and Tampa, Florida, from July 14-21. No
player has reached 3,000 hits at Yankee Stadium, old or new.  Tonight’s game was rescheduled for Sept. 22, the Yankees
said. No start time was set.  Fans with paid tickets for tonight’s game may use them for
the Sept. 22 game or exchange them for any regular season game
at Yankee Stadium within 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
