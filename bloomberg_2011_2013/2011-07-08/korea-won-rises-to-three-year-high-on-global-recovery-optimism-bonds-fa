South Korea ’s won climbed to its
highest level in almost three years after companies in the U.S.
added twice as many workers as forecast in June, shoring up
confidence the global economic recovery will be sustained.  The currency gained for a third week against the dollar
after Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said two days ago that the
local economy was expected to expand faster in the second half
of 2011 than in the first six months. The current-account
surplus probably widened in June from May on an increase in the
 trade surplus , the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said in a
monthly economic report yesterday.  “The won started off on a very strong note amid signs that
the global economy is expanding,” said Hwang Sun Min, a Seoul-
based currency dealer with Kookmin Bank, the nation’s largest
lender. “The won’s upward momentum will continue.”  The won closed 0.7 percent higher at 1,057.08 per dollar as
of the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul , contributing to a 0.9 percent
weekly advance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s
gained 6.4 percent this year and today touched 1,056.44, the
strongest level since August 2008.  The current-account surplus reached a seven-month high of
$2.26 billion in May, according to the central bank. The
indicator is the broadest measure of trade, tracking goods,
services and investment income. U.S. employers added 157,000
workers to their payrolls in June, more than double the 70,000
forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey, according to
figures released yesterday by ADP Employer Services.  International investors bought $1.18 billion more Korean
shares than they sold this week through yesterday, according to
exchange data. Gross domestic product is expected to rise 5
percent in the second half from a year earlier after increasing
3.9 percent in the first, the  finance ministry  said on June 30.  Government bonds  declined today, pushing yields to the
highest level since May 11. The rate on the 4 percent notes due
March 2016 rose four basis points to 4.07 percent, according to
prices from Korea Exchange Inc. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
