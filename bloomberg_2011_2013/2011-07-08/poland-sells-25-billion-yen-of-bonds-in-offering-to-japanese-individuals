Poland  sold 25 billion yen ($307
million) of four-year Samurai bonds in its first offering to
individual investors in  Japan .  The bonds maturing in July 2015 were priced to yield 1.25
percent or 71 basis points over mid-swaps, the  Finance Ministry 
said in a  statement  on its website today. Samurai bonds are yen-
denominated debt sold in Japan by overseas borrowers. Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co. managed the sale.  “The issue of retail bonds on the Japanese market is
Poland’s first in this segment of the market,” according to the
ministry’s statement. “It’s also the first such sale from a
foreign sovereign issuer on the Japanese market for retail bonds
since 2001.”  The offering to Japanese individuals follows a 10 billion-
yen sale of 15-year bonds last month in a second private
transaction of the debt this year. The bonds maturing in January
2026 were priced to yield 3 percent,  Piotr Marczak , director at
the Finance Ministry’s public debt department, said June 27.  Poland faces a total of 98.3 billion yen of debt coming due
next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
