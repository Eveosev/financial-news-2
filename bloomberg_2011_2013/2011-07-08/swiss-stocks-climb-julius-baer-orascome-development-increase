Stocks in Switzerland dropped,
pushing the benchmark  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  to a weekly decline,
after a report showed that employers in the U.S. added the
fewest workers in nine months and unemployment climbed.  Adecco SA, the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, slumped 3.7 percent.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest banks, each fell more than 1.5 percent.
 Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-largest cement maker, decreased
2.3 percent.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, dropped 0.9 percent to 6,152.69 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich. The gauge has declined 1.4
percent this week. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
retreated 0.9 percent.  “The jobs report is disappointing,” said Konstantin Giantiroglou, the head of investment advisory at Neue Aargauer
Bank in Brugg,  Switzerland . “The market is a bit stunned by the
negative results, but while this figure is certainly bad, the
market will focus on the incoming data in the next two weeks.”  The SMI has tumbled 8.4 percent since its high this year on
Feb. 18 as U.S. manufacturing and jobs reports fueled concern
that the recovery is faltering and investors speculated that
Greece will default on its debt.  The Labor Department report showed that the  U.S. economy 
added 18,000 workers in June, the smallest number since
September 2010. The release also showed an unexpected increase
in the unemployment rate, indicating that the labor market
continues to struggle.  U.S. Payrolls  The Labor Department also revised down the net number of
workers that the economy added in May to 25,000 from the initial
estimate of 25,000. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey called for a June gain of 105,000. The  unemployment rate 
rose to 9.2 percent, the highest level this year. Hiring by
companies, which excludes government agencies, was the weakest
since May 2010.  Adecco slumped 3.7 percent to 53.60 Swiss francs. The
company generated 19 percent of its revenue from North America
in 2010.  UBS slipped 2.8 percent to 14.73 francs and Credit Suisse
lost 1.7 percent to 31.84 francs as a gauge of European banks
was the worst performer of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, dropping 2.3 percent.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) ,
the 121-year-old wealth manager, fell 2.9 percent to 34.31
francs, its biggest retreat since April.  Holcim dropped 2.3 percent to 60.70 francs after Berenberg
Bank initiated coverage of the stock with a “sell”
recommendation.  Orascom Development Holding  Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , the owner of holiday
resorts on Egypt’s Red Sea coast, jumped 4.3 percent to 30.55
Swiss francs, its highest price in a month, as its Andermatt
Swiss Alps AG unit forecast 2011 sales of 120 million francs
($143 million) and said it picked up reservations of 22.5
million francs in the first half.  Kuoni Reisen Holding AG (KUNN) , a holiday bookings firm, gained
1.2 percent to 330 francs as Matthias Desmarais, an equity
analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, raised the company’s shares to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
