North Sea Flotta crude exports will
fall to one cargo next month, compared with two in July,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Shipment in August will consist of one 650,000-barrel
consignment, or 20,968 barrels a day, the program showed.
 Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  operates the field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
