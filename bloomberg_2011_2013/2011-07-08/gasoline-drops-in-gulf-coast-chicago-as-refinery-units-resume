Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  and
Chicago fell as  BP Plc (BP)  planned to resume normal operations on an
ultraformer at its Texas City plant and Husky Energy Inc.
expected to increase rates with units returning to service at
the Lima refinery in Ohio.  The ultraformer at BPâ€™s 475,000-barrel-a-day refinery was
scheduled to start at 6 a.m. local time today, according to a
filling with state regulators. Husky will exceed 80 percent
capacity later today as a coker goes back online, Carla Yuill, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The differential for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in
the Gulf Coast slipped 1.5 cents to a discount of 0.8 cent a
gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:39 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery fell 4.2 cents to $3.092 a gallon.  Husky shut the 155,000-barrel-a-day Lima plant for repairs
June 27 after a leak was found in a crude unit furnace.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago  widened 0.25 cent to 8 cents a gallon, the lowest level
since June 24.  The differential for the same fuel in the Midwest, or Group
3, widened 0.75 cent to a discount of 6.75 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
