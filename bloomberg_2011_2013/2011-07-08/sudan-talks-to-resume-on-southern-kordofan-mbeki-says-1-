Sudan  is ready to resume negotiations
to end clashes in the border state of Southern Kordofan, former
South African President  Thabo Mbeki  said, denying that Umar al- Bashir’s government had pulled out of the talks.  Mbeki, the African Union-appointed mediator for Sudan, said
today that negotiations between President al-Bashir’s government
and the northern branch of South Sudan’s ruling party would
resume after the south gains independence tomorrow. He travelled
to Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on July 6.  “We met Bashir two days ago and he did not say the
framework agreement has collapsed and he did not say he is
turning his back on negotiations between the SPLM north and the
government,” Mbeki told reporters in the Ethiopian capital,
 Addis Ababa .  Al-Bashir said yesterday his government was no longer
prepared to negotiate on Southern Kordofan outside the country.
“There will be no more negotiations outside Sudan,” he told a
rally in White Nile state in a speech televised live on the
state Sudan TV station.  Clashes between Sudanese government forces and troops loyal
to  Southern Sudan ’s army in Southern Kordofan have forced more
than 73,000 people to flee their homes since June 5, according
to the  United Nations . The fighting there and in the disputed
border region of Abyei raised concern about the possible
resumption of a two-decade civil war that ended in 2005.  To contact the reporters on this story:
