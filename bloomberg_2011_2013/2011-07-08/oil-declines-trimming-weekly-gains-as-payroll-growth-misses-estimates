Crude oil dropped, paring a second
weekly gain, after the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast in
June and the unemployment rate climbed, damping optimism for an
economic rebound and growth in fuel demand.  Futures fell 2.5 percent after the Labor Department said
U.S. employers added the fewest workers in nine months and the
unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent, the highest level this
year. The premium of London’s Brent oil over New York crude
briefly breached the record set June 15.  “The employment data clearly represents a real setback for
the economy,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital
LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “These
numbers go right to the heart of the demand picture for gasoline
and other fuels.”  Crude oil for August delivery declined $2.47 to settle at
$96.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the
biggest drop since June 23. The contract yesterday climbed to
$98.67, the highest close since June 14. Prices rose 1.3 percent
this week and have increased 28 percent in the past year.  Brent crude oil for August settlement fell 26 cents to end
the session at $118.33 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The contract increased 5.9 percent this week.  Brent’s premium to West Texas Intermediate, the grade
traded in New York, widened to $22.13 a barrel, earlier reaching
$22.43. Libyan output cuts and North Sea maintenance underpin
the European benchmark grade as economic concern and ample
stockpiles send U.S. oil lower.  Brent Premium  The gap between front-month futures of both grades surged
to a record $22.29 on a settlement basis on June 15. The spread
narrowed when the International Energy Agency said June 23 it
would release 60 million barrels to the market.  U.S. payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, Labor Department
data showed in Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a gain of 105,000. Hiring by companies
was the weakest since May 2010. Average hourly earnings fell 1
cent to $22.99, today’s report showed. The average work week for
all workers dropped to 34.3 hours from 34.4 the prior month.  “The U.S. data surprised to the downside massively,” said
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG
in Frankfurt. “Lower payrolls, higher unemployment rate and no
wage growth do not bode well for commodities, so we expect a
further slide ahead.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1 percent to
1,339.92, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.8
percent to 12,621.90. The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
dropped 0.8 percent to 685.68.  Yesterday’s Gain  Oil surged 2.1 percent yesterday after data from ADP
Employer Services showed a 157,000 gain in the number employed
by businesses last month. U.S. initial jobless claims fell by
14,000 to 418,000 in the week ended July 2, according to Labor
Department figures released yesterday.  “We had a run-up on enthusiasm about the economy and this
jobs number has knocked the props out from under the market,”
said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic
Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. “Demand is very weak,
down almost 2 percent from a year ago over the last four weeks,
which is a lot of oil.”  U.S. fuel demand was little changed at 19 million barrels a
day over the past four weeks, 1.8 percent lower than a year
earlier, an Energy Department report showed yesterday.  Crude-oil supplies fell 889,000 barrels to 358.6 million
last week, the department said. A 2.5 million-barrel drop was
projected, according to the median on 15 analyst forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  NATO Attack  Brent gained relative to other grades after warplanes from
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization carried out strikes July
6 on positions held by forces loyal to Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi
in the town of Brega, including refueling equipment. The strike
on infrastructure related to Libya’s oil assets was the first of
its kind, an alliance official who declined to be identified
according to NATO policy said today from Naples, Italy.  The Libyan revolt, which began in February, has reduced the
availability of light, sweet crude, or oil with low density and
sulfur content. The African country’s output fell 50,000
barrels, or 25 percent, to 150,000 barrels a day last month, a
Bloomberg News survey showed, the lowest amount in yearly data
since 1962.  Daily exports of the four North Sea crude grades that
determine Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of the
world’s oil, will drop to the lowest level in more than four
years, loading programs obtained by Bloomberg showed.  Shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk grades
will total 27.85 million barrels, or 898,387 barrels a day, in
August, the plans showed. That is 16 percent less than in July.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 615,128
contracts as of 3:20 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 726,406
contracts yesterday, 5.7 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.54 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
