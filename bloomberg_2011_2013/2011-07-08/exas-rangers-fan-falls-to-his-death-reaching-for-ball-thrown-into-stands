A Texas Rangers fan fell to his death
last night as he reached for a ball thrown into the stands by
outfielder  Josh Hamilton .  The accident happened during the second inning of the
Rangers’ Major League Baseball game against the  Oakland
Athletics  at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas, according to
the team’s website. The unidentified man fell head-first
approximately 20 feet behind the scoreboard.  “We are deeply saddened that the man who fell has passed
away,” Rangers President  Nolan Ryan  said in a statement on the
team’s website after the Rangers’ 6-0 win. “Our thoughts and
prayers are with his family.”  It was a year ago that Tyler Morris tumbled 30 feet from
the second-deck stands while trying to catch a foul ball at the
same venue. The 25-year-old sustained a fractured skull and
sprained ankle when he landed on four people at the July 5,
2010, game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
