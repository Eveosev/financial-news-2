New York  Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter  and third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  won’t play in Major
League Baseball’s All-Star Game, the team said in an e-mailed
statement.  Jeter, who was elected to start the July 12 game in Phoenix
and is two hits from becoming the 28th major-leaguer to reach
3,000 for his career, told reporters today that he is skipping
the game to rest while coming back from a strained calf,
according to the Associated Press. He is in the lineup tonight
at Yankee Stadium against the Tampa Bay Rays.  Jeter came back from the disabled list on July 4 and has
four hits since returning.  Rodriguez, also named an All-Star starter by fans, was sent
for an MRI on his sore right knee and won’t play tonight, AP
said.  The team statement didn’t give a reason for the two players
skipping the All-Star Game.  Six Yankees were named All-Stars. Relief pitcher
 Mariano Rivera  withdrew yesterday to rest his pitching arm,
which has been sore in recent days.  Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano and center fielder
Curtis Granderson are still scheduled to start the All-Star
Game, while catcher Russell Martin is a reserve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
