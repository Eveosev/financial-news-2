Dangote Group  of Nigeria plans to
build what it says will be Africa’s biggest fertilizer plant in
the country’s southern Edo state, with production scheduled to
start by 2014.  The company signed an agreement with  Saipem SpA (SPM) ’s Nigerian
unit to build the plant, which will include two trains, each
with the capacity for 3,850 metric tons a day of urea, the
Lagos-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. The
plant will also produce 2,200 tons of ammonia a day.  The plant will make Nigeria “self-sufficient in fertilizer
production and even have the capacity to export,” Aliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, was quoted as saying in
the statement.  While  Nigeria  is Africa’s top oil producer, agriculture,
dominated by subsistence farming, contributes the biggest share
of the country’s gross domestic product at 41 percent, according
to data from the  statistics office . Improved fertilizer supply
will provide added boost to agricultural productivity, Dangote
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
