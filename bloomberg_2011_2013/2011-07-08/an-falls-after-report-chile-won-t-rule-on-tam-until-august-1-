Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , Latin America’s
largest airline by market value, fell after Chile’s antitrust
tribunal president Tomas Menchaca told newspaper La Tercera that
a ruling on Lan’s planned takeover of  Brazil ’s Tam SA probably
won’t be delivered until August.  The tribunal previously estimated the outcome of its
investigation would be made known by the end of this month.  Lan fell 2.4 percent to 13,815 pesos in Santiago at 10:42
a.m. New York time. In the last two days it has fallen 3.2
percent. Shares rose 15 percent from June 17 to July 6 on
speculation that the deal will be approved.  “We still consider an approval of the deal is the most
likely scenario, so the delay shouldn’t have an effect on the
stock,” the brokerage unit of Banco de Credito & Inversiones
said in an e-mailed note to clients.  Tam fell 2.8 percent in  Sao Paulo  to 35.84 reais, its
second day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
