Canada ’s dollar weakened after a U.S.
government report showed employers added fewer jobs last month
than economists forecast.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, fell the most
against the Swiss franc as U.S. employers hired 18,000 workers
in June, less than forecast and the fewest in nine months, while
the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed, boosting concern
that the  U.S. economy  is struggling. Canada ships about three
quarters of its exports to the U.S. Canada’s currency
strengthened earlier after a report showed the nation added more
jobs than forecast last month.  “The U.S. numbers were a disappointment, and the loonie is
falling out of bed,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of
foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada  in Toronto. “Bad
economic news in the States typically hits the Canadian
dollar.”  The Canadian currency fell 0.4 percent to 96.27 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with 95.87 yesterday.
It declined 1.4 percent to 86.80 Swiss centimes. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0389.  The increase in U.S. payrolls followed a 25,000 gain that
was less than half the rise initially estimated, Labor
Department data showed today in  Washington . The median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a June gain of 105,000.
The unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent, the highest level
this year. Hiring by companies, which excludes government
agencies, was the weakest since May 2010.  ‘Horrid Number’  The U.S. employment report “says it all,”  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in Toronto at the online currency-
trading firm Oanda Corp., said in an e-mail. It’s “a horrid
number for markets and for the loonie that is guilty by
association. A sliver of optimism that we had has been thrown to
the sidelines.”  The loonie earlier touched the highest level since May
after a government report showed Canada’s employers added more
jobs last month than economists forecast.  Canada’s economy created 28,400 jobs in June after boosting
payrolls by a net 22,300 positions in the previous month,
 Statistics Canada  reported today. The median forecast of 27
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 15,000.
The jobless rate held at 7.4 percent.  Employment in Canada “remains supportive of consumption
going into the third quarter,” Matthieu Arseneau, an economist
at National Bank Financial in  Montreal , said in a note to
clients. “The U.S. soft patch in the first half did not affect
the Canadian labor market performance. This bodes well for the
domestic demand going forward.”  Yields Fall  Yields on two-year Government of Canada bonds fell eight
basis points, or 0.08 percent, to 1.5 percent, pushing the price
of the 2 percent note due in August 2013 up 16 cents to
C$101.01. The yield on the 10-year note fell nine basis points
to 2.96 percent.  Crude oil futures fell 2.2 percent to $96.52 a barrel in
New York as of 5:13 p.m. Crude is Canada’s largest export.
Copper futures for September delivery declined 3 cents, or 0.7
percent, to close at $4.412 a pound on the Comex in  New York .
Canada derives about half its export revenue from raw materials.  Canada’s dollar has weakened 1.7 percent this year versus
the currencies of nine other developed nations in the fourth-
worst performance, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes. The greenback has fallen 5.6 percent, the yen
is off 5 percent and sterling is down 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
