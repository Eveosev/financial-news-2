Brazil ’s real fell after U.S.
employers added the fewest workers in nine months, stoking
concern that global growth is weakening and diminishing demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The real lost 0.4 percent this week to close at 1.5625 per
dollar, from 1.5560 a week earlier. The currency declined 0.5
percent today.  U.S. employers increased payrolls by 18,000 workers in
June, less than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists, which called for growth of 105,000.
The increase followed a 25,000 gain that was less than half the
initial estimate. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed to
9.2 percent.  “The number was a splash of cold water,” said Marina Santos, chief economist at Squanto Investments in  Sao Paulo .
“Once again we have doubts about growth in the U.S. and the
global economy,” she said in a telephone interview.  Stocks sank, commodities slid and Treasuries jumped as
slower-than-forecast job growth damped optimism about the
economic recovery. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7
percent to 1,343.  “The global economy is fragile, and there are concerns
about  Europe ,” said  Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at CM
Capital Markets in Sao Paulo. “This is generating a flight to
quality,” he said.  Euro Depreciates  A European Union document on bank stress tests deepened
concern that the region’s debt crisis may intensify. The euro
depreciated 0.7 percent to $1.4265. The 10-year Treasury yield
decreased 11 basis points to 3.03 percent.  Yields on Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts rose as
traders bet weak job growth in the U.S. won’t deter the central
bank from raising  interest rates  after inflation jumped to a
six-year high in June.  “Independent of the external deceleration, the central
bank may still have to do a greater tightening,” said  Roberto Padovani , chief economist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA in Sao
Paulo.  Yields on the contract due in January rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.50 percent.  Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.71 percent in
June, the fastest pace since June 2005, the national statistics
agency said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
