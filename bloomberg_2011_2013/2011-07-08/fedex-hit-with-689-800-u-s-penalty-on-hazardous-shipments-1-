The  Federal Aviation Administration 
proposed a civil penalty of $689,800 against  FedEx Corp. (FDX) , saying
the world’s largest cargo airline violated U.S. hazardous-
materials regulations.  FedEx failed to provide pilots with complete and accurate
information about hazardous materials on board their planes in
89 instances from June 13, 2009, to Sept. 4, 2009, the FAA said
in a statement today. Between June 18, 2009, and Aug. 26, 2009,
FedEx accepted four shipments of hazardous materials for air
transportation that weren’t accurately described and certified
in shipping documents, the agency said.  “Pilots must know they are carrying dangerous goods so
they can take all necessary safety precautions,” FAA
Administrator  Randy Babbitt  said in a statement. “Shippers and
airlines must follow the rules so they are able to move these
materials safely.”  The citations were for “minor documentation errors,”
Sally Davenport, a spokeswoman for  Memphis , Tennessee-based
FedEx, said by telephone today.  Davenport said she didn’t immediately know the contents of the
89 packages. “All of these shipments traveled safely through
our system and never posed any danger whatsoever to our aircraft
or our crew members,” Davenport said.  FedEx Express, the company’s air service, handles 3.5
million packages every day, 0.5 percent of which have contents
classified as hazardous materials, according to Davenport. About
one-third of the hazardous-material shipments involve food, dry
ice, paint, perfume and other everyday items, she said.  FedEx has asked to meet with FAA officials to discuss the
proposed penalty, Davenport said. The company has “addressed
the deficiency with those involved in the matter -- our
employees, in other words -- and provided them with feedback and
additional training,” she said.  Shares of FedEx were down $1.24 at $97.26 as of 1:56 p.m.
from yesterday’s close of $98.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
