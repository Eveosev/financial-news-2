Following is the text of
 Canada 's
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Employment rose for the third consecutive month, up
28,000 in June. The unemployment rate was unchanged at
7.4% as the number of people participating in the labour
market increased. Over the past 12 months, employment has
grown by 238,000 (+1.4%).  Employment was up in transportation and warehousing in
June, while it fell in professional, scientific and
technical services. There was little change in the other
industries.  Increases in the number of employees working in the
public and private sectors were tempered by a decline in
the number of self-employed. Over the past 12 months,
public sector employment rose by 2.5%, private sector
employment was up 1.5%, while the number of self-employed
was little changed.  Ontario, Alberta and Nova Scotia posted employment
gains in June, while there were declines in Quebec as well
as Newfoundland and Labrador. Employment was little
changed in the other provinces.  The bulk of June's employment increase occurred among
women aged 25 to 54.  Compared with 12 months earlier, the  unemployment rate 
for students aged 17 to 19 was down in June, while it was
little changed for students aged 20 to 24.  Gains in transportation and warehousing  Employment rose by 15,000 in transportation and
warehousing in June. Since June 2010, this industry
experienced the fastest employment growth of all
industries at 5.4% (+43,000).  Following steady growth since the start of 2011,
employment in professional, scientific and technical
services was down 19,000 in June. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment in the industry is up 1.3% (+16,000).  For the third consecutive month, employment in
construction was little changed. However, the number of
people working in this industry has increased by 3.2%
(+39,000) since June 2010.  Manufacturing employment was little changed in June,
following a decline in May. Over the past 12 months,
employment in this industry has risen by 30,000 or 1.7%,
slightly faster than the pace of overall employment growth
(+1.4%).  Public sector adds employees while self-employment
declines  The number of employees in the public sector rose by
51,000 in June, while it was up 22,000 in the private
sector. At the same time, the number of self-employed fell
by 44,000.  Over the past 12 months, employment has grown 2.5% in
the public sector (+87,000). Over the same period, private
sector employment increased by 1.5% (+159,000), while the
number of self-employed was little changed.  Part-time work accounted for much of the monthly
increase in June. Over the past 12 months, however, growth
in full time contributed 205,000 of the 238,000 increase
in overall employment.  Ontario and  Alberta  drive employment gains  Employment in Ontario was up 40,000 in June, following
a slight decline in May. Over the past 12 months,
employment in the province increased 114,000 (+1.7%),
almost entirely in full-time work. The unemployment rate
fell by 0.2 percentage points in June to 7.7%.  In Alberta, employment rose by 22,000. At the same
time, the unemployment rate edged up to 5.6%, as there
were more people looking for work. Employment in the
province continued on its upward trend, growing by 3.5%
between June 2010 and June 2011, more than twice the
national pace of growth (+1.4%).  Nova Scotia also posted employment gains in June, up
3,800. Despite this gain, employment in the province is
down 0.8% over the past 12 months.  Employment in  Quebec  fell by 16,000, mostly among 15-
to 24-year-olds. An increase in the number of people
looking for work pushed the unemployment rate up 0.6
percentage points to 7.9%.  Newfoundland and Labrador also experienced a decline in
employment in June, down 7,400. Nevertheless, employment
in the province was 2.4% above the level of June 2010.  Employment growth primarily among core-aged women  Employment rose by 28,000 among core-aged women (25 to
54 years) in June, while it held steady among the other
demographic groups.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased
at the fastest pace among workers aged 55 and over, with
growth of 5.4% (+71,000) among women and 4.0% (+64,000)
among men. Over the same period, employment among core-
aged men increased by 1.3% (+79,000), while it was little
changed for core-aged women and youths.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects
labour market information about young people aged 15 to 24
who were attending school full time in March and intend to
return to school in the fall. The May and June survey
results provide the first indicators of the summer job
market, while the July and August data will provide
further insight. The published estimates are not
seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only be
made on a year-over-year basis.  For students aged 20 to 24, the employment rate was
little changed at 67.4% in June compared with June 2010.
However, this rate was 4.2 percentage points above their
rate in June 2009, a time when the student job market was
particularly affected by the labour market downturn. The
unemployment rate of 11.0% for these students was little
changed in June compared with June 2010.  In June, the employment rate for 17- to 19-year-old
students was 53.8%, slightly above their rates in both
June 2010 and June 2009. Their unemployment rate fell 2.2
percentage points to 13.8% in June compared with June
2010.  Quarterly update on the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is
produced monthly in the form of three-month moving
averages. Not all estimates are seasonally adjusted,
therefore comparisons should only be made on a year-over-
year basis.  All three territories saw employment gains in the
second quarter compared with the same quarter of 2010.  In Yukon, employment increased by 1,700 (+9.7%) in the
second quarter compared with the same quarter in 2010. At
the same time, the unemployment rate declined by 1.6
percentage points to 6.3%.  Employment in the  Northwest Territories  rose by 1,000
(+4.6%) from the second quarter of 2010 to the second
quarter in 2011. The unemployment rate was little changed
at 8.1%.  In Nunavut, employment increased by 500 (+4.4%) in the
second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2010.
The unemployment rate was 16.6%, 2.6 percentage points
lower than the same quarter of 2010.  Note to readers  Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information (71-
001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
