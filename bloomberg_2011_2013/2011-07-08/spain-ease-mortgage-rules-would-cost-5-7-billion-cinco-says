Spanish banks may need to raise as
much as 4 billion euros ($5.7 billion) of capital if the
countryâ€™s congress approves rules that would allow homeowners to
hand over the keys to cancel mortgages,  Cinco Dias  reported
citing an study from consultants  Oliver Wyman .  Lenders may be forced to take into their balance sheet up
to 400,000 properties, the newspaper said, according to the
study. The Spanish Banking association is using the conclusions
of the study to lobby against the proposal to ease mortgage
conditions, Cinco Dias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
