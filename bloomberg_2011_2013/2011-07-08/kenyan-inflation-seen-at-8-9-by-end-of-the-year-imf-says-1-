Raising  interest rates  may help
Kenya’s central bank combat increased fuel and food costs and
bring inflation down to 8 percent to 9 percent by the end of the
year, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  An increase in tourism and rising private sector investment
are likely to buoy economic growth, which is expected to reach
5.7 percent for the 2012 fiscal year, the IMF said in a
statement on its website yesterday.  “Strong growth continues in 2011, with the exception of
the agricultural sector, expected to decelerate significantly as
a result of weather disturbances in the first months of the
year,” the Washington-based lender said. “However, recent
inflationary pressures and insufficient rains present downside
risks that will need to be promptly addressed.”  Failure to tighten monetary policy could keep the inflation
rate above 12 percent this year, it said.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya on June 29 raised its overnight
lending rate to banks to 8 percent. The inflation rate in East
Africa’s largest economy climbed for the eighth consecutive
month in June, reaching 14.5 percent, as food and fuel prices
increased, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said June 29.  The shilling has declined 10 percent against the dollar
this year, making it Africa’s second-worst performing currency,
after neighboring Uganda’s, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
