Ghanaian President John Evans Atta Mills faces a challenge to his leadership of the ruling party
tomorrow from Nana Kunadu Agyeman Rawlings, the wife of the
party’s founder, Jerry John Rawlings.  More than 3,000 delegates of the National Democratic
Congress are meeting in Sunyani, 400 kilometers (249 miles)
north of the capital, Accra, over the next three days to elect
the party’s presidential candidate for the 2012 general
election.  “The party has come too far to experiment with
governance,” Deputy Finance Minister Fifi Kwetey said in an
interview in Sunyani today. “Nana Kunadu would be too costly an
experiment for us.”  It is the first time a sitting president has faced a
challenge from within his own party in his first term in the
West African nation. Voting is scheduled to be completed by 6
p.m. local time tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
