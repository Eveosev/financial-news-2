Exports of  North Sea  Alvheim crude
for September are scheduled at four cargoes, one less than
August, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The September program comprises four 780,000-barrel
shipments amounting to 3.12 million barrels, or 104,000 barrels
a day, according to the plan. Houston-based  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) 
operates the  field  in the Norwegian North Sea.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
