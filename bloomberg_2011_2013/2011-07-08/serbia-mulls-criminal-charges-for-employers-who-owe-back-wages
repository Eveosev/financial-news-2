Employers in  Serbia  who are late in
paying their workers may face criminal charges in the future,
the government said.  The authorities are considering introducing penalties,
including prison terms, for employers who are more than three
months late in paying wages, Labor Minister Rasim Ljajic said
after meeting with representatives of two union organizations
and an employers’ association.  “A huge number of people are working without being paid on
time so we decided to start this initiative,” which may become
law later this year, Ljajic said. Serbia’s workforce was 1.77
million people at the end of the first quarter, including
427,000 self-employed, according to official  statistics .  Among the 1.34 million employees, “there are delays in
salaries for 90,000 to 100,000 people every month” and as many
as 20,000 workers have claims that go back months or years, said
Ljubisav Orbovic, the head of the  Confederation of Autonomous
Trade Unions .  Serbia seeks to adapt its regulations to the European Union
and hopes to become a candidate for membership this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
