Copper, little changed, may trim a
second weekly increase as some investors sold the metal to lock
in gains after it rallied to a three-month high on concern
supply disruptions may worsen an expected shortage this year.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange fell as
much as 0.3 percent to $9,714.25 a metric ton and traded at
$9,746.50 by 3:24 p.m. Singapore time. The metal had touched
$9,769 earlier today, the highest price since April 12, on
reports of adverse weather in Chile’s copper-producing northern
region and a strike at the Grasberg mine in  Indonesia . It is up
3 percent this week.  The slowdown in demand “has been in a way compensated by a
slowdown in production also,” said Diego Hernandez, chief
executive officer of Codelco, the world’s largest copper
producer. “Some mines have problems with trade unions or
climate, or ramp ups of new operations have been slower than
expected. Overall the balance has not changed.”  Mines in  Chile  including BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida, the
world’s largest, and American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi
have been hit by rain and snow storms this week. The world’s
largest copper-producing country put emergency workers on alert
yesterday as more than 1,000 people evacuated their homes.  In Indonesia, Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc. said that
production from its Grasberg mine, the world’s second-largest,
was disrupted after workers started a seven-day strike on July 4,
demanding wage increases. Supply disruptions may exacerbate a
shortfall in the metal this year, estimated by the International
Copper Study Group to be around 377,000 tons.  Copper for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 1.8 percent to 72,290 yuan ($11,182) a
ton, also the highest price since April 12. Metal on the Comex
in  New York  was little changed at $4.4405 a pound, after gaining
2.5 percent yesterday.  ‘Looking Good’  “Fundamentally we’re looking good and the medium-term
uptrend remains intact,” Luo Minghui, an analyst at Hongta
Futures Co., said from Yunnan. “Tightening in China was one of
the more bearish issues for the market and now that it’s done,
and that economic data suggests there won’t be further steps in
the near term, the market can now focus on the fundamentals.”  China this week raised  interest rates  for a third time this
year, prompting analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. to predict the move may be the last for
2011, after  China ’s manufacturing shrank to the lowest level
since February 2009, while services industries expanded at the
slowest pace in four months in June.  “The market will be cautious today ahead of the U.S. jobs
data,” said Luo. The U.S. unemployment rate likely held at 9.1
percent in June even as payrolls climbed. Employers added
105,000 jobs in June after an advance of 54,000 in the prior
month, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before today’s Labor Department report.  Aluminum in London dropped 0.4 percent to $2,580 a ton, tin
slipped 0.2 percent to $27,490 a ton and zinc declined 0.7
percent to $2,396 a ton. Lead lost 0.3 percent to $2,714 a ton,
while nickel gained 0.8 percent to $24,100 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
