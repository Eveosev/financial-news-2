India  has referred the allocation of
Mahan coal block in central India to a panel of ministers
pending ecological clearance, a move that may raise costs for
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) ’s planned smelter in the region.  Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh recommended an
alternative coal block be given for two  power plants  by Hindalco
and Essar Power Ltd., according to a notice on the ministry’s
website. The ministry has identified Sohagpur coal block in
Shahdol district of Madhya Pradesh state as an alternative, it
said.  Essar was to get 60 percent of the coal mined from Mahan,
which has reserves of 150 million tons, according to Mahan Coal
Ltd.’s website. Hindalco was to get the balance.  Hindalco, the nation’s second-largest aluminum maker, is
building a 92 billion-rupee ($2.1 billion) alumina smelter and
power project in Madhya Pradesh that is expected to start
production in December, Managing Director Debu Bhattacharya said
on May 9.  “The news is a big negative for Hindalco which was banking
upon coal from the Mahan block for its power plant
requirements,” said  Niraj Shah , an analyst at Fortune Equity
Brokers India Ltd. in Mumbai, who has a “hold” rating on the
stock. “This will cause further delay in securing coal, leading
to substantial increase in costs.”  Hindalco shares fell 3.9 percent to 188.1 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The shares have lost 24 percent this
year, compared with an 8 percent drop in the key Sensitive Index
of the Bombay Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
