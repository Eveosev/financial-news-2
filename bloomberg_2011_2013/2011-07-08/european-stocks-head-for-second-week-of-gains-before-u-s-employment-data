European stocks rose, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index heading for a second week of gains, before a
U.S. Labor Department report that may show the world’s largest
economy hired more workers in June. Asian shares climbed, while
U.S. index futures were little changed.  The Stoxx 600 increased 0.3 percent to 276.83 at 8:05 a.m.
in  London . The gauge is headed for a 0.7 percent advance this
week. Even so, the benchmark measure has slumped 4.9 percent
from this year’s high on Feb. 17 on concern that the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis will derail its economic recovery.The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index rose 0.6 percent and Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures added less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
