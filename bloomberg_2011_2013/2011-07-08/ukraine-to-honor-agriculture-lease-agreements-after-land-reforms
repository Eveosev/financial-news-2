The Ukrainian government, which plans
to introduce the sale of agricultural land in 2012, will
guarantee that existing lease agreements will be honored,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  People in rural areas currently lease 6.5 million plots of
land to bigger companies. Ukraine has 41.6 million hectares (103
million acres) of agricultural land covering 69 percent of its
territory. Arable land accounts for 32.5 million hectares.  Land reform bills are scheduled to go before the parliament
this autumn and to be introduced Jan. 1, 2012.  The government plans to “keep in place the existing
balance to ensure production volumes and development of the
 agriculture sector ,” Prysyazhnyuk said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Ukraine’s land reform is expected to improve access to
bank loans, agricultural management and to help establish fair
lease and sale prices, President  Viktor Yanukovych  said at a
press conference in Kiev today.  The changes could generate up to 420 billion hryvnia ($52.6
billion) in new bank loans, Yanukovych said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
