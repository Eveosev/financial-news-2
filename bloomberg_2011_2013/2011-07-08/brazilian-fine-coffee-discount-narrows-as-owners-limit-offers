The discount on fine-cup coffee from
top producer  Brazil  narrowed over the past week as producers
limited offers in response to a drop in prices, broker Flavour
Coffee said.  The discount for fine cups was between 9 and 14 cents a
pound below the price on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the Rio
de Janeiro-based broker said in a report e-mailed yesterday.
Fine-cup qualities traded at 17 cents a pound below the exchange
price last week, it said.  “Differentials tightened up considerably, especially fine-
cup qualities,” Flavour said. Producers continue to be
“disciplined sellers,” increasing the amount of coffee offered
when prices rise and limiting availability when prices drop, the
broker said.  Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$2.69 a pound on ICE by 9:41 a.m. London time today. The price
gained 2 percent this week after falling as much as 1.7 percent
on July 5. Arabica beans are grown mainly in  Latin America  and
favored by coffee shops such as Starbucks Corp.  So-called good cup coffee, also known as Swedish quality,
was trading at 20 cents a pound below the New York price,
according to the broker. Fine and good cup qualities are mostly
exported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
