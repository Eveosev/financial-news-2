Municipal bond-rating downgrades
outnumbered upgrades by 3-to-1 last quarter, a decline from the
peak ratio reached at the end of 2010, Moody’s Investors Service
said.  Moody’s cut 127 ratings of $71.6 billion of state and local
debt and increased 43, totaling $4.2 billion, during the second
quarter, according to a statement today. Borrowers downgraded
included  New Jersey , Hawaii and Chicago’s Cook County, Illinois.  The trend reflects the fiscal challenges faced by state and
local governments, Naomi Richman, a Moody’s managing director,
said in the statement. The municipal market will continue to
“face pressure” as the economy recovers, she said.  “The news is somewhat more optimistic for states, but
local governments still have a way to go,” Robert Kurtter, a
managing director at Moody’s, said today during an economic
summit at  Rutgers University  in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  The ratio of cuts to increases peaked at 4.6-to-1 in the
fourth quarter, and remains near historic highs, Moody’s said.
Last quarter was the tenth-consecutive period that downgrades
outnumbered upgrades, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
