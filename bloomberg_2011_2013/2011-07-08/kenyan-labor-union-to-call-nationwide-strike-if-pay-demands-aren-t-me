Kenya ’s Central Organization for
Trade Unions will call for a nationwide strike if their pay
demands, including a 60 percent increase in the minimum wage,
aren’t met by July 20.  The Federation of Kenyan Employers haven’t attended talks
that have been held with the ministry of labor, undermining the
negotiations, Adam Baraza, personal assistant to the union’s
secretary-general, said by phone from Nairobi, the capital.  The union wants a minimum wage increase of 60 percent
rather than the 12.5 percent announced by President Mwai Kibaki
on May 1, and for a general wage increase of 10 percent, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
