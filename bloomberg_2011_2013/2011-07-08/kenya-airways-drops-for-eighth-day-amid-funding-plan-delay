Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, fell for an eighth day, the
longest streak of losses in more than a year, on concern the
company has yet to provide details on a capital-raising plan.  The stock fell as much as 6.4 percent to 32.75 shillings
before trading 1.4 percent lower at 34.5 shillings by 1:02 p.m.
in the capital, Nairobi, the longest losing run since June 22,
2010.  “The planned capital-raising, mostly likely through a
rights issue, is causing a lot of uncertainty among investors
because there has been a delay in giving further information,”
Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  The airline plans to raise as much as 23 billion shillings
($255.6 million), which would make it  Kenya ’s largest sale of
stock to existing shareholders, Nairobi-based Business daily
said June 6, citing documents from the office of Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta .  Kenya Airways, which is 23 percent state-owned, said Feb.
17 it plans to raise capital for investment and hired CFC
Stanbic Holdings Ltd. as an adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
