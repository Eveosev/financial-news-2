The Australian dollar fell against
the yen and the  U.S. dollar  as weaker-than-forecast U.S. jobs
data damped demand for currencies linked to riskier assets.  The Aussie, as it is commonly called, posted weekly losses
against both the dollar and the yen as U.S. employers added the
fewest jobs in nine months and the jobless rate unexpectedly
increased to 9.2 percent. New Zealand’s dollar had its third
weekly gain against the yen and second against the U.S. dollar.  “After that poor jobs data, U.S. stocks are falling, so we
are seeing a sale across the board of higher yielding currencies
like the Aussie,” said  John Doyle , a strategist in Washington
at the currency-trading firm Tempus Consulting Inc.  Australia’s dollar fell 1.2 percent to 86.52 yen at 12:18
a.m. in  New York , from 87.55 yen in New York yesterday. The
Aussie fell 0.5 percent to $1.0727.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.7 percent to 67.27 yen from
67.72 yen. It rose 0.1 percent to 83.40 U.S. cents from 83.34
cents yesterday. It touched 83.61 cents today, the highest since
the currency was freely floated in 1985.  The Aussie fell 0.6 percent against the yen this week and
0.4 percent against the U.S. dollar. New Zealand’s dollar
strengthened 0.6 percent versus Japan’s currency and 0.8 percent
against the U.S. dollar.  The  S&P 500 Index  dropped 1.1 percent and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  fell 0.9 percent.  The number of people employed in  Australia  rose by 23,400,
led by a jump in full-time jobs, the statistics bureau said
yesterday. That was higher than the median estimate for a 15,000
increase in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The jobless
rate held at 4.9 percent. Employment dropped by a revised 500 in
May following a 28,300 decline in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
