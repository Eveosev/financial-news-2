China Dongxiang Group Co. (3818) , a
sportswear retailer in  China , expects sales to decline and
profit margin to shrink in the first half of the year as
competition intensifies.  Sales may fall by about 45 percent in the six months ended
June 30, and the margin of profit attributable to equity holders
may narrow to as low as 17 percent from 37 percent a year
earlier, China Dongxiang said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today.  “The sports goods industry in China is facing a new series
of challenges, including intensifying competition and excess
inventory,” the company said.  Dongxiang shares fell 5.5 percent today to HK$2.08 at the 4
p.m. close in  Hong Kong .  To contact the reporters on this story:
