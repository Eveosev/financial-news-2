Private-equity firm Advent
International Corp. plans to raise 220 million euros ($314
million) of leveraged loans for the buyout of Mondo Minerals BV
from HgCapital, a person familiar with the situation said.  Advent said on July 1 it agreed to buy Amsterdam-based
Mondo, the world’s second-largest producer of talc which is used
in paper, paints and plastics products.  The senior financing to  Mondo  includes a 155 million-euro
seven-year term loan B paying 475 basis points more than the
euro interbank offered rate, a 20 million-euro six-year
revolving credit and a 15 million-euro seven-year facility to
fund potential acquisitions, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the deal is private.  Mondo will also get 30 million euros of mezzanine debt
paying interest margin of 11 percent, including 6 percent as
pay-in-kind, which accrues during the life of the loan and is
paid at maturity, the person said.  Guillaume Darbon, a managing director at Advent in Paris,
didn’t return a phone call seeking comment.  BNP Paribas Fortis, IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, and  RBC
Capital Markets  are arranging the senior financing while Ares
Capital Europe Ltd. provided mezzanine debt, Boston-based Advent
