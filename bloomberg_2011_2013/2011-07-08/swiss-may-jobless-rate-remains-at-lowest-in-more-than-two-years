Swiss unemployment remained at the
lowest in more than two years in June as companies boosted their
workforce to meet global demand.  The jobless rate held at 3 percent when adjusted for
seasonal swings, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in
Bern said in an e-mailed statement today. Thatâ€™s the same as in
May and the lowest since January 2009. The figure is in line
with the median forecast of nine economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The unadjusted jobless rate fell to 2.8 percent from 2.9
percent in May. The number of job openings fell by 623 to 21,193
in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
