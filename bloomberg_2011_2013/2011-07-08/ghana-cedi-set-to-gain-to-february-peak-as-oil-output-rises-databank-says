Ghana ’s cedi is set to appreciate to
its strongest level since February by the end of the third
quarter as the West African nation increases oil exports,
raising dollar receipts, Databank Financial Services Ltd. said.  The cedi will gain to 1.4900 per dollar, Sampson Akligoh,
economist at Accra-based Databank said in a telephone interview
today. that would be the strongest intraday level since Feb. 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency weakened
for the first day in five, slipping less than 0.1 percent to
1.5150 per dollar by 2:39 p.m. in the capital, Accra.  Oil exports from Ghana, which began production in December,
amounted to $954.6 million from the sale of 8.6 million barrels
of crude from the Jubilee field in the first five months of the
year, boosting export earnings by 63 percent to $5.2 billion
from a year earlier, central bank Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur
said July 6.  “We are expecting oil production from the Jubilee field to
ramp up to a peak level of 120,000 barrels per day by August,
latest by September,” Akligoh said. “With that, we see
increased government oil revenue providing a good buffer for the
cedi.”  Daily oil output at  Africa ’s biggest oil find in a decade
has been boosted to 80,000 barrels per day since the start of
July from 70,000 barrels, Gayheart Mensah, spokesman for the
local unit of  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the field’s operator, said
yesterday. Output will increase to the peak level by next month
or September, he said.  Low business confidence will also stem any cedi
depreciation as a decrease in imports cuts demand for dollars,
Kevin Adarkwa, a currency trader at the local unit of Standard
Chartered Bank Plc, said by phone from Accra today.  The overall  business confidence index  dropped to 104.1 in
June from 106.6 in April, Amissah-Arthur said July 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
