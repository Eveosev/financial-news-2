Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
agreed that it won’t sell generic versions of the cholesterol
drugs Vytorin and Zetia until 2017, settling patent lawsuits
with Merck & Co., court records show.  Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker, and Teva, the
world’s largest generic-drug maker, filed an agreement yesterday
in federal court in Newark,  New Jersey , that said Teva wouldn’t
sell copies of the drugs until April 25, 2017. The agreement
settles lawsuits that Merck’s Schering unit filed in 2009 and
2010 to prevent Teva from selling generic versions of the drugs.  Zetia accounted for $2.3 billion in sales last year and
Vytorin for $2 billion for Merck, based in  Whitehouse Station ,
New Jersey. A trial in which Merck is seeking to block Mylan
Inc. from selling generic versions of Zetia and Vytorin is
scheduled to begin Dec. 5, said  Ron Rogers , a spokesman for
Merck.  “This agreement has no impact on the Mylan case,” Rogers
said in an interview.  Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva, said the Petach
Tikva, Israel-based company had no comment.  The cases are Schering Corp. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
Inc., 10cv1058 and 10cv4473, both U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
