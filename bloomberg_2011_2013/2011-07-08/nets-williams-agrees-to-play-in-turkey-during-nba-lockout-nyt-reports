Deron Williams  of the New York Nets
agreed in principle to a one-year deal to play with the Turkish
club Besiktas until the National Basketball Association lockout
is over, the New York Times said, citing a European agent.  Williams, 27, would report Sept. 1 for the 10-month season
that begins Sept. 27, the Times said. The contract contains a
clause to allow him to return to the Nets once the lockout ends.  Williams would be paid between $1 million and $5 million,
agent Misko Raznatovic told the Times. He’ll also get a car,
housing, tax breaks associated with playing overseas, a security
guard, driver and personal assistant, the report said.  The NBA and FIBA, the world governing body for basketball,
must approve the move, although Williams’s contract with the
Nets isn’t in effect during the lockout, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
