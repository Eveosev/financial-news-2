Apollo Global Management LLC,  Leon
Black ’s private-equity firm, agreed to buy Gulf Stream Asset
Management, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based manager of
corporate-credit assets. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The deal will increase assets under management in Apollo’s
capital-markets business by more than $3 billion to about $27
billion, New York-based Apollo said today in a statement. The
sale is expected to be completed in the third quarter.  “We believe this transaction further solidifies our
position as one of the largest loan managers in the world,”
James Zelter, managing director of Apollo’s capital-markets
business, said in the statement.  Apollo, which raised $565.4 million in an initial public
offering in March, is seeking to expand beyond leveraged
buyouts. The firm, which had assets of $70 billion as of March
31, is the final bidder for Dusseldorf-based WestLB AG’s real-
estate finance unit, two people with knowledge of the process
said last month.  Mark Mahoney, president and founder of Gulf Stream, will
join Apollo as a partner, according to the statement.  Apollo shares rose 23 cents, or 1.36 percent, to $17.10 at
9:56 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has fallen 10 percent since the March 29 IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
