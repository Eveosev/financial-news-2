U.S. stock-index futures retreated
after the nation added fewer jobs than forecast in June, damping
optimism about the economy. Treasuries rallied.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September lost 1 percent to 1,338.5 at 8:30 a.m. in  New York .
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures tumbled 95 points, or 0.8
percent, to 12,586.  Labor Department figures showed U.S. employers added 18,000
workers in June, less than the median economist forecast of
105,000 and the fewest in nine months, while the  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly climbed to 9.2 percent, indicating a
struggling labor market.  The S&P 500 has climbed 6.7 percent since the start of last
week as Greek lawmakers passed a five-year austerity package,
qualifying the country for further aid, and yesterday’s report
from ADP Employer Services showed U.S. companies added twice as
many jobs as forecast in June. The index is about 10 points shy,
or less than 0.8 percent, of a three-year high reached on April
29.  Investors are also turning their attention to the second-
quarter earnings season, which unofficially starts on July 11
with Alcoa Inc., the first Dow company to release results.  S&P
500  profits are forecast to have grown by 13 percent in the
period, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
