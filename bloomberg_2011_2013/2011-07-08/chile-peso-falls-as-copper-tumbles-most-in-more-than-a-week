Chile ’s peso fell, ending a three-day
winning streak, as copper declined the most in more than a week
after U.S. payrolls rose less than forecast in June, damping the
outlook for growth.  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 462.83 per dollar at the
end of trading, from 461.02 yesterday. The currency gained 0.5
percent this week.  “The price of copper has been rising strongly in the last
few days, but that flipped today, and the peso responded in
turn,”  Alejandro Puente , an economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA, said in a phone interview from Santiago.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
the most in more than a week on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , retreating 0.7 percent.  Labor Department figures showed U.S. employers added 18,000
workers in June, less than the median economist forecast of
105,000, while the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed to 9.2
percent, indicating a struggling labor market.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
