Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the world’s largest
biotechnology company, launched 30 mice into space today on
NASA’s final shuttle mission to test a bone-loss drug.  The project, a collaboration between  Thousand Oaks ,
California-based Amgen and  UCB SA (UCB)  in Brussels, will gauge the
effectiveness of a sclerostin antibody designed to boost bone
formation, Amgen said in a statement.  “What we’re hoping to show is the sclerostin antibody can
build bone in a weightless environment,” said Chris Paszty,
Amgen’s scientific executive director, in a telephone interview.
“We don’t know yet what we are going to learn, but it may turn
out to be something important in terms of understanding how one
might develop therapeutics from this pathway.”  The lack of gravity’s weight on human bodies during space
flight causes the loss of bone mass, a significant issue for
long-term flights, Paszty said. Half of the mice aboard the
 Shuttle Atlantis  will receive the antibody while half will get a
placebo. The findings may offer insights into how the antibody
could be used to offset the effects from immobilization, stroke,
cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury and
reduced physical activity.  Amgen currently has a different sclerostin antibody, known
as AMG 785, in clinical trials, the second of three phases
generally required for regulatory approval, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
