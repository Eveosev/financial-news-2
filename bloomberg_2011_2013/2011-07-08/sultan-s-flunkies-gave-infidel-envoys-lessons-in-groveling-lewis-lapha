In 1660, the British ambassador to
Constantinople, Heneage Finch, arrived for an audience with the
sultan at the grand Topkapi Palace, where his entourage was fed
sweetmeats. Gifts were exchanged with the Grand Vizier, and
finally everyone went through the Gates of Felicity to enter the
Inner Court.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Forty eunuchs dressed in satin and gold surrounded the
great man on his throne. Two porters locked onto the
ambassador’s arms, propelled him to the middle of the room, and
forced him into a bow so low his forehead hit the ground.  Nothing less was expected. One recalcitrant Dutch official,
who gave a “rash” answer to the Grand Vizier, received 184
blows on his feet, which nearly crippled him for life.  And when the French ambassador protested the court’s lack
of respect for him, he was beaten up and imprisoned. The vizier
described him contemptuously as an infidel: “A hogge, a dogge,
a turde eater.”  I spoke with James Mather, author of “ Pashas: Traders and
Travellers in the Islamic World ,” on the following topics:  1. Spices and Silks  2. The Levant Company  3. Souks and Khans  4. Christians Vs. Muslims  5. Aspirational Luxuries  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
