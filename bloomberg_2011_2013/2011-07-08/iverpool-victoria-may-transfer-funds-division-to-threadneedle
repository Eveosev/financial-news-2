Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society
Ltd., the customer-owned insurer and asset manager known as LV=,
said it’s in talks to transfer the management of its funds unit
to Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Ltd.  “These discussions will take place over the next few weeks
with the aim of reaching a final decision on the proposal at the
start of next month,” London-based Liverpool Victoria said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The firm is considering moving its assets to London-based
Threadneedle to focus on its core products of non-life insurance
and income protection, Chief Executive Officer Mike Rogers said
in the statement. Liverpool Victoria manages about 8 billion
pounds ($13 billion) of assets and employs 70 people.  Threadneedle, the U.K.’s fourth-largest retail fund
manager, had 66.6 billion pounds of assets on March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
