Visa  Europe  Ltd. said it stopped
payments to WikiLeaks a second time, hours after an Internet
site restarted donations to the anti-secrecy group.  WikiLeaks’s payment provider, DataCell, attempted to use
an alternative-payment gateway to process money sent through
MasterCard, the world’s second-largest payments network, and
Visa Europe, which runs the largest card network in the European
Union, Reykjavik, Iceland-based DataCell  said  yesterday.  “As soon as this came to our attention, action was taken
with the suspension of Visa payment acceptance,” Amanda Kamin,
a spokeswoman for London-based Visa Europe said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Visa Europe and MasterCard in December blocked WikiLeaks
from using its network to collect funds from donors.  WikiLeaks ,
led by Julian Assange, publishes secret documents, including
confidential U.S. diplomatic and military information.
MasterCard’s website has been attacked by hackers in retaliation
as recently as last month.  Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, a lawyer for DataCell and WikiLeaks
in Reykjavik, confirmed that Valitor, a payment processor linked
to Visa and MasterCard, “terminated the contract with DataCell
for payment processing this morning,” he said in an e-mail.  Donation Processing  “The reason they give is that orders have been given by
the international card companies to close down the gateway and
that processing donations to WikiLeaks is a violation of general
terms between the two parties,” DataCell  said  in a separate
statement.  Valitor, based in Reykjavik, declined to immediately
comment.  MasterCard, the world’s second-biggest payments network,
said it had never changed its policy on accepting WikiLeaks
donations.  “MasterCard’s position on acceptance has not changed,”
James Issokson, a spokesman for the firm, said in a phone
interview.  Andreas Fink, DataCell’s chief executive, said in an e-mail
that the company may have received “five-to-six digit figures”
in donations for Wikileaks before the payments were halted.  DataCell said yesterday it was also able to process
WikiLeaks donations made through  American Express Co. (AXP) , the
biggest credit-card issuer by customer spending. Christine Elliott, a spokeswoman for New York-based American Express Co.,
declined to immediately comment.  The WikiLeaks Twitter account, which has almost 1 million
followers, posted a message yesterday about the “Financial
block workaround.”  “Donate whilst you can Visa, MasterCard and AmEx,” read
the rest of the message, which linked back to the WikiLeaks
website.  Visa Europe split from  Visa Inc. (V)  before the San Francisco-
based company’s initial public offering in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
