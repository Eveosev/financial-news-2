Uganda ’s shilling had its
biggest weekly drop in two years against the dollar as
importers increased demand for the U.S. currency to buy oil
products to fire generators amid an electricity shortage in
the East African nation.  The currency of the continent’s second-biggest coffee
producer depreciated 1 percent to 2,610 per dollar by 5
p.m. in Kampala, the capital, taking its decline this week
to 3.2 percent, the biggest five-day decrease since the
week through July 10, 2009.  “We really have demand from the energy sector as guys
want to come out with measures amid the power blackout,”
Ahmed Kalule, a currency trader at Bank of Africa Uganda
Ltd., said in a phone interview. “There is high corporate
demand, but retail customers are not willing to buy.”  Independent generators who sell power to the state-run
Uganda Electricity Transmission Co. cut supplies to the
national grid on July 4 because they are owed money by the
government, Eriasi Kiyimba, the agency’s chief executive,
said on July 5. Uganda, which is reliant on thermal
generators for about 47 percent of its electricity, has an
energy shortfall of as much as 120 megawatts during periods
of peak demand, he said.  Uganda’s currency has weakened 12 percent against the
dollar so far this year as inflation surged to a 17-year
high. The shilling is the world’s third-worst performing
currency, after Suriname’s dollar and the Maldives rufiyaa,
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
