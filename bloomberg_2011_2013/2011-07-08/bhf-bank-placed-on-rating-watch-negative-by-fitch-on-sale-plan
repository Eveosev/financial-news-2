BHF-Bank AG had some credit ratings
placed on “rating watch negative” by  Fitch Ratings  after owner
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  announced yesterday it’s in exclusive talks to
sell the unit to  RHJ International (RHJI) ’s  Kleinwort Benson  Group.  BHF-Bank’s A long-term issuer default rating, or IDR, F1
short-term IDR and 1 support rating and C individual rating were
placed on rating watch negative, or RWN, Fitch said today in a
statement.  “Fitch views the timing and the outcome of these
negotiations as uncertain, as shown by DB’s previous attempt to
sell the bank to Liechtenstein’s LGT Group, which was eventually
abandoned in April 2011,” the ratings company said. “The
individual rating has been placed on RWN to reflect the
uncertainty surrounding the future owner’s intentions regarding
BHF’s strategy, positioning and restructuring plans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
