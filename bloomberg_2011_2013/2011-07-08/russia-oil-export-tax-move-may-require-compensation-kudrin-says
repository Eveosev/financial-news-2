Russia’s plan to restructure taxes on
crude oil and refined oil products may require compensation for
some companies, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said today in
 London .  “Overall this switch is correct and perhaps somewhat
overdue,” Kudrin told reporters today in London. It will be
implemented “along with compensation measures or as a step-by-
step transition,” Kudrin said.  The ministry’s “60-66” proposal to restructure taxes on
 oil companies  would lower the coefficient used in setting the
crude export duty to 60 percent while taxing oil products at 66
percent of the crude levy. Russia, which exports more crude and
heavy fuel than high-grade products, is seeking to revise taxes
to spur output and bolster state revenue as global oil prices
climb.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin today expressed support for
the move and called for the government to submit a proposal on
implementing the measure within two weeks.  This transition has been “delayed” because it means “big
costs for companies, which endanger the stability of their
work,” Kudrin said. The government is working on a plan to
ensure their stability won’t be compromised in this transition,
he said.  Refiners such as TAIF, based in  Russia ’s Tatarstan region,
which haven’t upgraded plants to produce lighter fuels, face a
higher tax burden should the proposal be approved.  Kudrin said he couldn’t give a date for when the 60-66 tax
structure will go into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
