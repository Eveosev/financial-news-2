Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s
government should raise price caps on corn flour at least 40
percent to keep up with rising raw material costs,  El Mundo
reported , citing Lorenzo Mendoza, owner of Empresas Polar SA,
 Venezuela ’s largest privately held company.  The price at which corn flour can be sold to consumers
should be adjusted to meet an anticipated rise in the cost of
white corn on Aug. 15, El Mundo reported Mendoza as saying.
Polar, Venezuela’s largest producer of food and beer, plans to
invest 300 million bolivars ($70 million) in the food and drink
sector, Mendoza said, according to El Mundo.  Corn flour is used to make arepas, or patties, that are a
breakfast staple in many Venezuelan homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
