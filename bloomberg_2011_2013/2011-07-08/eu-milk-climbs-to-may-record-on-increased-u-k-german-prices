European Union cow-milk prices
climbed in May to the highest level ever for the month as U.K.
and German dairies raised prices, Dutch farm organization LTO-
Nederland said in a monthly  report .  The average price paid by EU dairies to farmers was 33.59
euros ($47.90) for 100 kilograms (220 pounds), up 2.8 percent
from the average of 32.66 euros in April, LTO said in a report.
The price was up 16 percent compared with a year earlier,
according to the report.  Robert Wiseman Dairies Plc,  Scotland â€™s biggest provider of
fresh milk, said this week it probably will raise prices paid to
farmers for raw milk to secure supplies after cheese producers
boosted their payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
