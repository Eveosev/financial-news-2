GML, Mauritius’ biggest company by
revenue, plans to expand its financial and retail operations in
East  Africa , said Arnaud Lagesse, its chief executive officer.  “We expect the African segment to grow from a marginal
contribution to our turnover to about 30 percent over the next
decade,” Lagesse said in an interview yesterday in Port Louis,
the capital. “Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million
people, is limited.”  Expansion by GML, previously known as Groupe Mon Loisir, in
Africa will be led by AfrAsia Bank, a corporate lender that also
has three branches in South Africa, and through Winners’, the
group’s chain that operates 18 supermarkets in the Indian Ocean
island nation.  GML is Mauritius’s largest company by revenue at 18.3
billion rupees ($649 million) in 2010, about 6.9 percent of the
country’s gross domestic product, according to Port Louis-based
Business Magazine. It has controlling stakes in  Ireland Blyth
Ltd. (IBL) ,  Naiade Resorts Ltd. (NRL) ,  Phoenix Beverages Ltd. (PBL)  and  United
Basalt Products (UBP)  Ltd. and has a stake in Flacq United Estates
Ltd., according to the group.  GML’s revenue “will easily” be more than 24 billion
rupees for the year through June, Lagesse said, following the
acquisition of the controlling stake in Ireland Blyth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
