The Philippine peso strengthened to a
two-month high after data yesterday showed a rebound in U.S.
jobs and the nation’s central bank governor said inflation is
“manageable.”  The currency was poised for a third weekly gain as
companies in the world’s largest economy added more than twice
as many workers as economists had predicted.  Government bonds 
gained this week after the treasury started its third debt
exchange in less than a year aimed at swapping short-maturity
notes with securities due in 10 to 20 years.  “The market is seeing more improvement in the global
economic outlook, especially in the U.S.,” said Lito Biacora,
vice president for treasury at Bank of the Philippine Islands in
 Manila . “The regional outlook remains bullish. Inflation should
support the positive outlook on the government’s funding.”  The peso strengthened 0.3 percent to 42.745 per dollar as
of the 4 p.m. close in Manila, taking gains for the week to 1
percent, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched 42.72
earlier, the strongest level since May 3.  Philippine consumer prices increased 5.2 percent in June
from a year earlier, the biggest gain since April 2009,
according to data released by the  National Statistics Office  on
July 5, using 2006 as a base year. Inflation was 4.6 percent
using 2000 as a base year, compared with the 4.7 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 economists.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said
on July 5 that the central bank vows to remain vigilant against
price pressures.  The yield on the 7 percent bonds due January 2016 fell 12
basis points to 4.68 percent this week, the lowest level this
year, according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, today.  ADP Employer Services reported yesterday the U.S. created
157,000 jobs in June, more than the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey for a 70,000 increase.  To contact the reporter for this story:
