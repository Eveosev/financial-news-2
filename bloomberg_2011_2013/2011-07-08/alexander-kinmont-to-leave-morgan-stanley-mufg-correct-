Alexander Kinmont, the equity
strategist who wrote the 2002 report “The Irrelevance of  Japan ,”
will leave Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. at the end of July,
brokerage spokesman Natsuo Nishio said by telephone today.  Kinmont, currently managing director of Japan equity
strategy at Morgan Stanley MUFG in Tokyo, characterized
Japan as unimportant for investors “except as a laboratory
experiment concerning deflation” in the December 2002 report for
previous employer Nikko Citigroup Ltd.  He reversed that view in April 2009 with a report for
Morgan Stanley entitled “The Relevance of Japan,” saying
easing of fiscal and monetary policy might boost earnings by
ending deflation. The Topix Index climbed 12 percent from the
date that report was published through March 10, the day before
a record earthquake and tsunami struck Japan.  Morgan Stanley MUFG would not comment on whether a
successor had been appointed, Nishio said. Kinmont declined to
discuss the matter.  Kinmont rejoined Morgan Stanley as a Japanese equity
strategist in 2009, according to Nishio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
