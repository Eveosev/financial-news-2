The  United Nations  is unable to deal
with the number of refugees fleeing to Ethiopia from Somalia
because of conflict and drought, the High Commissioner for
Refugees said.  “We are looking for better international support,”
 Antonio Guterres  told reporters today in the Ethiopian capital,
Addis Ababa. “There are more people arriving than there’s
capacity to register.”  The mortality rate at the refugee camps is about three
times the norm for emergency situations, Guterres said, without
providing details. Around half of the children arriving at the
camps are suffering from severe malnutrition, UN High
Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Adrian Edwards told the same
press conference.  Somalia is suffering from a regional drought that could
affect as many as 10 million people in the Horn of  Africa , the
UN World Food Programme said in an e-mailed statement today.  Camps run by the UN around Dolo Ado on Ethiopia’s southern
border have seen 54,000 Somalis arrive this year, with a surge
since the start of a government offensive against rebels in
February, Edwards said.  Somalia, which has not had a functioning government since
1991, is experiencing ongoing conflict between the Western-
backed Transitional Federal Government and insurgents including
the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab.  The fighting is exacerbating the drought, Guterres said.
“If there is conflict there is no way to address the problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
