Solon SE (SOO1)  has hired Alvarez & Marsal
Inc. to develop a restructuring plan for the maker of solar
modules and systems,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing a Solon spokeswoman without identifying her.  A&M’s German co-chief operating officer Walter Bickel may
join Solon’s management board as chief restructuring officer as
a result of pressure from creditor banks, the newspaper said,
without saying how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
