Apple Inc. (AAPL)  was told to pay closely
held Personal Audio LLC $8 million after a federal jury in Texas
found that the maker of iPod music players infringed patents for
downloadable playlists.  Personal Audio, a patent licensing company with an office
in Beaumont, Texas, sued Apple in 2009 for $84 million in
damages, claiming infringement of two patents. The jury today
found that the patents were infringed, and upheld their
validity, according to Personal Audio’s lawyer, Ron Schutz of
Robins Kaplan in Minneapolis.  The inventions cover an audio player that can receive
navigable playlists and can skip forward or backward through the
downloaded list. Apple contended that it wasn’t using the
inventions, and that the patents were invalid.  The iPod generated $8.3 billion in sales last year for
Cupertino, California-based Apple, about 13 percent of its total
revenue.  The case is Personal Audio LLC v. Apple Inc., 09cv111, U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of  Texas  (Lufkin).  To contact the reporter on this story:
