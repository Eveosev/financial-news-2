Cotton production in  Uganda  more than
doubled in the 2010-11 season and is expected to grow further in
the next four years because of wider use of fertilizers and
pesticides, the Cotton Development Organization said.  Production for the season increased to 147,000 185-kilogram
(410-pound) bales from 70,300 bales a year earlier, the Kampala-
based state-run agency said in a statement published today in
New Vision newspaper. The country harvests the crop from
October to April, according to the agency.   Export earnings from the crop rose to $106 million from
$20.7 million in 2009-10, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
