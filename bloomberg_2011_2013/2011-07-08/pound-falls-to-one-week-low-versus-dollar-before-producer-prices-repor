The pound fell to the lowest in more
than a week against the dollar and gilts rallied as a measure of
inflation slowed to the least since September, weakening the
case for higher  interest rates .  Yields on 10-year gilts fell to within one basis point of
the lowest this month, while sterling weakened versus half of
its 16 major peers. The rate of price growth for goods leaving
U.K. factories increased 0.1 percent in June from May, when it
rose 0.2 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said today.
The Bank of England left its key rate at a record-low 0.5
percent yesterday and maintained its bond-purchase program to
help support the U.K. recovery.  Today’s data “is still seen as adding to the Bank of
England’s policy dilemma, and thus remains less supportive for
sterling,”  said  Valentin Marinov , a currency strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in  London . “The monetary policy committee will
keep rates lower for longer.”  The pound fell as much as 0.3 percent to $1.5932, the
weakest intraday level since June 28, before trading at $1.5953
as of 12:41 p.m. in London. Sterling gained 0.7 percent to 89.32
pence per euro and was little changed at 129.86 yen.  Ten-year gilts rose for a fourth day in five, lowering
yields by four basis points to 3.26 percent. The 3.75 percent
security due September 2020 rose 0.29, or 2.9 pounds per 1,000-
pound ($1,595) face amount, to 103.85. Yields on two-year notes
were little changed at 0.80 percent.  Rate Outlook  Britain’s currency has lost 3 percent this year against a
basket of nine developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, as worsening economic
growth limits the  Bank of England ’s ability to raise rates.  U.K. economic growth slowed to a virtual standstill in the
second quarter, falling to 0.1 percent in the three months to
the end of June, the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Investors are now betting that the Bank of England won’t
raise borrowing costs until after May next year, data from
Tullett Prebon Plc on forward contracts for the sterling
overnight interbank average, or Sonia, show. As recently as
February, the data indicated traders were betting on a rate
increase this May.  The implied yield on short-sterling futures expiring in
March 2012 was one basis point higher at 1.03 percent. The yield
has still fallen from a high of 2.08 percent in February as
investors bet interest rates will stay low for longer.  Short-sterling futures are used by analysts to gauge the
future trajectory of borrowing costs between banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
