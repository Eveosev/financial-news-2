Zwack Unicum Nyrt., the family-
controlled Hungarian distiller created in the 18th century, said
it’s withdrawing carbonated vodka drink Szensavas Kalinka citing
concerns that the bottle may “explode.”  “There is a threat of product explosion in one of every
10,000 bottles because of bottle quality problems,” Zwack said
in a statement to the Budapest Stock Exchange today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
