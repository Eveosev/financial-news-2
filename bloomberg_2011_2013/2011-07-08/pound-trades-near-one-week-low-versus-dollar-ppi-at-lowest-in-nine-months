The pound stayed within a penny of a
more-than one-week low against the dollar after a report showed
U.K. producer prices rose in June at the slowest pace since
September, limiting the scope for higher  interest rates .  The pound fell as much as 0.2 percent to $1.5939, the
weakest intraday level since June 28, before trading at $1.5974
as of 9:45 a.m. in  London . Sterling added 0.4 percent to 89.58
pence per euro and was 0.2 percent stronger at 130.03 yen.  U.K. factory gate inflation accelerated 0.1 percent in
June, down from 0.2 percent in May, the Office for National
Statistics said today in London. That matched the median
forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
