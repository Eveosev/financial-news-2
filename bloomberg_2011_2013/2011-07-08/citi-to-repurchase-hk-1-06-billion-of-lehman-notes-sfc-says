Citigroup Inc. (C)  agreed to repurchase
HK$1.06 billion ($136 million) of notes linked to  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in Hong Kong, according to a statement
from the Hong Kong  Securities and Futures Commission  today.  Citigroup’s offer covers about 92 percent of customers
holding the outstanding notes, it said. The bank will pay 80
percent of the value of each customer’s investment, according to
the statement.  The offer from Citigroup came after  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
in March agreed to repurchase HK$1.48 billion of structured
notes linked to Lehman. The proposals, along with a settlement
agreement approved in May, may help end discontent that led
investors to hold almost daily protests outside bank branches in
Hong Kong.  “Citibank is making this offer in the best interests of
our clients without admitting any liability,”  James Griffiths ,
a Citigroup spokesman for the bank in Asia Pacific, said in the
e-mailed statement.  Hong Kong investors in notes tied to Lehman approved on May
20 a settlement agreement proposed by Lehman’s receiver
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that would return as much as 96.5
percent of their original investment. About 43,000 Hong Kong
investors had bought an estimated $1.8 billion of so-called
minibonds from lenders.  Citigroup is repurchasing market-linked notes and equity-
linked notes that are different from the minibonds that were
sold by some banks in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
