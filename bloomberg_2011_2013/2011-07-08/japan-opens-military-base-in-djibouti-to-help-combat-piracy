Japan  opened a military base in
Djibouti that will be used to help combat piracy off the coast
of the Horn of  Africa , said Admiral Kenichi Kuramoto, commander
of Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force.  Japan has about 600 people in the MSDF, 180 of whom will be
stationed at the base near the main international airport in the
capital, Djibouti City, Kuramoto said. He spoke at a ceremony
yesterday attended by Djiboutian Prime Minister Mohamed Dileita Dileita and Japanese Senior Vice Defense Minister Katsuya Ogawa.  Japan’s government today extended the MSDF’s anti-piracy
mission off Somalia, which was scheduled to end on July 23,
 Kyodo News  reported today, without citing anyone.  An increase in piracy, spurred by a 36-fold jump in ransom
payments in five years, has threatened vessels carrying 20
percent of world trade and raised expenses for shippers. Costs
linked to piracy may reach $13 billion to $15 billion by 2015 as
global trade rebounds and pirates operate over wider areas,
according to research firm  Geopolicity Inc.   Under Japanese law, MSDF can open fire on pirate vessels
that approach commercial vessels after warning shots have been
fired, Kyodo said today. They aren’t allowed to harm pirates
except in self defense, it said.  Japanese forces arrived in  Djibouti  in 2009 and have been
stationed at Camp Lemonnier, the U.S. military base in Djibouti.
The Japanese base is expected to generate $30 million in annual
revenue for Djibouti, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
