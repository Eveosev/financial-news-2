The weather in  California  will blow
cold, then hot, during the next two weeks, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  From July 13 to July 17, temperatures in California will be
cooler than normal. They will start to heat up from July 18 to
July 22, Rogers said in a note to clients.  The heat in the U.S. East, which will keep temperatures in
the high-80s Fahrenheit (high-20s Celsius) in  New York  starting
tomorrow, will retreat by the middle of next week. The hottest
weather will then set up over Great Plains from  South Dakota  to
northern Texas, said Rogers, based in Bethesda, Maryland.  The Plains states will stay hot through July 22 even as the
heat pushes west. The U.S. Northeast may see near-normal weather
from July 13 to July 22, while coastal regions of the Pacific
Northwest remain cooler than normal, Rogers said.  “We continue to see variations in the eastward and
westward reach of the prominent middle-of-the-continent hot-
ridging pattern,” Rogers said. “But more often than not, the
hot-ridge center is tied up in the middle third of the nation.”  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand. A Bloomberg
News survey of 16 analysts said natural gas futures may advance
next week as hotter-than-normal weather boosts demand for the
fuel to generate electricity for air conditioning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
