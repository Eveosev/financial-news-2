Canada  added almost twice as many
jobs as economists forecast in June, led by part-time staff and
transportation workers, keeping the country’s  unemployment rate 
at a 2-1/2 year low.  Employment rose by 28,400, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa, exceeding the 15,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
economist survey. The jobless rate was unchanged at 7.4 percent,
the lowest since January 2009.  Canada’s job recovery since the global recession has been
faster than other Group of Seven countries as companies expand
to fill commodity orders. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
has said economic growth may be slowing on disruptions in
automobile production and the drag on exports of a strong
Canadian dollar.  The jobs performance is “much better than what is going on
in most countries,” said  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian
currency and rates strategy at Royal Bank of Canada’s  RBC
Capital Markets  in Toronto. “There are very few holes you can
poke in the jobs market.”  The Canadian dollar reversed earlier gains after the U.S.
reported weaker-than-forecast job figures at 8:30 a.m. New York
time. The Canadian dollar fell 0.4 percent to 96.26 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:33 a.m. in Toronto, compared with 95.87
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0391. The yield on the
Canadian government two-year bond fell six basis points to 1.52
percent.  U.S. Payrolls  The U.S. Labor Department said payrolls rose 18,000 in
June, less than the gain in Canada, a country with a 10th the
population. The U.S. jobless rate rose in June to 9.2 percent
from 9.1 percent, while economists predicted it would be
unchanged.  The American unemployment rate peaked at 10.1 percent in
October 2009, while Canadian unemployment has fallen from a peak
of 8.7 percent in August 2009.  Canada’s unemployment rate remained unchanged in June as
the  labor force  grew by 42,000.  Part-time employment rose by 21,100, and full-time by 7,300
positions,  Statistics Canada  said. Employment rose the most in
transportation and warehousing with 14,500 new jobs and
financial services with 11,300.  Government Jobs  Self-employment decreased by 44,200 in June, while paid
employment advanced by 72,600, Statistics Canada said. Public-
sector employment rose by 50,700 in June and the number of
positions at private companies increased 21,900.  Average hourly wages rose 2 percent in June from a year
ago, matching the previous month’s pace.  Still, some Canadian companies are struggling to find
skilled workers, Human Resources Minister Diane Finley said July
6.  “While there are people who are unemployed, there are
still jobs going begging,” she told reporters in Ottawa.
“There is a degree of skills mismatch across the country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
