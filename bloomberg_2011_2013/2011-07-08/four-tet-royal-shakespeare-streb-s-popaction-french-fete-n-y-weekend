Watch nine very buff dancers play on
a 21-foot rotating ladder.  “Ascension” is a new piece choreographed by Elizabeth
Streb for her Extreme Action Company. Calling her work
“PopAction,” and mixing dance, boxing, sports, rodeo, circus
performance and daredevil stunts, Streb focuses on muscle-
propelled risk.  It’s part of the Whitney Museum’s downtown commissions
program to celebrate its future home.  Performances at 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. at Gansevoort Plaza,
Little W. 12th St. and 9th Ave. on Friday and Saturday.  Information: +1-212-570-3600;  http://whitney.org .  Then head over to Pastis for cold brew and a seared tuna
Nicoise salad.  Located at 9 Ninth Ave. Information: +1-212-929-4844.  Saturday  Enjoy the Zen serenity of a rock juxtaposed against a steel
plate, or the witty, elegant brush-strokes of “From Line”
(1977), part of the Lee Ufan retrospective at the Guggenheim
Museum.  This is the first U.S. show devoted to the artist, who
splits his time between Japan and Paris. Last year, a 32,000-
square foot Lee Ufan museum designed by Tadao Ando opened on the
island of Naoshima.  “Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity” runs until Sept. 28 at 1071
5th Ave. Information: +1-212-423-3618;
 http://www.guggenheim.org .  Saturday Afternoon  Riding high off a year of collaborations with Thom Yorke
and Burial, Four Tet, aka Kieran Hebden, will unleash his
carefully-crafted electronica at MoMA PS1’s Warm Up on Saturday
afternoon.  Expect the hypnotic intricacies of his fantastic 2010
album, “There Is Love in You.”  SBTRKT, a practitioner of dubstep beats, brings a sultry
element to the gathering.  Hydrate well -- it’s a dance party.  At 22-25 Jackson Ave. at 46th Ave.,  Long Island City .
Information: +1-718-784-2084;  http://ps1.org .  Saturday Night  Some of us like Peter Brook’s stripped-down staging of
Mozart’s “Magic Flute,” which is visiting  New York  as part of
the Lincoln Center Festival.  This is not  Julie Taymor ’s eye-ball-filling, over-the-top
fantasy world with its elaborate costumes and scarily balancing
Queen of the Night.  But at a trim 90 minutes, the show offers a hypnotic
simplicity in which silence plays a role.  Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 Tenth Ave.
Information: +1-212-721-6500;  http://lincolncenterfestival.org .  Stroll down to La Silhouette for a post-theater snack.
Start with an Ice Flower cocktail on the rocks: Bombay Sapphire,
St. Germain, dry vermouth plus lemon juice.  Then have some Hudson Valley foie gras with quince and pear
chutney or crudo of dorade with celery root puree.  At 362 W. 53rd St. Information: +1-212-581-2400.  Sunday  Can-Can dancers shake ruffled skirts at the annual Bastille
Day celebration.  Thrown by the French Institute Alliance Francaise, the
party offers wine and cheese, pastries, artisanal beer, as well
as games, storytelling and free language lessons.  Les Chauds Lapins, Banda Magna and the Veveritse Brass Band
will entertain you. And, bien sur, there will also be an
accordionist and a mime.  You won’t want to miss the Citroen and Velosolex rally
where dozens of the stylish French machines go on display
between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.  The fete runs from noon to 5 p.m. on E. 60th St. between
Fifth and Lexington avenues. Information: +1-212-355-6100;
 http://www.fiaf.org .  Sunday Night  The Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Romeo and Juliet”
features Sam Troughton and Mariah Gale as the doomed kids.  These folks don’t travel lightly: They’ve brought the
playhouse, packing it all into 47 containers weighing more than
327 tons. Thusly has Stratford-upon-Avon come to the Park Avenue
Armory.  Five plays are in rotation until Aug. 14, part of the
Lincoln Center Festival.  The Armory is at 643 Park Ave. Information: +1-212-721-
6500;  http://lincolncenterfestival.org .  (With assistance from Jacob Henkoff. Zinta Lundborg is an
