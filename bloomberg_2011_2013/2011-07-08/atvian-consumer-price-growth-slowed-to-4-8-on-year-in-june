Latvian consumer prices rose at a
slower pace in June than in the previous month as the cost of
health care, entertainment and culture fell.  The inflation rate advanced to 4.8 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 5 percent in the previous month, the
Riga-based  statistics office  said on its website today. The
median estimate of five economists in a Bloomberg survey was 5
percent. On the month, consumer prices grew 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
