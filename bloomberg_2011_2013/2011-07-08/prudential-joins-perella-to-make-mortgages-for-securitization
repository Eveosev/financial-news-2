Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, said it formed a venture with
the investment unit of Perella Weinberg Partners LP to originate
commercial mortgages for securitization.  The venture has a target of more than $1 billion a year in
loans, according to a statement today from the mortgage unit at
 Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential.  All loans made through the venture will be originated and
serviced by Prudential. The insurer exited commercial mortgage
securitization in 2008 after the unit posted a pretax loss of
$107 million in the first quarter.  “We think for both the borrowers and for ultimately the
CMBS securitized bonds, that this is a tremendous positive for
the market,” said David Schiff, a partner at Perella Weinberg
and portfolio manager for the asset unit. “Two quality players
are coming back to the market. That’s a sign that things are
healing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
