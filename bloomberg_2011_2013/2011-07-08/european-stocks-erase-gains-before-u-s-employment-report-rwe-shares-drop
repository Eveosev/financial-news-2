European stocks erased their gains,
paring a second weekly advance for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
before a U.S. Labor Department report that may show the world’s
largest economy hired more workers in June. Asian shares
climbed, while U.S. index futures retreated.  PPR (PP)  SA climbed 2.1 percent as people with knowledge of the
matter said buyout firms may bid for the luxury-goods company’s
Redcats unit.  Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGO)  advanced 1 percent
after News Corp. said it will close rival tabloid News of the
World following a phone-hacking scandal.  RWE AG (RWE)  retreated 3.6
percent after a report that the utility’s supervisory board may
discuss a share sale in August.  The Stoxx 600 slid less than 0.1 percent to 275.81 at 10:51
a.m. in London. The gauge is headed for a 0.3 percent advance
this week. The benchmark measure has slumped 5.3 percent from
this year’s high on Feb. 17 on concern that the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis will derail its economic recovery.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
