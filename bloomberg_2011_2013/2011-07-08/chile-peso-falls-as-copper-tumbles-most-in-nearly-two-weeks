Chile ’s peso fell, ending a three-day
winning streak, as copper declined the most in almost two weeks
after U.S. payrolls rose less than forecast in June, damping
growth prospects.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 462.61 per dollar at 10:16
a.m. New York time, from 461.02 yesterday. The currency has
gained 0.6 percent this week.  “The price of copper has been rising strongly in the last
few days, but that flipped today, and the peso responded in
turn,”  Alejandro Puente , an economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA, said in a phone interview from Santiago.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell 1
percent today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , its biggest
decrease since June 27.  Labor Department figures showed U.S. employers added 18,000
workers in June, less than the median economist forecast of
105,000, while the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed to 9.2
percent, indicating a struggling labor market.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell seven basis points to 5.71
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
