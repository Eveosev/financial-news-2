The European Union said today that it
will publish proposals to implement tougher Basel capital and
liquidity rules for banks in the 27-nation region on July 20.  Under the new rules lenders would need to “hold more and
better minimum capital than in the past; will need to build up
‘capital buffers’ over time so they will have money on-hand in
an economic downturn” and will also have to “monitor closely
their liquidity positions and leverage,” the European
Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in a statement on its
 website .  The plans are based on agreements reached last year by the
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , which brings together
regulators from 27 nations including the EU, U.S. and  China , the
Brussels-based commission said. These so-called Basel III rules
are “a tremendously important step forward in learning the
lessons from the crisis and adopting a new approach to risk,”
the commission said.  The proposals will need to be approved by governments and
by lawmakers in the European Parliament before they can enter
into force.  To contact the reporters on this story:
