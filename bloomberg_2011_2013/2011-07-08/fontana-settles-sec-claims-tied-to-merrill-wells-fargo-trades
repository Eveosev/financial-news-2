Forrest Fontana and his Boston-based
investment firm agreed to pay more than $900,000 to settle U.S.
regulator claims they violated anti-manipulation rules.  Fontana Capital LLC bet against shares of Merrill Lynch &
Co.,  XL Group Plc (XL)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  during a restricted
period before buying the shares in a public offering, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said in an administrative
 order  today. The firm made $816,184 in profit on the 2008 trades,
the SEC said.  SEC rules prohibit investors from selling short a stock, a
bet that its price will fall, within five business days of
participating in a public offering of the same security. The
provision, known as Rule 105, aims to prevent investors from
artificially depressing the price shortly before the sale.  In settling the claims, Fontana and his firm didn’t admit
or deny the SEC’s allegations. Lisa Wood, Fontana’s attorney at
Foley Hoag LLP in  Boston , didn’t immediately comment.  Fontana Capital sold short 40,000 shares of Merrill on July
25, 2008, at $27.30 per share, the SEC said. When Merrill, now
part of  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , offered shares for $22.50 four
days later, the investment firm bought 200,000 shares and made a
profit of $507,184. The firm made $160,000 in similar trades in
Wells Fargo shares and $149,000 from an XL Group offering,
according to the order.  The SEC filed an administrative order against Fontana
Capital in January, alleging the firm had made more than $1
million in unlawful profits on the transactions.  Editors: Lawrence Roberts, William Ahearn  To contact the reporter on this story:
