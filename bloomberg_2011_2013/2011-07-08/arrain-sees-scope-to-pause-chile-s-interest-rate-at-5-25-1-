Chile may be able to keep  interest
rates  unchanged for the first time since January as inflation
expectations decline, said Finance Minister Felipe Larrain.  Chile is nearing the end of its tightening cycle as price
pressures moderate along with declines in food and fuel,
Larrain, a non-voting member of the central bank board, told
reporters in Santiago. A report today showing that prices rose
less than expected last month is “good news,” he said.  “There could be space for pauses and a change in
trajectory,” Larrain said about interest rates. “My personal
vision is that we are very close to the end of the process of
returning the monetary policy interest rate to normal.”  Chilean consumer prices climbed 0.2 percent in June from
May, less than the 0.3 percent median forecast of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual inflation was 3.4 percent,
compared with a median estimate of 3.6 percent.  Policy makers have raised the benchmark rate in 12 of their
last 13 meetings to the current 5.25 percent, the highest in
more than two years. The central bank discussed keeping rates
unchanged in the June meeting before increasing by a quarter-
point, according to minutes of the meeting published June 30.  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 463.28 per dollar at 11:23
a.m. New York time from 461.02 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
