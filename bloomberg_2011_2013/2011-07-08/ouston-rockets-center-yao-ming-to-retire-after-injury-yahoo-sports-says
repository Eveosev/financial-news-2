Houston Rockets center Yao Ming will
retire after nine injury-ridden seasons in the  National
Basketball Association , Yahoo! Sports reported.  Houston Rockets  spokesman Nelson Luis didn’t immediately
return calls left at his office. The Yahoo report didn’t cite a
source for its information.  Yao, 30, played an important role in promoting the NBA in
 Asia  when he joined the Rockets from  China  as the No. 1 pick in
the 2002 draft. He hasn’t been able to recover from surgery in
January to repair a stress fracture in his left foot, Yahoo
said, and played in just five games during the 2010-11 season.  The 7-foot-6, 310-pound center will finish his  career 
averaging 19 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocked shots a game.
He played in six All-Star Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
