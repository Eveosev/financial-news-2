Russia â€™s food-safety  service  found
anthrax in two slaughtered cows at a private farm and set up a
local quarantine.  The carcasses of the slaughtered animals have been burned,
Rosselkhoznadzor, as the service is known,  said  on its website
today. The farm is in the village of Sorochinka in the Tula
region of central Russia.  Rosselkhoznadzor said it took steps to contain the disease
including local decontamination and vaccination of 160 head of
cattle and many domestic animals in the quarantine area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
