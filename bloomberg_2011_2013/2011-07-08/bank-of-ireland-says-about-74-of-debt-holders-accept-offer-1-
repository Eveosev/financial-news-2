Bank of Ireland Plc said about 74
percent of subordinated bondholders agreed to swap notes for
equity or cash at a discount as the nation’s largest lender
seeks to raise capital and avoid state control.  The Dublin-based bank, which needs to raise 5.2 billion
euros ($7.4 billion), said on June 23 it will raise at least 2
billion euros of capital from the exchange. Bank of Ireland is
scheduled to announce details of a share sale later today.  Already 36 percent state-owned, the lender has been seeking
to raise money from private investors to avoid becoming the last
domestic lender to fall under state control. Irish Finance
Minister  Michael Noonan  is imposing losses on subordinated
bondholders to offset the cost of bailing out lenders, who have
already been pledged as much as 70 billion euros.  Bank of Ireland will be the country’s only bank to raise
money from money managers since the financial crisis if it
succeeds in raising some of the additional capital being
demanded by regulators. Four Irish lenders were ordered by the
central bank in March to raise 24 billion euros by the end of
July to shore up their balance sheets against mounting bad loan
losses following the collapse of the country’s property bubble.  The government has committed to underwriting the Bank of
Ireland’s planned rights offering at 10 cents per share. The
shares rose 0.9 percent to 11.6 euro cents in Dublin trading
today.  Bank of Ireland said today it will issue 654.17 million
euros of new notes and pay investors more than $18 million cash
under the debt exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
