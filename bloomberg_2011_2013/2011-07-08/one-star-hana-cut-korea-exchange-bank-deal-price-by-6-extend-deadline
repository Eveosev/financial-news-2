Lone Star  Funds agreed to cut the
price of Korea Exchange Bank to 4.4 trillion won ($4.2 billion)
and extended the sale deadline as South Korean regulators delay
approving  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) ’s takeover.  Hana will pay 6 percent less than the initial price of 4.7
trillion won, for a 51 percent stake in KEB, and set Nov. 30 as
the new completion date, according to a regulatory filing today.
The previous terms allowed Hana or the Dallas-based fund to
scrap the deal if was incomplete by May 24 this year.  Lone Star is using record dividend payments to recoup its
investment in the Seoul-based bank and agreed to cut the sale
price further if it gets more payouts before the deal closes.
Hana Chairman Kim Seung Yu aims to narrow the gap in assets and
market value with bigger rivals  KB Financial Group Inc. (105560)  and
Woori Finance Holdings Co. with the purchase, which is on hold
until a court case involving Lone Star is resolved.  “Extending the contract isn’t enough to convince investors
that Hana and Lone Star can complete the deal,” said Lim Jeong
Seok, head of equities at Seoul-based KDB Asset Management Co.,
which oversees the equivalent of $11 billion in assets. “The
uncertainty won’t end until the regulators give their go-
ahead.”  Under today’s agreement, Hana will pay Lone Star 13,390 won
for each KEB share, down from 14,250 won, according to the
filing. Hana rose 0.3 percent to 38,800 won at the close of
Seoul trading. The stock has lost 10 percent this year.  Further Dividends  While the price will go down if Lone Star receives further
dividends, it will go up by 100 won per share for each month the
deal is delayed beyond September, to account for general gains
in asset values, the statement said.  The Seoul High Court began a retrial of Lone Star and its
former local chief Paul Yoo and KEB on June 16 on stock
manipulation charges after the  Supreme Court  in March overturned
a 2008 acquittal.  The Financial Services Commission will not approve the
transaction while legal proceeding questioning Lone Star’s
legitimacy as the owner of the  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  remain, vice
chairman Shin Je Yoon said on May 12.  KEB on July 1 said it would pay 973.8 billion won in
interim dividends, 497 billion of which will go to Lone Star,
helping it recoup all of its $2 billion investment.  Lone Star bought Korea Exchange Bank in 2003 and has been
trying to sell it for almost five years.  Court Probes  Its holding in the Korean lender came into question
following a probe that began in 2006 into allegations it paid
artificially low prices for the stake. Korea’s top court last
year cleared the fund on that case.  Lone Star had to scrap an attempt to sell its stake to HSBC
Holdings Plc in 2008 amid regulator’s delay in ruling on the
eligibility. Kookmin Bank, now part of KB Financial, walked away
from talks to buy control of  Korea  Exchange Bank in November
2006.  Hana and KEB’s combined assets at the end of March totaled
313 trillion won, trailing Woori’s 346 trillion won, KB
Financial’s 345 trillion won and Shinhan Financial Group Co.’s
323 trillion won, according to filings by the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
