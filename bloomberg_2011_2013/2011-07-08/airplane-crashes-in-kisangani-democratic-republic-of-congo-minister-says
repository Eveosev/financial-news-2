Forty-six people are confirmed dead
in the crash of a Boeing 727 aircraft that was attempting to
land during heavy rains in Kisangani in  Democratic Republic of
Congo , according to the chief executive of Hewa Bora Airways,
the plane’s owner.  The aircraft carried 110 people and there were 53 confirmed
survivors, Hewa Bora Chief Executive Officer Stavros Papaioannou
said by phone from Kinshasa, Congo’s capital. Eleven people were
not immediately accounted for.  The number of dead could increase, he said, noting that the
hospitals in Kisangani “are not very well equipped” to save
the lives of crash victims.  The plane crashed some 300 to 600 meters (328 to 656 yards)
from the Kisangani runway during a stopover from Kinshasa to
Goma in eastern Congo, Papaioannou said.  “We are waiting for an investigation to clarify exactly
what was the reason for the crash,” he said.  All of Congo’s airlines are prohibited from flying in the
European Union, according to the bloc’s list of banned carriers,
which was last updated on April 21.  In April 2008, a Hewa Bora Airways plane crashed on takeoff
in Goma, killing 37 people on the ground, three on the plane,
and injuring another 202.  To contact the reporter on this story:
