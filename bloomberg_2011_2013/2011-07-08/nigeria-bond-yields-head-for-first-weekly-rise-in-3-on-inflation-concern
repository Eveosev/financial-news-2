Nigerian bonds declined, with yields
headed for the first weekly increase in three on concern the
central bank of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy will
raise rates to curb inflation, eroding returns.  The 5.5 percent debt due 2013 of Africa’s largest oil
producer reached 9.82 percent yesterday, climbing 47 basis
points, or 0.47 percentage point, since the close on July 1,
according to data from the Financial Market Dealers Association
available on Bloomberg.  Nigeria’s inflation quickened to 12.4 percent in May as
three increases in its benchmark interest rate this year to 8
percent by May failed to curb price growth and bring it in line
with the central bank’s 10 percent target.  “We sensed a feeling that single-digit inflation will
again be elusive in 2011,” Gregory Kronsten and Olubunmi
Asaolu, analysts at FBN Capital Ltd., wrote in a note to clients
today. “The tightening cycle has at least a further 50 basis
points to run.” FBN Capital is a unit of First Bank of  Nigeria 
Plc, the country’s third-largest lender.  The West African nation may not attain its goal of cutting
the inflation rate to below 10 percent this year, central bank
Governor Lamido Sanusi said on June 20.  The naira snapped two days of declines, strengthening 0.3
percent to 152.825 per dollar at 12:08 p.m. in Lagos. The
increase pared the currency’s decline to 1.1 percent this week,
a first retreat in three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
