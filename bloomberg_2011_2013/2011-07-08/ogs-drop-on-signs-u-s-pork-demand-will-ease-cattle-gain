Hog futures fell for the first time
in a week as U.S. jobs data signaled a fragile economic
recovery, eroding prospects for pork demand. Cattle rose to the
highest price since April.  Wholesale pork declined 0.8 percent to 96.59 cents a pound
yesterday, the biggest drop in a week, and spot-market hog
prices touched a three-week low, government data show. U.S.
employers added 18,000 workers in June, the fewest in nine
months, and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly rose to 9.2
percent, Labor Department figures showed.  “The jobs report damped the outlook for economic
recovery,” said Doug Houghton, an analyst at Brock Associates
in  Milwaukee . “If you look at the cash market, the packers have
probably covered a good part of next week’s needs, and they’re
still looking at weak margins.”  Hog futures for August settlement dropped 0.175 cent, or
0.2 percent, to 96.1 cents a pound at 10:33 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the first decline since June 30. Before
today, the commodity rose 19 percent in the past 12 months.  Yesterday, the price of hogs for immediate delivery to
slaughterhouses fell 2.3 percent to 92.49 cents a pound, the
lowest since June 14, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.325 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $1.1505 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.1525,
the highest for a most-active contract since April 25. Before
today, the price gained 27 percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.575
cent, or 0.4 perlcent, to $1.44475 a pound after climbing to a
record $1.448.  To contact the reporter on this story:
