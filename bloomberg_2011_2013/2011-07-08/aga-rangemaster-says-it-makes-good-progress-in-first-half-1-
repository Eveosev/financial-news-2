AGA Rangemaster Group Plc (AGA) , a U.K.
range cooker and kitchen specialist, said it had a “solid”
first half and made “good operating profit progress.”  The Warwickshire-based company said in a statement on the
PR Newswire that it is pleased with the performance because
domestic home improvement spending remained subdued. Cooker
volumes slipped because of “the relatively quiet U.K. market”,
while exports continued to achieve record levels elsewhere in
 Europe . Revenue was “slightly lower” although margins
improved.  The company introduced a new cooker system called AGA Total
Control, which it said had been “very well received,” and
would be sold in international markets this autumn.  The company’s shares dropped 3.25 pence, or 2.9 percent, to
close at 109 pence at 4:35 p.m. in LOondon. They have risen 7.7
percent in the year so far, giving AGA Rangemaster a market
value of 75.5 million pounds ($121 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
