Zimbabwe ’s three main political
parties can’t agree on changes to the security forces or the
composition of an independent commission to oversee elections,
the  Herald  reported, citing minutes from a meeting held this
week.  The parties also failed to agree on outstanding issues such
as “state-sponsored violence” and the deployment of soldiers
in Zimbabwe’s rural areas, the Harare-based state-controlled
newspaper said on its website.  President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front refused a Movement for Democratic Change demand
that foreign election monitors be deployed for six months before
and after the election, the Herald said.  The parties, in talks on conditions that must be in place
for elections to be held, agreed that Mugabe can’t announce an
election date before consulting  Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of
the MDC and prime minister in the country’s power-sharing
government, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
