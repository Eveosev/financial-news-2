MasterCard Inc. (MA) , in a challenge to a
European Union decision accusing it of punishing consumers who
pay with plastic, told a European Union court it couldn’t
operate without the fees it charges on credit-card payments.  The second-biggest card network, joined in the fight by
banks including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS) , attacked a 2007 decision over transaction fees on
cross-border credit-card payments. The case will test whether
such levies are unfair to retailers and customers.  MasterCard maintaining a set fee “is necessary for the
viability of its global debit and credit card scheme,” said
Thomas Sharpe, a lawyer for MasterCard told  EU General Court  in
Luxembourg today. The absence of such a charge “would render
MasterCard’s main operation most difficult or impossible.”  Regulators globally are probing card fees and the way they
are set. Visa Europe Ltd.’s fees for cross-border credit-card
and so-called deferred-debit transactions could spark an
antitrust complaint later this year, the EU’s antitrust
regulator has said. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s decision
last month to cap debit-card swipe fees at 21 cents may cut by
half the $16 billion in annual revenue reaped by card issuers
including  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   MasterCard argued it didn’t keep fees high to please banks.  “The 2006 initial public offering was a radical
transformation,” Bernard Amory, another MasterCard lawyer, told
a three-judge panel of the court. “MasterCard is no longer
owned and controlled by the banks, and it is completely
independent of the banks” in setting the fee and “MasterCard
has no interest” in this fee being high.  2009 Changes  MasterCard argued the so-called multilateral interchange
fee at issue in today’s case is a set amount to be paid between
the banks and inherent to the functioning of the card program.  While MasterCard agreed to fee changes in 2009 in a
settlement with the European Commission to avoid a daily penalty
of as much as 3.5 percent of sales, it asked the court to quash
the EU antitrust agency’s findings. The fee cuts will save
consumers 200 million euros ($287 million) a year, the
commission said at the time.  Retailers have long complained about the cost of taking
plastic. Unlike with checks, banks charge them fees, known as
interchange, to process debit- and credit-card payments. The
amounts are set by MasterCard and Visa, which own the payment
networks and pass the money to the banks.  Jules Stuyck, a lawyer for EuroCommerce, a retailers
association representing companies such as  Carrefour SA (CA) ,  Hennes
& Mauritz AB (HMB)  and Tesco Plc, the U.K.’s largest retailer, backed
the commission’s view that there was a restriction of
competition before and after MasterCard went public.  Enormous Costs  The fees at issue in the case “lead to enormous costs for
retailers estimated at 12 billion euros a year,” he told the
court. EuroCommerce filed a complaint with the commission
against the card program in 1997.  “A public company acts in the interests of its public
shareholders,” not the banks, said Amory, an antitrust partner
at law firm  Jones Day  in Brussels.  The commission’s lawyer Nicholas Khan said Purchase, New
York-based MasterCard, “hopes to extract the maximum from
merchants.”  Royal Bank of  Scotland ’s lawyer Nicholas Green said the
allegations in the commission’s decision were arrived at
“without ever being put to the banks for comment” and were
“crying out” for lenders to respond.  Any decision in today’s case can be appealed at the
region’s top tribunal, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  The case is: T-111/08, MasterCard and others v. European
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
