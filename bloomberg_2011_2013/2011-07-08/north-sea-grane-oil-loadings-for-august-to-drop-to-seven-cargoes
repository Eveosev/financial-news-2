Exports of North Sea Grane crude for
August will drop to seven cargoes, one less than July, according
to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The August program will total 4.2 million barrels, or
135,484 barrels a day, the plan showed. That’s 13 percent less
than this month.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s largest oil company, is the operator
of the Grane field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
