    July 8 (Bloomberg) ---  Glorious Property Holdings Ltd. (845) , a
developer with projects in 10 Chinese cities, may cut prices on
two existing residential developments as it plans to start
marketing two new projects, according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc.  “The management decided to cut the price of Hefei and
Nantong projects because of bad sales recorded in the first
half,” Jeffrey Gao, a Shanghai-based analyst at RBS, said in a
phone interview today, citing a meeting with the company’s Chief
Financial Officer Michael Jiang. “The new developments in
Harbin’s Royal Bay and in Dalian won’t be hurt by property-
purchasing curbs because they are in new developing areas.”  Chinese developers are accelerating sales since the
government imposed tougher controls on home purchases this year.
The outlook on property companies was cut to “negative” from
“stable” by  Standard & Poor’s  on June 15 on concern tighter
credit and further controls may lead to rating downgrades in the
next year.  Helen Zhou, a Hong Kong-based investor relations officer at
Glorious Property, declined to comment on the price cuts when
contacted by Bloomberg News today.  The company’s two new projects may contribute 1 billion
yuan ($155 million) to revenue in the second half, Gao said.  The stock rose 4.8 percent to HK$2.62 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong, the highest since Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
