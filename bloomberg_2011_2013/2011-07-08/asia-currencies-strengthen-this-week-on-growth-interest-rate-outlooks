Asian currencies rose for a second
week, led by  Thailand ’s baht, on speculation the world’s fastest
economic growth and rising interest rates will spur more fund
inflows from abroad.  The baht posted its biggest five-day advance since December
2008 as overseas investors increased holdings of local assets
after the Pheu Thai party won a clear majority in elections last
weekend, reducing the scope for political unrest. China raised
borrowing costs July 6 and the Bank of Thailand is expected to
do so next week. Global funds pumped about $1.6 billion into
South Korean, Thai and Indonesian equities in the first four
days of the week, exchange data show.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.3
percent this week, touching a 14-year high of 119.40 yesterday.
The baht climbed 1.9 percent to 30.24 per dollar, the Philippine
peso strengthened 1 percent to 42.745 and  South Korea ’s won
advanced 0.9 percent to 1,057.08, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The difference in growth rates between Asia and developed
economies will attract fund inflows,” said  Frances Cheung , a
senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “Asian
currencies will strengthen toward year-end.”  Developing economies in Asia will expand 8.4 percent in
2011, outpacing growth of 2.5 percent in the U.S. and 2 percent
in the euro region, according to International Monetary Fund
estimates released last month. Benchmark interest rates of 7.5
percent in  India  and 6.75 percent in  Indonesia  compare with a
maximum 0.25 percent in the U.S. and  Japan .  Taming Inflation  The People’s Bank of  China  this week boosted one-year
lending and deposit rates to 6.56 percent and 3.5 percent,
respectively. China’s yuan was little changed from a week ago at
6.4650.  The baht reached a one-month high yesterday after incoming
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said policy makers will let
the currency appreciate to tame inflation, according to a Wall
Street Journal report on July 7. The Bank of Thailand, which has
boosted its benchmark interest rate four times this year, will
lift it by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.25 percent on
July 13, according to all 13 economists polled by Bloomberg.  “The baht got a boost from fund inflows into the nation on
optimism the country will have a stable government for now,”
said Kozo Hasegawa, a currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. in Bangkok. “Yingluck also showed an intention to let the
baht rise, while the market is also pricing in a rate hike next
week. The baht will stay on a bullish bias for now.”  ‘Won’s Upward Momentum’  The won climbed to its highest level in almost three years
after U.S. companies added twice as many workers as forecast in
June, shoring up confidence the global economic recovery will be
sustained. Employers in the world’s largest economy added
157,000 workers to their payrolls, according to figures released
on July 7 by ADP Employer Services, more than the 70,000
forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The South Korean currency had a third weekly gain after
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said July 6 the local economy was
expected to expand faster in the second half of 2011 than in the
first six months.  “The won started off on a very strong note amid signs that
the global economy is expanding,” said Hwang Sun Min, a Seoul-
based currency dealer with Kookmin Bank, the nation’s largest
lender. “The won’s upward momentum will continue.”  Elsewhere,  Malaysia ’s ringgit gained 0.5 percent this week
to 2.9948 per dollar, Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened 0.2
percent to 8,520 and the  Singapore dollar  advanced 0.6 percent
to S$1.2195. India’s rupee appreciated 0.6 percent to 44.3280
while  Taiwan ’s dollar slipped 0.1 percent to NT$28.795.  To contact the reporters on this story:
