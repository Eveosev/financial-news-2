The Sudanese government suspended six
newspapers because their owners include citizens from South
 Sudan , which is due to be declared independent tomorrow, the
state-run  Sudanese Media Center  said today.  The suspension will be imposed on five English-language
papers and the Arabic Ajras al-Hurreya newspaper, the Khartoum-
based  news agency  reported, citing Al-Obaid Ahmed Morawwah, the
secretary-general of the Sudanese press council.  At midnight,  Southern Sudan  will be the world’s 193rd
nation, assuming control of about 75 percent of Sudan’s current
oil production of 490,000 barrels a day when it secedes from
Sudan. Most of Sudan’s crude is pumped by China National
Petroleum Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd and India’s
Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  The Southern Sudanese will lose their Sudanese citizenship
when the south is declared independent, Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir’s government in Khartoum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
