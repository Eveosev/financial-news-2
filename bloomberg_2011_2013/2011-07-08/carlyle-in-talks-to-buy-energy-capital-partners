Carlyle Group , the Washington-based
private-equity firm gearing up for an initial public offering,
is in talks to purchase Energy Capital Partners, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the negotiations.  Discussions began about three months ago and may not lead
to a deal, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the matter is private.  Energy Capital Partners, a private-equity firm based in
Short Hills,  New Jersey , with offices in  San Diego , has raised
about $7 billion to invest in energy infrastructure assets
including gas, electric and alternative power plants, according
to its website. The firm gathered $4.34 billion last year for
its second private-equity fund, as rising energy prices
attracted investors.  Carlyle aims to take advantage of more stable stock markets
to join U.S.-listed rivals  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , KKR & Co. and
Apollo Global Management LLC. Blackstone, the world’s largest
private-equity firm, has gained 22 percent this year in New York
trading and KKR has risen 12 percent. Apollo has declined 11
percent since its March 29 offering.  Carlyle, which may raise about $1 billion by going public,
told investors it was winding down a joint venture with New
York-based investment company Riverstone Holdings LLC, the
person said. Riverstone and Carlyle amassed a $1.1 billion fund
in 2004 to buy energy assets, after gathering a $222 million
pool in 2001.  An official at Carlyle Group declined to comment. Energy
Capital Partners didn’t return a telephone message left after
regular business hours.  The talks were reported earlier today by the New York
Times’ Dealbook.  #<561013.6132810.2.1.87.23378.96># To contact the reporter on this story:
