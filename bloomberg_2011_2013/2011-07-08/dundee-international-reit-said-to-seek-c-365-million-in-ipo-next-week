Dundee International Real Estate
Investment Trust plans to raise about C$365 million ($379
million) in an initial public offering to buy properties in
 Germany , according to two people familiar with the sale.  The Toronto-based REIT plans to sell about C$290 million in
units and C$75 million in convertible debentures, said the
people, who asked not to be named because the terms aren’t
public. The IPO is expected to be sold next week, they said.  The REIT was founded by Dundee Corp.’s real estate unit to
buy 295 office and other commercial properties in Germany with
about 12.5 million square feet of leasable commercial area,
according to a June 8 filing.  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ,  Europe ’s largest
mail carrier, leases about 75 percent of the property, which
would make Dundee International REIT the single largest landlord
in Germany for the postal company, the filing said.  The sale would be  Canada ’s largest REIT IPO in at least a
decade, surpassing TransGlobe Apartment REIT’s C$247.3 million
IPO in May 2010. TD Securities is leading a group of 11 firms on
the sale.  Dundee Corp., a Toronto-based firm that offers asset
management and real estate services, will buy 10 million units
and its Dundee Realty Corp. unit will buy 2 million units, the
filing said. Dundee Realty, which formed Dundee REIT in 2003,
has about C$5 billion in assets under management.  A telephone message left with  Dundee Corp. (DC/A)  Chief Executive
Officer Ned Goodman wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
