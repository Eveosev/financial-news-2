Daily exports of 12 main North Sea
crude grades will decline 12 percent in August from this month,
according to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  Combined shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk,
Alvheim, Aasgard, DUC, Flotta, Grane, Gullfaks, Statfjord, and
Troll grades will total 61.4 million barrels, or 1.98 million
barrels a day, next month, loading programs showed. That
compares with 69.7 million barrels, or 2.25 million barrels a
day, in July.  The lower output is mainly due to a 30 percent drop in
production of Forties. Exports of this blend will be 309,677
barrels a day, the lowest in at least four years, due to planned
maintenance at the Forties Pipeline System.  BP Plc,  Europe â€™s second-biggest oil company, will shut the
FPS from Aug. 1 to Aug. 5 for planned maintenance and the
removal of an unexploded World War II mine found in March, Mark Salt, a London-based spokesman for the company, said in an e-
mailed statement on May 31.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities. All the 12 grades are
light, sweet or low-sulfur, meaning they can produce more
profitable fuels such as gasoline and diesel.  Details of loadings of the 12 grades are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
