Wheat futures rose, capping the first
weekly gain since May, on speculation that U.S. livestock
producers and biofuel makers will buy more of the grain as an
alternative to corn.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates 220 million
bushels of wheat will go to  feed  and residual use this year, 29
percent more than in 2010. Corn prices rallied today, capping
the first weekly gain since May and narrowing the grain’s
discount to wheat, on speculation that hot weather in the
Midwest will erode yields.  “Wheat feeding is still very high, and we’re seeing actual
usage of wheat in biofuels, given the wheat-corn price spread,”
said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity Analytics &
Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana .  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 16.75 cents, or
2.6 percent, to settle at $6.5125 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. This week, the price climbed 6.4 percent
after tumbling 25 percent in the previous five weeks.  Corn futures for July delivery have traded at a premium to
wheat in the past month for the first time since 1996 with the
price difference widening to as much as 66.75 cents a bushel.
Today, the September corn contract closed at $6.4225, 9 cents
below wheat. A year earlier, corn was $1.63 cheaper.  The U.S. is the world’s leading exporter of wheat. The
grain is the nation’s fourth-largest crop, valued at $13 billion
in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
