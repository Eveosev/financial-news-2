Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a managing
director at the  World Bank , will leave her post mid-August to
become coordinating minister for the economy and minister of
finance in Nigeria, the Washington-based lender said.  Nigeria’s Senate this week approved Okonjo-Iweala’s return
to a cabinet position, five years after she left a previous
government.  “Her desire to serve her country is truly a big loss for
the World Bank but a major gain for Nigeria as it works to craft
its economic way forward,” World Bank President  Robert Zoellick 
said in a press release today. He called her work “stellar.”  As finance minister of Africa’s largest oil producer from
2003 to 2006, Okonjo-Iweala spearheaded talks that led the Paris
Club group of creditors to write off $18 billion in Nigerian
debt. At the World Bank since 2007, she had special oversight
for work in African, eastern  Europe , and Central and South Asia.  She also led efforts to replenish the bank’s fund that
lends to poor countries, raising a record $49.3 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
