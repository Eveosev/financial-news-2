Rwanda ’s economic growth will
probably slow to 7 percent this year from an estimated 7.5
percent and inflation may accelerate to 7.5 percent, the
International Monetary Fund said.  Rwanda’s central bank is committed to tightening monetary
policy if needed to curb second-round effects of higher
international food and fuel costs, the Washington-based
institution said in a statement on its website.  Sustained growth in the East African nation’s economy is
dependent on securing financing for projects, a favorable
external environment and a strong recovery in private sector
credit, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
