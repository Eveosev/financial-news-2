What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that hot,
dry weather the next two weeks will erode U.S. crop prospects,
said  Dax Wedemeyer , a broker at U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West
Des Moines . Increased Chinese purchases of U.S. grain also may
boost prices, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that demand will get a boost from
livestock producers seeking an alternative to higher-priced
corn, Wedemeyer said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 3 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago after a government report showed overseas buyers
canceled orders for soy-based animal feed and cooking oil,
Wedemeyer said. Slower-than-expected U.S. job growth also may
dim prospects for domestic demand, he said. Soybean-oil futures
are expected to open 0.15 cent to 0.25 cent a pound lower, and
soybean-meal futures may open down $1 to $2 for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
