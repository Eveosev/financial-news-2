U.S. Gulf crudes surged as the gap
between West Texas Intermediate and Brent widened a fourth
consecutive day to near a record.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart increased
$2.23 to $22.15 a barrel as of 1:10 p.m. in  New York  after
hitting an intraday high of $22.43, above a record of $22.29
based on settlement prices June 15.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $2.10 to $18.35 a
barrel over WTI as of 12:20 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained $2 to $18.50
over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added $2.20 to $13 a barrel, while Poseidon gained $2.15
to $12.90 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened $1.50 to $13.50 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $1.
Thunder Horse’s premium increased $2.60 to $19.10.  The premium for Syncrude widened 15 cents to $8.65.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25 cents to
$20.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
