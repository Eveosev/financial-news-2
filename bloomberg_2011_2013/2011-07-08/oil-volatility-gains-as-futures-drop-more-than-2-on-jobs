Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures tumbled more than 2 percent after the
U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast in June and the  unemployment
rate  climbed, damping optimism for an economic rebound and fuel
demand growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.5 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New
York , up from 27.4 percent yesterday. August options expire in a
week, on July 15.  Crude for August delivery dropped $2.47, or 2.5 percent, to
settle at $96.20 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
