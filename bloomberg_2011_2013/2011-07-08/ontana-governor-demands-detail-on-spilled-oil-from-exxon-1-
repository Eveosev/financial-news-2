Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer
demanded today that  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  provide the state with
details on the type of oil that has been shipped through the
ruptured Silvertip pipeline over the last three years.  In a letter to Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson,
Schweitzer sought a description of the oil, including its
viscosity, volatility and toxicity, along with any test data the
company has for the “most effective dispersant” for the crude
that spilled into the Yellowstone River.”  Exxon’s 12-inch pipeline was shut July 1 after rupturing
and leaking as much as 1,000 barrels of oil into the river. The
line runs 69 miles from Elk Basin,  Wyoming , and supplies the
company’s Billings refinery.  The demand comes as owners of property along the river are
banding together to push the company to do more to restore the
land, which they say was soiled by the leak.  Schweitzer asked that the information be provided as soon
as possible and no later than July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
