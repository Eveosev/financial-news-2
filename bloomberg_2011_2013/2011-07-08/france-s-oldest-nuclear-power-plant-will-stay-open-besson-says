Electricite de France SA’s Fessenheim
nuclear plant, the country’s oldest, will remain open after
regulators said it can operate for another 10 years as long as
improvements are made, Industry Minister Eric Besson said.  “I confirm that Fessenheim will continue to operate,”
Besson said on Europe1 radio. Besson said further work on the
plant may be required as a result of safety audits on European
nuclear plants that were ordered after the Fukushima meltdown in
 Japan .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
