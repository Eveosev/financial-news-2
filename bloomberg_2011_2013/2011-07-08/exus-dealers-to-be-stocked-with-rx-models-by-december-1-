Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  plans to restore
 Lexus  RX production in Canada to full speed in September and
have dealers stocked with RX sport-utility vehicles by December,
said Mark Templin, the U.S. chief of Lexus.  Sales of Lexus vehicles fell this year as the tsunami in
Japan disrupted suppliers and reduced manufacturing. Lexus sales
in June in the U.S. fell 38 percent to 10,773 from 17,332 a year
earlier. For the first half, U.S. Lexus sales slid 18 percent to
88,010.  “June was the bottom of the trough,” Templin said today
at a media luncheon in Chicago. “We see a bright future.”  The RX is the top-selling Lexus model. Through June,
dealers sold 39,838 in the U.S., 9.1 percent fewer than in last
year’s first half.  The brand’s buyers haven’t gone to other manufacturers
because of the company’s troubles with production, Templin said.  “They’ll be there when we do have product,” he said.  Sales of  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW brand rose 13
percent in the first half, the same as the rest of the U.S. auto
market.  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz gained 7 percent, according
to research firm Autodata Corp. and company statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
