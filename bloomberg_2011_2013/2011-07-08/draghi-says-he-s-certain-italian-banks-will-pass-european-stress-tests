Bank of  Italy  Governor  Mario Draghi 
said he’s certain that the country’s lenders will pass European
stress tests.  “I’m certain, based on our analyses, that the Italian
intermediaries will pass with a signficant margin, the stress
tests that are currently being undertaken in  Europe , confirming
their adequate level of capitalization,” he said in an e-
emailed statement today.  He added that new Italian austerity measures make balancing
the country’s budget in 2014 a “realistic” goal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
