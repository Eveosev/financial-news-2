Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in July to export terminals near  New Orleans  fell
relative to Chicago futures on slower export demand and
speculation that rain may limit damage from hot weather.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month fell to 89 cents to 92 cents a bushel above September
futures from 90 cents to 92 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The basis for soybeans was 75 cents to 78
cents a bushel above the July futures, compared with 75 cents to
79 cents.  “Export demand is a little softer than it was a week ago”
after futures rose on threatening weather for U.S. crops, said
 Glenn Hollander , a partner at Hollander & Feuerhaken in Chicago.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about how long the hot weather
will last and the impact on crops.”  Corn futures for September delivery rose 17.25 cents, or
2.8 percent, to close at $6.4225 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. The contract gained 5.9 percent this week after
falling to a three-month low last week.  Soybean futures for July delivery climbed 6.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.42 a bushel, capping a 2.3 percent weekly gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
