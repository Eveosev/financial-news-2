Senator  Ron Johnson , a Wisconsin
Republican, in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” said the U.S. can avoid a
default on obligations to bondholders even if Congress
doesn’t raise the debt ceiling by August.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Wisconsin freshman
Republican Senator Ron Johnson, a major Tea Party
supporter. Thank you for being with us, senator.  SENATOR RON JOHNSON: Well, thanks for having me on.  HUNT: Unemployment rate went up to 9.2 percent on
Friday morning, anemic job growth, obviously bad news for
the economy.  There are those that say, however, that that shows
what a sluggish economy is and, as important as it is to
cut back on spending and cut back on the size of
government, that any kind of tight fiscal policy now would
be a big mistake, and we ought to delay for at least a
couple years in order to get this economy back on track.  JOHNSON: Well, I think the problem is, really, is the
uncertainty caused by all the  government spending  and the
fact that we’re - we’ve, in just the last three years,
we’ve increased our debt and deficit by over $4 trillion.  That’s a 35 percent increase in our nation’s debt from
President Obama.  HUNT: And you don’t think if we cut now it could lead
to a double dip recession?  JOHNSON: The problem is we’re borrowing. It’s not that
we have the money to actually spend.  JOHNSON: We have to first put in the structural caps-  We’ll increase the debt ceiling upon certification
that we’ve actually passed a constitutional amendment that
will limit spending and eventually lead to a balanced
budget, and let the people decide. Let them-  HUNT: Let me ask you-  JOHNSON: - people decide.  HUNT: Let me ask you this: the - you’re - we’re three
and a half weeks away from what the Treasury secretary said
would be a cataclysmic default.  Do you think that - what are the odds now that we’ll
hit August 2 without any kind of deal?  JOHNSON: Well, they’re higher than they should be
because this president did not engage until just last week,
basically. I mean, to me, it’s - it is unbelievable.  HUNT: Do you think there will be a default?  JOHNSON: Well, first of all, there’s no reason for
default.  HUNT: Right.  JOHNSON: I mean, according to the president’s own
budget, if we don’t increase the debt ceiling, we’ll have
to live within our means, which would be $2.6 trillion next
year. And $2.6 trillion, just to put that into comparison,
10 years ago, we spent $1.8 trillion.  HUNT: Right.  JOHNSON: It covers 100 percent of Social Security,
which is $760 billion. That’s a trillion dollars. That
leaves $1.6 trillion to cover about $2.6 trillion dollars
of expenditures.  HUNT: Well, you’ve actually put out-  (CROSSTALK)  JOHNSON: So there’s no reason for us to default.  HUNT: And you have talked about a default budget, you
know, if we hit -  (CROSSTALK)  JOHNSON: Right.  HUNT: Let me ask you, would it cover Chinese bond
holders?  JOHNSON: Anybody who owns-  HUNT: OK.  JOHNSON: - you know, American-  HUNT: So it covers -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Would it cover military pay and benefits?  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: All military pay and (inaudible)?  JOHNSON: That’s right.  HUNT: Right. Would it cover drone attacks on
(inaudible) Taliban?  (CROSSTALK)  JOHNSON: I haven’t laid out the debt-  HUNT: No, no. But these-  JOHNSON: I haven’t laid out the debt-  HUNT: - but these are important questions and-  JOHNSON: - and I’m not recommending it. What I’m -
what I’m saying - what I’m saying is that, you know, I’m
new here in town.  I know how broken  Washington  is and I issued a letter
to the - or I sent a letter to President Obama saying
you’re responsible.  HUNT: I understand that you’re not advocating it. I
really do.  I’m just saying if we hit that situation, you talk
about a sort of a contingency budget thing, what it would
cover and what it might not cover. Would it cover those
drone attacks-  JOHNSON: This is-  HUNT: - and the Taliban?  JOHNSON: You know, I’m a business guy. I’ve had
customers go bankrupt.  HUNT: Right.  JOHNSON: We’re basically, you know, viewing this
almost bankrupt America. So I take a look at this as
secured creditors versus unsecured creditors.  So I’d put interest on the debt, you know, debt
service. I’d put Social Security, I’d put paying the
soldiers and, you know, specify some other things that
would be the secured credit -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: IRS refunds?  JOHNSON: They would - they would get dollar for dollar
coverage. And then you take the 1.6 versus the 2.6 and this
is one way of handling it.  Say we’ll pay the rest of you 60 cents on the dollar
until we reorganize, until we actually fix the problem.
That would be one way of -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: So but IRS refunds might only be 60 percent? Are
Wisconsin farm payments might only be 60 percent?  JOHNSON: For a couple weeks until we actually fix the
problem.  HUNT: If Obama agrees to a $4 trillion plus reduction
over the next 10 years, that includes three out of every
four of those dollars are on the spending side, significant
cutbacks in Medicare, in addition to domestic spending, and
$1 trillion in added revenues, could you support that if
the components are right?  JOHNSON: The devil’s in the details.  HUNT: OK.  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: No, what I’m trying to - you would rule that out
automatically because of revenues?  JOHNSON: And on the detail, again, I - I’m a small
business guy. I never (ph) came to Washington for special
tax deals. I’m opposed to those special tax deals, but not
opposed to legitimate business deductions.  HUNT: OK.  HUNT: But, Senator Johnson, am I right in saying you
wouldn’t rule out, if the details were right, a package
that included significant added revenues if it - if it was
done correctly.  JOHNSON: Again, we need more revenue, but we do need
to increase revenue deals (inaudible) by growing our
economy-  HUNT: Yes, but, you know -  (CROSSTALK)  JOHNSON: - listen, we can’t - economic growth is the
number one component for a solution here. None of the
policies that enact (ph) should harm economic growth.
Increasing taxes harm -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Let me - 1993,  Bill Clinton  increased taxes.
2001,  George W. Bush , massive tax cuts. We created 23
million jobs - there were 23 million jobs created under the
Clinton administration, 3 million under Bush. If taxes are
all important, why that difference?  JOHNSON: In 2003, total revenue of the federal
government was (inaudible) trillion.  HUNT: No, but give me -  (CROSSTALK)  JOHNSON: Five years later, in 2008, it was $2.5
trillion.  Had we taken Bill Clinton’s budget at $1.8 trillion in
2000, grown it by the rate of population and inflation, we
would be at about $2.6 trillion right now. The problem is
spending.  HUNT: Senator, I want to ask you again-  JOHNSON: (Inaudible).  HUNT: - why were so many more jobs created after the
Clinton tax increase than after the Bush tax cuts?  JOHNSON: Because jobs and businesses were created in
the ‘80s under  Ronald Reagan  when he dropped tax rates down
to 28 percent. No, I’m the living proof of that. I began my
business-  HUNT: So all those Clinton jobs - all those Clinton
jobs are due to Ronald Reagan?  JOHNSON: Absolutely. That is - those came from the
businesses that started in the ‘80s, when Reagan dropped
top margin tax rates from 70 percent down to 28 percent.
Yes.  HUNT: So it’s all due to Republican policies, nothing
to do with Bill Clinton’s policies?  (CROSSTALK)  JOHNSON: That’s exactly what caused it.  HUNT: You want to have a balanced budget. We mentioned
that earlier, enshrined in the Constitution. You’re a big
booster of Wisconsin Congressman  Paul Ryan ’s budget.  Ten years from now, he would have a deficit under his
budget of about $400 billion. What would you cut? What big
programs would you cut to get there, the Paul Ryan -  (CROSSTALK)  JOHNSON: What we need to do is structural reform
entitlement programs.  And as I, you know, I’m new to this political process,
but as I went through the campaign, I would ask younger
people - for me, unfortunately, that’s 50 and under.  What do you expect to get out of Social Security and
Medicare?  HUNT: But-  JOHNSON: Without exception, the answer was always,
“Nothing.” So what that tells me is there is a receptive
audience for structural reform.  It’s not fair that people currently paying into the
system expect no benefits.  HUNT: So you would go further than Paul Ryan on
Medicare?  JOHNSON: Listen, Paul Ryan, what I support about Paul
is he’s acknowledging the fact that Medicare is the biggest
problem -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: But to get to a balanced budget-  JOHNSON: - got to start to-  HUNT: - to get to that balanced budget, you would go
further on Medicare cuts, right?  JOHNSON: We have to restructure the program.  HUNT: OK, but that’s cuts. We - I mean, restructuring
sounds great, but that’s cuts. It may be desirable, but
it’s cuts.  JOHNSON: It’s not necessarily to individuals. OK?  HUNT: Could be to doctors, could be to hospitals.  JOHNSON: You-  HUNT: you’ve accused  Barack Obama  of demagoguing.  Yet members of your party still peddle this notion
that ObamaCare sanctions death panels (ph).  And you wrote a column a few months ago that said, “-
the single greatest assault on freedom in my lifetime-” -
more than communism or terrorism - was the Obama health
care plan.  Isn’t that the kind of demagoguery you accuse Obama-  JOHNSON: Because that’s exactly what we’re talking
about. When government is going to decide what kind of care
you can have, where you can get your care - and that is
what we’re-  HUNT: You think that’s a bigger threat than communism?  JOHNSON: That’s exactly what this thing is-  HUNT: You do?  JOHNSON: I wasn’t threatened under communism. I’m
saying, in my lifetime-  HUNT: You weren’t threatened under terrorism?  JOHNSON: Listen, I’m talking about things that are
imposed on me by this - by our government in America. It is
the greatest single threat to my freedom, our freedom.  HUNT: Senator Johnson, we appreciate very much you
being with us today. Thank you. We look forward to further
discussion.  And when we come, more talks Sunday. Are the budget
negotiations about to cut a deal?  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
