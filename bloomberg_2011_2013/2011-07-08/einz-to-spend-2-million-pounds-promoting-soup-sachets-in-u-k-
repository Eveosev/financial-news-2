H.J. Heinz Co., the world’s biggest
ketchup maker, plans to spend 2 million pounds ($3.2 million) to
help promote its new “Squeeze & Stir” soups in the U.K.  Heinz will start selling the soup sachets, which contain a
puree for dilution with hot water, as an alternative to powdered
cup soups, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  The product will be on sale from the end of July, with a
recommended retail price of 59 pence a packet, the company said.
Pittsburgh-based Heinz will promote the product in supermarkets
and with television and Internet-based advertising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
