Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest airline by market value, advanced the
most in a week in  Sao Paulo  trading on speculation it will buy
closely-held rival Webjet Linhas Aereas SA.  Gol gained 3.5 percent to 19.77 reais at the 4:15 p.m. New
York time close, the most on a closing basis since July 1. The
stock earlier jumped as much as 6.4 percent.  The company, based in Sao Paulo, said in a filing that it’s
in talks with Webjet, without elaborating further. Gol will
announce the acquisition of the smaller airline today, O Estado
de S. Paulo newspaper reported earlier, without saying where it
obtained the information.  Officials at outside press agencies representing Webjet and
Gol, who asked not to be identified due to internal policy,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  The deal would help Gol compete with rival  Tam SA (TAMM4) , which is
being bought by Chile’s  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , said Fernando Goes, an
analyst at brokerage Octo Investimentos SA in Rio de Janeiro.  “The market is seeing that it will gain market share and
reduce competition,” Goes said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
