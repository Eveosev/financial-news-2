Brent futures in  London  are poised to
breach a record premium to U.S. crude as prices in New York
tumbled after the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast and NATO
bombed Libyan oil installations in Brega this week.  The spread between the oil futures contracts traded on
London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange and the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  reached a record $22.29 a barrel on June 15, based on
settlement prices. The price difference reached $22.23 a barrel
on an intraday basis today.  U.S. employers added the fewest workers in nine months and
the  unemployment rate  rose to 9.2 percent, the highest level
this year, the Labor Department reported in Washington. NATO
struck military refueling equipment at Brega beginning July 6 to
deny troops loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  access to the
facilities. Brent futures and options also expire next week.  “The spread is blowing out again,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc. energy advisory company in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “U.S. markets are reacting to the jobs
and there’s some position squaring going into the expiration and
the geopolitics.”  Brent was $22.02 a barrel more expensive than New York
futures on West Texas Intermediate oil at 12:27 p.m., based on
prices on ICE and the Nymex, $2.11 a barrel more than yesterday.  $40 a Barrel  The Brent-WTI spread may widen to $40 a barrel or more
between now and the middle of 2012,  Edward Morse , head of
commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. said in a
report on July 6.  An increase of 260,000 barrels a day in oil production from
western  Canada  and the U.S. mid-continent from 2008 to 2010 has
led to near-record oil supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the
delivery point for New York-traded WTI futures, according to the
report.  Crude for August delivery $2.42, or 2.5 percent, to $96.25
a barrel at 12:27 p.m. on the Nymex.  Brent oil for August settlement declined 32 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $118.27 a barrel on the ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
