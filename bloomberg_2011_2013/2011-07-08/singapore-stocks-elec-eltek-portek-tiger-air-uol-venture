Singapore ’s  Straits Times Index (FSSTI) 
gained 0.8 percent to 3,151.28 as of the close. More than four
stocks advanced for each that fell in the gauge of 30 companies.
The measure is headed for a 0.4 percent increase this week, its
third weekly advance.  Shares on the measure trade at an average 14.5 times
estimated earnings, compared with about 15.6 times at the end of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following shares were among the most active in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the company name.  Elec & Eltek International Co. (ELEC SP), a maker of
printed circuit boards, rose 2.1 percent to $3.85 as its shares
started trading on the  Hong Kong  exchange today, giving the
primary listings in Singapore and Hong Kong.  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. (OCBC SP), Singapore’s
second-biggest lender by market value, added 0.2 percent to
S$9.46. The company said its Australian unit sold A$500 million
($538 million) of senior unsecured notes due in July 2014. The
floating-rate notes were priced to yield 83 basis points more
than the three-month bank bill swap reference rate, it said.  Portek International Ltd. (PORT)  , a Singapore-based port
operator and supplier of container cranes, climbed 5.7 percent
to S$1.305, heading for its highest close since it started
trading in March 2002. DMG & Partners Securities Pte initiated
coverage on the stock with a “buy” rating. A takeover offer by
Philippine rival International Container Terminal Services Inc.
for S$1.20 a share last month “undervalues” the stock, the
brokerage said. DMG estimates fair value for Portek at S$1.56.  UOL Group Ltd. (UOL)  , Singapore’s fifth-largest hotel
operator by sales, gained 0.2 percent to S$4.93. India Infoline
Ltd. initiated coverage of the stock, with an “add” rating and
share-price forecast of S$5.78, saying its hotels are benefiting
from increasing tourism in  Asia .  Venture Corp. (VMS SP), Singapore’s biggest publicly traded
electronics manufacturing services provider, slid 2 percent to
S$8.40. DBS Group Holdings Ltd. lowered its rating on the stock
to “hold” from “buy,” saying second-quarter earnings will be
weak. The brokerage cut its share-price forecast to S$8.10 from
S$11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
