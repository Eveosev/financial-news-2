Oil traded near the highest in more
than three weeks in  New York  before a U.S. report that may show
payrolls increased.  Futures fluctuated, falling as much as 0.3 percent amid
signs of ample crude supplies in the U.S., and gaining 0.3
percent today after data showed U.S. companies added twice as
many workers as forecast in June. Crude supplies fell 0.3
percent to 358.6 million barrels last week, above the five-year
average of 345 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s a temporary indication that growth is likely to be a
bit healthier in the second half and that’s good for oil demand,
especially given that we’ve got relatively abundant crude stocks
in the U.S. still,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy
economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne , who
predicts oil will average $113 a barrel in the third quarter.  Crude for August delivery was at $98.72 a barrel, up 5
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:14 p.m. Singapore time. It gained as much as 30 cents to
$98.97 and fell as low as $98.34. The contract yesterday climbed
$2.02 to $98.67, the highest since June 14. Prices are 4 percent
higher this week and up 31 percent the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement fell 3 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $118.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Record Spread  Oil’s advance in New York may stall before prices reach
$100 a barrel because of technical resistance at the 50-day
moving average, according Bloomberg data. This level is at
$99.19 today. Futures have been trading below the indicator for
more than two months.  Brent’s premium to New York crude futures is headed for a
second weekly gain after widening the most in almost four months
yesterday as Libyan output cuts and North Sea maintenance drive
the European benchmark grade higher.  Futures in  London  were $19.92 a barrel higher than West
Texas Intermediate in New York yesterday, after widening $2.95,
the most since March 9. The gap between front-month futures of
both grades surged to a record $22.29 on June 15.  “The ECB’s decision to raise  interest rates  led to a
bigger rise in Brent than in WTI,” said  Gordon Kwan , head of
regional energy research at Mirae Asset Securities Ltd. in  Hong
Kong . Mirae forecasts Brent’s premium to WTI to widen to $40 a
barrel in the next 12 months.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude supplies fell 889,000 barrels to 358.6 million
last week, the lowest level since April, an Energy Department
report showed. A 2.5 million-barrel decline was projected,
according to the median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Stockpiles of crude at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate oil, the grade traded in New
York, slipped 460,000 barrels to 37 million barrels last week,
the Energy Department report showed.  A 2.5 million-barrel decline in total U.S. crude supplies
was projected for last week, according to the median estimate of
15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The U.S. is the world’s
biggest consumer of the commodity.  The U.S. added 105,000 jobs in June, almost double the
54,000 created a month earlier, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey before a Labor Department report
today. Private hiring climbed 125,000 last month, while the
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent, the survey showed.  Calvin  Calvin became the third tropical storm of this year’s
eastern Pacific hurricane season, and is expected to strengthen
in the next couple of days, according to the  U.S. National
Hurricane Center.   The storm was located about 205 miles (330 kilometers)
south of Manzanillo,  Mexico , and was moving west-northwest at 14
miles per hour, according to an advisory released at 8 p.m.
Pacific Daylight Time. Top winds are 40 mph, and are forecast to
strengthen over the next two days. Calvin is expected to weaken
into a low-pressure system in six days, the NHC said. There were
no coastal watches or warnings in effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
