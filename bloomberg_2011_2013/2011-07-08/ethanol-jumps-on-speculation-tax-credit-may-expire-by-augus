Ethanol futures jumped in  Chicago  on
speculation refiners will boost buying to take advantage of a
tax credit that may expire at the end of the month.  The grain-based gasoline additive rose 1.8 percent a day
after three members of the  U.S. Senate  agreed on a proposal to
end the 45-cent credit permitted to refiners for each gallon of
the biofuel mixed with gasoline and abolish the 54-cent tariff
on Brazilian imports by July 31. The senators hope to include
the plan in a deficit-reduction package.  “Everybody’s scrambling to get this stuff to blend so they
can get the tax credit,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “It’s people stockpiling it
ahead of whatever happens with the tax credit.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 8.6 cents, or
3.3 percent, to settle at $2.707 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have gained 69 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  soared 5 cents
to $2.86 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive increased
2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.84, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago gained 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.76
a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel slumped 3.5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.765.  To contact the reporter on this story:
