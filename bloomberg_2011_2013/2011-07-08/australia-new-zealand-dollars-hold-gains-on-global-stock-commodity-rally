The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars headed for a second weekly advance against the yen as a
global rally in stocks and commodities supported demand for
higher-yielding assets.  Australia’s currency rose to its strongest level in two
months against the yen after oil extended gains for a second
day amid speculation U.S. employment gains will strengthen. New
Zealand’s dollar climbed for a second week versus the greenback
to trade 0.2 percent from its record high.  “There are signs that the so-called soft patch is
fading,” said Callum Henderson, global head of currency
research at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “It will be a
clear positive for higher-yielding currencies such as the
Aussie and the kiwi.”  Australia ’s dollar fetched 87.66 yen at 4:37 p.m. in
Sydney, from 87.55 yen in  New York  yesterday. It earlier
touched 87.69 yen, its highest level since May 11 and traded at
$1.0780 from $1.0776, after it reached $1.0790 on July 1, the
most since May 11. New Zealand’s dollar was at 83.33 U.S. cents
from 83.34 cents yesterday, when it touched 83.44 cents, the
highest since the currency was freely floated in 1985. It
bought 67.75 yen from 67.72 yen.  The so-called Aussie advanced 0.7 percent against the yen
this week, while the New Zealand dollar strengthened 1.3
percent versus  Japan ’s currency.  ‘Unduly Influenced’  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.6 percent and the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.7 percent, following a 1.1
percent jump in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in New York.
The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
climbed 1.8 percent yesterday, its biggest advance since May 18.  Figures from ADP Employer Services showed companies in the
U.S. added 157,000 workers to their payrolls in June. The
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for an advance of 70,000. The government reports June payrolls
data today.  The Aussie failed to extend gains as the swaps market
signaled the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will refrain from
raising  interest rates  in the next year.  The RBA is “being unduly influenced by the ebb and flow
of sentiment,”  Adam Carr , a Sydney-based senior economist at
ICAP Australia Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. They
“are formulating their economic views by reading the
newspapers, rather than by looking at hard data.”  RBA Rate Bets  Swaps traders are pricing in a 3-basis-points cut to the
RBA’s key rate in the next 12 months, a Credit Suisse AG index
showed today. As recently as June 15, the gauge signaled 14
basis points of tightening.  The RBA held borrowing costs at 4.75 percent on July 5,
where the rate has been since November. The number of people
employed in Australia rose by 23,400 in June, led by a jump in
full-time jobs, the statistics bureau said yesterday.  Current-account deficits are acceptable so long as
government policies aren’t distorting capital flows,  Guy Debelle , the RBA’s assistant governor for financial markets,
said today in Adelaide. He didn’t mention the current state of
the Australian economy or monetary policy in the text of his
prepared speech.  Australia’s current-account gap widened for a third
straight quarter in the first three months of this year,
reaching A$10.45 billion ($11 billion) after a A$8.09 billion
shortfall in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Bureau of
Statistics said May 31.  Ten-year Australian bond futures for June delivery were
little changed today at 94.75 on the  Sydney Futures Exchange .
Australia’s benchmark 10-year bond yield climbed to 5.24
percent from 5.20 percent yesterday.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, gained 1 basis point to 3.4 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
