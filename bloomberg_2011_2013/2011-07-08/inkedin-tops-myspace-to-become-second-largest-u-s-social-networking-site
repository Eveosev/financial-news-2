LinkedIn  Corp., a website focused on
job seekers and recruiters, surpassed Myspace to become the No.
2 social-networking service in the U.S. last month, boosted by
its initial public offering in May.  The company had 33.9 million visitors in June, up 63
percent from a year earlier, while Myspace had 33.5 million,
down 50 percent, according to a Reston, Virginia-based  ComScore
Inc. (SCOR)  report. Facebook Inc. remained the largest social-
networking site with 160.9 million U.S. visitors, up 14 percent.  LinkedInâ€™s IPO raised its profile with investors and helped
build publicity around the  Mountain View , California-based
company. It has posted two straight months of gains, according
to ComScore. To keep expanding its user base, LinkedIn is adding
features such as a personalized news feed and a visual map that
explores how users are connected.  Shares of LinkedIn rose $5.62, or 6 percent, to $99.60
today on the New York Stock Exchange, setting a new high. The
May 18 IPO priced the shares at $45.  Twitter was No. 4 in the U.S., with 30.6 million users.
That was up 14 percent from the previous month and a 31 percent
increase from a year earlier, ComScore said.  Once the biggest social network, Myspace has lost ground to
Facebook in recent years. Last month,  News Corp . agreed to sell
the business to Specific Media Inc. for $35 million, a fraction
of the $580 million News Corp. paid six years ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
