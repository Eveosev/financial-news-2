The rand pared its second weekly gain
against the dollar as slower-than-forecast U.S. job growth
damped demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest economy weakened as much
as 0.7 percent to 6.7248 against the dollar and traded 0.6
percent down at 6.7211 as of 5:09 p.m. in Johannesburg, paring
its second weekly increase to 0.2 percent. The rand rose for a
seventh day against the euro, adding 0.2 percent to 9.5580.  U.S. payrolls increased by 18,000 in June, about one-sixth
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, the
slowest pace in nine months, and the jobless rate rose to a 2011
high of 9.2 percent, dimming the outlook for global growth.  “This nonfarm payroll number, which was shockingly bad
relative to consensus expectations, is clearly a selling signal
for risky assets,”  Benoit Anne , the London-based head of
emerging-markets strategy at Societe Generale SA, wrote in an e-
mailed note today. Emerging-market currencies such as the rand,
“should overall sell off in the near term.”  The government’s 13.5 percent notes due 2015 rose 4 cents
to 121.502 rand, reducing the yield by one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 7.4 percent. The 6.75 percent securities
due 2021 climbed, driving the yield down one basis point to
8.283 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
