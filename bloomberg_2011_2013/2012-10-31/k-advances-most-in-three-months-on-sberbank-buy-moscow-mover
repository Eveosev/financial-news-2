OAO TMK (TMKS) ,  Russia ’s largest producer
of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, jumped the most in
three months after Sberbank CIS recommended buying the company’s
depositary receipts.  TMK surged as much as 5.4 percent, the most since July 27,
and traded up 5.2 percent to $14.56 by 2:09 p.m. in  London ,
paring its monthly loss to 4.3 percent. Sberbank set the target
price at $19.43, according to a note emailed today.  Prices for hot rolled coil, a benchmark steel product for
the industry, slumped 5.6 percent in October after falling 3.1
percent in September, according to Metal Bulletin data on
Bloomberg. TMK, which benefits from lower steel prices, has a
“dominant” 60 percent to 65 percent share of Russia’s seamless
pipe market and “established a long term relationship” with
oil and gas customers, Sberbank CIS said.  “The company has been gradually expanding its product
offering into high value-added products, which should assist top
line growth,” analysts including  Mikhail Stiskin  in Moscow said
in the note. “Softening prices for ferrous inputs is another
positive factor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
