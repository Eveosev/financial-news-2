Nathan Tinkler , the biggest
shareholder of  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC) , will vote against the
election of five board members at a general meeting tomorrow
because of the poor performance of the Australian miner.  “The company needs a better board and better management,”
Tinkler said today in a telephone interview. “These are world-
class assets. There’s nothing wrong with the assets. This
management team has an extremely poor record of delivering
profitability from assets.”  Tinkler, who scrapped a A$5.3 billion ($5.5 billion)
takeover proposal for the Sydney-based company in August, said
he would seek to remove the directors to install a better team
to boost Whitehaven’s performance. He gained his 19.4 percent
stake in the company after Whitehaven agreed to  buy  Aston
Resources Ltd. in December for about A$2.7 billion.  The electrician-turned-mining-investor is not planning to
sell his 19.4 percent stake in the company, valued at A$628
million, he said in the interview. Tinkler last week wrote to
Whitehaven Chairman Mark Vaile, seeking financial and
operational information.  Whitehaven rose 1.7 percent to A$3.05 at the close in
Sydney. The stock has declined 42 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
