The Czech Finance Ministry cut its
forecasts for economic output this year and next, while keeping
its budget-deficit targets even amid a recession.  The Prague-based ministry forecasts gross domestic product
to fall 1 percent this year, compared with a previous forecast
for a 0.5 percent contraction, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. The ministry cut next yearâ€™s GDP growth prediction to 0.7
percent, from a previously expected 1 percent expansion.  The public-finance deficit will be 3.2 percent of GDP this
year, compared with a revised 3.3 percent percent shortfall in
2011, the ministry said. It kept the forecast for the 2013
deficit at 2.9 percent, which matches the current government
target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
