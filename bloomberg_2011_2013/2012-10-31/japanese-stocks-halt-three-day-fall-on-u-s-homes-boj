Japanese  shares  gained, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average snapping a three-day decline, as U.S.
home prices rose the most in two years and the  Bank of Japan  and
the country’s government signaled their resolve to tackle the
stronger yen and deflation.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 27 percent of its
sales in the Americas, gained 1.5 percent.  Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. (7270)  jumped 6.7 percent after the maker of Subaru cars raised
its profit forecast. Ricoh Co. had the biggest drop in the
Nikkei 225, falling 3.1 percent, after the office-equipment
maker missed its first-half profit forecast. Panasonic Corp.
rose 4.5 percent before forecasting after markets closed that it
expects a 765 billion yen ($9.6 billion) loss instead of the 50
billion yen profit estimated in May.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1 percent to 8,928.29 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, gaining 0.7 percent for the month. Volume on the
gauge today was 8 percent above the 30-day average. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index climbed 1.2 percent to 742.33, with almost three
shares advancing for each that fell. Stocks slid yesterday in
the last 15 minutes of trading after the Bank of Japan announced
its first back-to-back monthly stimulus expansion since 2003.  “The U.S. housing market is clearly recovering,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “The joint statement from the government and
the BOJ on stimulus measures helps convince investors that they
are determined to overcome deflation and raises expectations
they will continue to take aggressive steps to ease policy.”  The Topix has risen 3.2 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started the latest wave of economic
stimulus to boost growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the
Bank of Japan following suit. Shares on the Japanese gauge
traded at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600
Index.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent in New York.
Equity markets in the U.S. are scheduled to reopen today after
 Hurricane Sandy  caused the longest weather-related shutdown in
more than a century.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 U.S.
cities rose 2 percent from August 2011, the biggest year-to-year
gain since July 2010, the group said yesterday in New York. The
median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg survey projected
a 1.9 percent gain.  Canon rose 1.5 percent to 2,578 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which
gets more than 40 percent of its sales in  North America , climbed
2.4 percent to 2,390 yen.  BOJ Stimulus  Japan’s central bank yesterday said it will offer unlimited
loans at low  interest rates  to lenders. The move came alongside
an 11 trillion yen ($138 billion) expansion of the central
bank’s asset-purchase program.  Economy Minister  Seiji Maehara  and Japanese Finance
Minister Koriki Jojima, in a joint statement with Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa, said the government “strongly expects”
powerful monetary easing until deflation is overcome. The joint
statement was the first of its kind, Maehara said.  “The government and BOJ are in accord on the main points
about how to support the economy,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
Tokyo-based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co.
which oversees about $70 billion. “They’ve convinced investors
their stance is aggressive toward stimulus measures, which is
positive.”  Japan’s current earnings season peaks this week, with more
than 570 of the 1,676 Topix companies reporting results. Of the
221 companies on the Topix that have reported quarterly revenue
since Oct. 1, and for which  Bloomberg News  has estimates, 64
percent have missed projections.  Subaru Sales  “Japanese company earnings won’t badly deteriorate as long
as we see some mild recovery in overseas economies,” Mitsubishi
UFJ Asset Management’s Ishigane said. “It’s getting clearer
that the U.S. housing market has bottomed, and that’s boosting
markets.”  Fuji Heavy gained the most in the Nikkei 225, rising 6.7
percent to 767 yen after raising its full-year net income
forecast 40 percent to 67 billion yen on better-than-expected
U.S. sales.  Ricoh sank 3.1 percent to 667 yen, a seventh straight
decline, after posting net income of 11.7 billion yen in the six
months ended Sept. 30, missing its forecast by 13 percent.  Panasonic climbed 4.5 percent to 514 yen. Japan’s second-
biggest television maker, projected a full year loss amid
falling demand for its Viera TVs and additional restructuring
costs. The forecast 765 billion-yen loss compares with the 24.7
billion-yen loss average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  sank 4.9 percent
to 19.01, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.4 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
