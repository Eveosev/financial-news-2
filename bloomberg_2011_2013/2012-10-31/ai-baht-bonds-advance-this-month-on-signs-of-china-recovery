Thailand’s baht and government  bonds 
had monthly gains as signs of a pickup in  China’s economy  helped
to increase demand for regional assets.  Global funds bought $1.9 billion more local sovereign debt
than they sold this month, according to data from the Thai Bond
Market Association. Reports this month showed exports and
investment gathered pace in  China , the biggest buyer of goods
shipped from Thailand. The Southeast Asian nation’s overseas
sales will recover in the second half of 2013 as the global
economy improves, central bank director Mathee Supapongse said
today. Ten-year sovereign bonds yield 3.31 percent in Thailand,
compared with 1.75 percent in the U.S.  “Funds are flowing into  Asia  as its economy is more solid
than other regions and still offers higher yields than developed
nations,” said   Tsutomu Soma , manager of the investment trust
and fixed-income business unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in
 Tokyo . “Fund inflows are supporting regional currencies.”  The baht strengthened 0.4 percent this month and 0.1
percent today to 30.68 per dollar as of 3:22 p.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency had  a
fifth monthly advance, the longest winning streak since October
2010.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, held steady today and this month
at 4.27 percent.  Exports declined 0.1 percent in September after a drop of
5.1 percent in August, a central bank report showed today.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 dropped
25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 3.06 percent from
the end of September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the largest monthly drop in a year. The rate slid two
basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
