Western Union Co. (WU) , the world’s
biggest money-transfer business, plunged the most since its 2006
spinoff from First Data Corp. after cutting its full-year profit
forecast for 2013.  Western Union dropped 29 percent to $12.73 today in New
York and has declined 30 percent this year, compared with a 12
percent  gain  for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Operating income could fall 10 percent to 15 percent next
year from 2012 levels as a result of initiatives geared toward
adding customers, investing in digital technology and cutting
costs, the Englewood, Colorado-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Third-quarter net income, excluding integration
expenses, was 46 cents per share, 1 cent higher than the  average
estimate  of 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Our sharply lower 2013 and 2014 revenue and earnings-per-
share estimates reflect management’s decision to reduce price in
key corridors in an effort to regain share,” Andrew Jeffrey, an
analyst at  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , said today in a note as he
downgraded Western Union to neutral from buy. “Some competitive
pressure is coming from new entrants, while much is likely from
traditional participants.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
