Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA ,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, said third-quarter
profit dropped 11 percent on falling metals prices, beating
analysts’ estimates as production was higher than expected.  Net income fell to $185.6 million, or 73 cents a share,
from $208.7 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, Lima-based
Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. Analysts
expected profit of 70 cents a share excluding one-time items,
according to the  average  of three estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s Yanacocha gold mine, in which
Buenaventura holds a 44 percent stake, and the company’s Soc.
Minera El Brocal SAA unit contributed less to Buenaventura’s
earnings on lower copper, silver and zinc prices, said Inteligo
SAB analyst Lali Merino, who doesn’t own Buenaventura shares and
rates the stock a hold.  “Earnings were down at both El Brocal and Yanacocha,”
Merino said in a telephone interview from  Lima  before the report
was released. “Prices of gold and silver have been the main
factor all year.”  New York-traded copper and silver futures tumbled 12
percent and 24 percent, respectively, while gold fell 1 percent
in the period.  Income from Buenaventura’s Yanacocha stake fell 18 percent
to $65.1 million.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s  Cerro
Verde (CVERDEC1)  copper mine, in which Buenaventura holds a 18 percent
stake, contributed $43.7 million, up 38 percent from a year
earlier.  Production Gains  Revenue declined 5 percent to $411.9 million. Gold
production rose 4 percent to 267,144 ounces, while zinc and lead
climbed 31 percent and 39 percent, respectively, Buenaventura
said. Silver output rose 12 percent to 4.68 million ounces.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 3.4 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $1,712.10 an ounce today on the Comex in New York.
Silver rose 0.2 percent to $31.816.  The report was released after the close of regular trading
today. Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, didn’t trade today as  Hurricane
Sandy  forced equity markets to close. Its Lima-listed share
didn’t trade.  (Buenaventura is scheduled to have its quarterly conference
