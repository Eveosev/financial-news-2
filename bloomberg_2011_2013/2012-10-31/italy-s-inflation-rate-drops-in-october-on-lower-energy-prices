Italy’s  inflation rate  dropped in
October to the lowest in more than one year as energy prices
declined on a monthly basis.  The inflation rate based on European Union measurements
dropped to 2.8 percent, the lowest since August 2011, from 3.4
percent in September, Rome-based national statistics office
Istat said in a preliminary report today. The inflation rate
jumped in September from 3.3 percent in August after the end of
post-summer retail discounts.  Economists had predicted a drop to 3.1 percent for October,
according to the median forecast of 10 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. In the month, consumer prices rose 0.3 percent,
Istat said.  Based on Italian methodology, prices were unchanged from
September and gained 2.6 percent from a year earlier, Istat said
today. Gasoline prices dropped 2.5 percent from the previous
month and rose 16.2 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
