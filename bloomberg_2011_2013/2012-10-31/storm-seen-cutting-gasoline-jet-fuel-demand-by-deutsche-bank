Superstorm Sandy will reduce demand
for gasoline and jet fuel as the U.S. East Coast lacks
electricity, while it largely spared the region’s energy
infrastructure, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  “With much of the East Coast energy infrastructure
generally unscathed by  Hurricane Sandy , focus has now shifted to
concerns about the dampening impact the storm may have on
demand,” analysts led by Xiao Fu in London said in an e-mailed
report today. “With so much of the densely populated eastern
region affected by the storm and still lacking power, demand is
expected to slip in the immediate aftermath.”  Demand for gasoline and jet fuel was most affected by past
storms that struck the East Coast, Deutsche Bank said, citing
 Hurricane Irene  in August 2011 and Hurricane Gloria in September
1985. Gasoline consumption declined two to three times more than
average, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
