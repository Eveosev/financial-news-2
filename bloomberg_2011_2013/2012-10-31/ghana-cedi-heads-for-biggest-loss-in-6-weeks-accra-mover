Ghana ’s cedi headed for the biggest
loss in almost six weeks as companies bought dollars to import
goods for year-end sales.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.5 percent to 1.8904 a dollar as of 2:18 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
close at this level would be the largest decline since Sept. 20.  The retreat was “largely due to local corporate demand for
dollars,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the Ghanaian unit
of Barclays Plc, said by phone today. “There is a bit of a
surge in imports as companies have begun to pile stock for the
upcoming festive sales.”  The cedi appreciated for a third month in October gaining
0.3 percent after a 1.9 percent increase in September and a rise
of 1.1 percent in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
