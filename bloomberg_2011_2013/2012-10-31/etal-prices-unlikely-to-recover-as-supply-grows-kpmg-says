Metals and mineral prices are
unlikely to recover in the next five years as new projects will
add supply at a time of tepid demand, according to KPMG LLP’s
global head of mining.  A decline in the growth rates of Asian economies as new
projects begin production means the metals market is imbalanced,
 Wayne Jansen  said. As a result, companies are deferring
investments, he said.  “You are not going to see a massive change in commodities
prices overnight,” Jansen said in an interview in Rio de
Janeiro yesterday. “We will have fairly flat prices for the
next five years.”  Prices of  iron ore , the key raw material to produce steel,
tumbled to a three-year low on Sept. 5 as  China , the biggest
consumer, heads toward its slowest economic growth since 1999,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Nickel dropped about 26 percent since reaching its
highest this year on Feb. 7.  “There has been a lot of capacity that has been
effectively built up through projects that are now starting to
come on stream,” Jansen said. “This is a long-term game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
