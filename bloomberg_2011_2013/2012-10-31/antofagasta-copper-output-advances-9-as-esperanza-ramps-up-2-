Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper miner
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, said third-quarter output
rose 9 percent as volumes from its Esperanza mine increased.  Production climbed to 179,800 metric tons from 165,000 tons
a year earlier, Antofagasta said today in a statement. Volumes
of molybdenum, used to harden steel, advanced to 3,000 tons from
2,400 tons.  Antofagasta is seeking to increase annual copper output to
about 700,000 tons this year from 640,500 tons amid rising
demand for the metal used in cables and pipes. Esperanza is now
adding volumes after delays at the Chilean project prompted the
company to cut its production forecast for that year. It also
had to repair a feed conveyor at the site in the first quarter.  The company raised copper output from Esperanza to 45,600
tons in the quarter, up 21 percent from the previous three
months. Antofagasta achieved an average ore throughput of 85,100
tons a day at Esperanza, up 6.8 percent from the second quarter,
according to the statement.  “The increase in average throughput reflects ongoing
improvements in the reliability of the operation following
further optimization of the plant,” Jason Fairclough, an
analyst at Bank of America Corp., wrote in a note today.  Costs Drop  The company’s production in 2013 “will be similar” to
this year as output stabilizes at Esperanza, Chief Executive
Officer Diego Hernandez told reporters in Santiago today.
Production will expand in 2015 as the company starts its
Antucoya project and a decision will be taken next year to
expand the company’s flagship Los Pelambres mine, he said.  Hernandez predicts copper prices in 2013 will remain at
similar levels to this year as the balance between supply and
demand remains “tight”. Miners may expand output in the second
half of next year, he said.  Cash costs, taking into account earnings from by-products
such as molybdenum and gold, declined to 99 cents a pound in the
first nine months of the year from 103.7 cents a year earlier,
Antofagasta said. That’s 10 percent lower than Bank of America’s
estimate, Fairclough said, citing better by-product volumes.  Copper production in the nine months rose to 515,800 tons
from 453,500 tons, while gold output increased by 71 percent to
213,500 ounces in the period, reflecting the contribution from
Esperanza.  Antofagasta shares fell 0.7 percent to 1,257 pence at the
close in London, valuing the company controlled by Chilean
billionaire Jean-Paul Luksic at 12.39 billion pounds ($20
billion).  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange declined 14 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier to average $7,720 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
