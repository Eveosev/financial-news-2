The National Bank of  Serbia  asked
lawmakers to amend the central bank law again to adjust rules to
European Union standards and strengthen the monetary
institution’s independence.  Lawmakers will probably debate and vote on the amendments
when they meet on Nov. 1, according to the draft submitted to
Parliament in Belgrade. Key changes relate to the length of the
terms for vice governors and members of the Governor’s Council.  The Narodna Banka Srbije said amendments adopted on Aug. 4
“left some confusion” and prompted concern the law still
doesn’t comply with EU laws and needs to be changed as part of
Serbia’s EU accession process.  Serbia passed a law on Aug. 4 that gave Parliament control
over the central bank, prompting the governor, one vice governor
and four members of the Governor’s Council to quit. Parliament
appointed Jorgovanka Tabakovic to be the new central bank
governor on Aug. 6. The law was criticized by the  International
Monetary Fund , the  World Bank  and the EU.  The IMF said in September any new loan deal with Serbia
will depend on fiscal consolidation measures and how the
government handles the central bank’s autonomy in practice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
