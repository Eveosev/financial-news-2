The naira declined, paring its
fourth monthly gain, as importers demanded dollars after the
central bank sold the lowest amount of the U.S. currency in five
weeks.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer slipped less
than 0.1 percent to 157.06 a dollar as of 4:48 p.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital. That trimmed its monthly advance to 0.1
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $50 million at an auction
today, bringing its sales this week to $93.5 million, the least
in five weeks, according to data on the Abuja-based bank’s
website.  “Dollar demand, which was low at the last central bank
auction is seen rising today as supply is drying and the oil
industry sold only about $50 million yesterday,” Tunde Ladipo,
chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment
Ltd., said by phone from Lagos. “Today’s central bank supply is
not enough to meet demand.”  The yield on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 declined four basis points to 4.535 percent. The
yield on the 16.39 percent naira debt due 2022 fell one basis
point to 13.32 percent, according to yesterday’s prices on the
website of the Lagos-based Financial Markets Dealers
Association.  Ghana ’s cedi slipped for a second day, weakening 0.5
percent to 1.8904 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
