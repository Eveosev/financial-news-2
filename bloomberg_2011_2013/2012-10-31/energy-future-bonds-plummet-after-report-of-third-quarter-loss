The bonds of Energy Future Holdings
Corp., the Texas power company that was taken private in 2007 in
the largest buyout in history, plunged after it announced a $407
million third-quarter loss.  The energy provider’s $744.3 million of 6.55 percent bonds
due November 2034 fell 9.8 cents on the dollar to 38.3 cents at
2:30 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Sales at the closely held company fell 25 percent to $1.75
billion on low power prices and weaker demand due to milder
summer weather, the Dallas-based company said in an Oct. 29
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Chief
Executive Officer John Young said in a conference call yesterday
that continued low natural gas prices would “pose a significant
challenge” to cash flow as hedges expire.  “The company’s capital structure is unsustainable and will
likely see defaults within the next two years,” Peter Thornton,
an analyst at high-yield researcher KDP Investment Advisors
Inc., wrote in a note today. “We expect the company to continue
to tap the high-yield market again in 2013, using the remaining
value of its equity holdings in Oncor as collateral.”  Energy Future’s $2.18 billion of 10 percent, first-lien
notes due December 2020 dropped 2.5 cents to 109.5 to yield 8.36
percent, Trace data show. The notes are secured by equity
interest in Oncor Electric Delivery Co., Energy Future’s power-
transmission unit, which has been profitable for 11 of the past
12 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Expiring Hedges  Hedges that are supporting profit by locking in natural gas
prices expire by 2015, according to a July 31 regulatory filing.
The hedges lock in natural gas at a weighted average price of
$7.32 for 2012, compared with an average monthly forward natural
gas price of about $2.96, according to an Oct. 30 earnings
 presentation . Electricity prices are linked to those for natural
gas.  The company’s Texas Competitive Electric Holdings unit has
99 percent of its estimated natural gas price exposure hedged
for 2012, according to the presentation. That hedge decreases to
87 percent in 2013 and 39 percent in 2014.  Energy Future, which was taken private by KKR & Co., TPG
Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in 2007, has reported
seven straight quarterly  losses , Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
