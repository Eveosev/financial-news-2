Serbia  plans to sell $2 billion
worth of Eurobonds in 2013, securing a third of what it needs to
finance the  budget  deficit and service debts next year,
according to the draft budget.  Next year’s budget sees revenue at 956.4 billion dinars
($10.92 billion) and spending at 1.07 trillion dinars, the draft
budget posted on Parliament’s website shows. Total borrowing
needs were set at 554.4 billion dinars, including 188.4 billion
dinars in Eurobond sales, 265 billion dinars in domestic market
borrowing and 101.04 billion dinars in credits from
international financial institutions.  Serbia needs cash to close a 121.8 billion-dinar  budget
deficit  next year, which will account for 3.6 percent of gross
domestic product. This year’s deficit will be equivalent to 6.7
percent of GDP this year.  According to the 2013 repayment schedule, Serbia needs 92.5
billion dinars to pay back interest and principal to foreign
lenders.  The government also plans to issue sovereign guarantees
next year equivalent to $6.3 billion for new sovereign borrowing
and project financing, the draft shows.  Serbia needs to convince the  International Monetary Fund 
that its 2013 budget plan is consistent with a commitment to
consolidate public finances in the medium term and balance the
budget by 2016.  An IMF mission is due to arrive in Belgrade on Nov. 13 to
start talks on a new loan deal and return in January or February
after evaluating structural reforms and measures designed to
stabilize public finances.  The Washington-based lender suspended a $1.3 billion loan
with Serbia in February after the government slipped on agreed
debt and deficit targets ahead of May 6 general elections. An
IMF loan deal would help Serbia lower the cost of borrowing.  The government last tapped international lenders in
September with a $1 billion Eurobond at a cost of 6.625 percent.
The  Finance Ministry  plans another Eurobond this month, worth
$500 million, and hopes for a yield of below 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
