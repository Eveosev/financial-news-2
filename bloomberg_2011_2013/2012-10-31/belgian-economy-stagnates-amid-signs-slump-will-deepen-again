The Belgian economy stagnated in the
third quarter, narrowly escaping a second recession in 3 1/2
years amid signs an austerity-driven slump is spreading to
 Europe ’s core nations.  Gross domestic product in  Belgium  in the three months
through September was  unchanged  from the previous quarter, the
National Bank of Belgium said today in a statement. That
followed a 0.5 percent contraction in the second quarter. The
euro area’s sixth-largest economy shrank  0.3 percent  in the
third quarter from the year-earlier period.  Belgian consumers have cut back spending this year, a
report showed on Sept. 7, amid mounting concerns over
joblessness and the prospect of 3.7 billion euros ($4.8 billion)
in tax increases or spending cuts needed for the government to
reach deficit targets next year.  The slump may be deepening as business confidence fell to a
 three-year low  this month and consumer sentiment dropped to the
lowest since February before Ford Motor Co. said on Oct. 24 it
plans to shut its Belgian assembly plant in 2014, eliminating
4,300 jobs in the country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
