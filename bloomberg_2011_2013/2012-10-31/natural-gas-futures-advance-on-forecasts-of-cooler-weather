Natural gas headed for a second
monthly gain in New York as Sandy drew wintry weather into the
Midwest and East Coast, boosting demand for heating fuels.  Gas rose as much as 2.4 percent. U.S. states around the
 Great Lakes  and into the mid-Atlantic may see below-normal
temperatures over the next five days, according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . The Atlantic superstorm
left more than 8.2 million customers without power from  Maine  to
 North Carolina , the Energy Department said yesterday.  “The storm is creating an interesting dynamic where it
sucked cold air down from  Canada  and brought it to places a
little early this year,” said Tom Saal, senior vice president
of energy trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in Miami. “You’ve
got some cold air in gas-consuming areas and at the same time
you have power outages in New York and the coastal areas.”  Natural gas for December delivery increased 3 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.721 per million British thermal units at 1:55
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas is up 24 percent
this year and 12 percent this month.  Nymex floor trading opened today after being shut for two
days because of Sandy. Gas futures volume in electronic and
floor trading on the Nymex was 148,458 as of 1:51 p.m., compared
with the three-month average of 343,600.  Options Trading  April $2.00 puts were the most active options on the
exchange, trading 0.2 cent higher at 0.3 cent on volume of 1,000
lots at 1:59 p.m.  The low in New York on Nov. 3 may be 38 degrees Fahrenheit
(3 Celsius), 7 below normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Cleveland  may be 33
degrees, 10 below the usual reading.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  Consolidated Edison, which owns New York’s utility, said
the lights may remain off for four days in areas of Brooklyn and
 Manhattan  and as long as a week in other parts of the city as
the company deals with the worst storm in its history. ConEd had
811,354 customers without power as of 1:52 p.m., according to
the utility’s website.  The coming U.S. winter will probably be cooler than a year
ago, boosting demand for heating fuels such as natural gas, a
panel of forecasters said Oct. 18.  Winter Outlook  While December will be warmer than normal, temperatures
will drop through February, increasing natural gas use by 13
percent over the same period from last year, Commodity Weather
Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  said during the panel discussion
at Earth Networks Inc.’s seventh annual energy weather seminar
in New York.  The U.S. winter, measured by meteorologists from Dec. 1 to
Feb. 28, may be 21 percent cooler than last year in terms of
natural gas-weighted heating degree days, Rogers said.  An Energy Department report scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. tomorrow in  Washington  may show gas stockpiles rose 67
billion cubic feet last week to 3.91 trillion, according to the
median of 12 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-
year average gain for the week is 57 billion. Last year,
supplies rose 82 billion during the same period.  Gas inventories totaled 3.843 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Oct. 19, 7 percent above the five-year average. The
 surplus  to the average is down from 61 percent on March 30. U.S.
storage capacity is about 4.239 trillion, Energy Department data
show.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
