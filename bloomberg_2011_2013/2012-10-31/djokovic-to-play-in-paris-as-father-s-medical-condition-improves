World No. 2 Novak Djokovic was
knocked out of the Paris Masters today by  Sam Querrey  of the
U.S., his earliest tournament exit for more than two years.  Querrey, ranked 23rd on the ATP tennis tour, won 0-6, 7-6
(7-5), 6-4 in the second round after Djokovic had a bye in the
first. The Serb lost at the same stage in the Miami Masters in
March 2010.  Even so, Djokovic is assured of regaining the top ranking
from  Roger Federer  next week and will finish the season as No. 1
for the second straight year.  There’d been speculation Djokovic might pull out of the
Paris tournament after his father was taken ill back home,
Belgrade newspaper Blic reported. Srdjan Djokovic was diagnosed
with an acute respiratory condition and his son flew to Belgrade
to see him earlier this week, the paper said.  “Srdjan has pulled through, the worst is behind him” and
he may be discharged from the hospital in about 10 days, said
Goran Djokovic, Srdjan’s brother, in a phone interview with
Bloomberg News earlier today.  Djokovic, 25, lost the top spot in July to Federer, who has
withdrawn from this week’s event and won’t have enough points to
retain the top position. No. 4  Rafael Nadal  still hasn’t
recovered from a knee injury that’s kept him out since
Wimbledon.  The season-ending ATP World Tour Finals for the eight top
singles and doubles players starts Nov. 5 in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
