The Ukrainian government won’t limit
wheat exports for the time being as there’s not a critical
shortage of the cereal, said Ivan Bisyuk, first deputy
agriculture minister.  “Nobody was preparing an order to ban wheat exports,”
Bisyuk told journalists today after the weekly cabinet meeting.
“We do not see any critical situation with milling wheat.”  Drought may cut the combined wheat harvests in Ukraine,
Russia and Kazakhstan by 37 percent this year, helping send
global stockpiles to a four-year low, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates. Ukraine exported 4 million metric tons of
wheat in the current season which started July 1 and 5.4 million
tons have been contracted, according to the Ukrainian
Agriculture Ministry. Deliveries near 5.4 million tons would
threaten to exhaust the nation’s exportable surplus, Bisyuk said
on Oct. 19.  The ministry said today that it expects wheat exports to
slow down next month and to be replaced by corn. Ukraine ranked
eighth among world wheat exporters last season and was the
fourth-biggest shipper of corn, USDA data show. The country was
the largest supplier of both grains to the European Union last
year, according to data from the bloc.  Ukraine doesn’t plan to introduce any export quotas,
according to a statement today on the government’s website,
which cites First Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskyi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
