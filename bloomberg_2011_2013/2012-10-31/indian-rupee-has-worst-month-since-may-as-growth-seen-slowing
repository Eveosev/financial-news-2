India ’s rupee completed its biggest
monthly loss since May after the International Monetary Fund and
the central bank forecast the slowest economic growth for the
nation in almost a decade.  Gross domestic product will rise 5.8 percent in the year
through March, versus a July forecast of 6.5 percent, the
Reserve Bank of India said in a statement yesterday. That would
be the least since 2003. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares
plunged to a six-week low yesterday after the RBI held borrowing
costs, resisting Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram’s call
for cheaper credit to back a recent policy revamp that included
cutting fuel subsidies and allowing more foreign investment.  “Without the euphoria and distraction of the government’s
reform announcements, the RBI clearly spelt out its number one
priority, which is inflation,” Charlie Lay, an economist and
currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Singapore , wrote in a
research report today. The focus on inflation suggests the
central bank will want to prevent the rupee from weakening too
much, he wrote.  The rupee declined 1.8 percent this month to 53.8150 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency, which rose 0.3 percent today, touched 54.2075 earlier,
the weakest level since Sept. 21. Lay forecast the rupee would
trade between 52 and 54 in the coming months.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 40 basis points today to 9.90
percent. The rate dropped 160 basis points, or 1.6 percentage
points, in October.  Growth, Inflation  Asia’s third-largest economy will grow 4.9 percent in 2012,
the IMF said in an Oct. 9 report, less than the 6.1 percent it
predicted in July.  Policy makers will seek to limit the rupee’s depreciation
as a weaker currency will increase the nation’s import bill and
fuel consumer-price gains, according to Commerzbank. Inflation
accelerated to 7.81 percent in September, data showed Oct. 15,
the fastest pace this year. The  trade deficit  widened to the
highest level in more than a year in September as exports fell
10.8 percent from a year earlier.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 54.71 per dollar
compared with 54.92 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 54.63
versus 54.89. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
