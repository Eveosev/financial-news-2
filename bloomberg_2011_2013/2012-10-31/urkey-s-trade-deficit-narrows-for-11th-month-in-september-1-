Turkey’s  trade deficit  narrowed for
an 11th consecutive month in September, as slowing growth hit
demand for imports and gold exports continued to increase.  The gap declined to $6.8 billion from a record $10.5
billion for the same month a year earlier, the statistics office
in Ankara said on its  website  today. It was expected at $6.2
billion, according to the median estimate of three economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Imports fell 6.4 percent to $19.8 billion and exports rose
21 percent to $13 billion led by precious metal exports to the
United Arab Emirates, which increased to $1.1 billion, a more
than fourfold gain over last year.  The precious metals figure has distorted the underlying
trade picture and the narrowing deficit should be “taken with a
pinch of salt,”  Piotr Matys , an  emerging markets  analyst at
4cast Ltd., said by e-mail.  While the central bank has eased monetary policy in the
second half, Matys said that was unlikely to change import tends
in the near future. “The central bank will not allow domestic
demand to fuel import growth significantly as was the case in
2011.”  Turkey has diversified exports from crisis-hit Europe, its
biggest market, toward the  Middle East , Asia and  Africa . Import
growth has slowed as the central bank tightened monetary policy
to curb  consumer credit , which had contributed to a current
account gap that surpassed 10 percent of economic output last
year.  That deficit helped push the lira down by more than 18
percent in 2011. The currency has pared losses this year, adding
about 5.3 percent. The lira was trading up 0.1 percent at 1.7942
at 1:17 p.m. The ISE National 100 Index continued its rally,
rising by more than 1 percent to 72,460.48.  The narrowing trade deficit is more a sign of a weakening
economy than booming exports says Atilla Yesilada,  Turkey 
country adviser at New York-based Globalsource Partners Inc., in
a telephone interview. “This is a recession in domestic
demand,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
