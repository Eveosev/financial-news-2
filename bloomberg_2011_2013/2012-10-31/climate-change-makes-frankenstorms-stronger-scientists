Climate change  is raising sea levels and altering the jet stream in the U.S., making already powerful storms like Sandy stronger, scientists with a conservation group said.  Storms will grow unless greenhouse emissions are cut, the Tucson, Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity said last night in a  statement .  “The terrifying truth is that America faces a future full of Frankenstorms,” Shaye Wolf, the center’s climate science director, said in the statement. “The threat of killer winds and crushing storm surges will grow by the year unless we get serious about tackling greenhouse-gas pollution.”  The U.S. should use the  Clean Air Act , a federal law passed in 1970 and last amended in 1990 that defines the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s responsibilities for protecting and improving U.S. air quality, to reduce  carbon emissions , the group said.  The center has more than 450,000 members and online activists and aims to protect endangered species and wild areas.
