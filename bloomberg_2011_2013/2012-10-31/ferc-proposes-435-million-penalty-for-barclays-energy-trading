Barclays Plc was ordered by the
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  to show why it shouldn’t be
assessed a civil penalty of $435 million, plus $34.9 million in
profit disgorgement, after the agency alleged the bank
manipulated U.S. energy markets from late 2006 to 2008.  The agency proposed the penalties in a show-cause order
issued today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
