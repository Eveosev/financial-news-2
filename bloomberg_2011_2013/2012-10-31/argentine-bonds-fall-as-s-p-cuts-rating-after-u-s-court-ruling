Argentine government bonds fell the
most among major  emerging markets  after Standard & Poor’s cut
the credit rating one level following a U.S. court ruling that
threatens to impede the country’s overseas debt payments.  The  extra yield  investors demand to own Argentine
government dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose 33 basis
points, or 0.33 percentage point, to 1,057 basis points at 5:43
p.m. Buenos Aires time. The sell-off was the biggest in emerging
markets today after Belarus.  S&P yesterday lowered the country’s rating to B-, or six
levels below investment grade with, citing the court ruling,
which blocks the country from servicing its restructured debt
while refusing to pay holders of its defaulted bonds. The
government’s yield spread has surged from 851 basis points on
Oct. 25, the day before the court released its ruling.  Government officials have stuck to their pledge to not pay
the holdouts who rejected restructuring offerings in 2005 and
2010.  Argentina  defaulted on a record $95 billion of bonds in
2001.  “We’ll never pay the vulture funds,” Economy Minister
Hernan Lorenzino posted on his Twitter account on Oct. 29.
“Whoever thinks otherwise hasn’t understood a thing.”  The cost to insure Argentine debt against default in five
years with credit default swaps surged 238 basis points to
1,734. The swaps have soared 775 basis points since the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
