Oil rose for a second day as
refineries resumed operations after  Hurricane Sandy  dissipated,
increasing demand for crude.  Futures climbed 0.7 percent as Philadelphia Energy
Solutions’ 355,000-barrel-a-day Pennsylvania refinery restored
operations. PBF Energy Inc. said its Paulsboro, New Jersey, and
Delaware City, Delaware, refineries were running normally. Oil
pared gains as U.S. stocks fell and the  American Petroleum
Institute  said inventories rose for an eighth week.  “Some refineries are already back and running, which will
absorb some of the crude, and that’s bullish for crude,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester, Massachusetts. “For all the damage from the
hurricane, people are expecting a fairly quick recovery.”  Crude oil for December delivery increased 56 cents to
settle at $86.24 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Futures, which are down 13 percent this year, fell 6.5 percent
in October.  Floor trading on the Nymex resumed today after being
suspended for two days because of the storm,  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the
exchange’s owner, said in an e-mail. Electronic trading has
operated normally.  Brent oil for December settlement slid 38 cents to $108.70
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark’s premium to the West Texas Intermediate
contract traded in New York narrowed for a second day, to $22.46
a barrel from $23.40.  Seven Refineries  Philadelphia Energy’s Pennsylvania refinery is running at a
reduced rate until waterborne deliveries resume, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  PBF said its 185,000-barrel-a-day Paulsboro refinery and
182,200-barrel-a-day Delaware City plant were operating normally
today after storm disruptions.  NuStar Energy LP (NS) ’s 74,000-barrel-
a-day plant in Paulsboro,  New Jersey , will be at full production
tomorrow, the company said.  “Refineries are going back on and it looks like there is
no lasting damage,” said Bill Baruch, senior market strategist
at Iitrader.com in Chicago. “There is technical resistance at
$86.50.”  Seven refineries with a total capacity of 1.29 million
barrels a day shut or reduced operations because of Sandy.
Production starts at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s 238,000-barrel-a-day Bayway
refinery in Linden and  Hess Corp. (HES) ’s 70,000-barrel-a-day Port
Reading plant depend on post-storm assessments, the companies
said.  Sandy Fades  Sandy’s remnants were scattered across the lower Great
Lakes, according to an 11 a.m.  advisory  issued by the
Hydrometeorological Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.  “Sandy is fading as a factor in crude market trading,”
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The price is reflecting
what’s taking place in other markets today.”  Gasoline for November delivery rose 3.3 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.7618 a gallon in New York. The contract expires
today. The more-active December futures rose 1.48 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.6303.  “Gasoline supplies are very tight and the market reflects
that,” Armstrong said.  Oil pared gains as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell as
much as 0.4 percent after rising as much as 0.5 percent.  Crude Stockpiles  U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.12 million barrels to 371.7
million last week, the American Petroleum Institute said
yesterday. Gasoline supplies slipped 173,000 barrels to 199.2
million, the report showed.  The  Department of Energy  postponed release of its inventory
report to 11 a.m. New York time tomorrow from today,  Jonathan Cogan , a Washington-based spokesman, said in a phone interview.  “We had a slightly bearish API report and we’ll see what
happens with the DOE,” Lynch said.  The government may report that crude supplies increased by
1.88 million barrels last week, according to the median of 10
responses in a  Bloomberg survey  of analysts. Gasoline stockpiles
rose 175,000 barrels and distillate inventories declined by 1.2
million in the survey.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 363,864
contracts as of 2:51 p.m. Volume totaled 223,552 contracts
yesterday, the lowest level this year and 57 percent below the
three-month average. Open interest was 1.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
