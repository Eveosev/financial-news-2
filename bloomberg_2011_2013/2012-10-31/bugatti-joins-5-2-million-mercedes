A 1959 Ferrari GT racer, an  Aston
Martin  once owned by  Paul McCartney  and a Bugatti Veyron were
among star lots in a test of the classic-car market last night.  The Ferrari sold for $3.2 million, the top lot in an annual
event by Canadian-based  RM Auctions  at London’s Battersea
Evolution. A rare “14-louver” air-vent variant of the “ Tour
de France ” Ferrari dating from 1956 was sold by RM for $6.7
million at its California auction in August.  “This was less desirable than the Monterey car,” said
Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of the Historic Automobile Group
International (HAGI), whose Top 50 benchmark index tracks the
sales of exceptional classic cars. “There were only seven or
eight ‘14-louver’ versions built, and the 1956 date allows the
new owner to enter the Mille Miglia Storica. Event-eligibility
is a significant value-driver.”  RM’s auction of 93 classic cars and motorcycles is the
first big-ticket event since a record $263.3 million series in
 California  in August.  Prices  of the rarest 1950s and 1960s cars
by marques such as Mercedes and Ferrari are on the rise; some
more recent models are struggling to appreciate, dealers said.  The Aston Martin DB5 was delivered new to McCartney during
his time as a Beatle in September 1964. It sold for 344,400
pounds ($556,481) with fees to an unidentified bidder in the
room, against an estimate of 300,000 pounds to 380,000 pounds.
The DB5 had passed through at least three other owners before
being acquired in 2002 by a U.K.-based collector, who restored
the original Sierra Blue bodywork.  Restored Racer  The Ferrari 250GT LWB Berlinetta “Tour de France” had a
formal selling price of 1.96 million pounds with fees, against a
hammer-price estimate of 1.8 million pounds to 2.4 million
pounds.  The racer was entered by a collector from Brescia,  Italy .
It had been restored after racing in hill climbs in 1959 and
1960, and was bought by a collector in the room who declined to
give his name.  Earlier in the evening, a 2008 Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 --the
world’s fastest production car -- sold for 579,600 pounds to an
unidentified bidder at the front of the room.  With a top speed of more than 250 miles per hour, the
Bugatti was one of 22 European- and U.S.-made cars being sold
without reserve by the Dutch collector Wim Zegwaard.  The Veyron, with a production limited to 300, had an
original price of $1.5 million to $2 million, dealers said. This
example had less than 700 kilometers (435 miles) on its odometer
and had been estimated to fetch between 440,000 pounds and
560,000 pounds.  Crazy Car  “The Veyron is completely crazy,” said Adrian Hamilton,
chairman of the Hampshire-based dealer  Duncan Hamilton & Co. ,
which has bought and sold several examples. “If you drive flat
out, it runs out of petrol in 16 minutes. It costs a fortune to
maintain. Yet a car like that may never be created again. It
could potentially be a reasonable investment.”  The HAGI Top 50 benchmark index declined 3.96 points (2.2
percent) in September against a backdrop of continuing
uncertainty in the global economy, particularly in  Europe , the
London-based company said in an e-mail.  A 1955 Mercedes-Benz Gullwing was the most highly valued
car in the auction and it failed to sell. The car was formally
estimated at 3.2 million pounds and bidding stopped at 2.4
million pounds.  The Mercedes was cataloged by RM as being one of just 29
alloy-bodied 300SL models. Another example of this rare car sold
for $4.6 million at Gooding & Co. in Scottsdale,  Arizona , on
Jan. 20-21. Both vehicles had been restored.  “This is the greatest of postwar Mercedes,” Simon Kidston, the founder of Geneva-based car dealer Kidston SA, said
in an interview at the sale. “After that Scottsdale result,
every owner thinks his car is worth $4.6 million. This event
tells us what a gullwing is really worth.”  The RM sale had a combined minimum estimate of 20 million
pounds and raised 13.87 million with an 83 percent success rate.  Muse highlights include  Greg Evans  on TV,  Craig Seligman  on
books and  Jason Harper  on cars.  To contact the writer on the story:
