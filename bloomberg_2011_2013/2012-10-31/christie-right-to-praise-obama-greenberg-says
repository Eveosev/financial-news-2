Chris Christie , New Jersey’s Republican governor, was right to praise President Barack Obama’s response to superstorm Sandy a week before Election Day, said Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, a supporter of  Mitt Romney .  “The president is doing what he should be doing,” Greenberg, the former chairman of  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , told Bloomberg Television’s Betty Liu on the “In the Loop” program today. “He’s supposed to be leading this charge. You wouldn’t denounce him for that. Why would you do that?”  Obama has done “as far as I’m concerned, a great job for New Jersey,” Christie said on the Fox News Channel yesterday, a day after Sandy struck the state. The president, a Democrat, scheduled a visit to  New Jersey  today to survey damage with Christie. Romney returns to the campaign trail with events in Florida.  Christie has campaigned on Romney’s behalf and was the keynote speaker at the Republican nominating convention. Greenberg said Christie was “being himself” in crediting Obama’s efforts this week.  “He has to be honest,” said Greenberg, who now runs insurance company Starr International Co.
