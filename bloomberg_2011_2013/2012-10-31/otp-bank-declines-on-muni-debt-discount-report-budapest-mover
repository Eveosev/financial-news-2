OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, snapped two days of gains after news website Origo
reported the government plans to apply discounts of as much 25
percent when it transfers municipal debt owed to banks to the
central budget.  The shares fell 1.7 percent to 4,150 forint by the end of
trading in Budapest, paring the advance this month to 6.6
percent. The benchmark BUX stock  index  rose 0.1 percent,
extending its gain in October to 3.4 percent.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government, which has been
working to cut the biggest sovereign debt burden in the east of
the European Union, is extending its “war” on liabilities by
taking over $2.8 billion in local council debt, Orban said on
Oct. 27. The government may pay between 75 percent and 80
percent of the face value on some of the riskier municipal debt,
forcing banks to write off the rest, and settle in bonds not
cash, Origo reported, without citing anyone.  “The news is negative for investor sentiment,” Zoltan Arokszallasi, an analyst at  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , wrote in an e-
mailed report. “In the worst case, losses for the banking
sector would be very significant and thus detrimental to lending
and the gross domestic product outlook.”  The prime minister’s press office declined to comment on
the Origo report when contacted by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
