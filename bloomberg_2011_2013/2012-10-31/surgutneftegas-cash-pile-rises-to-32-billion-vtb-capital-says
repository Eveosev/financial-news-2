OAO Surgutneftegas, the Siberian oil
producer headed by President Vladimir Putin’s ally Vladimir
Bogdanov, boosted its cash pile to $32.1 billion while dividends
may remain little changed, according to VTB Capital.  Net income fell 40 percent to 119.1 billion rubles ($3.8
billion) under Russian accounting standards from the same period
last year,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer said yesterday
after the close of business. The drop was largely due to a $1.9
billion foreign exchange loss, VTB Capital said.  Surgut may realize a currency gain in the fourth quarter if
oil prices hold at $110 a barrel and the ruble trades at 32.3 to
the dollar, VTB Capital said today in a research note. That
would allow the company to pay  dividends  of 7 cents a preferred
share on its 2012 income, implying a 9 percent yield, the bank
said. That is little changed from last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We would highlight that foreign exchange rate volatility
remains the key risk factor for Surgutneftegas dividends,” VTB
Capital said.  Surgutneftegas increased output 1.1 percent to 1.23 million
barrels a day of oil a day in the first nine months of 2012 from
a year earlier, almost all in Siberia, according to the Energy
Ministry’s CDU TEK  data  unit. That is about 1.5 percent of the
83.6 million barrels a day produced globally last year,
according to BP Plc data.  Shares fell 0.8 percent to 19.66 rubles by 12:24 p.m. in
Moscow, reversing gains of as much as 1.1 percent.  The Surgut, Russia-based company may begin publishing
financial results to international standards next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
