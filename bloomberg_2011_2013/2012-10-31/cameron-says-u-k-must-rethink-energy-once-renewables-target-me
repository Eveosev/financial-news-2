Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
the U.K. should rethink its energy policy once targets for
expanding renewable power generation are met.  “We’ve got a big pipeline of offshore and onshore wind
products coming through,” Cameron said in his weekly question
time in Parliament in London today. “All parties are going to
have to have a debate about what happens once those commitments
are met.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
