Michael Vick  will start at
quarterback for the  Philadelphia Eagles  against the New Orleans
Saints on Nov. 5, coach  Andy Reid  said in a  statement .  Vick, a four-time Pro Bowl quarterback, has thrown eight
interceptions and fumbled nine times this season. The team’s
30-17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Oct. 28 was its third
straight defeat, dropping Philadelphia to 3-4 in the National
Football Conference East division.  Reid said after the loss that he was going to evaluate all
his starters. Vick said he understood, and that he would support
Reid’s decision at the quarterback position. Rookie Nick Foles,
taken in the third round of the 2012 draft from the  University
of Arizona , is Vick’s backup.  Philadelphia has sustained setbacks on its offensive line,
including injuries to left tackle Jason Peters and center Jason
Kelce, that have led to 20 quarterback sacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
