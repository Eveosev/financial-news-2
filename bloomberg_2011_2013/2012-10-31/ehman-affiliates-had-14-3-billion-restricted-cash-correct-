Defunct Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and its affiliates had $14.3 billion in restricted cash on
Sept. 30, including $10.9 billion of reserves for claims,
according to a federal court filing in  Manhattan .  Free cash and investments totaled almost $11 billion. The
claim reserves include $5.8 billion held for disputed amounts,
Lehman said. The former investment bank plans two payments to
creditors every year. The last payment was Oct. 1.  Lehman, which four years after filing the biggest U.S.
bankruptcy continues to sell  assets  to pay creditors, made a
first payment of $22.5 billion in April and a second installment
of $10.2 billion this month.  Overseen by a new  board  since leaving bankruptcy in March,
the defunct New York-based firm plans a third distribution
around March 30. Lehman has said it intends to raise $53 billion
through 2016 or so, to pay an average of 18 cents on the dollar
on final claims of $300 billion.  The company filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 listing
debt of $613 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
