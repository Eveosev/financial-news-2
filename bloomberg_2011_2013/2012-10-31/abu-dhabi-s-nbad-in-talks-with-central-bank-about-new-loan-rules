National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC  said
it’s in talks with the United Arab Emirates central bank to
exclude its portfolio of “high-quality” bonds from a cap on
lending to governments and state-linked companies.  The U.A.E. second-biggest bank by assets isn’t in
compliance with regulations announced in April and “we do have
some technical issues that we want to thrash out,” Chief
Executive Officer Michael Tomalin said in a conference call with
analysts today.  The  central bank  said April 4 banks cannot lend more than
100 percent of their capital to local governments and the same
to state-related entities. Institutions had until Sept. 30 to
comply. There was no limit under previous rules.  “We are holding high-quality double-A bonds issued by top-
quality  Abu Dhabi  issuers as part of our liquidity pool,”
Tomalin said. There should be a distinction between marketable
securities that a bank uses for managing funding levels from
“overdrafts, which are obviously very different,” he said.  NBAD’s exposure to state-owned companies is in a large part
through its holding of bonds, Tomalin said. “I don’t think the
central bank would wish for us to sell these bonds and replace
them with lower grade bonds to meet some concentration ratio.”  The lender expects an agreement which ensures that banks
“are not overly exposed to any one particular borrower at the
same time allows National Bank of Abu Dhabi to do its job,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
