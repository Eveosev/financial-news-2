Brait SE (BAT) , a South African investment
group, grew first-half net asset value by 12 percent as its
stakes in retailers Pepkor Ltd and Iceland Foods Ltd delivered
gains.  The company’s net asset value per share increased to 23.01
rand in the six months through September as the value of its
investment in South African holding group Pepkor jumped 15
percent, while its stake in U.K.-based Iceland Foods, bought in
March, was worth 25 percent more at the end of the period.  Iceland’s increased value benefited from the 7.7 percent
depreciation in the value of the rand, Brait said in a statement
today. A stake in food group Premier Foods Ltd grew 5.2 percent
in value over the six months.  A private placement of 1.5 billion rand ($170 million) in
preference shares in July was used to repay debt, leaving “at
least” 2.8 billion rand in cash and credit facilities to fund
future acquisitions, Brait said.  “The defensive nature of the portfolio has enabled strong
growth in a tough macro environment,” Chairman Jabu Moleketi
said. “The directors believe that the business is well
positioned on the back of a strong portfolio and a robust
balance sheet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
