Softbank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese mobile-
phone carrier that agreed last month to buy a $20 billion stake
in  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , boosted second-quarter earnings by
luring users with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.  Operating income  rose 6.7 percent to 210.6 billion yen
($2.6 billion) in the three months ended September, the Tokyo-
based company said in a statement yesterday. The carrier is also
considering reducing its stake in  eAccess Ltd. (9427)  to one-third
after the 180 billion yen acquisition is completed, Softbank
President Masayoshi Son told reporters in Tokyo yesterday.  Softbank has narrowed the gap in subscribers with bigger
rivals  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437)  and  KDDI Corp. (9433)  by cutting basic fees and
being the first in  Japan  to offer the iPhone series, adding the
most net new users every year since 2007. By increasing
smartphone subscribers, Softbank has also raised average revenue
per user of data services including streaming video.  The result “should be positive for the share price in the
near term,” Hitoshi Hayakawa, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG in Tokyo, wrote in a note to clients yesterday. “The
market’s focus has shifted from results to the impact of the
recent major acquisitions” of Sprint and eAccess, he said.  The  carrier , Japan’s third-largest for mobile phones, seeks
to increase users outside the country. The acquisition of a 70
percent stake in Sprint Nextel would add the  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based company’s 56.4 million mobile subscribers, bringing
Softbank’s total to 96 million in the U.S. and Japan, compared
with 60.8 million for NTT DoCoMo, Japan’s biggest mobile
carrier.  EAccess Stake  Son also is considering the “merits and demerits” of
owning all of eAccess as initially planned, he said.  Softbank  rose  0.8 percent to 2,527 yen in  Tokyo  yesterday.
The stock has  gained  11 percent this year, compared with a 1.9
percent advance for the broader Topix index and a 17 percent
decline for NTT DoCoMo.  Softbank left unchanged its  projection  for at least 700
billion yen in operating profit for the year ending March.
Operating income rose 7.9 percent to 402.8 billion yen in the
six months ended Sept. 30, beating the 373.2 billion yen
estimate by Hayakawa of Credit Suisse.  Overseas Momentum  “Our earnings are running in top gear,” Son said. “It’s
proof that the iPhone isn’t the only thing boosting our profits.
We’re making various efforts, and that’s why we have strength to
go overseas.”  The Sprint deal would be the biggest publicly announced
outbound acquisition by a Japanese company since at least 2000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Softbank will pay $12.1
billion to Sprint shareholders and the deal includes $8 billion
of new capital, according to an Oct. 15 statement.  Son is pursuing an acquisition strategy that counts on
smartphone users migrating to faster wireless networks to surf
the Web and download or stream videos and music. Softbank is
looking to ride the fastest growth in mobile communications
since 3G started rolling out a decade ago with the emergence of
Long Term Evolution technology.  LTE subscriptions quadrupled this year to 73 million and
are expected to reach 1.2 billion by 2016, according to
 projections  from IHS iSuppli. Some of the world’s largest
handset makers -- Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and  HTC Corp. (2498)  -
- support the technology.  Capital Spending  Softbank will increase  capital spending  to 700 billion yen
this fiscal year as it seeks to keep capacity growth on pace
with the increase in subscribers, then trim to 550 billion yen
in the next 12 months, Son told reporters yesterday.  Softbank gained 320,200 subscribers in September, up from
217,200 in August. That compares with the 158,600 addition at
DoCoMo. KDDI, the No. 2 operator that also started offering
iPhone 5, attracted 224,900 users.  Softbank, the fastest-growing Japanese mobile provider,
boosted earnings by more than sevenfold during the past four
years with the popularity of the iPhone.  Net income fell 36 percent to 78.8 billion yen in the
fiscal second quarter, according to yesterday’s statement. The
sale of Yahoo! Inc. shares helped push profit for the same
period last year to a record 122.5 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
