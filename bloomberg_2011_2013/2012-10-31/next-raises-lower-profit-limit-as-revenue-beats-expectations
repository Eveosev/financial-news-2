Next Plc (NXT) , the U.K.’s second-largest
clothing retailer, raised its lower limit of profit guidance for
the year after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter
sales boosted by growth in September.  Profit before tax will be between 590 million pounds ($949
million) and 620 million pounds, compared with an earlier target
of as low as 575 million pounds, the Leicester, England-based
retailer said today in a  statement . Total brand sales in the
period ended Oct. 27 rose 2.7 percent, excluding value-added
tax, more than the 2 percent median estimate of six analysts.  Next said higher sales in late September and early October
offset an “unusually quiet” start to August. The retailer is
revamping its online delivery options, adding new home outlets
selling furniture and cutting costs to combat the difficult
consumer climate.  “Overall sales performance remains volatile, making it
hard to draw conclusions from any one short period of time,”
Next said in the statement. “We expect total sales in the final
quarter to increase broadly in line with sales for the year-to-
date.”  The shares rose 0.2 percent to 3,605 pence in  London 
trading yesterday. They have risen 32 percent this year.  Revenue at the Next Directory home-shopping unit increased
by 5.6 percent, compared with the 8.5 percent median estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
