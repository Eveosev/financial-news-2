John “Jack” Miller, a managing
director in fixed income at Brean Capital LLC, was among the
people killed by  Hurricane Sandy , the company said. He was 39.  Miller died after being struck by a tree that fell outside
his Lloyd Harbor, New York, home on Oct. 29, according to a
statement e-mailed today by Steve Corwen. He is survived by his
wife, Linda, and two daughters, Reilly and Kelsey, the firm
said.  Boomer Esiason, the former professional football player and
sports broadcaster, told CBS News that Miller was evacuating his
family from their house when the tree fell. Esiason, a friend
and teammate on Miller’s recreational hockey team, said he was
“stunned and saddened by the news,” CBS reported yesterday.  “Our office is deeply saddened by the loss of one of
ours,” Corwen, a sales manager at New York-based Brean, said in
the e-mail. “Jack had an incredible sense of humor and quick
wit. We lost our ‘funny bone.’ ”  Miller had joined the company last month with a team from
Gleacher & Co. as Brean expands into bonds. He’d been working
with many in the group for more than five years, Corwen said. He
previously had been at HSBC Holdings Plc. and Bear Stearns Cos.  “Jack Miller will be sorely missed by his family at Brean
Capital and all others that knew him,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
