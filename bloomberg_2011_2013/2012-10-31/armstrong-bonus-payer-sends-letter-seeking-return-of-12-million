Lance Armstrong  was asked to repay
$12 million given to him by SCA Promotions Inc., which
guaranteed bonuses for his wins in the Tour de  France  from 2002
to 2004 that have been stripped because of doping.  A letter, sent yesterday by SCA, also put the American
cyclist “on notice that we may seek legal sanctions and
penalties against Mr. Armstrong in connection with the false
testimony given by him in 2005-2006 arbitration proceeding,”
Jeff Dorough, an attorney for Dallas-based SCA, said in an e-
mail.  Armstrong, 41, was given until 5 p.m. Dallas time on Nov. 2
to respond, Dorough said. An e-mail sent to Jeffrey Tillotson,
SCA’s outside counsel, wasn’t immediately returned.  Asked in an e-mail if he had any response, Tim Herman,
Armstrong’s attorney, said: “I would if I had received a
letter.”  Armstrong and U.S. Postal Service team owner Tailwind
Sports sued SCA in 2004 for failing to pay a $5 million bonus to
the cyclist for his sixth  Tour de France  victory, which came
amid allegations of doping.  It settled the suit in 2006, agreeing to pay the $5 million
and $2.5 million in interest and legal fees. SCA also is seeking
to recover another $4.5 million in bonuses paid to Armstrong for
his 2002 and 2003 wins.  Armstrong was stripped of all seven of his Tour de France
victories and banned for life from competing in sanctioned
events by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which cited a career
“fueled from start to finish by doping” when it released a
202-page summary of its investigation into Armstrong and the
U.S. Postal Service pro cycling team on Oct. 10.  The International Cycling Union opted not to appeal USADA’s
ruling. Armstrong, who has denied doping and said he never
failed a drug test, declined to take the USADA case to
arbitration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
