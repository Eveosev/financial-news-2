OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of
 Russia ’s natural-gas exporter, acquired licenses to two
oilfields in Orenburg to take advantage of lower development
costs in the southern Russian region.  The transaction gives Gazprom Neft access to the
Baleykinsky and Uranskaya fields, adjacent to its Tsarichanskoe
development, the St. Petersburg-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement, without disclosing terms. The two deposits
may hold as much as 30 million metric tons of oil, it said.  “This region remains one of our key priorities,” First
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Vadim Yakovlev said in the
statement. “Last year Gazprom Neft acquired three assets in the
Orenburg region and has been expanding its scale of operations
since then.”  Gazprom Neft and Russian competitor TNK-BP have revived
output in the area by linking small fields to existing
infrastructure. Orenburg’s advantages over Siberia include well-
developed infrastructure, reserve potential and lower
development costs, according to Gazprom Neft’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
