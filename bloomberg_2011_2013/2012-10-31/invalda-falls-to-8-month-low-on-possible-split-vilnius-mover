Invalda AB (IVL1L) , Lithuania’s only listed
investment company, fell to the lowest in eight months after
saying shareholders would consider dividing assets into separate
companies at a meeting next month.  The shares fell 5 percent yesterday and 8.1 percent today
to 1.94 euros ($2.51) on the Nasdaq  OMX Vilnius (VILSE)  exchange in the
Lithuanian capital, the lowest since Feb. 27. Volume today of
171,299 was the most since Aug. 9, 2011. The OMX Vilnius stock
index declined 1.8 percent today to 346.19, a three-week low.  Invalda shareholders will consider reorganization “to
split different investment strategies by risk and horizon into
separate companies” at a special meeting on Nov. 20, the
company said on its  website  after trading on Oct. 29. Invalda’s
 current investments  include shares in  Trakcja-Tiltra SA (TRK) ,
Poland’s biggest publicly-traded railway builder,  AB Vilniaus
Baldai (VBL1L) , Lithuania’s biggest producer of flat-pack furniture, as
well as real estate, agriculture and IT companies, according to
the company’s website.  Lithuanian media, including the BNS news service, the
websites of Verslo Zinios newspaper and the Internet magazine
eversus.lt reported today that Invalda’s largest shareholders
had failed to reach agreement about the company’s strategy and
may divide its assets among themselves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
