Gold futures rose to a one-week high
as commodities rallied on speculation that  Europe ’s debt woes
will be contained.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
climbed to a one-week high, and the dollar dropped against a
basket of major currencies. Euro-area finance chiefs discussed

yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg .  “Gold is getting some bids today because of optimism about
Europe,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup
Inc.’s institutional client group in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “The weaker dollar is providing support
too.”  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
