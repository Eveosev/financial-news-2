Ashtead Group Plc (AHT) , a U.K.
construction-equipment rental company with most of its business
in the U.S., rose to a  record  on the expectation it will gain
sales helping to clear up in the wake of superstorm Sandy.  The shares climbed 2.3 percent to 373 pence in  London , the
highest price in at least 23 years, extending the gain this year
to 65 percent.  “It is good news for Ashtead, but it is not dial
changing,” Andrew Nussey, an analyst at Peel Hunt who has a buy
recommendation on the stock, said in an interview. “Companies
like Ashtead benefit from storm-related activity.”  Sandy was the biggest Atlantic storm in history, spanning
an area broader than  Texas , and caused at least 50 U.S. deaths,
according to the Associated Press. Losses from the storm may
total as much as $20 billion, according to Eqecat Inc., a risk-
management company in Oakland,  California .  The storm left more than 8.2 million electricity customers
without power in 20 states from South Carolina to Maine and as
far west as Michigan and Indiana, according to the U.S. Energy
Department. In New Jersey, 65 percent were without power, and in
 Connecticut , 31 percent were blacked out, the department said.  Ashtead said Sept. 4 that profit for the year ending April
30 would be “materially better” than previously forecast as
construction activity in the U.S. picked up.  The company had 945.7 million pounds ($1.52 billion) of
sales in North America in the fiscal year ended April 30, about
83 percent of its total revenue, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
