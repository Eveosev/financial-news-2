Foreign funds boosted  holdings  of
Malaysian local-currency debt by 7.8 percent in September from a
month earlier to a record 216 billion ringgit ($71 billion),
according to data published on the central bank’s  website  today.  The value of ringgit-denominated bonds held by overseas
investors rose 29 percent from the same month in 2011 and
surpassed the previous all-time high of 200 billion ringgit
reached at the end of August,  Bank Negara Malaysia  said. It was
the fourth monthly increase in a row.  Holdings of non-Islamic government securities increased 2.9
percent to 120 billion, while ownership of Shariah-compliant
sovereign bonds climbed 7 percent to 1.7 billion ringgit. Short-
term central bank bill and note holdings rose 16 percent to 79
billion ringgit, the figures show.  The ringgit appreciated 0.2 percent to 3.0473 per dollar as
of 6:46 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency gained 4.1 percent this year, the
fourth-best performer among Asia’s 11 most-used currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
