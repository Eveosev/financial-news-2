Mondi Ltd., the largest maker of
office paper and industrial bags in  Europe , said third-quarter
operating profit decreased after a fall in sales prices.  Underlying operational profit was 135 million euros ($175
million) compared with 136 million euros a year ago, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement.  “Third-quarter average benchmark selling prices across all
grades were below those of the comparable prior-year period,”
the company said.  Sales for the third quarter are typically lower than the
rest of the year due to European summer vacations and
maintenance at the company’s plants, Chief Financial Officer
 Andrew King  said by phone from Johannesburg. Mondi expects price
increases for its packaging products to deliver a boost to
fourth-quarter earnings, King said.  Mondi bought 99.93 percent of consumer package-maker
Nordenia International AG, based in Greven,  Germany , effective
Oct. 1 for 259 million euros in cash. In September Mondi bought
two corrugated-box plants and a recycled-container-board mill
from  Austria ’s Duropack AG for 125 million euros.  Sales and profit from Nordenia will be included in the
company’s fourth-quarter results, King said.  Mondi’s shares traded 0.2 percent higher at 92.33 rand in
Johannesburg at 10:07 a.m., reversing three days’ decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
