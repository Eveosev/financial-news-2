The U.S. Navy is sending three large- deck amphibious ships to waters off of  New York  and  New Jersey  to offer assistance in storm recovery and relief.  “The Navy is moving ships to be closer to the areas affected by the hurricane,” Rear Admiral John Kirby, the service’s chief spokesman, said in a  blog posting yesterday.   The Pentagon said in a separate update on military assistance that 10,000 Army and Air Force National Guard personnel have been mobilized to provide support in the 13 states that were hit hardest by superstorm Sandy.  While the three ships haven’t been officially assigned to post-storm duties, Kirby said the moves “will allow our forces to be best-postured to minimize the amount of time it will take these forces to get on station” if needed.  The  USS Wasp , USS  San Antonio  and USS Carter Hall are being sent from Norfolk, Virginia. The  San Antonio  is the lead ship in the new $18.8 billion, 12-ship LPD-17 class. The three vessels are capable of carrying Navy helicopters or refueling Army choppers.  The Wasp was already out to sea riding out the storm when it headed north “to be better positioned,” Kirby said, and the other ships were ordered to follow.  Sending Pumps  In other moves by the military, the Pentagon said in an e- mailed statement that the U.S. Transportation Command airlifted about 120 medical personnel to New York City to reinforce staff providing care to nursing home residents and at-risk elderly patients.  Transport aircraft also were on standby and medical personnel were being brought in from Colorado, Ohio and  Texas .  The  Army Corps  of Engineers has received 25 assignments so far from the  Federal Emergency Management Agency , including missions in  New York City  to deliver and use “high-volume” water pumps to drain flooded areas, according to the Pentagon.  The equipment includes 25 pumps being shipped from  New Orleans . The U.S. Northern Command, which is coordinating the military’s assistance, is providing an additional 100 pumps to FEMA, the Pentagon said.
