(Corrects date of euro’s introduction in second paragraph.
See TOP CRIS for more on  Europe ’s financial crisis.)  Spain posted its second current-
account surplus since the start of the euro in August, while
foreign stock and bond investors increased their holdings in the
nation for the first time in more than a year.  The current account showed a surplus of 1.24 billion euros
($1.6 billion) in August, compared with 500 million euros in
July, the first positive reading since the euro was introduced
in 1999, the Bank of Spain said today. Foreign portfolio
investment showed an inflow of 2.34 billion euros in August, the
first positive reading since February 2011.  Spain, which ran up the world’s second-biggest current-
account deficit during the housing-fueled boom, is now relying
on exports to drag the economy out of a five-year slump as an
unemployment rate of 25 percent weakens domestic demand. As the
government seeks to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign
financing, it is implementing measures such as cuts to labor
costs to make Spanish goods more competitive abroad, while
raising taxes on consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
