Estonian  industrial production  rose
in September for the first time in seven months as demand  for
its electronics exports improved.  Production increased 8.3 percent from a year earlier, the
biggest increase in 13 months, compared with a revised 2.9
percent drop in August, the Tallinn-based statistics office said
on its  website  today. Output was up 2.1 percent from the
previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.  “The main reason for the growth in production was the low
reference base in the manufacture of electronic products,”
which slowed down sharply in Sept. 2011, affecting total output,
the statistics office said. “Now, the production volume in this
branch has recovered, contributing a fifth of the total
manufacturing output.”  Electronics output, led by the local plant of Stockholm-
based  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , jumped 69 percent in September from a year
earlier, while wood and food processing, the other main
industries, still produced less than a year earlier, the office
said.  The Ericsson plant, which mainly produces mobile network
stations, more than doubled revenue last year to 1.2 billion
euros ($1.56 billion), becoming the country’s second-biggest
exporter behind fuel-trading company Baltic International
Trading OU, according to business newspaper  Aeripaeev .  To contact the reporter on this story:
