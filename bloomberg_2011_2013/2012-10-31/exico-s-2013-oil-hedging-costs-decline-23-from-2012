Mexico , the third-largest supplier
of oil to the U.S., paid 23 percent less this year to lock in
prices for 2013 oil exports than a year ago,  Finance Ministry 
data shows.  Hedging costs paid in the first nine months of the year
were 11.7 billion pesos ($897 million,) the ministry said in its
quarterly public-finances report published late yesterday. The
document doesn’t include details of the hedges.  Mexico’s hedging contracts are included in annual budget
discussions when government officials estimate incoming oil
revenue. The hedging program is usually the world’s largest of
its type, Finance Ministry officials have said. Last year,
Mexico paid $1.17 billion to lock in prices for 2012 exports at
$85 a barrel, a 44 percent increase from the previous year.  Deputy Finance Minister  Gerardo Rodriguez  declined to
detail how much crude volume Mexico was seeking to hedge in an
Oct. 13 interview. Mexico’s 2013 budget will be discussed during
the first half of December, when incoming President Enrique Pena
Nieto starts his six-year term. About a third of the national
budget comes from state oil company  Petroleos Mexicanos , known
as Pemex.  The Mexican  mix  of oil for export has traded at an average
of $103.38 a barrel this year, 22 percent higher than the
estimate of $84.90 a barrel for this year’s budget, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Officials at the Finance Ministry didn’t immediately
respond to e-mail and voice messages seeking comment.  Canada and  Saudi Arabia  are the two largest suppliers to
the U.S., according to the  Energy Information Administration .  To contact the reporters on this story:
