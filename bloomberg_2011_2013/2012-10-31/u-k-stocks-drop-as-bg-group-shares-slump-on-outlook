U.K. stocks  declined, trimming the
benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index’s monthly gain, as  BG Group Plc (BG/)  slumped
the most in at least 24 years and U.S. equity markets reopened
after Hurricane Sandy.  BG Group plunged 14 percent after saying project delays
will hold back output growth next year.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  declined
4.7 percent after disclosing two additional investigations by
U.S. regulators.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) ,
the owner of British Airways, advanced 1.7 percent after  Air
France-KLM  Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG posted earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates.  The FTSE 100 Index slipped 67.20 points, or 1.2 percent, to
5,782.7 at the close in  London . The gauge still climbed 0.7
percent in October, its fifth month of gains and its longest
winning streak since April 2006, as U.S. economic reports
exceeded forecasts. The broader FTSE All-Share Index lost 1
percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index was little changed.  “Traders turned up the heat on BG Group as the energy
company lowered its production target for 2012,” David Madden,
a market analyst at IG in London, wrote in e-mailed comments.
“The nightmare on  Wall Street  is over as the New York Stock
Exchange and  NASDAQ  reopen after  Hurricane Sandy .”  U.S. equity trading resumed today after the longest
weather-related shutdown in more than a century. Exchanges
closed for two days after Sandy halted public transport and
forced evacuations in New York.  American Economy  A U.S. business activity  gauge  from the Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago Inc. increased to 49.9 in October from
49.7 in September. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction. The  median estimate  of 54 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast had called for an increase to 51.
The projections ranged from 49.1 to 54.3.  Euro-area governments pressed Greece to make deeper
spending cuts to keep aid flowing, in the latest test of will
during the three-year battle to prevent the single currency’s
breakup.  With Greece pleading for a 31 billion-euro ($40 billion)
aid payout in November and facing a sixth year of recession in
2013, the region’s finance ministers said unfreezing loans for
the country required more efforts in Athens to rein in the
 budget deficit  and deregulate the economy.  Consumer Sentiment  In the U.K., a report from GfK NOP Ltd. showed that
 consumer confidence  fell to a six-month low in October. An index
of sentiment dropped to minus 30 from minus 28 in September, the
research group said. A gauge of how consumers see their personal
financial situation over the next year dropped 5 points to minus
13, also the lowest in six months.  BG Group plunged 14 percent to 1,147.5 pence, its biggest
decrease since at least September 1988, after the U.K.’s third-
largest natural-gas producer said delays to projects in the
North Sea, Brazil and Egypt will hold back output growth in
2013. The company said production next year will be “in line”
with that in 2012.  Barclays slid 4.7 percent to 227.5 pence, the most in more
than four months. The bank today reported third-quarter revenue
from fixed income, commodities and currencies, known as FICC,
that missed analysts’ estimates.  Barclays said the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  has
probed its western U.S. power trading business between 2006 and
2008 and could issue a notice of penalties as soon as today.  It also said the  Department of Justice  and the Securities
and Exchange Commission have investigated whether the group’s
relationships with third parties who assist the bank to win or
retain business comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  GlaxoSmithKline Earnings  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  retreated 2.4 percent to 1,386.5 pence
after the  U.K.’s largest drugmaker  reported third-quarter profit
and sales that fell more than analysts had estimated.  Earnings excluding some items decreased 15 percent to 1.97
billion pounds ($3.17 billion), or 26.5 pence a share. That
missed the  average estimate  of 28 pence from 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales declined 8 percent to 6.53 billion
pounds, falling short of the  average analyst estimate  of 6.66
billion pounds.  IAG rallied 1.7 percent to 161.3 pence. Air France and
Deutsche Lufthansa posted earnings that beat analysts’ estimates
as Europe’s two biggest airlines began to reap the benefits of
cost savings.  Third-quarter operating profit at Air France-KLM jumped 27
percent to 506 million euros ($657 million), surpassing the
average analyst prediction for 434 million euros. The profit
measure increased 6.2 percent to 648 million euros at Lufthansa,
exceeding a 522 million-euro forecast.  Tullow Oil (TLW) , the U.K.-based explorer with the most licenses
in  Africa , climbed 1.6 percent to 1,404 pence after Kenya’s
Business Daily newspaper said the company has discovered oil at
its second well in the country.  Separately, Tim O’Hanlon, Tullow’s vice-president of
African business, said the company will start taking out oil at
its Jubilee field in  Ghana  by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
