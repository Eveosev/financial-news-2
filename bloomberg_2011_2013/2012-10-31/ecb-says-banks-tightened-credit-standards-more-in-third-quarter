The European Central Bank said euro-
area banks increased tightening of credit standards to
businesses in the third quarter and expect a similar degree of
tightening in the fourth.  “The impact of risk perceptions on the net tightening of
credit standards increased in the third quarter of 2012 compared
with the previous quarter,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said in the
report today. For the fourth quarter, “banks expect a similar
degree of net tightening in credit standards for loans to
enterprises and households,” it said.  Lending to households and companies in the euro area
contracted at the fastest pace in almost three years in
September as the 17-nation currency bloc teetered on the edge of
recession. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Oct. 4 that the
weak outlook for the economy is weighing on credit demand.  For loans to households for house purchases, net tightening
was broadly stable in the third quarter, while it declined
slightly for consumer credit, the ECB said.  Euro-area banks continued to report a “pronounced” net
decline in demand for loans to enterprises in the third quarter
and expect a continued decline in the demand in the fourth,
albeit at a slower pace, the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
