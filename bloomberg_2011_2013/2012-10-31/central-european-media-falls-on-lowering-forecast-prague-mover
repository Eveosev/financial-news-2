Central European Media Ltd., the
broadcaster co-owned by Time Warner Inc., headed to its lowest
level in about two months after the company cut its full-year
guidance and cautioned against market developments in the fourth
quarter.  The Bermuda-based operator of television channels in
central and eastern  Europe , known as CME, dropped 10.99 koruna,
or 8.6 percent, to 117.01 koruna as of 9:25 a.m. in Prague
trading as of 9:25 a.m. That’s the lowest level since Sept. 6
based on closing stock prices.  The prospects for the full year “indicate” that
advertising markets are not recovering, Chief Executive Officer
Adrian Sarbu said in a regulatory filing today. The advertising
spending in the second half of the year hasn’t matched
expectations, he said.  CME also cut its full-year forecast for Oibda, or operating
income before depreciation and amortization, to be between $130
million and $140 million, compared with a previous $150 million
to $160 million forecast.  CME said its third-quarter net loss shrank to $32.6 million
from $82.2 million from a year earlier. Net revenue in the
period declined 15 percent to $140.1 million.  CME is “seriously cautious” towards the fourth-quarter
performance, Ceska Sporitelna AS’ analyst Vaclav Kminek wrote in
a note to clients. The “significant” cut for full-year
forecast is definitely “negative” news for the stock, Kminek
wrote. He recommends investors to “hold” the shares.  The company operates channels in the  Czech Republic ,
 Bulgaria ,  Romania ,  Croatia , Slovakia and Slovenia. Time Warner
holds 49.9 percent stake in CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
