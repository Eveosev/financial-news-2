Colombia ’s  urban jobless rate  was
10.7 percent in September, the national statistics agency said
today in Bogota.  Economists had estimated unemployment would be 10.2
percent, according to the median forecast of 18 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said a tax bill
presented to Congress this month seeks to cut the number of
Colombians who are out of work by reducing the cost to employers
of hiring.  Colombia’s unemployment rate is the highest among major
Latin American economies tracked by Bloomberg. Central Bank
chief Jose Dario Uribe said Oct. 2 that the Andean nation has a
high level of “structural” unemployment, which can’t be
managed with monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
