Spain ’s government bonds rose, with
10-year yields falling the most in a week, after the nation
posted its biggest current-account surplus since the euro was
introduced in 1999.  Spanish and Italian  two-year notes  extended their third
monthly advance as the data boosted optimism the sovereign-debt
crisis can be contained. Greek bonds dropped for a fifth day as
euro-area finance ministers said the nation would need to make
deeper spending cuts to keep financial aid flowing.  Germany ’s
30-year bunds advanced after demand at an auction of the
securities increased to a euro-era record.  “The figures in Spain were more positive than we
forecast,” said Ralf Umlauf, a research analyst at Landesbank
Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt . “We see peripheral bonds
rallying,” he said, referring to the securities issued by the
region’s most-indebted nations.  Spain’s 10-year yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.62 percent at 4:51 p.m. London time after
dropping as much as seven basis points, the most since Oct. 19.
The 5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 rose 0.39, or 3.90
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,298) face amount, to 101.625.  The nation’s  two-year yields  declined seven basis points to
3.02 percent, extending their monthly drop to 42 basis points.
Italian two-year yields fell six basis points to 2.27 percent.  Spanish Surplus  Spain’s current account surplus widened to 1.24 billion
euros in August from 500 million euros in July, which was the
first positive reading since 1999, the central bank said.
Foreign portfolio investment showed an inflow of 2.34 billion
euros in August, the first positive outcome since February 2011.  European policy makers pressed  Greece  for more cuts as the
nation requested a 31 billion-euro aid payout in November and
faced a sixth year of recession in 2013.  “We called on the Greek authorities to solve remaining
issues so as to swiftly finalize the negotiations,” Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said in an e-mailed  statement 
after leading a two-and-a-half-hour conference call with the
region’s finance chiefs. He said the aim was “to conclude on
the program” at a scheduled Nov. 12 meeting in Brussels.  The yield on Greece’s 10-year bond rose 11 basis points to
17.77 percent after reaching 18.14 percent, the highest since
Oct. 12. The price fell to 31.19 percent of face value.  German Auction  Germany’s  30-year yield  dropped four basis points to 2.30
percent, trimming this month’s increase to five basis points.
The 10-year yield fell two basis points to 1.46 percent.  The nation sold 1.7 billion euros of the 30-year bonds at
an average yield of 2.34 percent, compared with a record-low
yield of 2.17 percent at the previous sale on July 25. Investors
 bid  for 2.7 times the amount of securities allotted, up from 1.5
times at the prior auction, and the most since at least 1997,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is a good auction result,” Lyn Graham-Taylor, a
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in  London ,
wrote in an e-mailed report. “This is likely to have been
driven by this being the last ultra-long dated issuance of the
year for Germany.”  France  sold 4.37 billion euros of 10-year bonds at an
average yield of 2.22 percent, down from 2.28 percent on Oct. 4.
It also auctioned 1.49 billion euros of seven-year notes and
1.64 billion euros of securities maturing in 2035.  French 10-year yields were little changed at 2.24 percent.  German bonds returned 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities gained 2.9 percent, while France’s rose 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
