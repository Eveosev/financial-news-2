Carbon trading in Australia and
provinces of Canada may lack needed liquidity unless they link
with other markets, according to an adviser at the Center for
European Policy Studies.  The countries should link their proposed markets to
existing programs in  Europe , the center’s  Andrei Marcu  said
today at a conference in Bangkok. South Korea’s efforts to start
a carbon market in 2015 should also tie up with Europe to boost
trading liquidity, he said.  “Margins are currently too small for traders in the carbon
market,” he said. “Emerging carbon programs across the world
can improve margins in the long-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
