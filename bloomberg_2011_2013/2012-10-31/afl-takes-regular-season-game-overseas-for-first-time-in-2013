The Australian Football League will
stage its first regular-season match overseas next year when the
defending champion Sydney Swans face St. Kilda in the New
Zealand capital Wellington.  The teams will meet April 25 at Westpac Stadium on the
Anzac Day public holiday shared by the neighboring nations. It
will be the first time premiership points have been contested
outside  Australia , the AFL said.  The  2013 schedule released today  features a 23-round season
with the grand final taking place Sept. 28. Each of the 18 teams
plays 22 games -- 11 home and 11 away -- with one bye.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
