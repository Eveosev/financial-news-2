The U.S. District Court in lower
Manhattan, one of the busiest in the nation and the primary
venue for major financial litigation given its jurisdiction over
the  New York  Stock Exchange and bank headquarters, will be
closed the remainder of the week as a result of the superstorm
that pummelled the New York metropolitan area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
