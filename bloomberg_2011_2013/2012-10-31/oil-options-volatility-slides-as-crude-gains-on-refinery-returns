Oil options volatility slid as crude
futures rose after some U.S. East Coast refineries returned to
full operations following  Hurricane Sandy .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.13 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 4:05 p.m. compared with 30.54 percent
yesterday.  Crude oil for December delivery rose 56 cents to settle at
$86.24 a barrel as Monroe Energy and  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  returned
refineries in  Pennsylvania , New Jersey and  Delaware  to full
rates.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
December $85 puts, which fell 35 cents to $1.46 a barrel on
volume of 4,760. The second-most active were December $90 puts,
which fell 54 cents to $4.34 a barrel with 3,976 contracts
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Puts, or bets that prices will fall, accounted for 65
percent of the 37,386 contracts that traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts made up 61 percent of the
18,363 contracts that changed hands.  December $80 puts were the most actively traded in the
previous session, falling 3 cents to 50 cents a barrel on volume
of 2,252 lots. December $81 puts were next, with 1,214 lots
changing hands as they fell 4 cents to 66 cents a barrel.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls, with
68,123 lots. Next were December $125 calls, with 45,994,
followed by December $80 puts with 45,621.  To contact the reporter on this story:
