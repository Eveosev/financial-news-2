New York  Yankees’ first baseman Mark Teixeira and St. Louis Cardinals’ catcher Yadier Molina each
earned their fifth Gold Glove Award for the best fielding
performances in Major League Baseball.  Teixeira led qualifying first basemen in voting by managers
and coaches with a career-best .999 fielding percentage. He
committed one error in 1,055 chances last season.  “There are a lot of great first basemen in the American
League and I will continue to work hard to stay on top of my
game defensively,” said Teixeira, who also won in 2005, 2006,
2009 and 2010.  Yankee teammate Robinson Cano finished second in the league
with a .992 fielding percentage while making six errors to earn
his second career Gold Glove.  “My defense is something I take a lot of pride in,” said
Cano, who won his first Gold Glove in 2010. “There are a lot of
ways you can contribute to a team win. It’s not always about
offense. Sometimes saving runs is as important as scoring
runs.”  Molina, whose team went to the National League Championship
Series this year, is one of six catchers to win at least five
Gold Gloves: Ivan Rodriguez (13), Johnny Bench (10), Bob Boone
(7), Jim Sundberg (6) and Bill Freehan (5).  “It’s nice to be voted as a top player at your position,”
Molina said.  Orioles Trio  The Baltimore Orioles had three winners: catcher Matt Wieters, shortstop J.J. Hardy and centerfielder Adam Jones.  Hardy, one of nine first-time winners, made six errors in
158 games to lead the AL in fielding percentage.  Wieters was recognized for throwing out 39 percent of
potential base-stealers even though he led AL catchers with 10
errors.  Jones, who captured his second Gold Glove, had 32 home runs
and 82 runs batted in for the Orioles.  Jake Peavy of the Chicago White Sox and Jeremy Hellickson
of the Tampa Bay Rays shared the AL pitcher’s award. Peavy had
an 11-12 record, while Hellickson had a 10-11 record.  Rounding out the AL Gold Gloves were Texas Rangers third
baseman Adrian Beltre, a four-time recipient; Kansas City Royals
left-hander Alex Gordon (2); and Oakland Athletics right-fielder
Josh Reddick.  NL Winners  In the National League, Pittsburgh center fielder Andrew McCutchen and San Diego third baseman Chase Headley were first-
time winners, while Philadelphia shortstop Jimmy Rollins and
Miami Marlins pitcher Mark Buehrle picked up their fourth Gold
Gloves.  “With a whole new group of managers voting for you, it
wasn’t like it was handed to you,” said Buehrle, who ended the
season 13-13. “This one means a lot because switching leagues,
it was different managers voting on it. I had to do my job to
earn it.”  Other first-time NL winners were Washington first baseman
Adam LaRoche, Chicago Cubs second baseman Darwin Barney and
Atlanta right fielder Jason Heyward.  Rounding out the NL was Colorado Rockies leftfielder Carlos Gonzalez, who got a $25,000 bonus for his win, according to the
Associated Press.  Beltre got a $100,000 bonus and Hardy received $75,000, AP
said. Gordon, LaRoche, Molina, Peavy and Rollins each were given
$50,000; and Jones and McCutchen got $25,000 apiece.  In addition, Gordon’s salaries for 2014 and 2015 increased
by $250,000 a year to $10.25 million and $12.75 million, the AP
said. His 2016 player option also rises by $250,000 to $12.75
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
