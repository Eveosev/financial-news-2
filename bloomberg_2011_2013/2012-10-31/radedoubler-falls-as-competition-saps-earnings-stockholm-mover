TradeDoubler AB (TRAD) , a Swedish online
marketing and advertising services company, fell the most in
three months in Stockholm after the company reported a third-
quarter operating loss due to declining sales volumes.  The share fell as much as 7.2 percent, the most since July
27, and was down 4 percent to 12 kronor as of 3:05 p.m. in the
Swedish capital.  TradeDoubler reported a loss before interest and tax of 7.8
million kronor ($1.2 million) compared with a profit of 31.1
million kronor a year earlier, the Stockholm-based company said
today in a statement. Sales declined 20 percent to 526.1 million
kronor as a result of increased competition in Northern  Europe ,
the company said.  “There is no doubt that the competitive pressure is
significant in the larger, more mature markets such as  Germany ,
the Netherlands,  Sweden  and the U.K.,” Chief Executive Officer
Rob Wilson said in a statement. “However, in Southern Europe,
we are competing well despite continuing weak market
conditions.”  Wilson replaced Urban Gillstrom as CEO on Aug. 1.  TradeDoubler said the underlying markets for e-commerce and
online advertising in Europe are growing by over 10 percent a
year, creating a basis for growth in performance marketing. The
company is expected to return to expansion “in line with the
market” during the second half of next year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
