Starcomms Plc, a Nigerian
telecommunications company, said it reached an agreement with
Capcom Ltd. for investment of cash and assets worth $210 million
in return for a 90.5 percent stake.  “The proposed transaction will create a leading CDMA
operator in Nigeria and represents a fundamental step as part of
the consolidation move in the Nigerian telecoms industry,”
Lagos-based Starcomms said today in an e-mailed statement.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160
million people, has one of Africa’s fastest-growing
telecommunication industries, with about 102 million mobile-
phone subscribers, according to industry regulator  Nigeria
Communications Commission . The Code Division Multiple Access, or
CDMA, networks have about 3.5 million customers, or a 3.4
percent share of the country’s mobile-phone subscribers.  Starcomms has recently faced “severe operational and
financial challenges” because of “the shifting competitive
landscape in Nigeria’s telecommunication industry,” the company
said in the statement.  Starcoms will get assets including a license operated by
1st Communications Ltd. and the CDMA mobile business of Multi-
Links Telecommunications Ltd., according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
