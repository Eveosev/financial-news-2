Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest oil
company, has for the first time written down the value of its
U.S. shale assets.  The explorer’s depreciation on Barnett shale holdings
amounted to 700 million euros ($911 million) after taxes in the
third quarter, according to Total’s spokesman Charles-Etienne
Lebatard.  Total recognized a charge of 800 million euros of “special
items” in financial results published today. The items were
mostly from U.S. shale assets and a one-off 4 percent tax on
crude and refined oil product inventories imposed by French
President Francois Hollande as part of a 2012 austerity budget.  The impairment follows a combined $3 billion of write downs
from BG Group Plc and Encana Corp. on the value of their gas
properties in North America. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
largest mining company, also booked one-time charges of $2.84
billion on the value of U.S. shale gas assets in August after
prices fell. Energy companies have had to adjust to price
declines since a glut in supplies from booming shale production
lowered futures.  Last month, the French company signed a 20-year deal to buy
liquefied natural gas from Korea Gas Corp. from the Sabine Pass
Terminal in Louisiana as a way to enter the emerging LNG export
market in the U.S.  Total has a venture with Chesapeake Energy Corp. to produce
natural gas in the U.S. both in the Barnett Shale in  Texas  and
the liquids-rich Utica shale play in  Ohio .  Total reported today a 20 percent rise in third-quarter
profit, beating analyst estimates as earnings from refining
improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
