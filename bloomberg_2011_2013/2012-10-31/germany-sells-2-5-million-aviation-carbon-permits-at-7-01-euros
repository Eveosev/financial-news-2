Germany  sold 2.5 million European
Union spot aviation carbon permits at a 9.9 percent discount to
yesterday’s settlement price for December futures, as trading
volume on secondary markets is scarce.  Germany sold at 7.01 euros ($9.12) a metric ton in an
auction today on the European Energy Exchange AG, according to
the bourse’s  website . That’s compared with a closing price for
the December contract of 7.78 euros a ton yesterday on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . Spot standard carbon permits
traded at 8.18 euros at 8:59 a.m. in London, an hour before the
auction closed.  ICE has handled 141,000 tons of December aviation
allowances since it first offered the contract in February. It
handled 13.4 million tons of standard December EU allowances
yesterday alone.  Germany is auctioning as many as 5 million tons of spot
aviation permits in two sales as part of its allocation of
allowances in 2012. The EU’s emissions trading system is in its
second phase, which runs from 2008 to the end of this year.
Airlines joined the bloc’s carbon market in 2012. The EU will
also sell at least 11.4 million aviation permits in five
auctions on EEX starting Nov. 21.  Germany’s sale attracted bids for 1.8 times the volume, EEX
said. There were six bidders in the auction, it said.  EEX, based in Leipzig, has also sold Phase 2 permits on
behalf of Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and
 Lithuania , and is selling Phase 3 allowances for prompt delivery
on behalf of Germany and 25 EU member states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
