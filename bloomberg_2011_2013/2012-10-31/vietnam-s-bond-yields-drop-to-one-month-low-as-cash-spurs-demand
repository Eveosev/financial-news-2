Vietnam ’s bonds gained for a fifth
day, pushing the five-year yield to the lowest level in more
than a month, on speculation banks have more cash to investment
in debt. The dong was steady.  Fund supply in the banking system has “improved” after
lenders bought 60 metric tons of gold from the public since May
and converted those into cash, the central bank’s Governor
Nguyen Van Binh told lawmakers at National Assembly’s meeting in
Hanoi today.  The  yield  on the benchmark five-year notes fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.13 percent in Hanoi, the
lowest level since Sept. 26, according to a daily fixing from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields that are higher than a 9 percent deposit-rate limit
at banks and increasing cash at lenders will spur demand for
government debt, Nguyen Thanh Khiem, a Hanoi-based bond analyst
at BaoViet Securities Co., wrote in a research note.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
