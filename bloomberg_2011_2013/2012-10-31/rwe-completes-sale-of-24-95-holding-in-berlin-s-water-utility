RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-biggest
utility, completed the sale of its 24.95 percent holding in
Berlinwasser to the state of Berlin to finalize its withdrawal
from Berlin’s water business.  The sale after two years of negotiations is valued at 658
million euros ($856 million), Essen-based RWE said in a
statement. The Berlin state parliament, cartel authorities and
RWE’s supervisory board approved the divestment.  “The sale of our shareholding in Berlinwasser is an
important step in the implementation of RWE’s measures to
reinforce our capital base and to create further financial
headroom for RWE,” board member Leonhard Birnbaum said.  The French water utility  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  in August
lost an appeal to block RWE from selling its share of the
companies’ joint stake in Berlinwasser, which they acquired in
1999. Veolia still holds 24.95 percent of the 150-year-old water
supplier. With the RWE sale, the state of Berlin now holds the
remainder of Germany’s largest water company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
