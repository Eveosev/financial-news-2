European Union governments abandoned
plans for a Nov. 13 deal on overhauling the bloc’s financial
market rules amid a clash over boosting competition between
clearinghouses.  Cyprus, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, took
the draft law off the agenda for a meeting of finance ministers
next month, according to an EU official, who can’t be identified
because the talks are private. The decision follows a meeting
yesterday between diplomats from the EU’s 27 national
governments.  Michel Barnier, the EU’s financial services chief, has
called for an overhaul of the bloc’s market rules. The
proposals, known as Mifid, would rein in speculation with
commodity derivatives, toughen oversight of high-frequency
trading and boost competition by forcing exchanges to hand over
trade data to rival clearinghouses.  The data-access rules are supported by the U.K. government,
which says they will boost competition and reduce costs for
investors. Germany and France have resisted the move, arguing
that it would fragment markets and harm financial stability.  Nations are also yet to  resolve splits  over what exemptions
should apply to pre-trade market transparency rules, according
to documents on the  EU’s website . They are also divided over
rules for companies running new trading platforms, known as
organized trading facilities or OTFs.  A spokesman for the Cypriot presidency declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
