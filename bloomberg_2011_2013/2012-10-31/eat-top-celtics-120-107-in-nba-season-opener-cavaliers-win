Dwyane Wade  had 29 points and LeBron James added 26 as the defending champion  Miami Heat  beat the
Boston Celtics 120-107 on the opening night of the National
Basketball Association season.  Elsewhere last night, the Dallas Mavericks won 99-91 at the
 Los Angeles Lakers , while the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the
Washington Wizards 94-84.  The Heat are favored to win back-to-back NBA titles, with a
successful $100 bet returning $225, according to Pregame.com.
The Lakers are second followed by the Oklahoma City Thunder,
last season’s runner-up. A winning $100 bet on the  New York 
Knicks would return $4,000 or $5,000 for the Brooklyn Nets.  The Nets open their season tomorrow with the first NBA
regular-season game at the Barclays Center against the Knicks.  Miami’s Wade hit 10 of 22 field-goal attempts and added 9-
of-11 from the free-throw line for the Heat at AmericanAirlines
Arena in Miami. James, who left the game with leg cramps during
the fourth quarter, had 10 rebounds while  Chris Bosh  had 10
points and 10 rebounds.  Ray Allen , who played five seasons with
the Celtics before moving to Miami, added 19 points.  “I had a bevy of emotions,” said Allen, who was meeting
his former team for the first time as a member of the Heat.
“Coming out here was even tougher than I expected but I
adjusted.”  The Heat had a 62-54 halftime advantage before the Celtics,
down by as many as 19 points at the start of the fourth quarter,
battled back to within four points at 111-107 with two minutes,
9 seconds remaining in the game.  No Dirk  At Staples Center in Los Angeles, Darren Collison scored 17
points and Brandon Wright added 14 for the Mavericks, who will
be without Dirk Nowitzki for six weeks after he had knee surgery
Oct. 20.  Pau Gasol led the Lakers with 23 points and 13 rebounds,
while  Kobe Bryant  had 22 points and  Dwight Howard  added 19
points and 10 rebounds before fouling out in his debut for Los
Angeles.  The Mavericks bench out-scored the Lakers substitutes by 37
points to 17, while Dallas made 78 percent of its free-throw
attempts, compared with 39 percent for Los Angeles.  At Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Kyrie Irving scored 29
points and Anderson Varejao had a career-high 23 rebounds for
the Cavaliers. Rookie Dion Waiters added 17 points.  Reserve Jordan Crawford scored 11 points for the Wizards,
who were playing without point guard  John Wall , power forward
Nene and forward Kevin Seraphin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
