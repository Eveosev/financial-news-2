Zambia signed a $150 million bulk
water supply project with  China  Civil Engineering Construction
to help boost potable supplies to homes and commercial areas in
Lusaka, the Times of Zambia said, citing the government.  The pact signed yesterday would involve the construction of
a new bulk water supply line from Kafue to Lusaka as well as
upgrading the distribution system in Lusaka and neighboring
areas to expand supplies over a two-year period, the paper said.
The project compliments the Lusaka water supply program funded
by the U.S. government through its Millennium Challenge Corp.
thatâ€™s more than twice as large, local government and housing
secretary Bernard Namachila told the Times.  The government obtained a loan from Exim Bank of China for
the Kafue project, the paper cited the permanent secretary as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
