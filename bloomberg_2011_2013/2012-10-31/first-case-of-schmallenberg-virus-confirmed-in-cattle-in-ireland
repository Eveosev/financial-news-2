Schmallenberg virus was confirmed in
a bovine fetus in County Cork, the first time the disease has
been identified in Ireland, the Agriculture Ministry said.  The virus is not a danger to humans or food safety, the
Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said in a
 statement  on its website dated yesterday. The disease can cause
stillbirths or malformed young when infected animals give birth.
Ireland has been carrying out surveillance measures for the
virus since February.  More than 6,000 outbreaks of the disease have been found to
date in 10 countries across  Europe , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
