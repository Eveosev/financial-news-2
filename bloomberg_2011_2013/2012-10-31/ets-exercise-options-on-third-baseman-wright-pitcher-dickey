The  New York  Mets exercised 2013
contract options on third baseman  David Wright  and pitcher R.A. Dickey, MLB.com reported, citing a person familiar with the
transactions.  Wright will earn $16 million next season and Dickey will
get $5 million, the website said. Last month General Manager
 Sandy Alderson  said he wanted both players signed to long-term
extensions with the Major League Baseball club.  Wright could be the recipient of a seven or eight-year
contract valued at $150 million, MLB.com said. Dickey may sign a
three-year deal worth $40 million.  Wright, 29, hit .306 with 21 home runs and 93 runs batted
last season while breaking the franchise record for hits. He
signed a six-year $55 million contract extension in 2006.  Dickey, 38, was 20-6 last season with a 2.73 earned run
average and 230 strikeouts. Dickey, the first Mets pitcher in 22
seasons to reach 20 wins, had signed a two-year, $7.8 million
contract extension that included his $5 million option for next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
