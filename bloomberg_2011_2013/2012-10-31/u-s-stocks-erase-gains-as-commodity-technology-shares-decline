U.S. stocks erased gains as
commodity shares slipped and technology companies were dragged
down by a decline in Apple Inc.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,411.77 at 10:53 a.m. New York time, after rising as much as
0.5 percent earlier.  Stocks rose earlier as equity markets in the world’s
largest economy reopened after  Hurricane Sandy  caused the
longest weather-related shutdown since 1888.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
