Taiwan’s dollar advanced for a third
month as official data showed the island’s economy rebounded in
the third quarter. Government bonds rose.  Gross domestic product  increased 1.02 percent from a year
earlier, following a 0.18 percent decline in the three months
through June, the statistics bureau said today. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was for 1.5
percent growth.  South Korea  reported industrial production
increased in September for the first time in four months,
boosted by stronger sales of cars and electronics, buoying
sentiment toward Taiwan that produces similar goods.  “Taiwan’s economy is starting to recover, and
fundamentally it creates appreciation pressure,” said  Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong .
“Still, the currency will have limited room for gains as Taiwan
needs to maintain export competitiveness.”  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.3 percent this month and 0.1 percent
today to NT$29.260 against its U.S. counterpart, data from
Taipei Forex Inc. showed. It touched NT$29.142 on Oct. 17, the
strongest level since May 2. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined
21 basis points to 3.5 percent this month and was little changed
today.  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.4 percent to
NT$29.165 per dollar in October, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They were little changed today.  Government bonds  rallied this month. The yield on the 1.125
percent notes due September 2022 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.127 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. It dropped one basis point today and is just
0.2 basis points shy of matching a record low of 1.125 percent
for  benchmark 10-year  rates reached on July 26.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent today, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
