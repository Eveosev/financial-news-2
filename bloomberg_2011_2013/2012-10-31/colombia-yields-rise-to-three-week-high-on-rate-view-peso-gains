Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose to
a three-week high as investors pared bets on further interest
rate cuts this year.  The yield on the 10 percent peso-denominated bonds due in
July 2024 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 6.17 percent, according to the central bank. That is the
highest level on a closing basis since Oct. 4. The bond’s price
fell 0.115 centavo to 131.218 centavos per peso.  The central bank held the target lending  rate  at 4.75
percent on Oct. 26, citing eased risk of a global economic slump
and the expanding Colombian economy amid growing domestic
demand. While 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected the
rate to remain unchanged, seven projected a reduction of a
quarter-percentage point. Policy makers have cut the target rate
twice since June from 5.25 percent.  “The tone of the central bank’s statement is optimistic,
lowering the chances of another cut this year,” said William Florez, an analyst at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage in Bogota.  The peso fell for a ninth day, slipping 0.1 percent to
1,832.15 per  U.S. dollar . The currency fell 1.7 percent in
October, paring its rally this year to 5.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
