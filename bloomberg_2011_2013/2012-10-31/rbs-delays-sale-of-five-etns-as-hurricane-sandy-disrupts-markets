Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  has
delayed selling five exchange-traded notes until next month
after  Hurricane Sandy  disrupted financial markets.  Britain’s biggest government-owned lender was scheduled to
begin selling ETNs tied to commodities, agriculture, energy,
precious metals and industrial metals on Oct. 30, according to
an e-mailed announcement last week from NYSE Arca Inc., the
electronic platform of NYSE Euronext. The bank has not publicly
announced a date for when the ETNs will trade.  “Due the storm, we’ve rescheduled the launch/listing
date,” Ed Canaday, a spokesman for RBS, said in an e-mail. The
ETNs were delayed because today is the beginning of the bank’s
so-called quiet period before releasing its third-quarter
earnings on Nov. 2, he said.  The bank issued two other ETNs this year. The RBS U.S.
Large Cap Alternator notes started selling on Sept. 6, and the
China Trendpilot ETN began selling on April 19.  The five ETNs that are delayed are the RBS Rogers Enhanced
Commodity, the RBS Rogers Enhanced Agriculture, the RBS Rogers
Enhanced Energy, the RBS Rogers Enhanced Precious Metals, and
the RBS Rogers Enhanced Industrial Metals notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
