The  Czech Republic ’s manufacturing
performance worsened for a seventh month in October to the
weakest in more than three years as  export  orders declined, an
industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI fell to 47.2, the
lowest reading since August 2009, from 48 in September, the bank
said today in an e-mailed report compiled by Markit, a
financial-information company. A result greater than 50 signals
an improvement in performance, while a figure below signals
deterioration.  “The main drag in the October survey came from new orders
and new exports orders,”  Agata Urbanska , a London-based
economist at HSBC, said in the statement. “The German October
PMI surprised on the downside, so did the ifo index; both
highlighting more downside risks to manufacturing and export
orders in the Czech Republic in the last quarter of the year.”  The economy relies on demand for cars, auto parts and
electronics goods from the European Union, the market for about
80 percent of its exports. The government wants to push through
a package of measures including tax increases that the central
bank forecasts will further depress domestic demand next year.  The central bank in  Prague  cut the  benchmark   interest rate 
to a record-low 0.25 percent on Sept. 27 as weakening domestic
demand pushed the economy into its second recession in three
years. Gross domestic product contracted for three quarters
through June as households cut spending in response to a
worsening economic outlook across  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
