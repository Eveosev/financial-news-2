The ruble strengthened as crude oil,
 Russia ’s main export earner, rose for a second day.  The currency advanced less than 0.1 percent to 31.34 per
dollar, paring the monthly loss to 0.5 percent by the close in
Moscow. The currency weakened less than 0.1 percent to 40.6500
versus the euro and 35.5295 against the central bank’s euro-
dollar basket.  Oil gained 1.4 percent to $86.9 a barrel in  New York , while
Urals, Russia’s main export blend, added 0.3 percent to $108.32,
climbing for a second day. Crude and natural gas account for
about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue.  Home prices  in the
U.S. rose this year through August by the most in two years, a
report showed yesterday.  “Oil is a piece of the broader picture, which is
supportive,” Vladimir Osakovskiy, the chief economist for Bank
of America Merrill Lynch in Moscow, said by e-mail.  The ruble has depreciated 7.5 percent from this year’s peak
of 28.9925 per dollar reached on March 26 when oil traded $2.74
from a high of $109.77 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Russia’s currency lost 1.8 percent last week, the biggest
five-day decline since June.  Bank Rossii is due to review  interest rates  in the first
ten days of November. The central bank is likely to leave the
 refinancing rate  on hold at 8.25 percent, according to a median
estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8105 per
dollar in three months, compared with 31.8255 per dollar
yesterday. Bank of America estimates the ruble at 34.3 versus
the basket by year-end, according to Osakovskiy.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 188, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index of five-year
government bond yields lost one basis point to 7.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
