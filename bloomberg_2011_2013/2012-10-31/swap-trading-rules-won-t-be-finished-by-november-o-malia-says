Swap-trading rules governing firms
such as  CME Group Inc. (CME)  and  ICAP Plc (IAP)  won’t be completed by mid-
November at the main U.S. derivatives regulator, according to
Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner  Scott O’Malia .  The CFTC plans to first finish separate rules to ensure
interest-rate and credit swaps are backed by clearinghouses that
collect collateral from buyers and sellers, O’Malia said today
at a Futures Industry Association conference in  Chicago .  “I don’t think we are going to be able to get through
this” by the CFTC meeting set for Nov. 15, because “there is a
lot to be negotiated,” he said. “That’s way too soon.”  The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission are
required by the Dodd-Frank Act to increase transparency in the
swaps market after unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008
credit crisis. The law calls for measures requiring trades to be
executed on exchanges or so-called swap-execution facilities.  Firms that have said they want to create swap execution
facilities include inter-dealer brokers, Phoenix Partners Group
LP, Javelin Capital Markets LLC, Tradeweb LLC and Bloomberg LP,
the parent company of  Bloomberg News .  The CFTC has other rulemakings to complete in November and
December, O’Malia said, and swap-dealers are expected to
register by the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
