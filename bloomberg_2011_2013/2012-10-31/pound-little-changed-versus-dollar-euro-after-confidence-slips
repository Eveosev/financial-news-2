The pound strengthened for a second
day against the dollar amid speculation the Bank of England will
refrain from adding monetary stimulus to the economy when policy
makers meet next week.  Sterling gained versus 15 of its 16 major peers after the
Swiss National Bank said it boosted the amount of pounds in its
foreign-exchange reserves. The U.K. central bank will announce
on Nov. 8 whether it will raise its asset-purchase  target  from
375 billion pounds ($604 billion) after data last week showed
gross domestic product grew 1 percent last quarter as the
economy emerged from a recession. U.K. 10-year gilts dropped for
a second day.  “There are expectations for monetary policy to be less
loose and that does support sterling,” said Raghav Subbarao, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Barclays Plc in London. “The
U.K. GDP last week indicated the underlying trend is much
stronger.” The SNB’s decision to increase its holdings was a
“slight surprise,” he said.  The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.6113 at 4:22 p.m. London
time after appreciating 0.3 percent yesterday. Sterling rose for
the first time in four days against the euro, gaining 0.2
percent to 80.45 pence after dropping 0.5 percent over the
previous three days.  Barclays predicts that sterling will strengthen to $1.65 by
year-end, Subbarao said.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0
to keep its bond-purchase target unchanged at its Oct. 3-4
meeting, according to the minutes released on Oct. 17. Some
members “questioned the magnitude of the impact that lower
long-term yields on corporate debt and equity would have on the
broader economy,” the minutes showed.  Swiss Holdings  Switzerland’s central bank increased the allocation of
pounds in its foreign-exchange holdings to 7 percent in the
third quarter from 3 percent at the end of June, it said today
in a statement. It reduced its holdings of euros to 48 percent
from 60 percent.  The pound advanced even after GfK NOP Ltd. said its index
of U.K. consumer sentiment declined in September. The gauge
dropped to minus 30 from minus 28 in September, the London-based
company said in an e-mailed report. A survey tomorrow will show
U.K. manufacturing shrank in October, according to the median of
27 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Sterling is little changed over the past month, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The currency has fallen 0.3 percent
in October against the dollar and declined 1.1 percent versus
the 17-nation euro.  The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.85 percent, having climbed 13 basis
points this month. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022
fell 0.245, or 2.45 pounds pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to
99.065.  Gilts returned 2.8 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
