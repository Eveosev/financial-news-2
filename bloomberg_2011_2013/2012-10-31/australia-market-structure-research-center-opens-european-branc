The  Capital Markets Cooperative
Research Centre , an Australian company that publishes academic
research on market structure, dark pools and high frequency
trading, created a European equivalent this week, according to a
statement.  The University of Chieti-Pescara, University of Naples
Federico II, University of Teramo, Cass Business School,
University of Southampton, University of Liverpool and VUZF
University are among the European institutions that have
committed to the new venture, according to the statement. The
opening is planned for January 2013, according to the statement.  “The center will facilitate research into many important
issues currently faced by European financial markets including
the impact of market fragmentation, high frequency trading and
dark pools,” Alex Frino, chief executive officer of the CMCRC,
said in the statement.  The Sydney-based center was founded in 2001 and is backed
by the Australian federal government and New South Wales
government, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
