Poland ’s five-year bond yields fell
after a report showed manufacturing contracted for a seventh
month, bolstering the case for a cut in  interest rates  at a
monetary policy meeting next week.  The rate on notes due in April 2017 fell five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.08 percent as of 5:26 p.m. in
Warsaw, snapping two days of gains. The zloty weakened 0.1
percent to 4.1351 per euro, extending this month’s loss to 0.5
percent.  The five-year bonds are heading for a fifth month of gains
as mounting evidence of an economic slowdown increases the
probability of a cut in borrowing costs. The Purchasing
Managers’ Index for Poland, a gauge of manufacturing
performance, stayed below the level indicating expansion while
rising to 47.3 percent in October.  “The data is rather negative,”  Adam Antoniak , a senior
economist at  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  in Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients today. “It adds to an overall picture of economic
slowdown in Poland and give another reason for rate cuts.”  The report is the last piece of macroeconomic data released
before the central bank’s rate-setting meeting on Nov. 7. Policy
makers will trim borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 4.5
percent, according to a median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
20 economists.  A cut in interest rates now would be a “natural”
consequence of the slowdown, Governor Marek Belka was reported
as saying in  Gazeta Wyborcza  on Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
