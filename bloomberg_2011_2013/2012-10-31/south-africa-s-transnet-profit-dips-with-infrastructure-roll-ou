Transnet SOC Ltd., the state-owned
South African ports and rail operator, said after-tax profit for
the six months through September fell as a 650 billion-rand ($75
billion) infrastructure roll-out pushed up borrowing costs.  Profit fell 25 percent to 1.8 billion rand, Chief Executive
Officer Brian Molefe told reporters in Johannesburg today.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
rose 7.1 percent 10.1 billion rand, he said.  President  Jacob Zuma  is banking on greater power and
transport capacity to boost exports and create jobs. As part of
that infrastructure plan, Transnet plans to spend 300 billion
rand to develop railways and ports in  Africa ’s biggest economy
over the next seven years.  Transnet in July issued a 10-year $1 billion bond, its
biggest single issuance. The Johannesburg-based company boosted
capital expenditure by 35 percent to 12.8 billion rand in the
six-month period, Molefe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
