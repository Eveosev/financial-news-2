Cameron International Corp. (CAM) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of oilfield equipment, fell after
forecasting profits that fell short of expectations.  Cameron fell 1.2 percent to $50.64 at the close in New
York. Earlier the shares fell as much as 7.1 percent, the
 biggest  intraday decline since June 21.  The company expects to report adjusted fourth-quarter
earnings of 95 cents to 97 cents a share, according to a
statement today. Analysts were expecting $1.08 a share, the
average of 27 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company said
its operating profit margin next year will be from 17 percent to
18 percent.  Analysts’ expectations for next year are about 10 percent
too high, said James Wicklund, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG in Dallas, who rates the shares a buy and owns none.  Cameron is “taking the hit they deserve,” Wicklund said
today in a telephone interview.  National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV)  is the biggest supplier of
oilfield equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
