Ethanol futures in Chicago capped
the longest streak of gains in more than three weeks on supply
reductions.  Futures climbed a day after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-
biggest U.S. ethanol producer, said on an earnings conference
call that it idled plants in Albion,  Nebraska , and Linden,
 Indiana , because of poor margins and is operating three of its
mills at reduced rates. U.S.  production  of the biofuel is down
17 percent this year, the Energy Department said Oct. 24. The
agency will publish weekly output figures tomorrow.  “As for a specific trigger, the earnings calls probably
spooked people yesterday,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn
Group in Chicago. “People are looking for a draw tomorrow.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 2.3 cents, or
1 percent, to $2.436 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since Oct. 11. Futures gained 3.9 percent in
October and have advanced 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York
at $2.47 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.395 and on the U.S. Gulf and
West coasts at $2.46, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Corn for December delivery gained 14 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $7.5575 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 33 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Distillery Operations  Green Plains Renewable Energy Inc. (GPRE) , the fourth-largest U.S.
ethanol producer, said today that it plans to operate its
distilleries at about 92 percent or 93 percent of capacity
during the fourth quarter.  Gasoline for November delivery increased 3.3 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.7618 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations. The November futures expired at
the close of floor trading today. The more-active December
contract increased 1.48 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.6303.  Ethanol’s  discount  to the motor fuel narrowed to 32.58
cents from 31.58 cents yesterday. Gasoline traded at a premium
of 99.8 cents to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
