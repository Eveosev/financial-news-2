Cyprus will negotiate the sale of
oil and gas licenses for four blocks in its exclusive economic
zone, which will be concluded in 2013, Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Neoklis Sylikiotis said.  The government decided to start talks with a group
consisting of Italy’s  Eni SpA (ENI)  and South Korea’s  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) 
on blocks 2 and 3, another group including  France ’s Total SA
Russia’s  Novatek OAO (NVTK)  and GPB Global Resources for block 9, as
well as France’s Total on block 11, Sylikiotis said yesterday,
according to an emailed statement.  “The reason we decided to go ahead with these four blocks
is because we above all create economies of scale, given the
synergies that will emerge, as they are near block 12 in which
hydrocarbons were already discovered,” Sylikiotis said. “The
evaluation of the other blocks continues.”  U.S. explorer  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  said in December it found
as much as 8 trillion cubic feet of gas off the southern Cyprus
coast. Sylikiotis said Aug. 22 that Cyprus, the fifth euro area
member to request an international bailout, could receive as
much as 300 million euros ($390 million) in signature bonuses
from bids to explore for natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
