Corporate bond sales surged to $3.3
trillion this year, challenging the record in 2009, as investors
sought higher-yielding alternatives to  government securities  and
companies took advantage of borrowing costs at all-time lows.  General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest maker of power-generation
equipment, led issuers this month with a $7 billion bond
offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Along with
software provider  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s $5 billion sale, they paced
$347 billion of bond issuance in October, a record for the
month, and left sales about $116 billion shy of the $3.4
trillion reached by this time three years ago.  Policy makers from the U.S. to Europe and Asia reacted to
the deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression by
pumping unprecedented amounts of money into the global economy
and suppressing  interest rates  at record lows. That’s pushed
yields on the safest government debt close to or below zero
percent, prompting money managers to take refuge in company debt
as default rates run below their historical average.  “There’s a lot of money out there looking for a home,”
said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London, who recommends investors avoid corporate debt from euro-
region countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. “ Government
bonds  give you almost nothing, so you’re left with corporate
bonds, which give you a little bit more than nothing.”  Investor Demand  Yields on bonds sold by companies around the world fell to
a record 2.676 percent on Oct. 15 from 3.981 percent at the end
of last year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
Global Broad Market Corporate index.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association recommended that trading of fixed-
income securities in the U.S. resume today as Wall Street
recovers from  Hurricane Sandy . A benchmark gauge of U.S.
corporate credit risk declined for the first time in three
trading sessions.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, fell 1.7
basis points to a mid-price of 99.1 basis points at 11:36 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Europe Swaps  In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index tied to 125
companies with investment-grade ratings was little changed at
128.4 basis points, holding at about a one-week low.  Credit-default swaps typically fall as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of debt.  U.S. bond markets opened after being closed since noon Oct.
29 in New York as the so-called superstorm flooded the city’s
subways, cut power to millions of East Coast households and
businesses and paralyzed  Wall Street .  Volume of 971 trades of $1 million or more as of 11:38 a.m.
in New York compares with a daily average of 4,319 during the
three months before the storm, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Sales of corporate bonds through yesterday were 18 percent
higher this year than in the same period a year ago and
increased 19 percent from 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Companies around the world sold $3.9 trillion of debt in all of
2009, the most ever.  Pacing Gains  Borrowers in the U.S. are pacing this year’s jump in deals,
with sales rising 25 percent from the first 10 months of 2011,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. They have also raised 12
percent more than in 2009.  Both U.S. investment-grade and junk-rated companies have
increased bond sales this year, with issuance rising 22 percent
to $918.8 billion and 35 percent to $292.5 billion,
respectively.  “Companies have been very proactive in making sure they
refinance their maturities in good time,” said  Alberto Gallo , a
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London.  Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE sold $7 billion of bonds on
Oct. 1 with maturities from 2015 to 2042. The extra yield
investors demand to own its $3 billion of 2.7 percent notes due
2022 has narrowed to 92 basis points from 110 basis points at
issuance, according to Trace.  Oracle Bonds  Oracle issued bonds due in 2017 and 2022 on Oct. 18 in its
first offerings in more than two years. Spreads on its $2.5
billion of notes due in 2022 narrowed to 64 basis points from 68
when sold, Trace data show.  The largest supplier of  database software , based in Redwood
City,  California , has $2.75 billion of bonds maturing in the
next two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Investment-grade corporate debt has returned about 10
percent this year, while  junk bonds  gained 15.4 percent
including reinvested interest, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  European bonds are beating those from U.S. issuers.
European investment-grade debt returned 11 percent and junk debt
22 percent. That exceeds the 10.3 percent and 13 percent returns
in the U.S., the index data show.  Few Alternatives  While the euro-region sovereign crisis continues to damp
growth and the U.S. faces a so-called fiscal cliff of spending
cuts and tax rises, investors are reassured by the relatively
low defaults on corporate debt. The global speculative-grade
default rate of 3 percent at the end of the third quarter is
lower than the 4.8 percent historical average since 1983,
Moody’s Investors Service said in a report on Oct. 8.  Unprecedented low interest rates around the world have left
fixed-income investors with fewer alternatives as they search
for higher returns. The  Federal Reserve  has held its benchmark
rate close to zero percent for four years and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month he expects no change in this policy
through mid-2015.  The  European Central Bank  in  Frankfurt  cut its main
 refinancing rate  to a record-low 0.75 percent in July, after
starting to lower borrowing costs at the end of 2008.  That’s pushed yields on some of the safest government bonds
below zero, while U.S. notes have hovered above this level.  U.S. two-year  Treasury rates dropped to 0.143 percent in
September 2011, hovered above 0.2 percent for much of this year
and are now 0.289 percent. The yield on  Germany’s two-year  note
fell to a record of minus 0.097 percent on Aug. 2, and has since
risen to 0.04 percent, while the Netherlands’ bond of that
maturity fell to minus 0.035 percent on the same day, before
recovering to 0.067 percent.  Way to Go  Issuance of corporate debt still has a way to go to match
2009’s level as a number of borrowers who raised money in that
record year stay out of the market. Borrowers including New
York-based oil company  Hess Corp. (HES)  and Grupo Petrotemex SA de CV
in Monterrey, Mexico, which issued three years ago and haven’t
so far in 2012, will have to add another $640 billion of debt by
year-end to match the total $3.93 trillion sold in all of 2009,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We expect another 10 billion euros in new corporate bond
issuance for the remainder of 2012,” said  Suki Mann , head of
credit strategy at Societe Generale SA in London. “Total bond
issuance at the end of this year will not be anywhere near 2009
levels, but it’s an excellent year nevertheless.”  Companies from the Asia-Pacific region have already sold a
record amount of debt this year, raising $843 billion from bond
sales, 12 percent more than for all of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (600000)  and
China Minsheng Banking Corp. Ltd. are among the biggest issuers.  “We are certainly getting close to 2009 issuance levels
with recent good momentum in the primary market,” said Simon Ballard, senior credit strategist at National Australia Bank
Ltd. in London. “We have companies opportunistically tapping
the credit markets at levels that have not been available to
them for a long time, if at all.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
