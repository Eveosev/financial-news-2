Royal KPN NV (KPN) , the largest Dutch
phone operator, has agreed to sell part of its Dutch mobile
towers to  Indonesia ’s Protelindo as the company is looking to
strengthen its balance sheet.  Protelindo, an operator of towers for wireless
communications, will pay 75 million euros ($97 million) for the
towers which will result in a one-time gain for the Dutch
company of 66 million euros, The Hague-based KPN said in a
statement today. KPN already disposed of mobile towers from 2008
to 2012, and after such sales it leases back the space it needs
for  network equipment , the company said.  “KPN does not consider the exploitation of a large part of
its Dutch mobile towers to be a core business,” KPN said.  Declining earnings caused KPN to miss its target range on
its net debt-to-Ebitda ratio in the third quarter, which rose to
2.7. The company is likely to be one of the parties taking part
in the Dutch mobile spectrum auction, starting today, according
to analysts.  To raise cash, KPN has tried to sell Belgian mobile-phone
unit Base after it ended discussions on a potential merger
involving the E-Plus wireless unit in  Germany . The non-binding
offers it received for Base were unsatisfactory, KPN said in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
