The fiscal austerity programs that
are being implemented across  Europe  are self-defeating and will
lead to higher debt by next year, a research group said.  Government debt as a share of gross domestic product will
increase by an average of 5 percentage points as a result of
budget squeezes across the continent, the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research said today. Britain and every euro-
area country except Ireland will see debt ratios rise, it said.  “In current circumstances, fiscal consolidation is
indeed likely to be self-defeating,” the London-based group
said in a statement. “As a result of the fiscal consolidation
plans currently in train, debt ratios will be higher in 2013
rather than lower.”  The research follows a warning from the  International
Monetary Fund  earlier this month that budget consolidation
programs may cause a bigger-than-anticipated drag on economic
growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
