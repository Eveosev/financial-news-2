The  French Senate  may reject
President  Francois Hollande ’s 2013 budget law, which will be
voted this month, according to Alain Vidalies, the Socialist
Party minister in charge of Parliamentary Affairs.  “We don’t have a majority in the senate,” the  minister 
told reporters in Paris today after the weekly cabinet meeting.
“We must seek a majority each time we vote and we will have to
build that majority for the budget law.”  While the president’s Socialist Party has an absolute
majority in the National Assembly, the lower chamber of
parliament, it doesn’t have one in the Senate. The budget law
was successfully voted in the National Assembly on Oct. 23. A
final vote is expected in December.  Socialists have 127 of the Senate’s 347 seats. Former
President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s Union for a Majority party (UMP)
holds 131 seats.  Together with the Greens, Communists and Left Union
parties, Hollande’s government has 159 seats while the
opposition with its affiliates has 163. The 25 remaining
senators are from minority groups who may or may not support the
government. None of the parties affiliated with the Socialists
has indicated how they might vote.  A proposed energy-savings law that would modify the way
power and gas rates are calculated was rejected yesterday with
the opposition UMP and the Communist Party lawmakers voting down
the government-backed bill.  To contact the reporters on this story:
