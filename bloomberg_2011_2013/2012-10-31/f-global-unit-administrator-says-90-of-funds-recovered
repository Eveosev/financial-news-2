Administrators of MF Global Holding
Ltd.’s U.K. subsidiary said that one year after the brokerage
firm collapsed they have recovered about 90 percent of funds
belonging to the unit’s clients and 75 percent of assets due
creditors.  About 570 million pounds ($920 million) has been recovered
from client accounts, while 900 million pounds was obtained for
creditors,  KPMG  LLP partner Mike Pink said yesterday at the
London Institute of Directors during an evening event organized
by MF Global’s U.K. clients.  “It’s been an incredibly stressful time” for MF Global’s
U.K. clients, U.K. lawmaker Mark Field said at the event. Field
told attendees that the British government and the Financial
Services Authority are considering rule changes to ensure
clients can get money back quickly in the event of insolvency.  KPMG has agreed to pay 26 cents on the dollar to clients
with protected accounts, and hasn’t yet made a distribution to
creditors. U.S. trustees of the holding company and its
affiliates have sued KPMG seeking assets of about $1 billion.  The accounting firm said it won’t be able to return more
until the legal disputes with MF Global’s U.S. entities are
resolved. If KPMG prevails, Pink said, it could potentially
return all of the money being claimed by the U.K. unit’s
creditors and clients, and still have money left over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
