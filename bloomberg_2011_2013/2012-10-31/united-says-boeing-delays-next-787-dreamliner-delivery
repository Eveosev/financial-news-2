United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
the first North American customer for  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s new 787
Dreamliner, said it picked up its second jet today after last
week’s unexpected delay in delivery.  “We will fly it around our domestic system over the next
few weeks on an ad hoc basis,” Christen David, a spokeswoman
for the Chicago-based carrier, said today in an e-mail.  United picked up its first 787 on Sept. 24 and was to have
received the second one in time to enter service along with the
first on Nov. 4. The airline said yesterday that Boeing informed
it of the setback on Oct. 26, with no new schedule in place, and
that the other three due this year could be delayed as well.  Boeing, based in  Chicago , said yesterday that “final
closeouts” on United’s 787s were taking a few days longer than
anticipated. The company announced the news of today’s delivery
in a post on Twitter Inc.’s website.  The 787 is the world’s first airliner made of composites
instead of aluminum, making it more fuel-efficient and able to
provide bigger windows and better  air quality  for passengers.
The jet was 3 1/2 years late when it entered service in 2011,
after Boeing struggled with the new materials and manufacturing
processes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
