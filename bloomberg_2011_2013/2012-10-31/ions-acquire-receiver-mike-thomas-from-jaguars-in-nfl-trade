The Jacksonville Jaguars sent wide
receiver Mike Thomas to the  Detroit Lions  for an undisclosed
draft pick after the  National Football League  extended its trade
deadline because of Hurricane Sandy.  Thomas, who led Jacksonville in catches the past two
seasons, was traded yesterday, the team said on its  website 
without disclosing terms of the deal. The Lions said on their
website that they don’t officially announce trades until the
players have passed physicals. The NFL extended its trade
deadline on Oct. 29 by two days, to tomorrow from yesterday.  Thomas, a fourth-round pick in the 2009 draft, has 13
catches for 80 yards this season, making him sixth in receptions
on the Jaguars (1-6). He has 171 catches for 1,768 yards and six
touchdowns in his career.  Thomas will help to fill the void created in the Lions’
lineup by the season-ending injury to Nate Burleson, who broke
his leg on Oct. 22. Detroit is 3-4, three games behind the
National Football Conference North Division-leading Chicago
Bears.  To contact the reporter on this story:
