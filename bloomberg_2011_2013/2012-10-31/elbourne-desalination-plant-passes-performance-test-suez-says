The  Melbourne  desalination plant
completed a performance test for the facility’s second water
treatment line,  Suez Environnement (SEV)  said.  With the second line now operational, the plant is
producing 300,000 cubic meters a day of drinking water for
Melbourne. Startup of the Victoria state facility will continue
with a third treatment line to reach the plant’s 450,000 cubic
meters a day capacity, the French utility said today.  Suez currently provides 30 percent of Australia’s drinking
water supply, the Paris-based company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
