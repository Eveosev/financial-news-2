percent.  Henderson Land Development Co. (12) , controlled by
billionaire Lee Shau-kee, rebounded 1.5 percent after falling to
an almost six-week low on a new city property tax.  Techtronic

they will keep monitoring whether the sector will see net-

bottom out and it will raise valuations for Chinese stocks.”  ICBC rose 1.2 percent to HK$5.09 after reporting third-
quarter net income of 62.4 billion  yuan  ($10 billion) that
