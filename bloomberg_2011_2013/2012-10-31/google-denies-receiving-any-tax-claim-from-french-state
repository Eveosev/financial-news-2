Google Inc. (GOOG)  said it didn’t receive a
tax claim from  France  after newspaper Le Canard Enchaine
reported that the country is seeking 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) in taxes from the world’s largest search engine.  “Google has not received any tax assessment from the
French tax administration,” the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. “We have and will continue to cooperate with
the authorities in France.”  French President  Francois Hollande  met with Google Chairman
 Eric Schmidt  this week to discuss creating jobs, investing and
paying more taxes in France. The Socialist president told
Schmidt that the development of digital economy calls for
changes in how companies are taxed, the Elysee said after the
session.  The meeting between Google and the French President,
planned months ago, came as local government looks for ways to
get Internet companies to pay more taxes on revenue earned in
France. Companies like Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.
would be subject to new taxes in advertisement, e-commerce and
video-on-demand revenue under a draft law that will be debated
in the French Senate on Jan. 31.  Internet giants collectively escape hundreds of millions of
euros in French value-added and corporate taxes because of
loopholes in European Union laws and the different tax rules in
the region’s countries, according to Philippe Marini, the bill’s
author and a senator and president of the Senate finance
committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
