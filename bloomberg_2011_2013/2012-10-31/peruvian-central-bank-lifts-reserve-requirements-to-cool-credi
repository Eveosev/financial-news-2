Peru ’s central bank increased
reserve requirements for the third time in three months to cool
credit demand.  The average ratio will rise by 0.75 percentage points for
bank deposits in soles and dollars effective tomorrow, the
central bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
average deposit ratio last month was 16.9 percent for soles and
38.9 percent for dollars, it said.  “The measure seeks to act preventively to slow the pace of
credit expansion in a context of high liquidity abroad and
exceptionally low interest rates in international markets,” the
central bank said in a statement.  The monetary authority increased the amount of reserves
banks must hold at the central bank by 0.5 percentage points in
May, September and October while maintaining its benchmark
interest rate steady at 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
