Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
South America’s largest power producer, expects to receive
“close to” 30 billion reais ($14.7 billion) in compensation
after the government changed concession rules.  “Tomorrow will be an important day because we’ll know how
much the compensation will be and we hope it’ll be close to the
book value of our assets,” Chief Executive Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho told reporters in Brasilia today. The book value
of the assets is 30 billion reais, he said.  Eletrobras, as the state-controlled company is known, is
waiting for the government to publish tomorrow terms of
concessions after President  Dilma Rousseff  announced in
September a package that aims to cut power prices by as much as
28 percent. Eletrobras is one of the three companies with most
assets facing concession renewals under the new terms.  Eletrobras rose 2.9 percent to 16.47 reais at 12:30 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo , heading for the biggest daily increase since Aug. 20.
The stock is down 39 percent this year.  The two other companies with most assets facing concession
renewals are  Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais , or Cemig, and  Cia
Energetica de Sao Paulo , or Cesp.
