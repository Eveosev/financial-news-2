CEZ AS, the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, relaxed its 2016 deadline for installing as many
as 3,000 megawatts of renewable energy sources.  The company has adopted “stricter criteria” for choosing
investments into wind, solar and hydroelectric projects in
 Romania , Poland and  Germany  and extended the deadline because of
changing regulations in the industry, Martin Pacovsky, the head
of CEZ’s foreign investments, said today in an interview after a
press conference in Prague.  CEZ still aims for a capacity of 3,000 megawatts, mostly in
windpower, Pacovsky said. The company is in advanced
negotiations to acquire more projects in Romania, where it’s
building a 600-megawatt wind farm, Europe’s largest.  “Romania is probably the most promising volume-wise, but
 Poland  is a bit more of a stable market,” Pacovsky said.
“Germany is of course the most stable, but the returns aren’t
so interesting. Still, we see interesting opportunities there.”  CEZ previously said it will stop developing renewable
energy sources by 2016 to focus fully on the financing of two
new blocks at its Temelin nuclear power station. The Temelin
project had been estimated to cost at least $10 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
