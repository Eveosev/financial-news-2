Trading in European Union carbon
permits rose to the second highest ever this month on ICE
Futures  Europe  in  London , as the bloc prepares for an
unprecedented program of sales.  October futures volumes so far across contracts advanced to
610 million tons, according to data from the exchange through
yesterday. The bourse needs to handle 45 million tons today to
break the June 2011 record of 654 million tons. Volume last
reached the level needed on Oct. 17, when 58.9 million tons
changed hands.  EU carbon for December advanced 0.9 percent to 8.22 euros
($10.69) a metric ton on ICE, as the European Commission in
Brussels plans to temporarily curb supply in the phase beginning
next year.  The European Energy Exchange AG said yesterday some nations
in the bloc including  Poland , the  Czech Republic  and the
Netherlands were not yet ready to sell allowances in a program
of auctions starting Nov. 13.  About 40 million of the 120 million tons of volume for sale
in the auctions this year is subject to nations being ready to
offload the allowances, the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
