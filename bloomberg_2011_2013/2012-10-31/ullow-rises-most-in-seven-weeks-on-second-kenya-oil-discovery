Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K. explorer
that unlocked billions of barrels from Uganda to  French Guiana ,
rose the most in seven weeks after finding oil in Kenya for the
second time this year.  Tullow  gained  as much as 3.6 percent, the most since Sept.
14, and traded at 1,430 pence as of 1:15 p.m local time.  Drilling is still taking place at the Twiga South-1
exploration well in onshore Kenya Block 13T, the London-based
company said today in a statement. Results are expected by mid-
November after target depth has been reached at the well that’s
co-owned by  Africa Oil Corp. (AOI)   Business Daily in Nairobi reported earlier that Tullow
found more than 30 meters (98 feet) of oil in block 13T, citing
people it didn’t identify, as the company has embarked on a
multiwell drilling campaign in  Kenya  and Ethiopia. Tullow
declined to comment on the potential size of the find.  The company made Kenya’s first oil discovery earlier this
year at its Ngamia well in the north of the country. Tullow’s
Chief Executive Officer Aidan Heavey said in May that Kenya’s
oil potential may be greater than neighboring Uganda, where the
company and its partners have found about 2.5 billion barrels of
resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
