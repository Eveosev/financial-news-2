The  U.S. Treasury  Department said it
hasn’t yet made a decision on whether to allow negative-rate
bidding in auctions of Treasury bills.  The Treasury told members of the Treasury Borrowing
Advisory Committee to study “operational issues” connected
with possible negative-rate bidding, according to minutes of a
conference call with members of the committee.  The Treasury said it was on schedule for its first auction
of floating-rate notes late next year. The conference call was
held instead of the usual dealer meeting because of  Hurricane
Sandy . The committee of bond dealers meets quarterly with the
Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
