Lithuania ’s Social Democrats, who
won this month’s election, plan to sign a coalition agreement as
soon as next week with a party the country’s president wants to
exclude from the government, the Baltic News Service news
service reported.  “We’re moving systematically toward our goal” of signing
the agreement on Nov. 6, Social Democrat leader Algirdas Butkevicius said after talks today with the Labor Party and
Order & Justice in Vilnius, the capital, according to BNS.  President Dalia Grybauskaite, who must approve a new prime
minister and Cabinet, said Oct. 29 she wouldn’t support any
coalition that included Labor, citing criminal cases against the
party and some of its leaders for election and accounting
violations. Labor leader Viktor Uspaskich told reporters the
same day that the charges were politically motivated.  The three parties invited the Lithuanian Polish Election
Action party to join its coalition talks, potentially increasing
their bloc to 86 seats from 78 in Lithuania’s 141-member
parliament, BNS reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
