Indian equities rebounded from a
six-week low on speculation policy makers will take steps to
stimulate economic growth.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.4 percent
to 18,498.60, the most since Oct. 22, according to preliminary
closing prices in Mumbai. The gauge lost 1.1 percent yesterday
after the central bank refrained from paring interest rates to
fight price pressures.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar
Land Rover, climbed the most in a month.  Housing Development
Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the top mortgage lender, gained for the first
time in four days.  While the  Reserve Bank of India  resisted Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram’s call for lowering funding costs to
back a recent government policy overhaul, the authority said
there’s a “reasonable likelihood” of monetary easing in the
first quarter of 2013 as inflation cools. The RBI cut lenders’
reserve ratio, injecting 175 billion rupees ($3.2 billion) into
the system to revive growth from the weakest level since 2009.  The central bank held the benchmark repurchase rate at 8
percent. The measure has been reduced only once -- a 50 basis
point decrease in April -- after it was bolstered by a record
375 basis points through 2010 and 2011 to combat inflation that
has averaged 8.6 percent in the past three years.  Consumer prices  may accelerate to 8 percent in the quarter
ending December and ease to 7.5 percent in the three months to
March 2013, the central bank forecast yesterday. The RBI pared
its  growth  estimate for this fiscal year to 5.8 percent from 6.5
percent on slowing investment and consumer spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
