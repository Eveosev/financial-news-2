The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
headed for a monthly decline, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped four basis points to
199.5 basis points as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The benchmark has fallen about 24 basis points in 
October, heading for its first monthly decline since June, 
according to Deutsche Bank and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased four basis
points to 143 as of 11:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac 
Banking Corp. The measure is on track to fall 16 this month, 
its biggest decline since July, according to CMA, which is owned 
by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the 
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan slid one basis point to 123 as of 8:09
a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The gauge is
on track to fall about 13 basis points this month after ranging
from 114.4 basis points and 134.6 in October, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
