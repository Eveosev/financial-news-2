and were little changed.  Fresenius Medical Care AG retreated 4.6 percent after
third-quarter earnings and revenue missed analystsâ€™ estimates.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG surged 6.6 percent after reporting third-
quarter operating profit that unexpectedly rose.  The DAX fell less than 0.1 percent to 7,283.57 at 3:58 p.m.
in  Frankfurt , after earlier gaining as much as 0.9 percent. The
broader HDAX Index increased less than 0.1 percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
