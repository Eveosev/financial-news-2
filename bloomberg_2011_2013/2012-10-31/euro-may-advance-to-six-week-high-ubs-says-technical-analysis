The euro may strengthen against its
U.S. counterpart to the highest level in six weeks if it breaks
key levels of resistance, according to UBS AG, citing technical
indicators.  If the shared currency advances past resistance at $1.3012
and $1.3042, it could appreciate to its Sept. 17 monthly high of
$1.3172,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy
at UBS in  London , wrote today in a note to clients. Last week’s
low of $1.2883 is a near-term support level for the euro, he
said.  “As long as support at this month’s $1.2802 low holds, the
risk is for resumption of strength,” Adcock wrote in the
report. He didn’t immediately respond to a message requesting
comment.  The euro increased 0.2 percent to $1.2984 at 10:38 a.m.  New
York  time after earlier gaining 0.5 percent to $1.3021, its
highest level since Oct. 25. The 17-nation currency rose 0.5
percent to 103.68 yen.  The euro has strengthened 1.4 percent this month, the
second-best performance after the Swiss franc among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 0.3 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered. Support is
an area where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
