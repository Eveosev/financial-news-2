Brazil may include electric and
hybrid vehicles in the second phase of an incentive program to
encourage automakers to manufacture them in the country,
according to an  article  in Folha de S. Paulo citing Heloisa
Menezes, secretary of development and production at the Ministry
of Development, Industry and  Foreign Trade .  The vehicles werenâ€™t included in the first phase of the
Inovar-Auto program. The government will consider waiving
certain taxes for companies that produce the vehicles in Brazil,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
