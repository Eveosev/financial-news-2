Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-biggest
U.S. automaker, climbed the most in more than 14 months after
posting quarterly profit yesterday that exceeded analysts’
estimates.  The  shares  rose 8.2 percent to $11.16 at the close in  New
York , the biggest daily increase since Aug. 9, 2011, and the
fourth-largest gain in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)  Trading
had been suspended the past two days because of  Hurricane Sandy .  Ford reported third-quarter profit of 40 cents a share
excluding one-time items, beating the 30-cent average of 19
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, as its North American unit
delivered record pretax operating income of $2.3 billion. Net
income was $1.63 billion, or 41 cents a share, compared with
$1.65 billion, or 41 cents, a year earlier.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company derives most of its
 sales and profit  in its home region, which helped overcome
widening losses in Europe. The European pretax loss was
$468 million, compared with $306 million a year earlier.  Ford has said it expects its European losses to total more
than $1.5 billion this year and again in 2013. The automaker
plans to cut 6,200 employees in Europe, or 13 percent of its
workforce in the region.  General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest U.S. automaker, surged
9.5 percent to $25.50 after reporting third-quarter results that
exceeded analysts’ estimates. Excluding one-time items, the
Detroit-based company’s profit was 93 cents a share, compared
with the 60-cent average of 17 estimates. Today’s share gain was
the largest since GM’s November 2010 initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
