Uganda ’s inflation rate fell to the
lowest level since December 2010, making room for the central
bank to cut borrowing costs.  Inflation in the East African nation slowed to 4.5 percent
in October from a revised 5.5 percent the month before, Chris Mukiza of the Uganda Bureau of Statistics told reporters today
in Kampala, the capital. Prices rose 0.3 percent in the month.  Uganda’s central bank has cut  interest rates  seven times
this year after almost doubling them in 2011 as inflation surged
above 30 percent, driven by rising oil prices and higher food
costs caused by drought.  The latest slowdown may give the central bank room to ease
the benchmark rate, currently 13 percent, by at least another
percentage point as it seeks to stimulate credit growth, Kenneth
Kitariko, managing director of brokerage African Alliance Uganda
Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. The bank may avoid a larger
cut because it’s “cautious on the effects it would have on the
shilling,” he said.  Underlying inflation, which excludes food crops, fuel,
electricity and metered water, slowed to 4 percent from 4.9
percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
