The Slovak government approved a
plan to reinstate a single public health-insurer system starting
i 2014 as it seeks to stop the inflow of funds to private
providers.  The Health Ministry will early next year pick an adviser to
assess the value of the two private insurers operating in
Slovakia, Premier Robert Fico said today. The government will
expropriate the providers if it fails to reach an agreement on a
voluntary purchase by the end of 2013, he said.  “We want a single insurer,” Fico told a news conference
today after a Cabinet meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia. “We will
negotiate until the end of next year. But if the agreement
doesn’t come, we will use the powers which the state has.”  Fico, an advocate of increasing state influence in the
economy, has accused private health insurers of profiting from
public funds, which instead should be spent fully on treatment.
The government says a unified system will channel more funds for
health care at a time when the country is striving to reduce the
budget  deficit .  Dovera, controlled by Czech-Slovak private equity group
Penta, has 1.4 million clients, while Union, a unit of Achmea
BV, has 400,000. Two-thirds of Slovakia’s 5.4 million citizens
are insured by the state-run General Health Insurance Company.  The government will sell some other state assets to finance
the costs of the purchase or the eventual expropriation, Fico
said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
