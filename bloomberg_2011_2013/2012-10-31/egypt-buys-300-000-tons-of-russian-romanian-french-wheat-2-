Egypt bought 300,000 metric tons of
wheat in a tender today from suppliers in  Russia ,  France  and
Romania, said Nomani Nomani, the vice chairman of Egypt’s state
grain buyer.  The wheat grown in France was purchased in cargoes of
60,000 tons each, at $353.61 a ton from  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and $353.61 a
ton from  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , Nomani said today from
Cairo. Ameropa Grains AG sold a 60,000 ton cargo of Romanian
wheat at $355.88 a ton. Glencore sold 120,000 tons grown in
Russia at $356.50 a ton. All of the grain is for shipment from
Dec. 21 to Dec. 31. Egypt is the world’s largest wheat importer.  Wheat supplies in Russia, last season’s third-biggest
shipper, and eastern  Europe  have declined as drought hurt crops
this year, raising speculation that Egyptian demand would shift
to western European and Western Hemisphere suppliers. Russia
last sold wheat to Egypt in a tender on Sept. 13, and more
recently the north African country has favored supplies from
countries including France and  Argentina , data compiled by
Bloomberg shows.  Russia’s sale was “a bit surprising,” as some traders may
have expected part of Egypt’s business to go to the U.S. today,
said Dan Hofstad, a London-based risk management consultant at
INTL FCStone, who focuses on the  Black Sea region . Russian wheat
supplies are more plentiful in southern areas near the port of
Novorossiysk than in central parts of the country, and “without
any official export ban, they’re going to sell the wheat they
have,” Hofstad said by telephone today.  Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade, the global
benchmark, rose 1.6 percent to $8.70 a bushel. In Paris,
milling-wheat futures gained 1 percent to 266 euros ($345) a ton
on NYSE Liffe.  Export Ban  Russia may harvest 40 million tons of wheat this year,
Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov said Oct. 9. In 2010, when
the worst drought in half a century spurred the government to
ban grain exports for 10 months, Russia produced 41.5 million
tons of wheat. President  Vladimir Putin  said Oct. 10 that
there’s no need for the country to restrict shipments this year.  Paris wheat futures, which jumped 92 percent in 2010, rose
to the highest in almost six weeks on Oct. 25 on speculation
that Ukraine would restrict exports next month, after crops
suffered from drought and demand accelerated. Ivan Bisyuk,
Ukraine’s First Deputy Agriculture Minister, told reporters
today in Kiev that no wheat export ban for Nov. 15 has been
drafted and there is no government resolution to curb trade.  Combined wheat harvests in Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan
fell by 37 percent this year, helping send global stockpiles to
a four-year low, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.
 Egypt  has 4.65 million tons of domestic and imported wheat,
enough to meet consumption for the next 187 days, the Cabinet
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
