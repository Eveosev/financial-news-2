Bulgaria will hold a referendum on
whether to build a new nuclear plant on Jan. 27, President Rosen Plevneliev said in e-mailed statement today.  Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov ’s Cabinet canceled on March
28 a 10 billion-euro ($12.25 billion) project to build a 2,000-
megawatt nuclear power plant at Belene with Rosatom Corp.,
 Russia ’s state nuclear company, after failing to agree on its
cost and find Western investors.  The move caused criticism from the opposition socialist
party, which said the government deprived the country from an
electricity source. Rosatom filed a 1 billion-euro claim on
Sept. 11 with the International Court of Arbitration in Paris to
cover construction work and production costs on the canceled
project.  The socialist party collected about 770,000 signatures
under a proposal to hold a referendum on whether to continue
with the construction of the Belene plant, which was submitted
to Parliament in July. The assembly voted on Oct. 24 to hold a
referendum on a new nuclear plant, formulating the question
without the mention of Belene.  The government also plans to build new reactor at the
existing nuclear plant Kozloduy, in northern  Bulgaria .  “The referendum will not address neither the problem with
Belene, nor all the development and financing issues related to
the new reactor in Kozloduy, because of the way it is
formulated, asking a general question,” Ilian Vassilev,
managing partner at Innovative Energy Solutions Ltd. in Sofia,
said in an e-mail Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
