Norway ’s krone strengthened the most
in more than seven weeks against the euro as the nation’s
central bank said it would halt foreign-currency purchases for
its sovereign wealth fund.  The krone appreciated at least 0.2 percent against all of
its 16 major peers. The Norges Bank said it won’t buy any
foreign currency for its $650 billion fund next month after
 purchasing  500 million kroner ($87.6 million) a day in September
and October. The central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 1.5 percent, while pushing back plans to increase
borrowing costs.  “Norges Bank refraining from foreign-exchange purchases in
November was a big surprise,” Katrine Boye, a senior economist
at Nordea Bank AB in Oslo, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.
“The decision not to purchase in November points in the
direction that the need for foreign-exchange in 2012 is already
covered.”  The krone strengthened 0.5 percent to 7.3945 per euro as of
5:07 p.m. in Oslo after gaining as much as 0.7 percent, the most
since Sept. 7. It appreciated 0.5 percent versus the dollar to
5.7056.  Norway’s central bank converts oil revenue into foreign
currency, which its wealth fund invests abroad to avoid
overheating the domestic economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
