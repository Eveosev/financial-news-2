The Brooklyn Nets will open their
season as planned tomorrow against the  New York Knicks , the
National Basketball Association said.  The timing of the first regular-season game at the $1
billion Barclays Center had been in doubt as New York City
recovers from  Hurricane Sandy .  “The Nets-Knicks game will go on as scheduled Thursday
night,” NBA spokesman Tim Frank said in an e-mail last night.  New York is recovering from the effects of the storm, which
caused flooding and blackouts in the metropolitan area and
claimed the lives of at least 10 people in the city, Mayor
 Michael Bloomberg  said in a news conference yesterday. The mayor
is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent
Bloomberg LP.  The Barclays Center, which seats 18,000 fans for basketball,
is next to Brooklyn’s main transportation hub, which includes
stops for subway lines and the Long Island Rail Road, neither of
which are running because of storm damage.  New York’s subway system may take weeks to be restored to
full service, Metropolitan Transit Authority Chairman Joe Lhota
said at a news conference yesterday.  In last night’s NBA games, the  Boston Celtics  lost 120-107
at the defending champion Miami Heat, a rematch of last year’s
Eastern Conference finals, which went the full seven games. The
Cleveland Cavaliers won 94-84 against the visiting Washington
Wizards and the  Los Angeles Lakers  lost 99-91 at home against
the Dallas Mavericks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
