Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened for
the first time in four days on speculation the region’s supplies
will shrink after BP Plc shut a unit at its Texas City refinery.  A fire in a section of a residual hydrotreater at the site
yesterday resulted in a shutdown of the unit, the company
reported. With the capacity to process 475,000 barrels a day,
BP’s Texas City plant is the fourth-largest refinery in the Gulf
Coast.  Supplies in the region fell by 1.39 million barrels to 69
million in the week ended Oct. 19, the biggest drop since Sept.
7, the Energy Department reported Oct. 24. Total  U.S. stockpiles 
of motor fuel are forecast to increase 175,000 barrels in the
seven-day period ending Oct. 26, according to the median
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Reformulated gasoline to be  blended with ethanol  on the
Gulf Coast gained 5.5 cents to trade at a discount of 15 cents a
gallon versus futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
2:22 p.m., the biggest advance since Sept. 25, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  declined by 0.02 cent to
3.75 cents below heating oil futures.  A diesel hydrotreater unit is down at Exxon Mobil Corp.’s
Baytown, Texas, refinery, the third-largest refinery in the Gulf
Coast, while the Chalmette, Louisiana, facility undergoes work
on an undisclosed unit, the company said Oct. 26. Together, the
plants can process 784,700 barrels a day, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
