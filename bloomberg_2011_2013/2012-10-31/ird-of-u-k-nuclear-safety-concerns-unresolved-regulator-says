A third of nuclear-safety concerns
in the U.K. remain unresolved after the regulator outlined
necessary improvements in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.  The nuclear industry, which has until the end of 2014 to
meet the demands of the Office of Nuclear Regulation, still has
to fix 32 percent of concerns identified during site visits, the
ONR said in a  report  one year after making its recommendations.  The ONR will “if necessary, consider enforcement action to
ensure that appropriate measures are implemented,” said Deputy
Chief Inspector Andy Hall. Reactors must be better prepared to
respond to natural disasters and other emergencies, the ONR
said, calling for plant reinforcements, reviews of cooling
systems and ventilation routes for combustible gases.  The regulator’s recommendations last year followed the
results of so-called stress tests on U.K. reactors after the
2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused a meltdown at Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Dai-Ichi plant. The crisis triggered
similar reviews in other countries and led some, including
Germany, to decide to phase out nuclear power altogether.  “Much work is still to be done to implement the lessons
from Fukushima,” the ONR report shows. “We expect the
licensees to make proposals on how they intend to meet the
required safety outcomes, and to justify why their proposal
represents the safest reasonably practicable option for
improvement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
