Armed robbers killed at least 18
people in a raid on a village in  Nigeria ’s northwestern state of
Zamfara, a government spokesman said.  The incident took place late yesterday in Kabaru village,
Sani Abdullahi Tsafe, a spokesman for the state governor in the
capital, Gusau, said today by phone. The gunmen aren’t suspected
to be linked to the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, he said.  The robbers, who are believed to also operate in the
northern states Katsina and Kaduna, killed more than 50 people
this year in attacks in Zamfara, Tsafe said.  “The robbers came on Monday night and started shooting,
going into houses and demanding money, and if you refuse or run
away they simply open fire and shoot you,” Sani Sahabi, a
Kabaru village resident, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
