New York Yankees relief pitcher
 Rafael Soriano  opted out of the final year of his contract after
saving 42 games last season in place of the injured  Mariano Rivera , MLB.com said yesterday.  Soriano, 32, would have received $14 million in 2013, the
website reported without saying where it got the information.
The right-handed pitcher instead activated a $1.5 million buyout
from the team, according to the report.  Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment on the report.  Soriano’s 42 saves this season were third in the  American
League  behind Jim Johnson of the  Baltimore Orioles , who had 51,
and Fernando Rodney of the Tampa Bay Rays, who had 48. He
stepped into the closer role when Rivera sustained a season-
ending knee injury in May, and finished the year 2-1 with a 2.26
earned run average and 69 strikeouts in 67 2/3 innings.  Rivera, 42, is a free agent after making $15 million last
season. The 12-time All-Star has been the team’s closer since
1997, and won World Series titles with the Yankees in 1996,
1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. He has a Major League Baseball-record
608 saves.  The Yankees may offer Soriano a qualifying one-year
contract of $13.3 million prior to the Nov. 2 deadline, which
would allow  New York  draft compensation should he sign
elsewhere, according to MLB.com. Soriano would have until Nov. 9
to accept the offer or decline and explore free agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
