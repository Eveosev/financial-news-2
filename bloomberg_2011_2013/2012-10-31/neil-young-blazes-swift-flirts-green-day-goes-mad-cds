Neil Young’s 35th studio album might
have been a train wreck.  It’s his second in four months, rush-released and speedily
recorded. It includes two self-indulgent tracks stretching to 16
minutes each and another one topping out at nearly half an hour.  “Psychedelic Pill” may sound an odd title given Young’s
shunning of drugs. He regresses to the 1960s on the slow-burn
opener “Driftin’ Back.” Some of his lyrics are plain
ridiculous: “I’m gonna get me a hip-hop haircut” indeed.  Still, many Young epics have silly words. And this time
there’s at least nothing quite as bad as the infamous chorus:
“Down by the river, I shot my baby.”  I’ve always liked long Young tracks -- “Like a
Hurricane,” “Ordinary People,” “Love to Burn,” “Cortez the
Killer” -- and this album adds more to the impressive canon as
he saddles up his old cohorts Crazy Horse.  It’s a companion piece to Young’s recent autobiography,
“Waging Heavy Peace.” The deadpan book covers years of excess:
friends’ drug deaths and the star’s own health problems
including a near-fatal brain aneurism. There’s also copious
mention of his environmental campaigns.  The memoir’s final chapter begins: “A lot has happened
over the years. I am now a very successful musician with a lot
of stuff and things of value.”  The new album can be counted
among them. Rating: ****.  Young isn’t the only rock veteran to come back from health
scares:  Bobby Womack , who has had surgery for colon cancer, has
released the excellent “The Bravest Man in the Universe.”  The CD has been out for a few months but has gradually been
picking up plaudits, such as the Best Album award from Q
Magazine this month. It’s coproduced by Damon Albarn of Blur and
has Lana Del Rey guesting on one track. Rating: ****.  Fiona Apple’s latest also takes a while to digest -- even
longer than to say its title: “The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than
the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More
Than Ropes Will Ever Do.” The collection starts with the
pleasant “Every Single Night” and veers into challenging songs
that seem to be difficult for the sake of it, and attempts to
outdo Regina Spektor or Joanna Newsom. Rating: **.  Another U.S. singer-songwriter, Taylor Swift, adds a little
Joni Mitchell-style maturity to her commercial cutting edge.
This sometimes means obtuse lyrics and gently strummed guitars.
Then she’s back in radio-friendly mode with “We Are Never Ever
Getting Back Together.” The CD, “Red,” has rocketed off to
strong sales and it’s musically more successful than Apple’s.
Rating: ***.  Green Day went crazy in the studio this year and ended up
with enough material for a three-disc set. The first volume is
out now and called “Uno.” No prizes for guessing the titles of
the next two: “Dos” and “Tre.” There’s also talk of a
documentary called “Quatro.” The band stays true to its
postpunk form with stripped-down bar rock and direct lyrics on
“Kill the DJ.” Rating: **.  U.K. band  Damn Vandals  has a stronger album, “Done for
Desire,” with some aggressive songs such as the opener
“Revolution/ Rehearsal.” I hope these guys make it. Kasabian,
and Green Day, should weep. Rating: ****.  Young’s album was released yesterday on Warner, Womack is
on XL and Apple on Epic. The CD prices start at $10 and download
prices vary across services.  Damn Vandals is on import from the U.K.’s Sexy Beast
records and there are deluxe editions of Swift, on Big Machine,
and Green Day on Reprise, all for $20.  Information:  http://neilyoungpsychpill.warnerreprise.com ,
