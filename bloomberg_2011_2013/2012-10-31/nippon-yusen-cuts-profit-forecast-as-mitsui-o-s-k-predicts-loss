Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) , Japan’s biggest
shipping line, lowered its annual profit forecast and  Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  predicted a loss as rates for carrying
commodities slump amid a glut of vessels.  Nippon Yusen  reduced its projected net income to 1 billion
yen ($13 million) in the year ending March from an earlier
prediction of 20 billion yen, according to a statement today.
Mitsui O.S.K. forecast a loss of 24 billion yen, compared with
an earlier prediction for a 3 billion yen profit. It also won’t
pay a first-half divided.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  similarly cut its profit
estimate as slower investment in vessels fails to revive dry-
bulk rates amid excess capacity and waning demand. The  Baltic
Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of commodity-shipping prices, averaged 45
percent lower in the quarter than a year earlier.  “We don’t expect a meaningful recovery until 2014,” said
 Janet Lewis , a Hong Kong-based analyst at Macquarie Securities
Ltd. Dry bulk is “the main drag” on Japanese shipping lines’
earnings, she said.  K-Line, Japan’s third-largest shipping line, expects net
income of 2 billion yen in the year ending March 31, compared
with an earlier forecast of 8 billion yen, it said.  China Cosco
Holdings Co. (1919) , China’s biggest listed shipping company, yesterday
forecast a loss for the current calendar year.  The three Japanese shipping lines, all based in Tokyo, have
all slumped more than 20 percent this year on the city’s stock
exchange.  In the quarter through September, Nippon Yusen narrowed its
net loss to 2.8 billion yen from 4.9 billion yen. Mitsui O.S.K.
reported an 8.1 billion loss, down from 8.4 billion yen. K-
Line’s loss narrowed to 449 million yen from 14.9 billion yen. A
pick-up in container-shipping rates in the period helped boost
earnings industrywide.  The Baltic Dry Index averaged 846 points in the three
months ended September, compared with 1,534 a year earlier. It
traded at 1,043 points, yesterday in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
