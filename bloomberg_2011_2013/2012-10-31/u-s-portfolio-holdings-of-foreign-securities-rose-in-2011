U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign
securities rose at the end of 2011 from a year earlier, with the
largest investments made in debt and equities from the U.K.,
Canada, Cayman Islands and Japan.  Total holdings were $6.84 trillion on Dec. 31, 2011,
compared with $6.76 trillion at the end of 2010, according to
final data released by the Treasury in Washington today.  The U.K. and the other three countries attracted 43 percent
of total U.S. portfolio investment, with British securities
topping the list at $989 billion, according to a statement from
the Treasury.  The survey is taken by the Treasury, the  Federal Reserve 
and the  New York  Fed. The Treasury Department released a
preliminary estimate in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
