Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502) , the
biggest beer maker in  Japan  by market share, declined in Tokyo
trading after posting lower earnings and having its
recommendation cut at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  stock  fell 1.7 percent to 1,819 yen at the close in
Tokyo trading, the lowest since Aug. 13. The broader Topix index
rose 1.2 percent. The Tokyo-based company yesterday posted a 12
percent drop in operating profit to 67.7 billion yen ($851
million) in the nine months ended September amid increased
costs.  Asahi, which affirmed its forecast for full-year earnings
of 113 billion yen, has boosted spending on marketing in its
soft-drink business to drive sales. Ritsuko Tsunoda, an analyst
at JPMorgan in  Tokyo , cut the stock to underweight from neutral.  “Our overall impression is negative,” Satsuki Kawasaki,
an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in an Oct. 30
report. There is “an increasing risk of operating profit
missing the target.”  Kawasaki cut her share price forecast on the stock by 5.3
percent to 1,800 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
