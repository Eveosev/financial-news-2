Nice Systems Ltd. (NICE)  and  ClickSoftware
Technologies Ltd. (CKSW)  surged in New York, paring the biggest monthly
loss since May for U.S.-traded Israeli stocks, after the
technology companies reported earnings that beat estimates.  The  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest New-
York traded Israeli companies rose 0.7 percent to 83.66 as
trading resumed following  Hurricane Sandy . The gain reduced the
October decline to 3.6 percent. Nice Systems posted its biggest
advance since May 2010 after the maker of analytical
telecommunications software raised its 2012 earnings forecast.
ClickSoftware, whose technology is used to manage workforces,
increased the most in a year as net income  exceeded  estimates.  Nice Systems, based in Ra’anana, Israel, raised its net
income forecast by as much as 8 percent and ClickSoftware offset
weaker European growth with sales in  Latin America  and Russia
two weeks after  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , the world’s biggest technology companies, reported
earnings that fell short of analysts’ projections.  “The fact that Nice was able to put up this kind of a
quarter and make this kind of forecast in a very cloudy spending
environment has really grabbed investors’ attention,”  Daniel Ives , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. who rates Nice
Systems outperform, said by phone yesterday from Westfield, New
Jersey. Nice is “an underappreciated story given how well
they’re doing relative to the industry,” he said.  Shutdown  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  added 0.5 percent to 1,219.71 at 10:24
a.m. in Tel Aviv. The gauge advanced 2.1 percent in October, its
fourth consecutive monthly gain. Most  U.S. stocks  rose as equity
markets in the world’s largest economy reopened after Hurricane
Sandy caused the longest weather-related shutdown since 1888.  The Bloomberg Israel-US Index declined last month as
 Ceragon Networks Ltd. (CRNT) , which sells its gear to telecommunication
operators and  Internet service providers , and  Mellanox
Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , the maker of products used to transfer and
store data, issued lower-than-expected forecasts. The index has
added 3 percent this year lagging behind the  Nasdaq Composite
Index (CCMP) ’s 14 percent increase.  Nice advanced 7.8 percent to $33.26. The  shares  in Tel Aviv
today gained 2.1 percent to 131.2 shekels, or $33.9.  The company raised its full-year 2012 adjusted earnings per
share forecast to $2.41-$2.46 compared with an Aug. 1 forecast
of $2.28-$2.38, according to a PRNewswire statement yesterday.
Third-quarter adjusted revenue grew 10 percent to $220.9
million, while adjusted net income rose to $39.7 million from
$34.5 million.  ‘Good Visibility’  ClickSoftware, based in Petach Tikva, Israel, jumped 6.5
percent to $7.49, the most since October 2011, as third-quarter
sales of $27.3 million beat the $25.5 million average estimate
of four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “ClickSoftware has been able to offset the macroeconomic
slowdown in Europe with new business in Brazil,  North America 
and Russia,”  Ashok Kumar , an analyst at Maxim Group LLC, said
in a phone interview from Palo Alto, California yesterday.
“That they have good visibility on revenue, especially in this
difficult economic environment, is the reason money is coming
back to this stock.”  Mellanox, based in Yokneam Elit, Israel, lost 24 percent in
October after the company forecast fourth-quarter sales of $145
million to $150 million, below the $156.6 million estimate of 13
analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg. Tel Aviv-based Ceragon tumbled
29 percent last month as Chief Executive Officer Ira Palti said
the second half of 2012 has been “slower than originally
expected.”  Potash Acquisition  American depositary receipts of  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) 
traded over-the-counter in New York gained 5.4 percent to
$12.89, the most since July. The  shares  in Tel Aviv today fell
0.2 percent to 48.50 shekels, or $12.52. ICL’s market value
today was 61.71 billion shekels, or $15.9 billion.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. , the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer, is in talks with the Israeli government to
acquire the chemicals company in a deal that may be worth more
than $13.5 billion.  Israel Corp. (ILCO) , the largest shareholder in Israel Chemicals,
advanced 0.9 percent to 2,663 shekels today in Tel Aviv.  To contact the reporter on this story:
