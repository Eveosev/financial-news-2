Kauto Star , multiple winner of
English horseracing’s Cheltenham Gold Cup and King George VI
Chase, has been retired.  Kauto Star made history last year by winning the King
George for a record fifth time. He also won the Gold Cup in 2007
and 2009, but was pulled up by jockey  Ruby Walsh  halfway through
this year’s showcase race at the Cheltenham Festival in March.  The retirement of the 12-year-old French-bred steeplechaser
was a mutual decision by his owner Clive Smith and trainer  Paul
Nicholls .  “We have had nine superb years with the horse,” Nicholls
wrote in his column on betting exchange Betfair Plc’s website
today. After seeing the horse at work in the past couple of
weeks, his team concluded “that the time had arrived to retire
him.”  “The end of an era has finally arrived,” Nicholls said,
who added that the bay gelding was a “once-in-a-lifetime
horse.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
