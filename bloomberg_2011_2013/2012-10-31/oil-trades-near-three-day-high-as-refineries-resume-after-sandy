Oil traded near a three-day high in
 New York  as  China ’s manufacturing expanded for the first month
since July and as U.S. East Coast refineries resumed operations
in the wake of superstorm Sandy, boosting crude use.  West Texas Intermediate futures were little changed after
closing 0.7 percent higher yesterday. China’s  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index rose to 50.2 in October, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
today, adding to signs of growth in the world’s second-biggest
crude user. U.S. East Coast refineries accounting for 76 percent
of the capacity that was halted or curtailed in Sandy’s path
have restored operations or were in the process of doing so as
of yesterday.  “Positive PMI data released this morning appears to show
that  China’s economy  is turning a corner after several months of
slowdown,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets
strategy at BNP Paribas SA in  London .  Crude for December delivery was at $86.42 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 18
cents, at 12:34 p.m. in London. Prices gained 56 cents yesterday
to $86.24, the highest close since Oct. 26. Futures are down 13
percent this year.  Brent for December settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was at $108.36 a barrel, down 34 cents.
The contract dropped as much as 0.9 percent and has fallen the
past three days. The European benchmark crude was at a $21.95
premium to WTI, down from $22.46 yesterday.  Rising Supply  An Energy Department report today may show U.S. crude
stockpiles rose to the highest level in three months. The period
covered in the report precedes Atlantic superstorm Sandy.  PBF Energy Inc.’s  Delaware  City, Delaware, and Paulsboro,
 New Jersey , refineries were operating normally yesterday,
according to recorded community hotline messages. The plants,
with a combined capacity of 367,200 barrels a day, ran at
reduced rates throughout the storm.  NuStar Energy LP (NS) ’s 74,000 barrel-a-day Paulsboro asphalt
facility in New Jersey was returning to service and is expected
to be back to full production by today, according to a statement
posted on the company’s website Oct. 30.  Delta Air Lines Inc.’s Monroe Energy LLC 185,000 barrel-a-
day Trainer,  Pennsylvania , refinery was operating normally, the
Energy Department said yesterday. Trebor Banstetter, an Atlanta-
based spokesman for Monroe, didn’t respond to an e-mail about
the status of the plant.  “Refineries are getting back online quickly, so clearly
that is going to remove some of that concern about a temporary
oversupply,” said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market strategist
at CMC Markets in Sydney. “I’m expecting further pressure on
prices in the next week or so from inventory builds.”  Gasoline Gains  Gasoline for December delivery in New York gained 1.8 cents
to $2.6491 a gallon. It rose 1.48 cents to $2.6303 yesterday
while the November contract, which expired, advanced 3.3 cents
to $2.7618.  U.S. crude inventories probably increased by 1.8 million
barrels to 376.9 million in the week ended Oct. 26, before Sandy
struck, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts ahead of
the Energy Department report. That would be the highest level
since July 20. The weekly data on supplies and output will be
published at 11 a.m. Washington time, the department said in an
e-mailed statement. It postponed the report by a day because of
disruptions caused by Sandy.  Output probably kept climbing after reaching 6.61 million
barrels a day in the week to Oct. 19, the most since May 1995,
the survey shows. Imports grew 5.7 percent for a fourth weekly
increase. Shipments may end their upward trend this week after
Sandy shut terminals and closed refineries.  Product Inventories  Gasoline stockpiles are expected to have gained 850,000
barrels to 199.4 million, according to the analyst survey.
Distillate-fuel inventories, a category that includes diesel and
heating oil, probably fell 1.4 million barrels to 116.6 million.  Production by OPEC, the supplier of about 40 percent of the
world’s crude oil, declined in October as Iranian output dropped
to the lowest level in 22 years, another Bloomberg survey
showed.  Output from the 12-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries slid 87,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to an
average 32.092 million barrels a day from a revised 32.179
million in September, according to the survey of  oil companies ,
producers and analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
