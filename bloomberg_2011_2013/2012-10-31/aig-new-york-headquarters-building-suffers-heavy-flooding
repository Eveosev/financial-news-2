American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
headquarters building in lower Manhattan suffered heavy flooding
from superstorm Sandy, the property’s landlord said.  Engineers are working to remove the remaining water from
the basement at 180 Maiden Lane and restore operating systems,
 SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG)  said in a statement. The New York-based
real estate investment trust said it expects losses from the
flooding to be fully covered by its insurers.  AIG leases more than 800,000 square feet (74,000 square
meters) at 180 Maiden, which SL Green co-owns with closely held
Moinian Group, based in  New York . The insurer, which was rescued
by the U.S. government four years ago, is planning to move out
of the 1.1 million-square-foot tower near the  East River  in
2014, Steve Durels, SL Green’s leasing director, said on a
conference call last week.  “Offices in lower Manhattan continue to be closed,
including 180 Maiden Lane,” said Jim Ankner, an AIG spokesman.
“Our business continuity plans have enabled us to continue to
serve our customers.”  Four other SL Green buildings remain without power, the
company said: 100 Church St., 641 Sixth Ave., 304 Park Ave.
South and 673 First Ave. SL Green is New York’s biggest office
landlord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
