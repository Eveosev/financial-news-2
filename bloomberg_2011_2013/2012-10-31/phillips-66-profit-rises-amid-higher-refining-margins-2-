Phillips 66 (PSX) , which became the
largest U.S. independent refiner after its spinoff from
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  earlier this year, said third-quarter profit rose
52 percent as the margin between oil costs and fuel prices
widened.  Net income rose to $1.6 billion, or $2.51 a share, from
$1.05 billion, or $1.65, a year earlier, Houston-based Phillips
66 said today in a statement. Profit excluding asset writedowns,
early debt payoffs and other one-time items was $2.97 a share,
61 cents more than the average of 15  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted profit in the company’s
chemicals business rose 42 percent to $275 million.  Since its May 1 spinoff, Phillips 66 has led U.S. refiners
in a rally rooted in  surging  U.S. crude output, which has
depressed prices and allowed the companies to save on every
barrel they process. The margin between crude costs and the
prices at which refiners sell fuel on the U.S. Gulf Coast
 averaged  $12.71 a barrel in the July-to-September period, the
most since 2005 and a 69 percent increase over the same period
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Low cost feedstock versus the crudes that are included in
industry markers and inventory impacts provided meaningful
uplift to refining earnings,” Jeff Dietert, an analyst at
Simmons & Co. in Houston, said in a note to clients.  Growth Opportunities  Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland has steered Phillips
66 toward growth opportunities in the company’s chemical and
pipeline segments, a plan that has attracted investors, Brian
Youngberg, an analyst at  Edward Jones  in  St. Louis , said in an
interview before earnings were released. “Longer term, that’s
where the upside is.”  Phillips 66 has stakes in 15 operating refineries as well
as a chemical joint venture with  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and a pipeline
and natural gas liquids unit with  Spectra Energy Corp. (SE)   The company lost $77 million in its pipeline and natural
gas liquids businesses as prices fell more than 40 percent from
the same period in 2011, according to the statement. DCP
Midstream, the joint venture with Spectra, produced 398,000
barrels a day in the quarter, a “slight increase” from last
year, according to the statement.  Phillips 66 fell 0.7 percent to $47.16 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
