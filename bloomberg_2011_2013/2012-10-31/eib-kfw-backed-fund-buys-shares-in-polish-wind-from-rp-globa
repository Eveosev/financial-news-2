The  Marguerite Fund , the European
Investment Bank-backed investor seeking to raise 1.5 billion
euros ($1.9 billion), bought 49.99 percent of two wind farms in
 Poland  from Austria’s RP Global Group.  RP Global, based in Vienna, will hold the remaining shares
of the parks. It will operate the 50-megawatt Tychowo and the
54-megawatt Kukinia plants in northwest Poland, the Marguerite
Fund, based in Luxembourg, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The fund, which already raised 710 million euros for
infrastructure investments, made the acquisition as Poland lures
investors such as German utility  RWE AG (RWE)  and Czech power producer
CEZ AS by offering clean power incentives through a green
certificate program to bolster renewable energy.  The fund, with backers including  Germany ’s KfW Group and
Instituto de Credito Oficial, got 560 million zloty ($176
million) of project finance with a 15-year maturity to refinance
the operational Tychowo park and to help fund construction of
Kukinia, according to William Pierson, managing director at
Marguerite Adviser SA, the fund’s adviser.  The funding was raised from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , another
of the fund’s backers.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
