Centamin Plc (CEY) ’s Sukari Gold Mine in
 Egypt  is operating as normal as the company prepares to appeal
yesterday’s court decision annulling its 18-year-old contract,
executives said.  “We are not worried, and have the support of the
government,” Yousef Al Raghi, the mine’s managing director,
said in a phone interview today. He said the court wasn’t
empowered to overturn the concession agreement. Andy Davidson,
head of  investor relations , said the company is waiting for a
transcript of the verdict to understand its implications.  The agreement, between Centamin Plc and the state-run
 Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority , is valid until a copy of
the court’s decision is received, Fekry Youssef Mohamed,
chairman of the state-run agency, said in a telephone interview
today. He said he expects to get it by Sunday.  The administrative court in Cairo ruled yesterday that the
mineral authority didn’t exercise enough oversight on gold-
extraction operations, and that Egypt’s share of the profits is
too low. Centamin’s London-listed shares fell as much as 59
percent, the most on record, before trading was suspended.  Centamin signed a 50-50 joint venture agreement with the
authority in 1994 under the rule of President  Hosni Mubarak , who
was ousted in a popular uprising last year.  The lawsuit was brought by Hamdy Al-Fakharany, a former
lawmaker involved in overturning Mubarak-era deals where he says
that public assets were sold for less than their fair value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
