Richard Branson ’s bid to retain the
premier U.K. rail route for his Virgin Trains wasn’t scrutinized
by top transport officials or any external financial advisers, a
senior civil servant said today when questioned by lawmakers.  The role of three people suspended following the collapse
of the West Coast tender is being examined in a human resources
inquiry, Philip Rutnam, permanent secretary to the Department
for Transport, told the  House of Commons Transport Committee .  Rutnam said that procurement rules meant senior officials
weren’t allowed to view confidential details of proposals from
Virgin and successful bidder  FirstGroup Plc (FGP) , which was stripped
of the London-Scotland contract when “serious flaws” were
detected in the process after a legal challenge from Branson.  The staff suspensions are “precautionary only and do not
imply any judgment as to conclusions the department will reach
on their behavior,” Rutnam said. Investigators are seeking
access to internal emails pertaining to the bids to evaluate
whether Branson’s pitch was discriminated against.  Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told the committee
that the DfT as a whole shouldn’t be blamed for the West Coast
debacle, while revealing that costs of the failure will exceed
the 40 million pounds ($64 pounds) previously stated.  The tender for a franchise that carries 31 million people a
year to cities including Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and
Glasgow was halted on Oct. 3, seven weeks after FirstGroup had
been handed a contract on Aug. 15 with a 5.5 billion-pound bid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
