European coal for next-year delivery
fell to near its lowest since 2010 as natural gas declined.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp lost as much as 35 cents to $93 a metric ton and was
at $93.25 at 3:44 p.m. in  London , according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contract fell as low as $92.80 on
Oct. 29, its lowest intraday level since May 19, 2010.  Bloomberg tracks coal-price information supplied by ICAP
Plc, GFI Group Inc., Marex Spectron Group Ltd., Credit Suisse
Group AG, IHS McCloskey, Tradition Financial Services and
Tullett Prebon Plc.  Dutch gas for the six months through September declined 0.9
percent to 26.40 euros a megawatt-hour. Coal and gas are
competing fuels in power generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
