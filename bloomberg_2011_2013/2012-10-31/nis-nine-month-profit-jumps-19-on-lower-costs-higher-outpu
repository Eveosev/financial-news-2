Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , said
its nine-month profit jumped 19 percent as costs fell and output
increased.  Net income climbed to 32.2 billion dinars ($368 million) as
sales advanced 22 percent to 162 billion dinars, the Novi Sad,
Serbia-based company known as NIS said in an e-mailed statement
today. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization jumped 49 percent to 18.1 billion dinars as oil and
gas production rose 13 percent to 1.25 million tons of oil
equivalent.  “The results are slightly above market expectations,”
said Nenad Gujanicic, chief broker at Belgrade-based Sinteza
Invest Group AD.  Vertically integrated NIS, which tomorrow will restart
units at its main refinery in Pancevo after their upgrade,
processed 1.46 million tons of crude in the first nine months,
17 percent less than a year ago. Investments increased 62
percent to 30.4 billion dinars, which included 6.9 billion
dinars spent on the expansion of its retail distribution
networks in  Serbia , Romania and  Bulgaria .  Debt shrank $91 million this year to $367 million at the
end of September, according to the statement.  NIS will “soon” regain about 17 billion dinars of debt
owed by Serbia’s state-owned gas monopoly Srbijagas JP, which
will lead to a ‘very high full-year result,’’ Gujanicic said.  Its  shares  rose for a third day, adding 1.3 percent to 648
dinars. Gazprom Neft owns 56 percent of the company, while the
Serbian government’s stake is 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
