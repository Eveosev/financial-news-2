About 1,000 Japanese companies were
bankrupted as a result of last yearâ€™s earthquake and tsunami,
according to  Teikoku Databank Ltd ., a research company.  A total of 24,000 people were employed at the companies.
Bankruptcies were triggered by physical damage, loss of demand
and other effects of the March 11, 2011 disaster, with
manufacturers hardest hit, accounting for 21.5 percent of the
failures, Teikoku Databank said in an Oct. 29  report  on its
website.  The biggest number of bankruptcies, 47.7 percent, were in
the Kanto area around Tokyo, according to the study. The portion
in the hardest-hit Tohoku region was 15.8 percent.  Ninety companies failed as a result of the nuclear disaster
at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic station that was caused by the
natural disasters, including 18 that were bankrupted due to
power outages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
