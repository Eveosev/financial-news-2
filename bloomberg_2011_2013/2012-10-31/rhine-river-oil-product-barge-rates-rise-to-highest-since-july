Rhine River freight rates for oil
products rose to the highest level in more than three months.  The cost of shipping gasoil, or heating oil, to Duisburg,
 Germany , from Rotterdam or Amsterdam rose to 6.75 euros ($8.77)
a metric ton yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Thatâ€™s the highest since July 9, the data show.  Water levels at Kaub, south of Duisburg, dropped about 40
percent in the last two weeks, the data show. The river is still
higher than at this time last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
