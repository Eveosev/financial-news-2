PT Asuransi Multi Artha Guna (AMAG) ,
Indonesia’s second-largest insurance company by market value,
posted its biggest  three-day drop  in 16 months on concern floods
in Jakarta will lead to a jump in claims and hurt earnings.  Multi Artha Guna fell 4.1 percent to 235 rupiah by 2 p.m.
local time, after slumping as much as 6.1 percent. The Jakarta
Composite Index slipped 0.2 percent. Multi Artha Guna shares
have lost 13 percent over the past three days, the most since
the period ended Sept. 26, 2011.  Jakarta’s floods killed at least 20 people last week and
caused widespread damage to homes, vehicles and public
facilities. Investor Daily Indonesia reported today insurance
claims may reach 3 trillion rupiah ($310.9 million) compared
with around 2.1 trillion rupiah during a similar disaster in the
capital city in 2007.  “The shares were hit by concerns over claims that might
arise from the floods,” Robby Hafil, an analyst at Trimegah
Securities in Jakarta, said by telephone. “However, the market
potential for insurance companies is still huge in  Indonesia .
The public awareness on the need for insurance is still very
low.”  Multi Artha Guna’s trading volume was 80 percent of its
three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Shares of other insurance companies fell with Asuransi Dayin
Mitra declining 4.1 percent and Lippo General Insurance losing
3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
