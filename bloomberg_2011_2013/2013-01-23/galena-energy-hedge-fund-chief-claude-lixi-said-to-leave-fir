Claude Lixi, the head of Galena
Asset Management Ltd.’s energy hedge fund, left the London-based
company, according to two people with direct knowledge of the
departure.  The people didn’t say whether he resigned or was fired, and
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
Lixi, 40, who was based in Geneva, declined to comment when
contacted yesterday on his mobile phone. Duncan Letchford, the
company’s chief investment officer in London, didn’t return a
message left with his secretary yesterday.  Jaakko Ahmala, a former executive at Galena’s parent
company Trafigura Beheer BV, will take over Lixi’s role and work
with portfolio manager Mark Heath, the people said. Ahmala
joined Galena this month from Trafigura, where he was in charge
of its derivatives group since 2010, according to a company
website. Ahmala and Heath were hired by Trafigura in 2008.  Lixi joined Galena in May 2009 from Morgan Stanley, where
he traded oil options.  Galena’s $218 million energy fund returned 4.3 percent in
2012, after a 1.2 percent gain in 2011, according to one of the
people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
