Sweden  should set up a macro-
prudential council to better spot risks and prevent future
financial crises, a government-appointed committee said.  The council should be established by law to help
cooperation between the Financial Supervisory Authority and the
Riksbank, the Financial Crisis Committee said in a report today
in Stockholm.  “The council should promote increased expertise about
systemic risks and the development of macroprudential tools and
analyse risks in the financial system and discuss appropriate
measures for counteracting these risks,” the committee said.  Sweden managed to avoid meltdown during the 2008 crisis as
the central bank provided liquidity and the government
guaranteed as much as 1.5 trillion kronor ($230 billion) in bank
borrowing. It also doubled deposit guarantees up to 500,000
kronor and provided loans to  Latvia , where a burst property
bubble triggered losses at Swedish banks.  The Swedish National Audit Office in 2011 complained about
a lack of a formalized division of responsibility between the
country’s authorities to ensure stability. It attributed part of
the successful handling of the crisis to personal relationships
between civil servants dating back to Sweden’s domestic banking
crisis in the early 1990s.  The committee, whose recommendations were originally
supposed to be published in August, was appointed by the
government in February last year to review the regulatory
framework for dealing with financial crises. It will publish a
complete report in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
