Portugal ’s 10-year bonds gained for
a fifth day, extending the longest rally since November, amid
speculation the country will succeed in selling notes for the
first time since requesting a bailout in April 2011.  Portuguese  two-year  yields dropped below 3 percent, a level
not seen since October 2010. Spanish securities rose after the
nation’s Treasury said it aims to cover as much as 13 percent of
its planned gross debt issuance for 2013 this month after a
syndicated sale yesterday attracted record demand. German bunds
advanced as the International Monetary Fund cut its global
growth forecasts and projected a second year of contraction in
the euro area, spurring demand for the region’s safest assets.  “The improvement in how peripheral debt, not only Spain
and  Italy , but also Ireland, has been received by the market
definitely bodes well for a Portuguese syndication,” said
Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
London. “This is the next big step to having real primary
market access.”  The yield on Portuguese 10-year bonds fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.83 percent at 4:43 p.m.
London time. The 4.95 percent security due October 2023 climbed
0.47, or 4.70 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,330) face amount, to
93.125. Two-year rates dropped 21 basis points to 3.06 percent,
after sliding to 2.94 percent, the least since Oct. 26, 2010.  Portugal’s sale of October 2017 notes through banks may be
priced to yield 395 basis points more than the mid-swap rate,
according to a person familiar with the deal, who declined to be
identified because the transaction hasn’t been completed.  Spanish Sale  The nation may sell as much as 2 billion euros of the
notes, RBC’s Aul estimated.  Spain allotted 7 billion euros of 10-year bonds yesterday,
a sale that Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said had the
biggest demand in the nation’s history. Ireland sold 2.5 billion
euros of bonds on Jan. 8, spurring Portugal, which requested a
78 billion-euro bailout in 2011, to achieve its goal of
regaining market access by September.  “For Portugal to get back to capital markets so soon in
2013 is quite something,”  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-
market debt strategy at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam, wrote in a
note to clients today. “A successful tap would ease that
pressure on bills, and pave the way for Portugal to ease its way
back on to capital markets.”  Spanish 10-year yields fell five basis points to 5.07
percent, and the rate on the nation’s two-year notes dropped two
basis points to 2.55 percent.  German Bunds  Germany’s 10-year bunds rose for a second day, pushing the
yield down three basis points to 1.54 percent. It climbed to
1.64 percent on Jan. 18, the highest level since Oct. 18.  The world economy will expand 3.5 percent this year, less
than the 3.6 percent forecast in October, the Washington-based
IMF said today in an update of its World Economic Outlook
report. It expects the 17-country euro area to shrink 0.2
percent in 2013, instead of growing 0.2 percent as forecast in
October, as Spain leads the contraction and  Germany  slows.  “Is  Europe  on the mend? I think the answer is yes and
no,” IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard said in a video
released with the report. “Something has to happen to start
growth.”  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Finland and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the
yield spread between two-year and 10-year securities, and
credit-default swaps.  German bunds have handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent
this month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Portuguese securities returned 1.8 percent and
Spanish bonds gained 1.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
