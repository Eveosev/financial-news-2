Peru , the world’s third-largest
copper and zinc producer, is set to boost its metals export
revenue by 20 percent to $30 billion this year as new copper
mines increase output, state news agency  Andina  reported.  New mines from  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and Chinalco Mining Corp. and an
expansion at Cia. Minera Antamina SA will help lift annual
copper output to 2.8 million metric tons by 2016 from 1.3
million tons last year, the agency said, citing Deputy Mining
Minister Guillermo Shinno.  Companies are expected to invest $1 billion in exploration
and $20 billion in mine construction in Peru this year, Shinno
told Andina.  Shinno didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
