Chilean traders and investors expect
the central bank to raise  interest rates  by February next year
as the inflation rate doubles, according to a survey published
on the central bank website today.  The bank’s board, which hasn’t changed borrowing costs
since January 2012, will keep the key rate on hold at 5 percent
until at least August before raising it to 5.25 percent by
February next year, according to the survey posted on the bank
website today. Traders last surveyed on Jan. 7 expected the bank
to raise rates to 5.25 percent by January 2014.  Since the past survey, policy makers have cited improved
financial conditions abroad as well as easing inflation and a
tight labor market at home as justification for keeping rates at
5 percent for 12 straight months. That decision reinforced
estimates borrowing costs will remain unchanged, according to
BNP Paribas.  “The neutral bias remained unchanged, suggesting that no
rate changes are likely near term,” BNP analysts including
Florencia Vazquez wrote in a note e-mailed to investors a day
after the Jan. 17 rate decision. “This stands in line with our
forecast that only pencils in the start of a gradual tightening
cycle later in the year.”  The peso, which has gained 4.6 percent in the past six
months, rose by less than 0.1 percent to 470.85 per  U.S. dollar 
at 8:42 a.m. Santiago time. Chile’s currency will trade at
471.50 per dollar in seven days, according to the median
estimate of 58 analysts in today’s survey.  The economy expanded 1.3 percent in November from the
previous month, the fastest pace since the end of 2011.  Still, the  inflation rate  fell to 1.5 percent in December
from 2.1 percent the previous month, dropping below the central
bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range for the first time
since October 2010. Inflation will accelerate to 3 percent in 12
months, according to today’s survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
