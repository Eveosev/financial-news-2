Maria Schaumayer, the Austrian
Central Bank governor who went on to settle claims filed by Nazi
slave-labor victims, died today. She was 82.  She died unexpectedly early this morning in her apartment,
the Vienna coroner’s office said today in a  statement . No cause
of death was given for the native of Graz,  Austria .  Schaumayer was the first woman to lead a central bank in
 Europe , heading the Austrian institution from 1990 to 1995.
After leaving the bank, she led the Austrian government’s
negotiations to compensate Nazi slave-labor victims. The
government agreed to pay out $394.5 million in 2000.  “She decisively influenced the economic and political life
of our country,” Austrian President Heinz Fischer said today in
a  statement . She was “counted among the most important
political and economic personalities in the life of the Republic
of Austria.”  Schaumayer, who began her career as a Vienna city
councilwoman, was awarded Austria’s Golden Medal of Honor in
2000 for her service to the country. She was an honorary member
of the country’s National Academy of Science and ran a
 foundation  that helped women enter economics and the sciences.  To contact the reporter on this story:
