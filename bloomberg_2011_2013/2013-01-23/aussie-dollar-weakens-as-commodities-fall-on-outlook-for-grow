the majority of its 16 most-traded peers as commodities declined
after the  International Monetary Fund  lowered its estimate for
global economic growth.  The Aussie weakened against the  U.S. dollar  for the first
time in three days after the Washington-based IMF said the world
economy will grow 3.5 percent this year, less than the 3.6
percent forecast in October. The fund cut Japan’s 2014 growth
forecast by 0.4 percentage point to 0.7 percent. Australia’s
consumer price index rose less than forecast last quarter. New
Zealand’s dollar gained as a gauge of manufacturing rose.  “The Aussie decline came from the Asian session after the
release of the softer-than-expected CPI number, which increased
fears that the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will cut rates,”
 Camilla Sutton , chief currency strategist at Bank of  Nova
Scotia , said yesterday in a telephone interview from Toronto.

percent to 84.24 U.S. cents. The currency was little changed at
