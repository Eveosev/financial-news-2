Morgan Stanley and the World Bank’s
International Finance Corp. will participate in a $5 million
investment in eleni LLC, a Nairobi, Kenya-based company that was
started by the founder of the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange.  Eleni plans to build commodity exchanges in  Africa , Morgan
Stanley, the IFC and eleni said in a statement yesterday. Cocoa,
cotton, coffee, sorghum and sesame seeds are potential products
to start exchanges because Africa grows them all, eleni Chief
Executive Officer Eleni Gabre-Madhin said by phone from Davos,
 Switzerland  today. Offices in Dubai and Accra,  Ghana  are
planned, she said.  “What we’re trying to do is improve the domestic supply
chains in each of the regions in which we set up an exchange,”
Gabre-Madhin said. “If you talk to the big buyers, a lot of
them are concerned about reliable sourcing and being assured
that farmers are being properly treated.”  Eleni founded the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange in 2008,
which now handles 640,000 metric tons of coffee, sesame seeds,
white pea beans and corn a year with a total value of $1.4
billion, she said. Coffee farmers in the country now get 65
percent of the final export price, up from 38 percent three
years ago, she said.  Gabre-Madhin was born in  Ethiopia  and is moving to  Kenya  to
start eleni LLC because “it’s a good hub for technological
development and innovation,” she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
