City Trust Ltd. (CTRL)  surged toward a
record after a newspaper report said the Kenyan investment
company’s proposed merger with a bank will boost its market
value.  The stock surged by the maximum daily limit of 10 percent
to 440 shillings by 2:03 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. A close
at this level will be the highest since May 20, 1997, when
Bloomberg began compiling data on the stock. About 52 percent of
the three-month daily average volume of shares were traded.  The proposed merger with Nairobi-based I&M Bank Ltd. may be
worth 29 billion shillings ($330.7 million), Business Daily
reported, citing documents from the companies. City Trust has a
market value of 2.52 billion shillings now.  “Based on 2011 earnings, the company would easily come
into the market at a level of between 80 shillings and 100
shillings per share,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview.  Under the planned merger announced on Dec. 24, City Trust
shares will be split five times, placing the current market
price at 88 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
