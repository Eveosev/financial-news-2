Malaysia ’s inflation eased in
December to the slowest pace in almost three years, providing
scope for the central bank to support growth.  Consumer prices  rose 1.2 percent from a year earlier, after
climbing a previously reported 1.3 percent in November,
according to data released by the Putrajaya-based Statistics
Department today. The median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 1.4 percent gain. Inflation was 1.6 percent in
2012, the report showed.   Malaysia’s central bank has kept interest rates unchanged
for nine straight meetings as an expanding economy and inflation
below 2 percent reduced the need to adjust monetary policy. Bank
Negara Malaysia said in November price gains are expected to
remain “modest” in 2013 amid excess capacity in the economy.  “Inflation is going to be higher this year but I don’t
think it will be out of control,” Ho Woei Chen, a Singapore-
based economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd., said before the
report. “Bank Negara is still in a comfortable position. I
don’t think they will either hike or cut interest rate this
year.”  Policy makers meet next week and are forecast to keep the
benchmark rate at 3 percent, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The economy may expand 5.6 percent this year after
growing an estimated 5.1 percent in 2012, the Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research said Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
