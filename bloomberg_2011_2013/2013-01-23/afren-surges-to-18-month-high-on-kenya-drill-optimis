Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based oil explorer
in Africa and Iraq, surged to the highest level in 18 months
amid speculation that drilling results from its Paipai well in
Kenya will soon be released.  The  shares  jumped 9.2 percent to 152 pence at the close of
trading in London, the highest since July 2011. The volume of
stock changing hands was more than 10 times the three-month
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Afren is up on high volume amid rumors of forthcoming
results from the Paipai prospects in which Tullow Oil and Africa
Oil also have a stake,” said Jawaid Afsar, a trader at
Securequity Ltd. in Sheffield, England.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  rallied 3.5 percent to 1,195 pence in London
while  Africa Oil Corp. (AOI)  slipped 0.9 percent to C$7.52 at 11:51
a.m. in Toronto trading.  An external spokesman for Afren, who asked not to be
identified, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News
today. Galib Virani, an associate director at Afren, told
Bloomberg News on Jan. 21 that operator Tullow “should be in a
position to make some announcement over the next three weeks or
so.”  Afren, which owns oil fields in the Kurdistan region of
Iraq, rallied 53 percent last year as the Daily Mail reported
that Exxon Mobil Corp. and Italy’s  Eni SpA (ENI)  examined the company.
Exxon’s chief executive officer, Rex Tillerson, met with Kurdish
President  Massoud Barzani  yesterday in Davos, Switzerland,
according to Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
