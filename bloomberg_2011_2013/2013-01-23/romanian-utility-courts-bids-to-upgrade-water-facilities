The Romanian water utility Aquaserv
SA is seeking bids of about 27 million lei ($8 million) for
works to upgrade water treatment plants in two central towns, a
 European Union procurement document showed.   The utility is asking for bids from companies interested in
works estimated to last 36 months as it plans to assign the
contract from March 20, according to the document. The project
is partly financed through European Union funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
