Equity derivatives trading fell last
year for the first time since 2004 as volatility subsided,
according to a report from the World Federation of Exchanges.  Stock derivative contracts, such as options and futures, on
regulated exchanges declined 20 percent to 14.9 billion in 2012,
according to a WFE  release  today on the annual survey of global
markets. Stock index options had the biggest drop  among equity
derivatives , falling 40 percent from 2011, the data show.  Derivatives trading slumped last year as the  VIX (VIX) , as the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, fell
to its lowest level since the financial crisis that began in
2007. Stock swings declined as U.S. corporations posted an 11th
quarter of  earnings  growth and American policymakers reached a
budget agreement to avoid spending cuts and tax increases in
2013. Futures are agreements to buy or sell financial assets or
commodities at a set price and date, and investors often trade
the products as bets on price fluctuations.  “2012 was a very challenging year for exchanges,” the WFE
said. “Derivatives markets were affected from the continued low
interest-rate environment and the significant decrease of
volatility, both factors reducing hedging needs.”  Derivatives, a more than $600 trillion market, allow buyers
to bet on the direction of currencies,  interest rates  and
markets to protect their holdings, insure against defaults on
bonds or lock in a price on commodities. The futures market
totaled  $25 trillion  in notional value as of September 2012,
according to the  Bank for International Settlements , a Basel,
Switzerland-based organization that tracks derivatives.  The VIX, the benchmark gauge for U.S. stock options, ended
2012 at 18.02, 78 percent lower than the all-time high reached
in November 2008, during the height of the credit crisis. It
 slumped  0.5 percent to 12.36 at 12:20 p.m.  New York  time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
