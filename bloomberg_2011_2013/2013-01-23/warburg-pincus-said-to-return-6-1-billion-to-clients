Warburg Pincus  LLC, the private-
equity firm that owns Neiman Marcus and Interactive Data Corp.,
handed back $6.1 billion to clients last year as a stock-market
rally drove sales of company shares, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Distributions to investors were 36 percent higher than the
$4.5 billion in 2011, and exceeded the $2.3 billion Warburg
Pincus invested in 28 new companies and several follow-on deals
last year, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private.  Jeffrey Smith, a spokesman for Warburg Pincus, declined to
comment.  Warburg Pincus sold shares in public portfolio companies
during the last three months of the year including  Ziggo NV (ZIGGO) , a
Dutch cable company;  Webster Financial Corp. (WBS) ;  Primerica Inc. (PRI)  and
Intime Department Store Company Ltd. Warburg Pincus’s portfolio
company Fidelity National Information Services Inc., a provider
of banking and payment technology, in December agreed to
repurchase $200 million of common stock from the private-equity
firm’s ninth fund.  Warburg Pincus, which in September 2011 started seeking $12
billion for its latest fund, has so far closed on $7 billion,
said the person.  The firm’s prior fund, which gathered $15 billion in 2008,
was generating a 1.15 times multiple and a 5.5 percent net
internal rate of return as of Sept. 30, according to performance
data by  Oregon Public Employees’ Retirement Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
