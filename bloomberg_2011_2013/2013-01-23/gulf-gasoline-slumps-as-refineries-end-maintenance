U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened
for a fourth day against futures as refiners including Citgo
Petroleum Corp. and Motiva Enterprises LLC completed maintenance
at plants in the area.  Citgo’s 165,000-barrel-a-day Corpus Christi East refinery
is operating at planned rates after finishing work at the Texas
plant, while Motiva restarted a 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit
at the  Port Arthur, Texas, refinery , following repairs, the
companies said. Motiva’s pipestill, which had been idled since
Dec. 11, boosted the plant’s capacity to 600,000 barrels a day
from 275,000 barrels.  The return of production after maintenance may further
boost supplies of distillate and gasoline products on the U.S.
Gulf Coast, home to almost half of the nation’s refining
capacity. Inventories of the fuels rose by a combined 4.66
million barrels last week.  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol in the
region weakened 2.5 cents to 19.75 cents a gallon versus futures
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:12 p.m. That’s the
widest gap since Dec. 27 and longest losing streak since Dec.
10.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region advanced 0.51 cent to
0.13 cent above heating oil futures.  “You’re getting some cheap crude down there and it will
improve the crack spreads,” Steve Mosby, vice president of ADMO
Energy LLC, a supply consultant in Kansas City,  Missouri . “They
are just going to run those refineries harder. They are making
good money right now and it’s just going to get better.”  The 3-2-1 crack spread, a measure of refining profitability
based on WTI in Cushing, gained 88 cents to $21.18 a barrel at
2:31 p.m. The  same spread  based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil
rose 13 cents to $1.43  a barrel.  ‘More Supply’  Refiners last week  processed  7.76 million barrels of crude
and other feedstocks on the U.S. Gulf Coast, where  gasoline
supplies  grew to 83.8 million barrels last week and distillate
stockpiles jumped to 39.3 million, according to data from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  “The anticipation is more supply,” Mosby said in a phone
interview today. “There are huge discounts on crude because
Cushing is flush with supply but as you have the ability to take
the barrels south, there won’t be such a discount.”  West  Texas  Intermediate crude for March delivery fell 1.45
cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $95.23 a barrel on Nymex.
The  discount to Brent oil , the European crude benchmark, widened
to $17.57 a barrel, the largest gap since Jan. 14.  Group 3  Conventional gasoline in the Mid-continent, or Group 3
region, advanced 2.5 cents to trade at a discount of 20.5 cents
a gallon versus futures, the lowest since Dec. 11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A similar  85-octane gasoline , called
CBOB, gained 1.25 cents to 27.25 cents a gallon below futures in
the  Chicago  region.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  held at 5 cents below heating oil
futures in the Mid-continent, while the fuel retreated 0.25 cent
to a 12-cent discount in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
