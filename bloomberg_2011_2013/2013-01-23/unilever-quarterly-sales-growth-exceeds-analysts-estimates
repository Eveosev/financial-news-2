Unilever, the world’s second-largest
consumer-goods maker, reported fourth-quarter revenue growth
that beat estimates, led by growth of its personal-care
products.  Sales excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations rose
7.8 percent in the three months through December, the London-
and Rotterdam-based company said today in a statement. The
average estimate of 13 analysts polled by Bloomberg for so-
called underlying sales was 6.2 percent. The quantity of goods
sold gained 4.8 percent, more than the 4 percent estimated by
analysts and the biggest quarterly gain in two years.  “We remain focused on achieving another year of profitable
volume growth ahead of our markets, steady and sustainable core
operating margin improvement and strong  cash flow ,” Chief
Executive Officer Paul Polman said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
