Malaysia ’s ringgit rebounded from
near a two-week low as a pickup in German investor confidence
allayed concern about  Europe ’s growth outlook and spurred risk-
taking.  Government bonds  gained before inflation data today.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said yesterday its index of investor and analyst expectations
jumped to 31.5 in January, the highest in 2 1/2 years. The
ringgit declined 1 percent in the last two days on concern
Malaysia’s government will call an early election that may
loosen its grip on power. The currency is still 0.6 percent
stronger for the month.  “Fears of Europe’s core slipping into a deep recession
are” receding, said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “It’s not like the
European situation has turned completely rosy, but at least
there won’t be an imminent implosion.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.2 percent, the most since Jan.
17, to 3.0374 per dollar as of 9:25 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
3.0493 yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 8. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, increased one basis point to 5.38
percent.  Inflation Data  Prime Minister Najib Razak must dissolve parliament by

10 statement. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index of
