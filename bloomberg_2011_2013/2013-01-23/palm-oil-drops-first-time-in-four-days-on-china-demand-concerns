Palm oil  declined for the first time
in four days on concern that exports from Malaysia, the second-
largest producer, may decrease this month as  China  buys less
after tightening quality regulations on imports.  The contract for delivery in April fell as much as 0.6
percent to 2,450 ringgit ($806) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,457
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures closed 1.9 percent higher
yesterday, the biggest gain in almost three weeks.  China’s quality watchdog, the General Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, toughened
inspections on imports from Jan. 1. Exports from Malaysia to the
biggest cooking oil consumer declined 28 percent in the first 20
days of January from the same period a month earlier, data from
Societe Generale de Surveillance showed Jan. 21. Total shipments
from Malaysia in that period fell 20 percent, according to SGS.  The full-month “export figures may be worse than the first
20 days,” Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment
Bank Bhd., said by phone in  Kuala Lumpur . “China inventories
are also at a record high.”  Stockpiles at China’s major ports rose to a record 1.18
million tons, state-owned researcher Grain.gov.cn said Jan. 16.
Malaysian inventories reached an all-time high of 2.63 million
tons in December, prompting the government to cut export taxes.
The tariffs were reduced to zero for this month and will be
maintained at that level in February.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September dropped 0.3
percent to 7,120  yuan  ($1,145) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 0.2
percent to 8,834 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery lost 0.2 percent to $14.485 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for delivery
in March was little changed at 52.38 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
