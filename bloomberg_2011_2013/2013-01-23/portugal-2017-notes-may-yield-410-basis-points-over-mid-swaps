Portugal  sold 2.5 billion euros
($3.33 billion) of  five-year  bonds through banks, the first
offering of that maturity in almost two years as it makes
progress in regaining access to long-term debt markets.  The 4.35 percent bonds due in October 2017 were allotted at
a yield of 4.891 percent and attracted 12 billion euros of bids,
Secretary of State for Treasury Maria Luis Albuquerque said
yesterday. About 93 percent were sold to overseas investors,
including 33 percent to the U.S., 29 percent to the U.K. and 9
percent to  Asia , the debt agency said. About 60 percent were
taken up by asset managers and 24 percent by  hedge funds .  “We’re interested in rebuilding all of Portugal’s yield
curve, which will imply issuing 10-year debt at a given time and
when adequate,”  Albuquerque  said at a press conference in
Lisbon. Portugal will conduct other bond sales, she said,
without providing dates.  The country’s  five-year  yield fell to 4.77 percent today,
the lowest since December 2010, before rising seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.97 percent at 2:32 p.m.
in London. The yield has declined from a record 23 percent in
January 2012.  Ten-year bonds yielded 5.98 percent. The extra yield
investors demand to hold the securities instead of similar-
maturity German bunds has narrowed to 4.45 percentage points
from a euro-era record 16 percentage points in January 2012.  Ireland, Italy  Portugal’s  10-year yield  fell below 6 percent this week for
the first time since December 2010, encouraging the country to
join Ireland,  Italy  and  Spain  in extending the maturity of its
debt sales.  Governments in the nations are seeking to tap resurgent
demand for their debt amid optimism  Europe ’s three-year-old
financial crisis is abating. While Portugal has maintained bill
sales since requesting a bailout in April 2011, it hadn’t
offered bonds.  Portugal hired Barclays Plc,  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,
Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley for yesterday’s sale, the
debt agency said on its  website . The country’s securities are
rated junk by  Standard & Poor’s ,  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s
Investors Service.  “With this issue, Portugal is taking a further step to
regaining full access to the debt markets and restoring its
credibility,” Tiago Veiga Anjos, an analyst at  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  in
Oporto, Portugal, wrote today in a research note.  Aid Request  Portugal requested a bailout from the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund  in 2011 after a surge in debt
and borrowing costs. The government is seeking to narrow the
deficit to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and
will cut the deficit below the EU’s 3 percent limit in 2014,
when it targets a 2.5 percent gap.  Portuguese borrowing costs fell when it sold a combined 2.5
billion euros of three-, 12- and 18-month bills on Jan. 16, its
first auction of 2013. The debt agency allotted the 12-month
securities at an average yield of 1.609 percent, the lowest
since April 2010.  Portugal has to meet a 5.8 billion-euro bond redemption in
September without relying on the EU-led rescue program, which
lasts until the middle of 2014. The IMF forecasts the nation’s
 debt  will peak at 122.3 percent of GDP in 2014, assuming it
returns to bond markets in the middle of this year and yields on
medium- and long-term debt decline to 5 percent from 7 percent.  Previous Auction  Portugal’s previous bond auction was in April 2011 when it
sold 1.6 billion euros of securities due in June 2012 at an
average yield of 5.793 percent. The debt agency on Oct. 3
exchanged 3.76 billion euros of notes maturing in September 2013
for the same value of those due in October 2015, reducing its
2013 repayment burden.  Spain sold 7 billion euros of 10-year bonds on Jan. 22, a
sale Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said had the biggest
demand in the nation’s history. Ireland allotted 2.5 billion
euros of bonds on Jan. 8 and Italy used banks for a 15-year debt
sale on Jan. 15.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  has said the
ECB may undertake debt purchases for euro-area nations under
bailout programs when they regain bond-market access.  The measures, called Outright Monetary Transactions, “would
not apply to countries that are under a full-adjustment program”
until they have “full-market access,” Draghi said Oct. 4. The
OMT isn’t a replacement for primary-market access, he said.  “Albuquerque hinted that a 10-year issue could be next,
after which Portugal may be OMT eligible,” Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc strategists Claire Tucker and Giles Gale
wrote in a note to clients. “The front-end looks attractive at
current levels,” they wrote, referring to shorter-maturity
Portuguese securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
