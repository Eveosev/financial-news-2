Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
largest gold producer, reported a 15 percent decline in output
in the second quarter that missed analyst estimates.  Production was 492,906 ounces in the three months ended
Dec. 31, from 579,073 ounces a year earlier, the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. The median estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 509,000 ounces. The company’s
cost of production rose 23 percent to A$1,031 ($1,084) an ounce.  Newcrest kept its annual production forecast from August
and forecasts it to be at the low end of a range of 2.3 million
to 2.5 million ounces. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of four analysts before the report was 2.24 million ounces.
Newcrest rose 1.8 percent to A$23.98 at the close in Sydney. The
S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.5 percent.  It was “a marginally softer quarter than what might have
been, with Gosowong and Hidden Valley under-delivering,” Credit
Suisse AG analysts  Michael Slifirski  and Sam Webb said today in
a note to clients, referring to the company’s mines in  Indonesia 
and  Papua New Guinea . They had expected Newcrest to report
output of 500,000 ounces last quarter.  Production growth will come from its Cadia East expansion
in New South Wales and the Lihir project in Papua New Guinea,
said Newcrest. The cost of those projects is almost 8 percent
higher than forecast due to delays.  Gold producers are expanding mines and boosting output to
cope with rising costs and benefit from prices that have
increased for 12 consecutive years. Spot gold prices gained 7
percent last year as Asian demand rose and central banks boosted
purchases.  “Given the weak start, a significant catch up will be
required in the second half” to meet the target, said the
Credit Suisse analysts. “The main driver will be the ramp up of
Lihir, which is a couple of weeks behind plan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
