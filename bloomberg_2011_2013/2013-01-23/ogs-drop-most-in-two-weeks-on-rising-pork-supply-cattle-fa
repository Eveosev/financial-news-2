Hog prices fell the most in two
weeks on signs of increasing U.S. supplies of pork. Cattle
futures also slid.  Warehouses held 554.4 million pounds (about 251,000 metric
tons) of pork at the end of December, up 14 percent from a  year 
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday in a
report released after the close of trading. Chicken-meat
inventories were 7.9 percent larger than a year earlier, and
beef supplies rose 1.8 percent, USDA data show.  “The cold storage not only was a little bit heavy on the
pork, poultry came in higher and so did beef,”  Mark Schultz ,
the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “We came in a
little bit heavier than what the trade was expecting.”  Hog futures for April settlement declined 0.7 percent to
87.65 cents a pound at 9:41 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price would be the biggest slump for
the most-active contract since Jan. 9.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to $1.30
a pound in Chicago. Prices are down 1.4 percent this month
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slid 0.6 percent
to $1.4615 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
