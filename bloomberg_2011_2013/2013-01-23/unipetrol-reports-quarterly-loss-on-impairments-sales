Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the largest Czech
refiner, said it incurred a loss in the fourth quarter on
impairment charges and lower sales of gasoline.  Net loss in the three months through December reached 3.1
billion koruna ($161 million), half the 6.2 billion-koruna loss
reported a year earlier, the Prague-based company said in a
statement on its website today. In the third quarter, Unipetrol
reported a 645 million-koruna profit.  Unipetrol wrote off 4.37 billion koruna in impairments on
fixed assets in the refinery segment, bringing earnings before
interest and tax down to a 4.47 billion-koruna loss. Revenue in
the quarter fell 8 percent to 26.3 billion koruna as demand for
both refinery products and gasoline fell.  “The retail segment was negatively affected by lower sales
volumes, mainly in gasoline, partly caused by fuel imports
within the grey economy,” Piotr Wielowieyski, vice chairman of
the board, said in the statement.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN) , which controls 63 percent of Unipetrol, said
today it incurred a fourth-quarter loss of 276.5 million zloty
($88.3 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
