Iamgold Corp. (IMG) , a producer of gold in
Suriname and  Burkina Faso , dropped the most in two months after
forecasting higher operating costs for 2013 as it mines lower-
grade ore and starts up its Westwood project.  The shares  fell  9.4 percent to C$9.78 at 11 a.m. in
Toronto. The company earlier declined 10 percent, the most
intraday since Nov. 14.  Total so-called cash costs will be $850 to $925 an ounce,
the Toronto-based company said in a statement yesterday after
the close of regular trading. For 2012, costs were probably
within 3 percent of the upper end of an Aug. 13 forecast of $670
to $695, it said.  The company’s estimated net present value was cut by about
10 percent because of higher costs, David Haughton, an analyst
at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, said in a note yesterday.
Haughton lowered his target price to $14 from $16 and revised
his recommendation to hold from buy. Steven Butler, an analyst
at Canaccord Financial Inc. in Toronto, reduced his target to
$12.75 from $15.25 and cut his rating to hold from buy.  Iamgold also said 2013 attributable gold production will be
875,000 ounces to 950,000 ounces, compared with 830,000 ounces
last year. Gold output will grow by about 80 percent over the
next five years to 1.4 million to 1.6 million ounces by 2017,
the company said.  Project feasibility studies at the Rosebel mine in Suriname
and Niobec, Iamgold’s niobium operation in  Canada , “may improve
the outlook for the company,” Haughton said.  Iamgold also published an updated resource update for its
Cote gold project in northern Ontario, which the company
acquired when it bought bought Trelawney Mining and Exploration
Inc. last year. Indicated resources at the project more than
doubled, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
