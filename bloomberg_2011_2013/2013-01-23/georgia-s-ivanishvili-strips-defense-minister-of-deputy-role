Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili stripped Irakli Alasania of his position as deputy
premier, without giving reasons, according to a statement
published today on the government website.  Alasania will retain his post as defense minister, Rusudan
Tsimakuridze, a ministry spokeswoman, said by phone.  “We decided that the  Defense Ministry  is a very important
area and requires more attention,” Alasania told reporters in
the capital, Tbilisi. “There’s no problem between the prime
minister and myself.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
