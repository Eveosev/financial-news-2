Penske Automotive Group Inc. (PAG) ,  Group
1 Automotive Inc. (GPI)  and  Lithia Motors Inc. (LAD)  reached record prices
after a KeyBanc Capital Markets report about the auto retailers
cited a “confident” outlook on U.S. vehicle sales.  Penske gained 4.2 percent to $32.32 at the close in
 New York , the highest since its 1996 initial public offering.
Group 1, which began trading in 1997, increased 4.9 percent to
$68.05. Lithia, which held its IPO in 1996, rose 2.7 percent
to $42.09.  Brett Hoselton, a KeyBanc analyst in  Cleveland , changed his
ratings on Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Penske and Houston-
based Group 1 to buy from hold. He also reiterated a buy rating
for Medford, Oregon-based Lithia while raising his price target
to $46 from $41.  “We are incrementally more confident” about light-vehicle
sales, KeyBanc said in a report in which Hoselton was the lead
author. The sales have risen at least 10 percent in each of the
past three years and, based on the average of 18 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, may climb to 15.1 million this
year from 14.5 million in 2012. Consumers are replacing cars and
trucks that are, on average, the oldest ever on U.S. roads.  KeyBanc also said in the report that “we are now bullish
on the acquisitions outlook” for the auto retailers.  Penske said in November and October that it bought
dealerships in Wisconsin and California that will contribute
about $255 million of annual revenue. Group 1 said earlier this
month that it acquired a Kia dealership in Kansas that it
expects to generate about $65 million a year in sales, after
disclosing the purchase of a Ford outlet in Georgia in December
with expected annual revenue of $70 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
