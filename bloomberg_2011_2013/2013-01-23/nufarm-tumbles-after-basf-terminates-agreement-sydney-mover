Nufarm Ltd., (NUF)   Australia ’s largest
supplier of farm chemicals, headed for its biggest drop since
2010 in Sydney after saying it will lose BASF AG’s distribution
rights next year and its local unit will miss its profit target.  The stock fell as much as 9 percent to A$5.76, poised for
its largest decline since July 16, 2010. It was down 8.7 percent
at A$5.78 as of 12:27 p.m. local time. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 0.3 percent.  BASF advised this week it will terminate its distribution
agreement to sell BASF crop-protection products in Australia
starting from March next year, ending a 10-year contract, the
Melbourne-based company said today in a statement. Nufarm also
said “more challenging” trading conditions in Australia have
hurt profit in the country, although it maintained its global
forecast for higher underlying first-half profit.  The Australia and New Zealand operations in the half year
ending Jan. 31, as well as the full-year result, are expected to
be “well down” on the previous year, Nufarm said.  “While the Australian results will be below
expectations,” Nufarm’s “business in other parts of the world
has performed more strongly than expected, particularly in  South
America  and  Europe ,” the company said.  Annual sales generated by BASF products distributed by
Nufarm Australia and unit Crop Care since 2004 are less than 10
percent of total Australian revenues and less than 3 percent of
Nufarm’s global sales, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
