Agricultural commodity-futures
markets require tighter regulation to avoid a distorted balance
between physical and futures trading, said Stephane Le Foll,
 France ’s farm minister.  The food crisis of 2008 showed a need “to be vigilant
about the way we allow markets to function, but also how we
frame them,” Le Foll said at a grain-industry meeting in Paris
today. “We have to be more strict on the framework.”  Le Foll said while there is “always a need” for
agricultural futures markets, they should function primarily to
provide price-risk coverage for producers and users. A framework
is needed to avoid “a blow up of the equilibrium between
physical and futures markets,” he said.  World  food prices  as tracked by the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization have more than doubled in the past
decade. The U.S. State Department estimates surging food prices
triggered more than 60 riots worldwide from 2007 to 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
