Low interest rates and quantitative
easing will boost investor purchases of gold and buoy prices
this year, Morgan Stanley said, even as it lowered its forecast
for the precious metal. Platinum may advance as supplies
tighten.  “We remain bullish on the gold price outlook in 2013
despite recent selling pressure triggered by market concerns of
an earlier-than-previously-anticipated tightening in U.S.
monetary policy,” analysts  Peter Richardson  and Joel Crane
wrote in a report today. The bank expects gold to average $1,773
an ounce this year, 4 percent less than an earlier forecast.
Prices may gain to $1,845 in 2014.  Gold climbed for a 12th year in 2012, the longest run of
annual gains in at least nine decades as governments from the
U.S. to  Europe  and Japan boosted stimulus to buoy economic
recoveries.  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  and Credit Suisse Group AG, the
most-accurate gold forecasters, predict prices will probably
peak this year as central-bank stimulus will sustain buying as a
hedge against inflation and  currency devaluation .  “We are skeptical that dissenters within the FOMC on
current monetary policy will succeed in overturning the current
policy settings before the end of 2014, given lingering tail
risks to growth and still elevated levels of U.S.
unemployment,” Morgan Stanley said. Low  interest rates , an
ongoing commitment to quantitative easing and a below-par
recovery with pressure on the dollar will still combine to
encourage investment buying, despite elevated prices, it said.  Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,684.45
an ounce at 7:16 a.m. in  Singapore , after declining 0.4 percent
yesterday. Prices climbed 7.1 percent in 2012.  The U.S. House of Representatives voted yesterday to
temporarily suspend the nation’s borrowing limit, removing the
debt ceiling for now as a tool for seeking deeper spending cuts.
The measure, passed 285-144, lifts the government’s $16.4
trillion borrowing limit until May 19.  The platinum market will see a “negligible” surplus in
2013 after production cuts by  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
world’s biggest producer, according to Morgan Stanley. Prices
may average $1,700 an ounce in the first quarter and $1,710 in
the second quarter, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
