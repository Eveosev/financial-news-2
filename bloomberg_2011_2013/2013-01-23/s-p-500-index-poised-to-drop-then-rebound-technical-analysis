The rally that sent the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  to a five-year high may stall in the coming
week before resuming over the next month, according to a report
by Bespoke Investment Group LLC.  More than three quarters of the stocks in the U.S. equity
benchmark were trading at least one standard deviation above
their  average prices  from the past 50 days, the note said. The
S&P 500 averaged a 0.6 percent decline in the following week
when more than 75 percent of its companies were “overbought,”
according to Bespoke. It rose by an average of 1.1 percent in
the following month and 2.8 percent after three months, the
research firm wrote, citing seven previous instances since 1990.  “If the trends of the last seven extreme overbought
readings are any indication, the  S&P 500  tends to see some
short-term weakness, but then it bounces back once overbought
levels are worked off,” Bespoke said in today’s note.  The S&P 500 gained 4.7 percent in January through yesterday
for the best start to a year since 1997. The gauge surged to the
highest level since December 2007 as companies including General
Electric Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported better-than-
estimated  earnings  and lawmakers agreed on measures to avoid
more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax
increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
