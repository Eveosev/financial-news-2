Ethos Private Equity Ltd., South
 Africa ’s oldest private equity firm, raised $800 million from
global investors that include corporate pension and sovereign
wealth funds seeking to tap higher growth rates in Africa.  Ethos made two investments in the new Fund VI and is
weighing others after exceeding its target of raising $750
million, spokeswoman Chelsea Wilkinson said today by telephone
from Johannesburg. Ethos began raising cash about 18 months ago
for the fund and has invested in Waco International Ltd., a
building, construction and scaffolding company, and Kevro (Pty)
Ltd., a clothing and gifts corporate branding company, she said.  “The fund raising market has been tough,” Andre Roux, the
firm’s chief executive officer, said in a separate e-mailed
statement. “Investors are constrained. They are looking beyond
the developed markets for pockets of growth and have identified
South Africa’s potential as a gateway into sub-Saharan Africa.”  Ethos said in January last year that it bought a 72 percent
stake in Kervo for 850 million rand ($108 million). The firm
hasn’t publicly disclosed the amount it paid for Waco, Wilkinson
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
