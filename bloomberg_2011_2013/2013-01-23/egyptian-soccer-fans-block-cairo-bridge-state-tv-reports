Fans of the Egyptian Al-Ahly soccer
club briefly blocked Cairo’s Sixth of October bridge, state
television reported, before a court hearing relating to deadly
violence that erupted after a game last year.  The fans, known as “Ultras”, lit small fires to stop cars
from passing, the television station said today. The bridge was
later reopened, it said.  About 300 fans staged an earlier protest outside the stock
exchange building, demanding speedy punishment for those
responsible for more than 70 deaths following a match between
al-Ahly and the rival al-Masri club in Port Said last year, the
state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  The prosecutor general has submitted new evidence in the
case before a scheduled hearing on Jan. 26, MENA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
