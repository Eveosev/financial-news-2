Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is set to
boost its use of drilling rigs to a record this year as it
pushes exploration for oil and shale gas into the  Red Sea , a
local energy analyst said.  Saudi Aramco , as the world’s largest crude exporter is
known, will probably use about 163 rigs this year, up from 133
at the end of 2012, said Sadad al-Husseini, who founded  Husseini
Energy , an independent energy consultant in Dhahran,  Saudi
Arabia , after retiring from the state producer in 2004.  Aramco was using 98 rigs to produce oil and gas from
onshore fields and perform maintenance on existing wells at the
end of last year, with a further 35 employed in exploration
activity and offshore operations, al-Husseini said. This year,
the company may use as many as 170 rigs in total should the
country step up production of oil or gas, thus activating more
rigs, he said.  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , the world’s largest oilfield-services
provider, also expects a gain in Saudi drilling activity. Saudi
Aramco ended 2012 with 134 rigs and that number will grow to 160
rigs by the end of this year, Schlumberger Chief Executive
Officer Paal Kibsgaard told analysts and investors on Jan. 18 in
a conference call.  Al-Husseini had been executive vice president for
exploration and development at Aramco before he retired. Saudi
Aramco doesn’t publish information on how many rigs it has in
operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
