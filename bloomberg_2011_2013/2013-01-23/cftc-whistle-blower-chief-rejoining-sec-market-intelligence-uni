(Corrects spelling of Martinez’s first name in first
paragraph.)   Vincente Martinez, who helped start
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission market intelligence
office before stepping down in 2011, is returning to lead the
unit responsible for evaluating tips, complaints and referrals.  Martinez will rejoin the SEC next month from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, where he was the first director of
the agency’s whistle-blower office. In his prior stint at the
SEC, he worked for eight years in the enforcement division and
became an assistant director of the market intelligence office
when it was created as part of a restructuring of the unit.  “Our Office of Market Intelligence employs next-generation
technology and data analysis to inform and drive our enforcement
effort and priorities in the years to come,” SEC enforcement
director  Robert Khuzami  said in a statement. “Vince has the
vision and dedication to lead that effort given his talent,
commitment, and prior service to the SEC.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
