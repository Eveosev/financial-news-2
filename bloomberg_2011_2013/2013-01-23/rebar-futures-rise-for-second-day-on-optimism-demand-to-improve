Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose for a second day amid speculation demand may
improve after  China ’s Lunar New Year holiday.  Rebar for May delivery gained as much as 0.6 percent to
4,009  yuan  ($645) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
and traded at 3,992 yuan at 11:30 a.m. local time.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., China’s biggest publicly traded
steelmaker, yesterday raised prices for the second time in a
month. Demand from builders, the biggest steel users in China,
may increase after the new year holiday, which ends Feb. 15, as
construction sites resume operations as the weather turns warmer.  “The price hike by big mills boosted investor confidence
that demand will pick up after the holiday,” said Cao Yanghui,
steel and metal analyst with Nanhua Futures Co. in Hangzhou.
“Raw material costs are also underpinning prices.”  Jiangsu Shagang Group Co., the nation’s biggest non-state
owned mill, also raised prices this week, Cao said, without
elaborating.  The  average spot price of rebar  added 0.03 percent to 3,731
yuan a ton yesterday, the first gain since Jan. 7, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Spot iron
ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $145.90 a dry ton yesterday,
according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
