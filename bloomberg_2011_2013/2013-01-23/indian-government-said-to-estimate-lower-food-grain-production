India , the second-biggest grower of
wheat and rice, may estimate that the food-grain harvest in
2012-2013 will drop 3.8 percent from a year earlier after a
below-average monsoon, said two officials with direct knowledge.  Farmers may reap about 250 million metric tons in the year
ending June 30, from a record 260 million tons, said the two
government officials, asking not to be identified before the
forecast is released in the first week of February. The wheat
crop should be 90 million tons to 93 million tons, they said.
The harvest was a record 93.9 million tons in 2011-2012,
according to the farm ministry.  Manoj Pandey, a spokesman for the ministry, declined to
comment on the output figures.  Production of food grains sown during the monsoon and
harvested from October may drop 9.8 percent to 117.18 million
tons, according to the ministry’s estimate. The grains include
rice, corn and lentils. Harvesting of wheat, the biggest winter-
sown crop, usually begins in March.  Even a smaller food-grain harvest should be enough to meet
domestic demand after two consecutive years of rising output.
State  reserves  of rice and wheat were 66.7 million tons as of
Jan. 1, compared with the government’s buffer requirement of 25
million tons, according to the Food Corp. of India.  To contact the reporters on this story:
