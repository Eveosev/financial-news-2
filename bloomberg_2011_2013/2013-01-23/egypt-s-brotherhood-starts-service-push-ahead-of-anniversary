Egypt ’s Muslim Brotherhood said it’s
starting a campaign to improve public services, including free
health care for a million people, as the nation readies for the
second anniversary of the uprising that ousted  Hosni Mubarak .  The campaign, dubbed “Together We Build Egypt,” marks a
return to the Islamist group’s grassroots efforts that helped it
win millions of backers as the most powerful opposition movement
under Mubarak. The program will be backed by businesses and
civil-society groups and will include a push to upgrade or
renovate 2,000 schools nationwide, the state-run Al-Ahram
newspaper reported today.  The effort comes as President Mohamed Mursi and the
Brotherhood, which fielded him for office, face mounting
criticism from secularists and youth activists who accuse them
of monopolizing power. Mursi’s opponents are planning mass
protests on Jan. 25, calling for the revolution’s goals to be
realized and the Islamist-drafted constitution passed last month
in a referendum to be scrapped.  The Brotherhood’s political arm, the Freedom and Justice
Party, said on its website that it has already launched several
initiatives, including convoys to provide medical services such
as orthopedic, pediatric and gynecological check-ups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
