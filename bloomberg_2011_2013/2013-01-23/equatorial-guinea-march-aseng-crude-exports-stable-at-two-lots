Equatorial Guinea  plans to export
two cargoes of Aseng crude in March, the same amount as
scheduled for next month, according to a preliminary loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The two March consignments will be 950,000 barrels each,
compared with one 950,000-barrel lot and another of 600,000
barrels in February, the program shows.  The African nation will also ship three Zafiro cargoes and
two of Ceiba in March, according to earlier schedules. Daily
crude exports from the country are set to be 217,742 barrels
compared with 264,286 barrels next month.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
