U.K. government bonds rose for a
second day after the  International Monetary Fund  lowered its
growth forecasts for Britain’s economy, boosting demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  Benchmark  10-year yields  dropped to the lowest level in a
week as the IMF cut its global growth projection and predicted a
second year of contraction in the euro area. Gilts also advanced
after  Bank of England  Governor Mervyn King said yesterday there
was no easy route to economic recovery. The pound strengthened
for the first time in six days against the euro.  The IMF downgrade has “helped to give global bonds a bit
of a lift,” said Adam McCormack, head of gilt sales at Barclays
Plc in London. “The gilt market started off well this morning
after King’s speech last night.”  The 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage points, to 1.99 percent at 4:30 p.m. in  London . It
dropped to 1.98 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 16. The
1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022 gained 0.26, or
2.60 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 97.92.  The Washington-based IMF reduced its  growth prediction  for
the U.K. economy to 1 percent for this year, from a forecast of
1.1 percent in October. The estimate for 2014 was lowered to 1.9
percent from 2.2 percent.  The global economy will expand 3.5 percent this year, less
than the 3.6 percent forecast in October, the IMF said in an
update of its World Economic Outlook report.  Measures Needed  Government measures to strengthen the U.K. economy are
needed to underpin a “gentle recovery,” King said in a speech in
 Belfast  delivered to the  Confederation of British Industry .  “The challenge we face is not the inadequacy of the
framework, but the fact that there is no easy route to recovery
after a major banking crisis,” King said. “Recovery is
inevitably slow and protracted.”  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent this month
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bonds dropped 1.3 percent and Treasuries fell 0.3
percent, the indexes show.  The pound rose from near the weakest since February versus
the euro after a government report showed U.K. jobless claims
unexpectedly declined, suggesting the labor market remains
resilient even as the economy struggles to recover.  BOE Minutes  The U.K. currency also rallied after Bank of England
minutes released today showed only one member of the Monetary
Policy Committee voted against this month’s decision to pause
bond purchases, or quantitative easing. Policy makers voted 8-1
to keep the bond-buying plan at 375 billion pounds, according to
the minutes of the Jan. 10 meeting.  “The fact that the labor market is holding up could offer
sterling some support,” said  Chris Turner , head of foreign-
exchange strategy at ING Groep NV in London. “There was some
speculation a second member of the MPC could have voted for more
QE this month.”  The pound strengthened 0.2 percent to 83.94 pence per euro
after depreciating to 84.41 pence yesterday, the weakest level
since Feb. 29. Sterling was little changed at $1.5840.  Claims for jobless benefits fell by 12,100 in December to
1.56 million, the fewest since June 2011, the  Office for
National Statistics  said in London. Unemployment measured by
International Labour Organization methods declined to 7.7
percent in the three months through November, the lowest since
the quarter through April 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
