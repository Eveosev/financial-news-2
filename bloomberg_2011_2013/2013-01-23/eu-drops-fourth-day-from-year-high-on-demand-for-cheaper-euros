The leu retreated for a fourth day
from its strongest level in a year as Romanian companies and
individuals took advantage of cheaper euros to meet foreign-
currency requirements.  The currency slid 0.3 percent to 4.3723 per euro by 5 p.m.
in Bucharest, paring this month’s advance to 1.6 percent. Yields
on  Romania ’s June 2019 euro-denominated bonds rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.826 percent.  The leu appreciated to its highest level in a year on Jan.
16, the day after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said the country’s
domestic bonds are eligible for its emerging-market government
bond index. About 63 percent of private loans taken out in
Romania are denominated in foreign currencies, according to
central bank data.  “We expect the leu to gradually move toward 4.38 per euro
today, driven by net commercial demand for hard currency,”
Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-based economist at ING Bank Romania
SA, wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
