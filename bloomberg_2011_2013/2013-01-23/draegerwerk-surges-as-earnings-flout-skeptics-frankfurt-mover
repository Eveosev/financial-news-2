Draegerwerk AG & Co. rose the most
in 15 months in  Frankfurt  after the medical and aerospace
supplier said 2012 profit beat its own forecast, wrong-footing
skeptics who predicted a fourth-quarter margin squeeze.  Draegerwerk climbed as much as 8 percent, the most since
Oct. 6, 2011. The shares were up 7.1 percent at 87.25 euros as
of 11:55 a.m., giving the company a market value of 1.27 billion
euros ($1.69 billion). More than 160,000 shares were traded,
exceeding the average daily volume in the last three months
sixfold.  Earnings before interest and tax were as much as 9.7
percent of revenue last year, Luebeck, Germany-based Draegerwerk
said in a preliminary earnings statement last night. The company
previously forecast the Ebit margin to be midway between 8
percent and 9.5 percent.  “Sales and Ebit margin beat our estimates and that of the
market and the estimates the company gave in the third quarter;
that’s surprising,” Igor Kim, an analyst with Close Brothers
Seydler Research AG in Frankfurt, said in an interview. “Many
analysts expected fourth-quarter expenses would burden the
margin.”  Order intake “appeared strong,” with a 2.2 percent
increase excluding currency effects, which is positive for 2013,
Kim said. Of 14 analysts who rate Draegerwerk’s stock, 11 have
buy ratings, including Kim. Three advise holding the shares,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Draegerwerk, which is scheduled to publish final results on
March 12, said some expenses originally planned for the fourth
quarter weren’t incurred. Demand for ventilators “was
particularly strong,” it said.  Sales excluding currency effects this year should rise at
about the same rate as in 2012, it said. The company forecasts
an Ebit margin of 8 percent to 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
