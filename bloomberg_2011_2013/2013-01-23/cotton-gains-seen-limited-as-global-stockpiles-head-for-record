Cotton is set to trade between 70
cents and 80 cents a pound this year as China, the biggest buyer,
boosts stockpiles and global inventories climb to an all-time
high, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  World reserves may climb to a record 18 million metric tons
in 2012-2013, Singapore-based analyst Victor Thianpiriya said in
a report today. China’s inventories may total about 10 million
tons, more than enough to supply its needs for a year, he said.  Cotton dropped 20 percent in the past 12 months on concern
that rising output in China would cut imports and expand a
global surplus. World stockpiles before this year’s harvest will
jump 19 percent, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Jan. 11.
China’s reserves are rising as the government boosts purchases
to support domestic prices and farm incomes.  “Global prices in 2013 hinge on China’s policies on how
these reserves are managed and the release of Chinese import
quotas,” Thianpiriya said. “With implied volatility currently
low, this provides an attractive opportunity to use options to
trade our bearish view on cotton.”  Cotton for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to 79.76 cents
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  at 2 p.m. Singapore time. Prices
rose to 80.20 cents yesterday, the highest since May 15.  Global consumption is forecast to remain 14 percent below
the peak of 27 million tons in 2006-2007 and the stocks-to-use
ratio is the highest on record, he said, citing USDA estimates.
 China  will import 12.5 million bales of 480 pounds (218
kilograms) each in 2012-2013, down 49 percent from 24.53 million
bales a year earlier, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter for this story:
