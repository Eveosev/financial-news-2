China , the world’s largest emitter
of carbon dioxide, is seeking to cap the growth of electricity
consumption at 8 percent a year from 2010 to 2015, and will
limit the installation of new coal-fired power plants while
boosting the share that comes from wind, solar and nuclear.  In an outline of energy-development goals under the
country’s 12th five-year plan, China plans to reduce energy
consumption by 16 percent annually and carbon emissions by 17
percent, as measured per unit of gross domestic product, from
2010 to 2015, according to a  statement  today on the website of
China’s State Council, China’s cabinet.  The plan, which anticipates a near doubling of consumer
power consumption per capita, calls for China to get 11.4
percent of its electricity from non-fossil sources by 2015, up
from 8.6 percent in 2010, while reducing coal’s share of
generating capacity from 68 percent in 2010 to less than 65
percent.  China had a total of 39 gigawatts of renewable-energy
capacity in 2012, according to  Bloomberg New Energy Finance.   Under the plan, power generated by solar plants will
increase by 89.5 percent a year over the same period, wind
capacity will increase 26.4 percent, nuclear power by 29.9
percent, natural gas by 16.2 percent and coal by 7.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
