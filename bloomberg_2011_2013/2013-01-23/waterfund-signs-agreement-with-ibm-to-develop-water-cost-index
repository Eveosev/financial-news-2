Waterfund LLC, which provides
financial risk management to the water industry, signed an
agreement with  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  to develop
a water cost index. Terms weren’t disclosed.  “Our initiative with IBM Research will finally bring real
financial transparency to the water sector,” Chief Executive
Officer Scott Rickards said today in a statement. By calculating
the unsubsidized cost of freshwater production using IBM
analytics, New York-based Waterfund can offer “flexibly-
tailored financial tools to investors in water infrastructure.”  According to the  United Nations , water use has been growing
at more than twice the rate of population increase over the last
century as urbanization and climate change accelerate demands on
supplies. An estimated 41 percent of the world’s population now
lives in water-stressed areas.  Water utilities face the most obvious financial risks from
supply disruptions, though industries in which water
availability is critical include the mining, beverage, chemical
and energy sectors, Waterfund said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
