Light Louisiana Sweet crude produced
in the Gulf of Mexico gained versus West Texas Intermediate as
the U.S. benchmark dropped after Seaway pipeline’s ability to
ship oil south from the Midwest was limited.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  said capacity on its Seaway
pipeline that links the Cushing, Oklahoma, oil storage hub to
the Gulf Coast had run into “unforeseen constraints.”  WTI’s  discount  to international benchmark Brent increased
after Enterprise said in a notice to shippers that deliveries
into its Jones Creek, Texas, terminal south of Houston would be
limited to 175,000 barrels a day. The line was in the process of
increasing to 400,000 barrels a day.  The spread widened $1.83 a barrel to $17.57 a barrel, based
on settlement prices. Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 75
cents to $19.75 above WTI as of 2:31 p.m, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  WTI’s discount to Brent had narrowed to $15.16 Jan. 17 from
more than $25 in November after Seaway finished the expansion,
increasing the amount of crude oil that shippers can send from
the over-supplied depot in Cushing to refineries in the  Texas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
