First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  advanced to the
highest level in more than four years on bets the Abu Dhabi-
based lender will boost its full-year dividend above its peers
when it reports results next week.  Shares of the bank, which is controlled by  Abu Dhabi ’s
ruling family, rose 2.1 percent to 12.10 dirhams, the strongest
level since August 2008, at the close in Abu Dhabi. The stock
led a gain of 1.1 percent for the benchmark  ADX General Index (ADSMI) ,
the biggest advance since Jan. 2. First Gulf Bank, which was the
second-best performing bank on the gauge last year, has
increased 3 percent this week.  First Gulf Bank will offer a 7 percent dividend yield,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimated in October, raising its price
estimate for the bank to 13.5 dirhams. That compares with 4.5
percent for the ADX Banks Index. Net income for 2012 probably
climbed 7 percent to 3.97 billion dirhams (1.08 billion), the
 average  estimate of 12 analysts compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “Investors are anticipating handsome dividends for 2012”
amid higher profitability, said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.  First Gulf Bank will probably post the fastest loan growth
in the  United Arab Emirates  in 2013, helping boost profit, EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE said last month, maintaining its buy rating
on the stock.  Sixteen analysts recommend investors buy the shares of
First Gulf Bank, and one has a sell rating on the stock,
according  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The bank will probably
post results on Jan. 28, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
