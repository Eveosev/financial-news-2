Brazil  will lower energy costs this
year by more than the government initially announced and move up
the date that the cuts go into effect in an effort to rein in
consumer prices that have remained above the central bank’s
target since August 2010.  “Beyond anticipating the enforcement of the new rates, the
cut is bigger than previously announced,” President Dilma Rousseff said in a nationally-televised address today.  The cuts that go into effect tomorrow rather than early
next month call for lowering consumer power costs by 18 percent
and those for industry by 32 percent compared to the reductions
of 16.2 percent and 28 percent announced by the president in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
