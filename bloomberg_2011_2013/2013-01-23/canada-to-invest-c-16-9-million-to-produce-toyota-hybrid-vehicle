The Canadian government will provide
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Canadian manufacturing unit a loan of about
C$16.9 million ($16.9 million) to help produce a hybrid version
of the Lexus sport utility vehicle in Ontario, Prime Minister
Stephen Harper said today.  The project will create about 400 jobs at Toyota’s
Cambridge, Ontario plant and the vehicle is expected to begin
production in 2014, according to a statement. The investment is
part of the government’s Automotive Innovation Fund, a five-
year, C$250-million plan to support research and development for
automotive companies in  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
