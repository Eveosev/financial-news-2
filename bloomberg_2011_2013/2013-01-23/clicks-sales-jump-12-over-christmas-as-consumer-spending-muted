Clicks Group Ltd. (CLS) , a South African
health-care retailer and pharmacy chain-owner, said sales for
the 18 weeks to Dec. 30 rose 12 percent as  consumer spending 
remained muted over the Christmas period.  Revenue was 6.0 billion rand ($670 million), up from 5.3
billion last year, the Cape Town-based company said in a
statement. Sales at its chain of stores advanced by 8 percent
compared with a similar increase a year earlier. Sales growth at
its Musica division, a seller of DVDs and CDs, declined to 1
percent from 5.2 percent a year earlier as it closed seven
stores over the period.  “The trend of consumers delaying their purchases until
closer to Christmas continued while consumers were increasingly
value conscious this festive season,” Chief Executive Officer
David Kneale said in the statement. United Pharmaceutical
Distributors, another Clicks unit, reported sales growth of 20
percent over the period.  The South African economy probably expanded at the slowest
pace since the 2009 recession last year, putting pressure on
consumer spending. Fellow South African retailers  Mr Price Group
Ltd. (MPC)  and  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  put out worse-than-expected
trading updates last week, causing a sell-off in retail stocks.  Clicks rose 0.4 percent to 58.20 rand by 10:36 a.m. in
Johannesburg. It has declined 11 percent to three-month lows in
the year to date. The company will release its financial results
for the half year through February on or about April 25, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
