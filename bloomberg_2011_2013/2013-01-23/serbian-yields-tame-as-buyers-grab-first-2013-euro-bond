Serbia ’s borrowing costs were
unchanged in the first sale of euro-denominated debt this year
as investor demand helps keep a lid on yields.  The government raised 30 million euros ($40 million) in a
sale of three-year bonds today priced to yield 4.875 percent,
equivalent to the coupon, or 27 basis points above the average
bid rate, the Debt Management Agency in Belgrade said. Investors
sought to buy 42.85 million euros worth of the debt.  Demand is generated by “risk appetite and a lack of
investment alternatives” after Serbia secured financing for the
first half of 2013 amid plans to raise $2 billion from Eurobond
sales and $1 billion from a Russian loan this year, Hrvoje Stojic, chief analyst at Hypo Alpe Adria Bank DD in Zagreb, said
in a note to clients today.  Today’s 4.875 percent average yield, which matched the rate
at the last sale of euro-denominated debt on Dec. 31, compared
with the 13.95 percent Serbia paid on Dec. 4 to borrow dinars
over three years. Serbia’s neighbor  Romania  paid an average
yield of 3.14 percent on three-year euro-denominated debt sold
yesterday.  The debt agency has set a 10 percent coupon on all except
one of its dinar debt sales in the first quarter. The exception
is a Feb. 5 sale of a two-year bond with an annual coupon linked
to the central bank’s benchmark rate, currently 11.5 percent,
and an undefined margin on top. Serbia paid a 4 percent fixed
margin on top of the central bank’s benchmark of 10.25 percent
in an Aug. 1, 2012, debut offer of 10 billion dinars.  Yields Rise  The yields on Serbia’s five-year Eurobond stood at 4.153
percent and at 4.975 percent on the 10-year Eurobond at 1:23
p.m. in Belgrade, marking respective increases of 15 basis
points and 20 basis points since touching their lowest level on
Jan. 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While Serbia has outperformed regional peers in recent
months, “renewed political noise, uncertain prospects of an IMF
agreement and likely new issuance should cap performance,”
Barclays Capital emerging-markets analysts in  London  including
Eldar Vakhitov said in a Jan. 22 note to clients. They advised
switching from Serbian five-year and 10-year bonds to Hungarian
debt maturing in 2020 and 2021.  Serbia plans to sell a new Eurobond as soon as next month
at a rate below 5 percent, regardless of whether it reaches an
agreement beforehand with the  International Monetary Fund ,
Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said in a Jan. 15 interview.  The government has pledged to cut its 2013 fiscal gap to
3.6 percent of gross domestic product from 6.7 percent last
year. The IMF has said that’s too optimistic and that measures
to reach the deficit target lack the necessary commitment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
