Even if Fido prefers steak, his
ability to digest gruel instead may provide a key clue to dogs’
evolutionary transformation from wolves, according to research
published today in the journal  Nature .  Scientists who compared the dog’s full gene sequence with
that of wolves found about 36 regions that may have been changed
during domestication. Among genes affected were three that play
a role in how the animals digest starch, the study showed.  The research adds another facet to the debate over how dogs
morphed from adversary to ally some 10,000 years or more ago.
Tweaks in the starch-digestion genes may be evidence that dogs’
carnivorous ancestors adapted to scavenge for scraps from waste
dumps outside the camps of humans who were just settling down to
grow crops, said Erik Axelsson, an assistant professor of
evolutionary genetics at  Sweden ’s  Uppsala University .  “It must have been crucial for early dogs to be able to
thrive on a diet that was a lot more rich in starch,” Axelsson,
one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview. “It
wasn’t so much a question of whether I like to eat this porridge
or root or whatever it could have been, but that I need to eat
it.”  There are parallels in the changes that occurred in humans
themselves as their bodies adapted to better digest the new food
source, according to Axelsson. The development of agriculture
“may have been the factor that got the domestication process
started,” he said.  The researchers used pooled DNA from 12 wolves and 60 dogs
from 14 different breeds for the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
