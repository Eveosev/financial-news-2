France’s Socialist government has
appealed to British business leaders concerned about a possible
U.K. exit from the European Union to cross the English Channel.  “If Great Britain decides to leave Europe, we will roll
out the red carpet for you,” French Finance Minister Laurent
Fabius told a U.K. business group recently, he recounted on
France Info radio today.  Fabius’s proposition contrasts with Britain’s bid to
exploit higher taxes imposed by France last year. In October,
London Mayor  Boris Johnson  sought to woo talented French
immigrants to the U.K. capital away from the “tyranny” he says
they were suffering under President  Francois Hollande ’s tax
increases.  “We say to the people, not since 1789 has there been such
tyranny in France,” Johnson joked, referring to the year of the
French revolution. “I am very keen to welcome talented French
people to London.” He noted that there are already 240,000
French nationals in the capital.  Fabius’s turn came as U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
gave a speech promising voters a referendum on whether Britain
should leave the EU and backing a single economic market as
opposed to the political union among 27 nations.  “You can’t do Europe a la carte,” Fabius said.  “It
risks being dangerous for  Great Britain  itself.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
