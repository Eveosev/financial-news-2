Stephen Pagliuca, a managing
director at Bain Capital LLC, said going private would help  Dell
Inc. (DELL)  as it seeks to cut its reliance on personal computer sales.  “When companies are undergoing some transformation -- slow
growth, new products -- it’s really hard to be public,”
Pagliuca said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s
 Erik Schatzker  at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland. As a public company, “you have to make the
earnings every quarter, so becoming private is probably a good
thing for Dell,” Pagliuca said.  Dell, the third-biggest maker of personal computers, is
getting closer to clinching a leveraged buyout with private-
equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC, and Microsoft Corp. is
planning to provide part of the funding, people with knowledge
of the matter said yesterday.  Michael Dell , chief executive officer of the Round Rock,
Texas-based company he founded, has been using acquisitions to
sell more products to businesses as consumers shun PCs in favor
of tablets and smartphones, including devices that run Apple
Inc. and Google Inc. software that competes with Microsoft
Windows.  Pagliuca joined Boston-based Bain in 1989 and focuses on
investments in technology, media, telecommunications and
financial services. Bain oversees $67 billion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
