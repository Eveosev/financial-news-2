Belize defaulted bond prices climbed
as the government and creditors near agreement on a
restructuring.  The price on Belize’s 8.5 percent dollar bonds maturing in
2029 gained 2.7 percent to 55.99 cents on the dollar at 3:47
p.m.  New York  time. The bonds have climbed from a low of 30.5
cents on Aug. 15 after the government missed a $23 million
coupon payment.  The restructuring may value the defaulted debt at as much
as 70 cents on the dollar, more than double what the government
initially put forward in a proposal last year, Carl Ross, a
managing director at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, said in a
report today.  “The end result is likely to be significantly more
generous to bondholders than the initial offer,” Ross wrote,
adding that his analysis was based on “incomplete
information.”  Prime Minister Dean Barrow said Jan. 21 that an accord with
bondholders would be announced within two weeks and save the
Central American nation formerly known as British Honduras $33
million this year. Barrow originally said a deal over the
country’s $544 million “superbond” would be announced by mid-
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
