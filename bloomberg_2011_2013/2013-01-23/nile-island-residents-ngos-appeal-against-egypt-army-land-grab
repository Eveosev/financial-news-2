Lawyers and non-government
organizations have filed an appeal against a decision to turn
part of an island in Cairo into a military zone.  The appeal seeks to overturn the decision by President
Mohamed Mursi and the  Defense Ministry  to make part of Qursaya
Island on the Nile into a military zone of “strategic
importance,” the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social
Rights, one of the NGOs, said in a statement today.  Residents of the island clashed with security forces in
November during an attempt at forced eviction, leaving one
inhabitant dead. The military trial of 25 civilians from the
island is due to resume next week.  The army argues the island’s residents are on military
property, despite a 2010 court verdict overruling previous
eviction orders and recognizing the inhabitants’ right to live
and work on the island,  Human Rights Watch  said in November. The
group estimated that it has about 2,000 inhabitants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
