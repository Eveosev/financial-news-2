China ’s 21-day money-market rate
climbed for the first time this week on speculation banks are
hoarding cash to meet month-end  capital requirements  and holiday
cash withdrawals.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for an offering of
seven- and 14-day reverse repurchase contracts tomorrow,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. The
central bank said on Jan. 18 it will conduct short-term
liquidity operations, in addition to the reverse repo auctions
held every Tuesday and Thursday, to improve cash supply. Local
markets will be shut from Feb. 11 through Feb. 15 for the Lunar
New Year holiday.  “Money-market rates will go higher before the holiday,”
said Chen Lan, a bond analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. in
 Shanghai . “But the liquidity operations will help prevent such
serious cash shortage.”  The 21-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, rose 31 basis points, or 0.31 percentage
point, to 3.43 percent as of 10:37 a.m. in Shanghai, according
to a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed two
basis points to 3.21 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the 3.25 percent government bonds due
September 2019 dropped one basis point to 3.45 percent,
according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
