(Corrects spelling of Gorham in second paragraph of story
published Jan. 22.)  Alleghany Corp. (Y) , the insurer that
bought Transatlantic Holdings Inc., said Roger B. Gorham will
step down as chief financial officer to focus on managing the
$16 billion fixed-income portfolio.  Gorham will remain CFO until a successor is identified and
then be named senior vice president, head of fixed income, and
treasurer, the New York-based insurer said today in a regulatory
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
