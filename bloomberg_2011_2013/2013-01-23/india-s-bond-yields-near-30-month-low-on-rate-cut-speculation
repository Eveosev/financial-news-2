India ’s bond yields were near a 30-
month low on speculation slowing inflation will give the central
bank room to reduce  interest rates  as early as next week.  Fifteen of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg survey predict the
 Reserve Bank  of India will cut its repurchase rate by 25 basis
points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29, while two forecast a 50 basis
point reduction and one sees no change. Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram said in an interview yesterday he would
like borrowing costs to ease to help spur growth. Fiscal
prudence will be a key part of next month’s budget, he said,
reiterating a goal of 4.8 percent of gross domestic product for
the government’s deficit in the year through March 2014.  “The RBI is clearly teed up for rate cuts, banking on an
easing of inflation in coming quarters, fiscal consolidation
commencing, and structural reform implementation continuing,”
HSBC Holdings Plc economists including Singapore-based Leif Eskesen wrote in a research note today. “But it is likely to
tread carefully, given lingering inflation risks, limiting the
possible policy rate cut to 25 basis points.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 was at
7.86 percent as of 10:17 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. It touched 7.83 percent earlier,
approaching the lowest level since July 2010 of 7.8 percent
reached on Jan. 14. The yield has dropped 19 basis points this
month, headed for the biggest decline since May.  The RBI’s repo rate was last lowered by half a percentage
point in April. The wholesale-price  index  used to measure
inflation rose 7.18 percent in December from a year earlier, the
smallest increase since 2009, government data showed last week.
Chidambaram said in  Singapore  today that a 7 percent inflation
rate was “unacceptable.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 7.55 percent in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
