Stuart Hall, a longtime  BBC 
broadcaster, was charged with rape and indecent assault dating
back as far back as 1967.  Hall, 83, is charged with raping a 22-year-old woman in
1976 and 14 counts of indecent assault involving 10 girls from
1967 to 1986, according to a statement on the website of the
Lancashire Constabulary. The girls were between the age of 9 and
16, according to the statement.  Hall was arrested yesterday and released on bail, according
to the statement. He is scheduled to appear in court Feb. 7.  The British Broadcasting Corp. said in a Dec. 5  report  that
Lancashire police had questioned Hall about the rape and
indecent assault allegations. Hall, who’s been a broadcaster for
half a century, is known for his work on the 1970s show “It’s a
Knockout” and for his sports reporting on BBC Radio 5.  The BBC said in a statement last month that Hall wouldn’t
be working at the BBC during the police investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
