PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the second-largest U.S. regional bank, raised $1.75 billion
selling fixed- and floating-rate debt.  The lender’s $750 million of 0.8 percent, three-year notes
yield 45 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and
its $250 million of three-year floating-rate debt pays 31 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. PNC also sold $750 million of 2.95
percent, 10-year securities at 117 basis points.  Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley
and PNC managed the sale, Bloomberg data show. The three-year
debt is expected to be rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service and
the 10-year bonds may be graded A3. Proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes.  PNC reported fourth-quarter earnings last week, with net
income climbing to $719 million, or $1.24 a share, from $493
million, or 85 cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
