Asian  stocks  fell, with Japanese
shares capping their longest losing streak in two months as the
yen strengthened a day after the  Bank of Japan  opted to hold off
on fresh monetary stimulus until next year.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , an automaker that gets about a third of
its revenue from  North America , dropped 2.8 percent in  Tokyo .  LG
Household & Health Care Ltd. (051900) , a maker of household products,
slumped 7.5 percent in Seoul after forecasting 2013 operating
profit that fell short of expectations. China Vanke Co., the
country’s biggest publicly traded property developer, extended
gains to a record in Shenzhen on plans to move trading of its
foreign-currency denominated shares to Hong Kong.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.5 percent to 132.29 as
of 7:22 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than twice as many shares
declining as rising. The gauge rallied 11 percent through
yesterday from Nov. 14, when the announcement of Japanese
elections sparked optimism a new leadership would take more
steps to spur its economy.  The Bank of Japan meeting “marked yet another faltering
step on the path toward reflation,” said David Homan, New York-
based director of macro strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG. The
decision “leaves a lot of steps still to come. The reality for
reflation still looks more like a slow-burning fuse.”  Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa ’s board said yesterday the Bank
of Japan won’t begin indefinite purchases of  government bonds 
until January 2014 in pursuit of a 2 percent inflation target.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slumped 2.1 percent,
falling for a third day. The gauge rose 24 percent through
yesterday from Nov. 14 on optimism the central bank would add
stimulus amid pressure from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new
government.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  climbed 0.2 percent after a
report showed the nation’s fourth-quarter inflation rate rose
less than forecast. South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  lost 0.8 percent.
Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.1 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.3 percent.  Malaysian stocks will probably stay volatile until polling
day, according to Citigroup Inc. The benchmark FTSE Bursa
Malaysia KLCI Index rose 0.4 percent today after slumping 2.9
percent in the past two days on concern the ruling coalition may
lose seats.  Japan’s exporters declined. The yen added to an advance
yesterday that was the biggest in eight months after the BOJ
announced its delayed increase in monetary easing. A stronger
yen reduces overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Exporters Slide  Nissan fell 2.8 percent to 842 yen in Tokyo.  Yokohama
Rubber Co. (5101) , which gets about a fifth of its revenue from North
America, slid 2 percent to 630 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.3 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.1
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slipped 0.1 percent today. The gauge
climbed 0.4 percent yesterday after better-than-forecast
earnings from companies including Travelers Cos. and Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company by
market value, climbed 1.3 percent to A$37.06 in Sydney after
saying its total copper concentrate output at Chile’s Escondida
mine is on track to rise by 20 percent during fiscal 2013.  China Vanke’s  Hong Kong  dollar-denominated B-shares rose
6.9 percent to HK$16.17 in Shenzhen. The company is headed for a
26 percent three-day gain on plans to convert all 1.3 billion B-
shares into Hong Kong-listed H shares.  Nexon Surges  Nexon Co. (3659) , a Japanese online game distributor, surged 12
percent to 1,001 yen, the  steepest gain  in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised the stock’s price
target to 1,450 yen from 1,350 yen while maintaining a buy
rating.  Shenzhen Investment Ltd. (604) , a company backed by the Chinese
city of the same name, jumped 16 percent to HK$3.91 in Hong Kong
after saying it will buy land there from shareholder Shum Yip
Group Ltd. for 4.15 billion  yuan  ($667 million) in stock.  “We see this asset injection as a positive first step,”
Christie Ju, an analyst at Jefferies Group Inc., wrote in a
report dated yesterday. “Shenzhen Investment is well positioned
to become a leader in the Shenzhen residential market.”
Jefferies raised its 12-month target price on the stock to
HK$4.30 from HK$3.30, reiterating its buy rating.  LG Household Drops  Among stocks that fell outside Japan, LG Household & Health
Care slumped 7.5 percent to 619,000 won in Seoul, the  biggest
drag  on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Samsung Securities Co. said
the company’s 535 billion won ($503 million) operating profit
for 2013 is “conservative.”  Nufarm Ltd. tumbled 9.2 percent to A$5.75 in Sydney after
the agricultural-chemicals supplier said it will lose BASF AG’s
distribution rights and its local unit will miss its profit
target.  To contact the reporters on this story:
