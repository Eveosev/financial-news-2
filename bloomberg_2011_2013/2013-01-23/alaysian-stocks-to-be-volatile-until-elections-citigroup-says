Malaysian  stocks , which fell to a
six-week low yesterday on speculation elections will be held
soon, will probably stay volatile until polling day, according
to Citigroup Inc.  The benchmark  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI)  slumped 2.9
percent in the past two days on concern the ruling coalition may
lose seats. There was speculation the vote would be held during
school holidays at the end of March, Fiona Leong, a Kuala
Lumpur-based analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note today.  The KLCI index gained 0.3 percent as of 10:23 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur after  valuations  fell to 14.5 times estimated profit, the
lowest level since June 5, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
gauge rose to a record on Jan. 7 after gaining 4.9 percent last
month, the most since October 2011.  “We see selling pressure easing but stock prices are
likely to remain volatile until polling day,” Leong wrote.
“The heightened speculation and the KLCI’s strong performance
in December 2012 and early January triggered broad-based de-
risking by investors.”  The stock index’s 30-day historical  volatility  climbed to
10.4 on Jan. 21, surpassing the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index for
the first time since May 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The gauge’s volatility reading was at 10 today.  Value is emerging in  UEM Land Holdings Bhd. (ULHB) , IJM Corp. and
 Genting Malaysia Bhd. (GENM) , which Citigroup rates buy, the analyst
said. The bank recommends selling  Telekom Malaysia Bhd. (T)  and
 Maxis Bhd. (MAXIS)  on slowing growth and “stretched” valuations, Leong
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
