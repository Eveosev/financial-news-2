Soybeans and corn fell on
speculation that this month’s rally will curb livestock and
poultry feed demand in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer of
both crops.  Red-meat inventories held in storage rose 8.9 percent to
1.047 billion pounds (474,911 metric tons) on Dec. 31 from a
year earlier, while total poultry held in warehouses jumped 16
percent in the past year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said yesterday in a monthly report. Through yesterday, corn
jumped 4.3 percent this month and soybeans gained 3 percent, in
part because feed demand in the quarter ended Dec. 1 was
stronger than expected.  “Rising inventories of meat and poultry are a sign of
slowing consumer demand, and that will have a negative impact on
feed demand,” Mark Schultz, the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$14.485 a bushel at 11:18 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
erasing an earlier gain of 0.4 percent. The most-active futures
yesterday touched $14.6075 a bushel, the highest since Dec. 19.  Corn futures for March delivery slid 0.2 percent to $7.27 a
bushel in Chicago, heading for the first decline in three
sessions.  Soybeans and corn earlier rose on speculation that dry
weather may damage yield potential in Argentina, boosting
overseas demand for U.S. supplies. U.S. inventories of the crops
on Dec. 1 fell to the lowest in nine years after the worst
drought since the 1930s cut production for a third consecutive
season.  Argentina  is the biggest exporter of both crops after
the U.S. and  Brazil .  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
