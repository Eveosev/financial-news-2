GS Yuasa Corp. (6674) , the  Boeing Co. (BA) 
battery supplier at the center of inspections since the
Dreamliners were grounded last week, was searched again today,
 Japan ’s transport ministry said.  France  has also started investigating the battery incident,
Masahiro Kudo, an aircraft accident investigator for the
Japanese ministry’s transport safety board, told reporters in
 Tokyo  today. Two engineers of  Thales SA (HO)  are now in Japan to
assist with the checks, he said.  U.S. and Japanese investigators are inspecting GS Yuasa
looking for clues about a fire on a  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  plane and
an emergency landing by an  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  jet. Chicago-
based Boeing can’t deliver more 787 jets until the U.S.  Federal
Aviation Administration  confirms the safety of the Dreamliners,
which remain grounded since Jan. 16.  Investigators were also sent to the U.K. to probe a valve
actuator maker, Akihiro Ohta, Japan’s transport minister, told
reporters in Tokyo yesterday, without identifying the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
