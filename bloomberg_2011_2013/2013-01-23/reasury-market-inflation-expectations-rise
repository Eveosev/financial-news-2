Treasury market inflation
expectations climbed to a three-month high before a government
report economists project will show house prices rose at the
fastest pace in six months.  Inflation swaps, which allow investors to exchange fixed
interest rates for returns equivalent to the consumer price
index, show investors expect prices to increase at an annual
pace of 2.49 percent. The reading yesterday was the highest
since Oct. 11. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to buy as much
as $1.75 billion of Treasuries due from 2036 to 2042 today as
part of its efforts to support the economy.  “The continuous expansion of the Fed’s  balance sheet  at
least this year and improvement in U.S. economic indicators”
are behind the gain in inflation expectations,’’ said Hitoshi Asaoka, a senior strategist in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Trust & Banking
Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest bank by market value.
“There are expectations for a pickup in the U.S. economy.”  U.S. 10-year  yields  were little changed at 1.84 percent as
of 11:30 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.
The price of the 1.625 percent security due in November 2022 was
98 2/32.  Japan’s 10-year yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.74 percent, a day after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
announced plans to start open-ended debt purchases in 2014 to
help end deflation.  The nation’s bonds yield more than the U.S. counterparts
after accounting for the  cost of living . The so-called real 10-
year yield is 0.94 percent, reflecting a 0.2 percent decline in
consumer prices in November from the year before.  U.S. 10-year notes yield 0.14 percent after subtracting the
nation’s 1.7 percent inflation rate.  Comparative Returns  While Treasuries have handed investors a 0.3 percent loss
this month, Japan’s government securities gained 0.4 percent,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index
probably gained 0.7 percent in November from October, the
biggest increase since May, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the report at 9
a.m.  New York  time today.  An index of leading indicators tomorrow probably gained 0.4
percent in December, based on responses from economists.  New home sales climbed 2.1 percent, according to another
Bloomberg survey before the report Jan. 25.  The  difference  between rates on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, widened to 2.55 percentage points yesterday. It was the
most since Nov. 2.  U.S. consumer prices advanced 1.7 percent in December from
the year before, based on the most recent data from the Labor
Department. The average over the past 20 years is 2.5 percent.  The Fed is purchasing $85 billion of government and
mortgage debt each month to spur the economy by putting downward
pressure on bond yields. The BOJ is buying bonds and other
assets, and it plans to follow the Fed by switching to open-
ended debt purchases next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
