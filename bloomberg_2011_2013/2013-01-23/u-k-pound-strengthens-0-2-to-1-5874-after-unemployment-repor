The pound rose against the dollar
and maintained an advance versus the euro after a report showed
U.K. jobless claims unexpectedly fell in December to the lowest
level since June 2011.  Sterling gained 0.2 percent to $1.5874 at 9:43 a.m. London
time. The U.K. currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 84.03 pence
per euro.  Minutes also showed Bank of England policy makers voted 8-1
to keep their bond-purchase plan unchanged at 375 billion pounds
this month.  U.K. 10-year government bonds were little changed, leaving
the yield at 2.03 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
