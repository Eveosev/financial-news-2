Soybeans rose for a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation dry weather in southern Brazil will erode
crops of the oilseed before the harvest at the same time that
demand for U.S. supplies is increasing.  Brazil’s  Rio Grande  do Sul and Parana states may be mostly
dry tomorrow, with some scattered showers on Jan. 25 giving way
to more dryness during the weekend, forecaster DTN said. Two
percent of the country’s soybean crop, expected to be the
world’s largest, has been harvested, researcher Celeres said
Jan. 21. In the U.S., about 48.1 million bushels were inspected
for export in the week ended Jan. 17, 16 percent more than a
week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday.  “We’ve got South American weather now starting to affect
the price quite a bit,”  William Adams , a  fund manager  at
Resilience AG, said by telephone from Zurich. “The exports were
a little bit higher than expected in soybeans.”  Soybeans for delivery in March advanced as much as 0.3
percent on the Chicago Board of Trade and were little changed at
$14.515 a bushel by 7:15 a.m. local time. Prices yesterday
touched $14.6075, the highest level since Dec. 19, and gained
1.6 percent by the close.  Corn and wheat for delivery in March were little changed at
$7.29 a bushel and $7.7875 a bushel, respectively. In Paris,
milling wheat for the same delivery month fell 0.5 percent to
251.75 euros ($335.88) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
