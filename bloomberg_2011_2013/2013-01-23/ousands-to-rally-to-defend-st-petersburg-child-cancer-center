Thousands of people are set to
gather in  Russia ’s second-biggest city to protest the possible
closing of a children’s cancer-treatment center, which officials
plan to replace with a clinic for court employees.  The rally will take place today at Marsovo field, near
Nevsky prospect,  St. Petersburg ’s main street, according to
Alexey Volkov, a meeting organizer. Between 1,500 and 3,000
people will attend the rally, less than the maximum 10,000
permitted by the city administration, he said by phone.  Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered in November that the
 Supreme Court  and Supreme Arbitration Court be moved to St.
Petersburg from Moscow. While the site of the children’s cancer
center is one possibility for the court clinic, a final decision
hasn’t been made, St. Petersburg Governor Georgy Poltavchenko
said Jan. 16 in an e-mailed statement.  “The withdrawal of the hospital from the city’s medical
system is unacceptable,” Valentina Matvienko, who previously
served as St. Petersburg’s governor and speaker of Russia’s
upper house of parliament, told reporters yesterday in Moscow,
