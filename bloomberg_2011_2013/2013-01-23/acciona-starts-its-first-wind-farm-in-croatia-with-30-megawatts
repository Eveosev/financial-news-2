Acciona SA (ANA) , the Spanish developer of
renewable, water and public infrastructure projects, started its
first wind farm in  Croatia  as the country poised to enter the
European Union seeks to boost clean energy.  The 30-megawatt Jelinak wind farm in Split-Dalmatia in the
north west will provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes
a year, replacing the fossil fuel equivalent of about 48,000
barrels of oil, Acciona said today in a statement.  Croatia, due to become the 28th member of the European
Union on July 1, is boosting clean energy to align with
emissions-cutting goals pursued by the bloc. The former Yugoslav
region had 193.75 megawatts of wind installed at the end of last
year and plans for 1,200 megawatts of turbines in 2020 and 2,000
megawatts by 2030, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
