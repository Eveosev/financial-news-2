VTB Group Chief Executive  Andrei
Kostin  said Russia’s second-biggest lender may sell as much as
$3 billion of new shares this year, the state-controlled
lender’s first offering since 2011.  The Moscow-based bank may sell “from $1 billion to $3
billion” of stock, Kostin said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland.  VTB last sold shares at $6.25 per global depositary receipt
in February 2011. That’s about 60 percent more than the current
value of the stock,  which rose  1.6 percent to $3.93 at 8:25 a.m.
in London. The 2011 sale raised $3.3 billion.  “Any sale of new shares would be better at a price above
or the same as before,” Kostin said.  The Russian government has said it plans to sell all of its
stake in VTB by 2016. First Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov 
last week said the bank was in talks with sovereign-wealth funds
from China and  Kuwait  and would sell at least $3 billion of
stock at a price no less than that of the 2011 offering.  His insistence on a higher price may mean “privatization
is much further away than previously thought,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading in London, said
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
