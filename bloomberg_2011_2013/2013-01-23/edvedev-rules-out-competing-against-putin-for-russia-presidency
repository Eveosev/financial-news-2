Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry
Medvedev  said he won’t run against President  Vladimir Putin  in
the next presidential election.  “I believe this wouldn’t be correct,” Medvedev said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV in Davos, Switzerland. “I think
that would be impossible.”  Medvedev stepped aside last year as president to allow the
Kremlin return of Putin, who kept power as prime minister for
four years because of a constitutional ban on three consecutive
presidential terms. The next election is scheduled for 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
