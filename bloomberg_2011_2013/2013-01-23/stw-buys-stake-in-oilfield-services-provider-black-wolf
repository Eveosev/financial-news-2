STW Resources Holding Corp. (STWS) , an
oilfield reclamation company, purchased 10 percent of Black Wolf
Enterprises LLC, a venture that provides oilfield services in
west Texas and eastern New Mexico.  Black Wolf, a collaboration between Lone Wolf Resources LLC
and Black Pearl Energy LLC, is negotiating “on a number of
multi-well packages with many of the largest oil and gas
producers in west Texas,” STW said today in a statement. Based
on current growth, Black Wolf will generate an estimated $40
million in revenue in 2014, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
