The U.K. Supreme Court said tax
advice given to  Prudential Plc (PRU)  by accountants wasn’t protected
by legal privilege and should be disclosed to the British
government.  The U.K.’s highest court said only advice from lawyers was
protected by the privilege, according to a press  summary  of the
judgment today. When tax authorities asked Prudential for
information about a tax avoidance scheme created by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company argued it didn’t have to
hand over any documents containing advice from accountants.  “Accountants will be crying into their soup tonight, and
tax lawyers will be dancing in the streets,” said Peter Clough,
a partner at U.K. law firm Osborne Clarke. “The case presents a
clear cut choice for clients: if you want confidential tax
advice, you’re better off going to a law firm.”  Companies including  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  have
been criticized by lawmakers for trying to reduce their U.K. tax
liabilities with complex accounting methods.  Prudential spokesman Robin Tozer and PwC spokeswoman
Laetitia Lynn declined to comment.  “The right to see tax advice provided by accountants plays
an important role in our work against tax avoidance,” Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs said in an e-mailed statement.
“Today’s decision is a good one for the majority of taxpayers
who follow the letter and spirit of the law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
