The yen is likely to resume its
decline against the dollar, Ken Dickson, a director of
currencies in Edinburgh at Standard Life Investments, which
manages about $264 billion, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. The Japanese currency rallied 1 percent yesterday
after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  decided to  defer additional monetary
stimulus.  On the yen’s rally:  “I can see why the market is a little bit disappointed on
what’s been announced. That disappointment is in the context
that dollar yen has moved quite a long way in the past two to
three months. Many participants are sitting on some healthy
profits.”  On Japan’s currency resuming its decline:  “The dollar-yen trend will continue, but this is a good
opportunity for positions to refresh a little and for a short
period of consolidation.”  “The deterioration in the current account is such that
surplus in the current account is no longer covering FDI
outflows, so that the basic balance is now negative. That’s
quite an important driver for medium-term currency moves.”  “We know that the BOJ governor is going to be replaced in
April, and it’s very much likely that the replacement will be
more friendly to the ideas that the government has. There will
be fresh impetus on more aggressive easing when the new governor
is in place.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
