Rice exports from  Thailand  plunged
37 percent last year to the lowest in more than a decade,
dethroning the Southeast Asian nation as the largest shipper.  The country sold 6.73 million metric tons with a value of
$4.63 billion, the Ministry of Commerce said in an e-mailed
statement today. That compares with 10.7 million tons, worth
$6.43 billion a year earlier, data showed. Shipments fell to the
lowest since 2000 when the country exported 6.55 million tons,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  India  became the largest supplier last year, shipping 10.3
million tons, according to the  USDA .  Vietnam  shipped 8 million
tons, according to a report posted on the Vietnam’s General
Customs Department website on Jan. 16.  Thai rice exports declined after the government introduced
a price support program in October 2011, buying the grain from
farmers above market rates to boost domestic prices and lift
rural incomes. Stockpiles in Thailand will climb to a record
11.7 million tons in the 2012-2013 season, the USDA estimates.  The government bought 9 million tons of unmilled rice and
expects to purchase as much as 11 million tons this harvest,
Commerce Minister Boonsong Teriyapirom said today. The
strengthening baht has made exports “quite difficult,” he told
reporters. The baht touched 29.66 per dollar on Jan. 21, the
strongest level since August 2011.  The total cost of the support program may be as much as 440
billion baht ($14.8 billion) in the 2012-2013 season, compared
with 376 billion baht or around 3.4 percent of gross domestic
product in the previous year, according to the  World Bank .
Losses are estimated at about 115 billion baht last year and 140
billion this year, it said in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
