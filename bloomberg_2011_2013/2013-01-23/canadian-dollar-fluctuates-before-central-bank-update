The Canadian dollar fluctuated
against its U.S. counterpart before the Bank of Canada announces
an  interest-rate  decision and may revise its economic growth
forecast.  The central bank is forecast to maintain its benchmark
interest rate at 1 percent, according to all 27 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. So-called risk reversals show options
traders are paying the most for protection against loonie
weakness since Nov. 26. The three-month 25-delta risk reversal
rate rose to 0.90 percentage point from 0.88 percentage point
yesterday.  “The growth numbers for the fourth quarter give us a
weaker hand over to 2013, the growth numbers the bank have been
discounting in terms of annual growth, look too high,” said
 Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, by phone from  London . “The greater
the downgrade, the further the closing of the output gap is
pushed and the greater the risk the CAD takes a little bit of a
downside bias.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the picture
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was little changed at 99.17
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 8:17 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie buys
$1.0084.  Bonds Rise  Canada’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose, pushing the yield
down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.89
percent. The 2.75 percent note maturing in June 2022 added 13
cents to C$107.29.  The  Bank of Canada  will announce further details tomorrow
for a Jan. 30 10-year note auction.  The loonie has fallen 1.8 percent during the past six
months versus nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has gained 6 percent
while the greenback has dropped 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
