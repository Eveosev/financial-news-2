Nestle SA (NESN)  Chief Executive Officer
 Paul Bulcke  said he sees signs that the U.S. market is improving
and expects European consumer confidence will return.  The U.S. has “refreshing winds coming,” the top executive
of the world’s largest food company said in an interview at the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “You already feel
it a little bit,” he said. “We should not expect dramatic
increases in growth, but it’s going to get better.”  Consumer confidence in Europe “is going to come back,”
Bulcke also said. “It’s going to take years though. It’s not
going to be a fast-going out of the woods.”  Unilever, the world’s second-largest consumer-goods maker,
today reported revenue growth that beat estimates for a third
straight quarter, led by gains in North and South America and
demand for personal-care products. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said
 Europe  is facing at least a decade of slow economic growth in an
interview last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
