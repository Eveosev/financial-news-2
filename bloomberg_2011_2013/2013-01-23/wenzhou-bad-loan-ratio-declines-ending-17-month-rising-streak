The non-performing loan ratio at
banks in Wenzhou, the eastern Chinese city hit hardest by the
collapse of private lending, dropped for the first time since
June 2011, the Oriental Morning Post  reported .  The ratio fell to 3.43 percent at the end of November, down
0.01 percentage point from a month earlier, the newspaper said,
citing data from the local banking regulator. Still, the total
amount of soured debt climbed to 24 billion  yuan  in November, an
increase of 87 million yuan from October and up 15.3 billion
yuan from the beginning of the year, the report said.  In Wenzhou, an export hub where almost 90 percent of
families have taken part in underground lending, more than 100
people fled, committed suicide or declared bankruptcy from
August 2011 through last May, and at least 800 lending brokers
went bankrupt, Xinhua News Agency reported.  The city’s economy expanded  5.7 percent  in the first nine
months last year, compared with the  nation’s 7.7 percent ,
according to official data. The State Council,  China ’s cabinet,
announced a trial plan in March aimed at easing funding for
small companies and monitoring underground loans.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
