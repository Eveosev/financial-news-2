Perion (PERI)  Networks Ltd. tumbled the
most in 14 months in  New York  on concern its partnership with
 Google Inc. (GOOG) , which allows the Israeli company to package the
world’s no. 1 search engine in its products, will be terminated.  Perion sank 8.6 percent to $10.76 in New York on trading
volumes that were almost seven times the stock’s three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
decline was the steepest one-day slide since Nov. 16, 2011.  The Tel Aviv-based company corrected its annual report
today, clarifying that the expiration date of its partnership
agreement with Google was Jan. 31 and not Jan. 1, as was stated
on one page of the document. Bloomberg Television said in a
report aired yesterday that the Google deal expired Jan. 1. The
company is in final discussions over the renewal of its pact
with Google and will update investors before the end of the
month, Perion said in its statement.  “Perion is selling off today on concerns that its contract
with Google has not been renewed,”  Jay Srivatsa , an analyst at
Chardan Capital Markets LLC in New York who has a buy rating on
the shares, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “We further
expect that Perion will receive its renewal from Google before
the current contract expires.”  Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in an e-mail that the
 Mountain View , California-based company had no comment on
Perion’s contract as a third-party distributor of its search
engine.  Perion shares traded in Tel Aviv declined 4.7 percent to
42.50 shekels, or the equivalent of $11.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
