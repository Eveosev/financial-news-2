China  National Petroleum Corp., the
nation’s largest energy producer, said oil and natural gas
production rose 2.8 percent in 2012, even as overseas output
fell short of target.  Total oil and gas output reached 278 million metric tons,
the Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing Zhou Jiping,
general manager of the state-owned company. Domestic oil output
rose 2.6 percent from a year ago, reaching the highest level
since 1998, Zhou said, without elaborating.  Output of oil and gas from fields outside China would count
for 60 percent of the company’s total production by the end of
the decade, state-run Xinhua quoted Chairman Jiang Jiemin as
saying. Both Jiang and Zhou spoke at the company’s annual work
conference that opened today in Beijing, Xinhua reported.  Overseas output of oil and gas reached 104 million tons in
2012, 15 million tons less than its annual target, CNPC said in
a newsletter on Jan. 17. That would leave production from
overseas fields accounting for 37 percent of CNPC’s total
production in 2012, based on the total figure released today.  CNPC’s overseas production was affected by political
instability in countries such as Sudan and  Syria  in 2012, Zhou
said, according to Xinhua. “Geopolitical, security and policy
risks will be on the rise in 2013, making it very difficult for
CNPC to maintain stable production at overseas projects,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
