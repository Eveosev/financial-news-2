Cyprus needs support from the euro
area, the International Monetary Fund and Russia to stay in the
euro and avoid restoking the financial crisis, said Institute of
International Finance Managing Director Charles Dallara.  “One lesson we’ve learned from  Greece  is that just because
it’s a relatively small economy, don’t underestimate potential
contagion if a situation is not managed carefully,” Dallara
said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television’s
“Countdown” on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s
annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.  Cyprus has been negotiating a rescue since June. Dallara
said delays carry risk for Cyprus and also for Italy and Spain
because they could be affected by contagion.  “Russia has strong ties into Cyprus and they need to be
part of the solution,” Dallara said. “There’s no doubt that
this takes a coming together, a meeting of the minds and maybe a
meeting of the check books of the euro zone, of  Russia , of the
IMF and the Cypriot authorities.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
