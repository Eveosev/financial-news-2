Citigroup Inc. (C) , the U.S. lender
disposing of unwanted assets, sold a private banking subsidiary
with about 3,000 accounts to Reliance Financial Corp. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  Reliance will acquire Citigroup Trust-Delaware NA and merge
the company with its own subsidiary, Atlanta-based Reliance said
in a statement. The deal should be completed by the end of this
quarter if regulators approve, the firm said.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat , 52, is selling
assets and operations that are no longer considered part of the
New York-based bank’s core operations. Trust-Delaware manages
trust accounts that hold assets for some of the wealthiest
clients.  “These are fine relationships,” said James Maxwell,
chairman and CEO of Reliance, in a phone interview. “However,
they are part of a market segment that really is too small for
Citi.”  Many of the accounts were tied to  Smith Barney , the
brokerage that Citigroup previously owned outright, Maxwell
said. Reliance will hire 30 Citigroup executives who help manage
these accounts, he said.  Citigroup, ranked third by assets among U.S. banks, agreed
to sell Smith Barney in stages to New York-based  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
in 2009. Trust-Delaware was not part of that transaction,
Chantel Shipe, a spokeswoman for Reliance, said in an e-mail.  Paul James , CEO of Citi Private Bank’s trust business, said
in the statement that Citi Trust will still provide trust and
estate services to “high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth
clients of Citi Private Bank through our Delaware,
New York and South Dakota centers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
