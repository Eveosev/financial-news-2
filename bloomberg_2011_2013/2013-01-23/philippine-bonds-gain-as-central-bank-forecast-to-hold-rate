Philippine  government bonds  advanced
on speculation the central bank will hold its benchmark interest
rate at a record low at a meeting tomorrow, supporting demand
for the nation’s debt. The peso declined.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep its overnight
borrowing rate at 3.5 percent, all 20 economists forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. Policy makers cut the rate four times
last year. The Bureau of the Treasury sold 25 billion pesos
($615 million) of notes due November 2019 yesterday at an
average yield of 3.876 percent, with investors submitting almost
80 billion pesos in bids.  “The governor has been very vocal in saying rates are
appropriate where they are,” said Jan Briace Santos, a debt
trader who helps manage the equivalent of $17 billion at BPI
Asset Management Inc. in  Manila . “People are buying longer
tenors. It’s a sign there is good demand for local debt mainly
due to positive fundamentals of the  Philippines .”  The yield on the 8.125 percent bonds due December 2035 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.54 percent as
of 5:22 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services.  Low  interest rates  are fueling financial asset prices in
the Philippines and capital inflows could extend gains in such
prices, the  International Monetary Fund  said today.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 40.62 per dollar, data from
Tullett Prebon Plc show. The currency has risen 6.5 percent in
the past 12 months, the best performer among Asia’s 11 most-
traded currencies. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
unchanged for a seventh day at 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
