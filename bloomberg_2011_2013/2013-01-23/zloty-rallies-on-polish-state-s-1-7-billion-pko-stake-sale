The zloty rebounded from a three-day
losing streak as the government’s sale of a $1.7 billion stake
in  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)  spurred foreign demand for the currency.  The zloty jumped 0.5 percent to 4.1544 per euro at 11:18
a.m. in Warsaw, the biggest gain among more than 170 currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on 10-year notes fell 14 basis
points to 3.80 percent. PKO shares tumbled the most in two
months.  The Treasury Ministry and state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa
Krajowego are selling 146.9 million shares in Poland’s biggest
bank to institutional investors today, according to a term sheet
obtained by Bloomberg late yesterday. The stake was valued at
5.19 billion zloty ($1.7 billion) at yesterday’s closing price,
making this the largest share offering by a publicly traded
company in Poland, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We could expect strong interest from foreign investors,”
Rafal Benecki, chief economist for Poland at ING Groep NV in
Warsaw, said in e-mailed note today. “This is helping the zloty
strengthen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
