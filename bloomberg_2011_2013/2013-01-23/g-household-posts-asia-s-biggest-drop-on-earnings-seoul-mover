LG Household & Health Care Ltd. (051900) , a
South Korean maker of household cleaning and personal care
products, slumped the most in nine months in Seoul trading after
forecasting profit growth that fell short of estimates.  The stock retreated 5.5 percent to 632,000 won as of 10:59
a.m. on the  Korea  Exchange, poised for its steepest loss since
April 2 last year. It’s the  worst-performer  on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index today.  LG Household is targeting about 535 billion won ($502
million) in operating profit this year, the company said in a
filing yesterday. That’s lower than the 568.4 billion won
average of analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales at
major South Korean department stores declined in December as
persistent concerns over the global and local economic outlook
eroded  consumer confidence .  “With the recovery of domestic demand expected around the
second quarter or the third, which is later than previously
anticipated, the company tends to set conservative targets for
2013,” Park Eun Kyung, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co.,
wrote in a report today. She reduced the share-price estimate to
793,000 won from 841,000 won.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. today cut its 2013 economic growth
forecast for Korea to 3.1 percent from 3.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
