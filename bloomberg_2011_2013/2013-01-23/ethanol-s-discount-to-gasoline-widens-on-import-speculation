Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened for a second day on speculation the fuel’s 8.4 percent
gain price this month will spur demand for imports.  The spread increased 2.39 cents to the largest gap in two
weeks. Ethanol’s advance, on pace for the biggest monthly gain
since July, makes the Brazilian sugarcane-based variety more
competitive with the U.S. corn-derived grade.  “We’ve driven up prices to the point where the import play
is back in,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone
in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  The grain-based additive was 45.98 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities,
the widest since Jan. 10. The spread was 43.59 cents yesterday.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.374 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the biggest decline since Dec. 26. Prices have advanced 10
percent in the past year.  Ethanol prices have surged on the back of higher corn
prices as drought parched crops in the Midwest. Stockpiles of
the grain on Dec. 1 were 17 percent smaller than a year earlier,
a Jan. 11 Agriculture Department  report  showed.  Corn for March delivery decreased 7.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $7.2075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Producers’ Loss  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 23 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
24 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale
of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production
that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 0.39 cent to $2.8338
a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 2.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.43 a gallon on the  Gulf Coast , while in Chicago
the additive slid 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.375, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in  New York  advanced 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$2.485 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel gained 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
