PKN Orlen SA, eastern  Europe ’s
largest refiner, reduced the amount of crude it buys via long-
term contracts to rely on more favorable spot transactions, the
company’s Chief Financial Officer said.  Supplies from such agreements were cut to 500,000 metric
tons per month from 1 million tons after one accord expired,
Slawomir Jedrzejczyk said today on a conference call. The change
means that Orlen will now seek about 80 percent of its annual
crude requirement from the  spot market .  “The situation is very dynamic but it’s often cheaper to
buy on the spot market rather than in the long-term contracts,”
Jedrzejczyk said. “We may sign another long-term contract.”  The company issues eight to 10 spot tenders a month,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter, asking not
to be identified as the information is confidential. The most
recent was made yesterday and Orlen bought 100,000 tons of Urals
blend from Vitol Group, according to four traders who
participate in the market.  Orlen has refineries in  Poland , the Czech Republic and
 Lithuania , which processed 28 million tons of oil last year,
according to a company presentation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
