Ford Motor Co. (F)  restarted production
at its factory in Genk,  Belgium , after a blockade by workers
over plans to shut the site ended.  “We are pleased to be building and shipping vehicles again
and are working to get the factory quickly up to full
production,” said Adrian Schmitz, a spokesman for the
carmaker’s European operations in Cologne,  Germany .  An agreement between Ford and unions approved by workers
earlier this month had failed to result in a resumption of auto
assembly after protesters blocked an adjacent supplier area. The
dispute included union leaders being confined in a conference
room last week after demonstrators disrupted a meeting with Ford
suppliers.  Before this week, Ford hadn’t shipped a vehicle from Genk
since saying Oct. 24 that the plant will shut for good in 2014,
as walkouts compounded the effects of scheduled suspensions. The
permanent shutdown is part of an effort to end losses in  Europe 
that may exceed $1.5 billion a year in 2012 and 2013.  The agreement with Genk labor leaders, which outlines extra
money paid to workers for meeting production targets, was slated
to allow Ford to restart production Jan. 9 and ramp up output to
1,000 vehicles a day at the factory, according to unions. The
factory builds the Mondeo mid-sized sedan and the S-Max and
Galaxy minivans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
