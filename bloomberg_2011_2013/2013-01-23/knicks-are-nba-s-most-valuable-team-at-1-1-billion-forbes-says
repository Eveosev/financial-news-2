The  New York Knicks  ousted the  Los
Angeles Lakers  as the  National Basketball Association ’s most
valuable franchise with their estimated worth rising 41 percent
to $1.1 billion due mainly to a $980 million renovation of
Madison Square Garden, according to Forbes.  The makeover of the arena, which probably will be completed
this year, helped push the team’s revenue to a league-leading
$243 million, Forbes said in its annual ranking of team values.
New York’s operating income was the NBA’s highest for the third
straight season, Forbes said, and the team won a playoff game
for the first time since 2001.  The Lakers rank No. 2 with a value of $1 billion, up 11
percent from last year. The Knicks and Lakers, who start a new
20-year, $3.6 billion television contract with Time Warner Cable
this season, are the first NBA teams worth $1 billion.  The average value of a team is $509 million, Forbes said,
an increase of 30 percent over last year because of the league’s
new collective bargaining agreement, more television revenue and
new and renovated arenas.  The Nets’ jumped 48 percent in value to $530 million after
the team’s relocation to  Brooklyn  from  New Jersey , and now rank
ninth out of the NBA’s 30 teams. Forbes said the Nets may climb
higher as they add the  National Hockey League ’s Islanders as a
tenant at the $1 billion Barclays Center, helping offset
operating expenses at the arena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
