Iran  may consider buying water from
 Tajikistan  and other neighbors to address shortages, the Iranian
Students News Agency  said  today, citing an official in
parliament.  The Iranian parliamentâ€™s agriculture committee is working
on a report on the project, said Ali Iranpour, one of its
members, according to ISNA. Water purchases from Tajikistan may
address shortages in the east of Iran, ISNA said.  Turkey, which buys oil and gas from Iran, shares a long
border with the Islamic Republic of Iran.  To contact the reporters on this story:
