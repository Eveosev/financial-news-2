Hillary Clinton , who is often
mentioned as a prospective 2016 presidential candidate, has
cleared her 2008 campaign debts.  Clinton, the outgoing U.S. secretary of state, reported
yesterday to the Federal Election Commission that she paid off
the remaining bill to her former chief political strategist,
Mark Penn. She even had $294,833 left over.  At the end of 2008, after Clinton lost the Democratic
primary to President  Barack Obama , she owed $5.4 million, all to
Penn. Clinton earlier wrote off a $13.2 million personal loan to
her unsuccessful campaign.  The president chose her for secretary of state after that
election. Clinton plans to leave the post as soon as new nominee
 John Kerry , a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is confirmed.  In November, her campaign raised money by offering a free
trip for a donor and a guest to New York to spend time with her
husband, former President  Bill Clinton . Obamaâ€™s campaign
committee also helped generate cash for her committee by renting
her campaign mailing list in October for $62,782, FEC filings
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
