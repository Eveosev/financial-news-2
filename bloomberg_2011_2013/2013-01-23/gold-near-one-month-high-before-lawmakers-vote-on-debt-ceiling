Gold futures declined as the U.S.
House of Representatives voted to temporarily suspend the
nation’s borrowing limit, curbing demand for the precious metal
as a haven asset.  The measure, passed 285-144, lifts the government’s $16.4
trillion borrowing limit until May 19. It goes to the Senate,
where Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said lawmakers will pass the
measure unchanged and send it to President  Barack Obama . Bullion
demand from  India  may be “muted” in the next few days as
buyers wait for clarity on details related to this week’s
domestic import-tax increase, UBS AG said today.  “The can has been kicked down the road, and so there are
no immediate worries,” David Lee, a vice president at Heraeus
Precious Metals Management in  New York , said in a telephone
interview. “There is no good news on the physical side and at
the moment there is no incentive for the market to go higher.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,686.70 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, declining for the second time in three sessions.  Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the debt limit
79 times, including 49 times under Republican presidents,
according to the Treasury Department. Lawmakers have until March
1 before automatic spending reductions will start and until the
end of that month to pass a bill to fund the government.  India raised  import duties  on gold and platinum to 6
percent from 4 percent.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$32.439 an ounce on the Comex. Today’s advance was the seventh
straight climb, the longest rally for a most-active contract
since August 2011.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 0.4 percent to $1,691.80 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery retreated 0.5 percent
to $726.20 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
