Nordic electricity for next week
retreated after higher temperatures indicated less demand for
electric heating.  The contract for next week fell 0.6 percent to 38.75 euros
($51.62) a megawatt-hour on the the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.â€™s
energy exchange in Oslo. The February contract declined 0.1
percent to 41.75 euros a megawatt-hour.  Low temperatures in Oslo may rise to minus 7 degrees
Celsius (3 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 4, from minus 14 Celsius a day
earlier, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. That
compares with a 10-year average of minus 8 Celsius.  Electricity use in the Nordic region tracks temperatures
during winter months, with demand dropping and electric heating
use decreasing when temperatures rise.  Nordic nuclear reactors produced at 94 percent of their
combined capacity as of 7:30 a.m., data from operators showed.
The region gets a fifth of its electricity use from atomic
plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
