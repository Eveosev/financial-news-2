National Collegiate Athletic
Association investigators broke the organization’s own rules to
get information about  University of Miami  athletes possibly
getting improper benefits, the association said in a press
release.  Former NCAA enforcement staff members worked with the
criminal defense attorney for booster  Nevin Shapiro , who has
said he provided cash and benefits to at least 72 Miami
athletes, to obtain information for their investigation.  Since the NCAA doesn’t have subpoena power, it didn’t have
the authority to compel testimony. Through bankruptcy
proceedings, the NCAA staff got information for their
investigation that wouldn’t have been available otherwise, the
NCAA said in the statement.  The issue will delay the college sports governing body’s
findings on Miami until it gathers all the facts surrounding its
own violation of policy, the NCAA said.  “I have been very vocal in the past regarding the need for
integrity by NCAA member schools, athletics administrators,
coaches, and student-athletes,” NCAA President  Mark Emmert 
said. “That same commitment to integrity applies to all of us
in the NCAA national office.”  Miami declared itself ineligible for bowl play for the
second straight football season in November as the investigation
continues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
