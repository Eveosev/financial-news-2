STW Resources Holding Corp. (STWS) , an
oilfield reclamation company, agreed to build and operate a
water recycling plant near Midland,  Texas , that will provide up
to 8,000 barrels a day of water for oil producers in the area.  Tiburon Research Holdings, which owns the Powell saltwater
disposal site in Texas, will supply reclaimed water and help
provide $3 million in financing for the plant, Midland-based STW
said in a statement yesterday.  The plant will begin operating in the second quarter and
generate as much as $6 million in annual revenue. Tiburon and
STW plan to build additional water-recycling plants for oil
producers in West Texas and in the Eagle Ford shale formation.  STW  surged  48 percent to 6 cents a share in over-the-
counter markets yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
