Cree Inc. (CREE) , the North Carolina-based
maker of energy-efficient lighting products, surged after
quarterly profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Cree  advanced  22 percent to $40.85 at the close in New
York, the most since Jan. 16, 2004. The Durham, North Carolina-
based company was the best performer on the Standard & Poor’s
Midcap 400 Index today.  “Strong demand from new product launches and a new
distributor program helped drive revenue,” Aaron Chew, an
analyst with Maxim Group LLC in New York, wrote in a note to
investors today. Chew rates the stock a buy and raised his 12-
month price target to $40 from $38.  Cree reported quarterly profit that jumped 69 percent as
demand for its light-emitting diodes surged, according to a
statement released yesterday after the close of regular trading.
Net income rose to $20.4 million, or 18 cents a share, from
$12.1 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier. That beat the 14.5-
cent average of 17 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
