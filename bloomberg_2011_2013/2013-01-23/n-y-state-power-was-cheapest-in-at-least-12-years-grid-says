The average price for wholesale
electricity in New York State and across  New England  fell to
record lows last year because of cheap natural gas, the grid
operators said.  The New York Independent System Operator Inc. said the
average price for power fell 7 percent to $45.23 a megawatt-hour
in 2012 from the previous year. It was the lowest average in the
12-year history of the state’s competitive wholesale electricity
market, the grid operator said in a  statement  today.  Wholesale power from  Connecticut  to  Maine  averaged $36.09 a
megawatt-hour, down 23 percent from 2011 and the lowest level
since the region’s competitive market was started in 2003,
according to an ISO New England Inc.  statement  today.  Both grid operators attributed price declines to lower
costs for natural gas at power plants and new generating
capacity in the regions.  “The abundance and low price of natural gas are major
factors in the current price of electricity in  New York ,”
Stephen G. Whitley, chief executive officer of the Rensselaer,
New York-based NYISO, said in the statement. “Our markets
continue to function very well by sending the proper price
signals to promote the development and use of the most efficient
generation resources.”  New Capacity  Gas-fired plants and wind generation accounted for most of
the 745 megawatts added to the New York grid in 2012, the NYISO
said. More than 1,400 megawatts of capacity with an average age
of 43 years were either permanently shut or suspended operations
during the year.  The shift to more reliance on gas-fired generation also
pushed power prices lower in New England. The average price for
gas fell 20 percent to $4.01 per million British thermal units
from $4.98 in 2011 amid higher production from the Marcellus
shale in  Pennsylvania , ISO New England said.  Electricity consumption on the six-state grid fell by about
0.9 percent to 128,007 gigawatt-hours in 2012 because of the
“lingering effects of the economic downturn,” milder weather
and an increased push toward  energy efficiency , the Holyoke,
Massachusetts-based operator said.  The total amount paid for electric energy in New England
last year was $5.2 billion, down from $6.7 billion the previous
year, the grid operator said. The value of this market rose to a
high of $12.1 billion in 2008 when  gas prices  soared, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
