Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Wood River refinery in
 Illinois  plans to shut two crude distillation units, a
hydrocracker, a diesel hydrotreater and a coker for work
beginning in late February, a person familiar with the
turnaround schedule said.  The crude distillation units will be idled in the last week
of February for 33 days, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The refinery 
will begin shutting a hydrocracker on Feb. 26 for work lasting
until late March, a diesel hydrotreater on March 9 for six days
and a delayed coker on March 25 for six days, the person said.  Other units will be taken down for work during the
turnaround, including two desulfurization units for a combined
24 days, the person said.  Rich Johnson, a company spokesman in Houston, declined to
comment on the plans in an e-mail.  The Wood River refinery, located 15 miles northeast of St.
Louis, can process as much as 356,000 barrels of crude oil a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s a joint
venture between Phillips and  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
