Former New York Jets offensive
coordinator  Tony Sparano  is joining the National Football
League’s Oakland Raiders as offensive line coach.  Sparano, 51, also will serve as assistant head coach under
Dennis Allen, the Raiders said yesterday in an e-mailed release.  Sparano was fired after one season as the Jets’ offensive
coordinator. The team finished 6-10 and gained 299.2 yards per
game, third fewest in the 32-team league. The Jets averaged 17.6
points per game, their fewest since 2007.  The Raiders were 4-12 last season and haven’t had a winning
season since making the  Super Bowl  after the 2002 season. They
averaged 344 yards and 18.1 points per game under offensive
coordinator Greg Knapp, who was replaced this month by Greg Olson.  Prior to joining the Jets, Sparano was head coach of the
Miami Dolphins, where he was 29-33 in three-plus seasons from
2008 to 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
