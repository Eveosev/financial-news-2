Swansea said Michu, the Welsh soccer
club’s top goalscorer, signed a contract extension to stay at
the Premier League team through 2016.  The Spaniard has scored 16 times in 28 appearances for the
team since joining in July. The 26-year-old signed a new four-
year deal, a 12-month extension to the pact he signed when he
arrived from Spain’s Rayo Vallecano for 2.2 million pounds ($3.5
million), Swansea said today in a statement on its website.  “It was an easy decision for me,” Michu said in the
statement. “I am living a dream here at Swansea.”  Swansea plays Chelsea tonight with an opportunity to reach
the League Cup final. The Welsh team holds a 2-0 advantage from
the first game of the two-match semifinal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
