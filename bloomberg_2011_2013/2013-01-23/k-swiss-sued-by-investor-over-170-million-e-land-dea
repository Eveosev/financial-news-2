K-Swiss Inc. (KSWS) , the money-losing
athletic-footwear maker, was sued by an investor who contends
the company’s shares are undervalued in a $170 million, $4.75-a-
share offer from South Korean clothier E.Land World Ltd.  Directors of Westlake Village, California-based K-Swiss are
duty-bound to negotiate the best possible price for the company,
David Raul said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint made
public today in Wilmington.  The company’s officers and directors hold about 75 percent
of the voting power and their voting agreements “essentially
ensure that the proposed transaction will be approved, and pose
an unreasonable and preclusive obstruction to the emergence of a
superior alternative bid,” Raul claims.  K-Swiss and Seoul-based E.Land World announced the deal
Jan. 16 with E.Land offering a 49 percent premium for Class A
common stock at the time. The shares were unchanged at $4.71 in
Nasdaq stock market trading in  New York  at 3:51 p.m.  Raul is asking a judge to grant the case class or group
status, in behalf of all outside shareholders, and to stop the
transaction under its present terms.  Tripp Sullivan, a K-Swiss spokesman, said the company had
no comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Raul v. Nichols, CA8239, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
