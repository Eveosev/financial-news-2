La Banque Postale, the banking arm
of  France ’s postal service, is receiving lawful aid from France
to help people receive better access to banking, the European
Union said.  The European Commission, which checks whether state aid is
in line with EU competition rules, said French public financing
to La Banque Postale from 2009 to 2014 is legal. The system
gives “a significant number of economically disadvantaged
people” access to basic banking payment services through La
Banque Postale’s so-called Livret A savings accounts, the EU
said in a statement today.  “The Livret A distributed by La Banque Postale improves
banking accessibility for the economically disadvantaged part of
the population,” EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  
said in an e-mailed statement today. “The compensation that the
French State grants to La Banque Postale to fulfil this mission
is in line with our rules since it is limited to the cost for
discharging the public service obligations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
