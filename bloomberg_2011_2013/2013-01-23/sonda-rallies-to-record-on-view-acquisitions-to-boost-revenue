Sonda SA (SONDA) , Chile’s largest
information technology company and  software developer , rose to a
record on speculation acquisitions will further boost revenue.  Sonda gained 1.5 percent to 1,610 pesos today in Santiago,
its highest level since it began trading in 2006. The Ipsa index
retreated 0.5 percent.  The stock has rallied on the company’s plans to invest $700
million through 2015, Claudia Cavada, an analyst at BICE
Inversiones in Santiago, said in a phone interview. Of that
amount, 71 percent will be used to fund acquisitions, according
to a presentation posted this month on Sonda’s website.  “The new investment plan is more aggressive,” Cavada
said. “Sonda has a record of obtaining synergies from its
acquisitions.”  The company invested $439 million between 2010 and 2012,
according to the presentation.  Sonda has completed 11  acquisitions  in  Latin America  since
its listing in 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company’s revenue has increased to $1.23 billion in 2011
from $352 million in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
