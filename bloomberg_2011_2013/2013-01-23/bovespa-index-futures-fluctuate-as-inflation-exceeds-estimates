Bovespa-index futures swung between
gains and losses as  Brazil ’s inflation exceeded estimates in
January, clouding the outlook for interest rates.  Steelmaker Cia. Gas distributor  Cia. de Gas  de Sao Paulo
may be active after the investment bank Itau BBA cut its
recommendation on the stock to the equivalent of sell from hold.  Bovespa-index  futures  fell less than 0.1 percent to 61,795
at 9:18 a.m. in Sao Paulo, after rising as much as 0.1 percent
in earlier trading. The real was little changed at 2.0434 per
dollar.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index rose 0.88%
though mid-January, exceeding 0.82% median forecast of 38
economists, the national statistics agency said today.  The central bank board, led by Alexandre Tombini, kept the
benchmark interest rate at 7.25 percent for a second straight
meeting on Jan. 16, matching the forecast of all 56 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The best strategy is to keep monetary
policy conditions unchanged for a “prolonged period,” policy
makers said in a statement accompanying the unanimous decision.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  entered a bull market on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern economic growth might miss
expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in Brazil
boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its advance to
18 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 11 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday was 6.66
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.25 billion
reais in 2012, according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
