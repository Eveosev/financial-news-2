Copper, already heading for a third
straight monthly gain, may reach the highest price since April
in the next few weeks, according to  technical analysis  by Matt Zeman at Kingsview Financial.  The metal’s 15-day moving average rose above the 30-day
average on Jan. 16, signaling more gains, Zeman, a Chicago-based
strategist, said in a telephone interview. Prices are also
trading above the 50-day moving average, another bullish
indicator, he said. Copper may reach $3.90 a pound by late
February, he said. That would be 5.3 percent higher than
yesterday’s closing price of $3.705.  The last time the 15-day average crossed above the 30-day
was on Dec. 3, and prices rallied for two weeks. Futures for
March delivery slid 0.2 percent to $3.6975 at 9:19 a.m. on the
Comex in New York. Through yesterday, the metal was 1.4 percent
this month on signs of improving U.S. economic growth.  “We need to see a few more clear-cut closes above $3.70,
but if the data continues to look good, copper should keep
pushing higher,” Zeman said in a telephone interview. “We’re
seeing higher lows, and that’s a bullish scenario.”  The metal will meet “resistance” between $3.80 to $3.83
before reaching $3.90, Zeman said. Resistance refers to an area
where analysts anticipate orders to sell.  In technical analysis, analysts study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
