United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  posted
higher fourth-quarter profit than analysts estimated as the
acquisition of aerospace-parts maker Goodrich Corp. buoyed
performance.  Earnings excluding discontinued operations were $1.04 a
share, the Hartford, Connecticut-based company said today in a
statement. That compared with the $1.03 average of 22  estimates 
in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 14 percent to $16.4 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert  is reaping the
benefits of the $16.5 billion Goodrich deal, the largest
aerospace takeover on record, while streamlining units that make
Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines. The
company, which also makes Sikorsky helicopters and Otis
elevators, reiterated its forecast for 2013 profit and sales.  “It was a good quarter and a good end of the year,”
Christian Mayes, a  Des Peres , Missouri-based analyst at Edward
Jones & Co., said in a telephone interview. “Things are
proceeding along in line with the company’s expectations, not
least of all with the integration of Goodrich.”  Including restructuring, currency-exchange charges, costs
related to the Goodrich  acquisition  and other items, income from
continuing operations fell about 27 percent to $945 million,
compared with $1.28 billion, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier.  The company’s aerospace systems unit, which includes
Goodrich, posted operating profit of $264 million in the
quarter, up 33 percent from a year earlier. It was the only
division to report higher earnings, after taking into account
restructuring costs and other items.  Divestiture Gains  Profit from discontinued operations, largely made up of the
 Hamilton Sundstrand  industrial pumps and compressor businesses,
which were sold, was $1.11 billion, the company said.  Including both, net income advanced 55 percent to $2.06
billion, or $2.26 a share, from $1.32 billion, or $1.47, a year
earlier.  North American orders for residential equipment at the
company’s climate, controls and security unit, which makes
Carrier air conditioners, climbed 20 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to the statement. Orders for Otis elevators
and escalators climbed 12 percent.  The global economy is finding its footing, Chief Financial
Officer Greg Hayes said in a telephone interview after the
results were announced.  “We all feel a lot better about the economy than we did a
year ago or even a couple of months ago when we were thinking
about how 2013 would unfold,” Hayes said.  Shares Climb  United Technologies   rose  0.7 percent to $88.07 at the
market close in New York. The company has advanced 7.4 percent
this year, compared with a gain of 4.8 percent for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  For the full year, the company earned $4.85 billion from
continuing operations, or $5.35 a share, on $57.7 billion of
sales. That compares with  estimates  for profit of about $5.32
per share and revenue of about $58 billion.  United Technologies said 2013 profit will be $5.85 to $6.15
a share on sales of $64 billion to $65 billion. Earnings and
revenue will grow fastest at its aerospace systems unit, which
includes Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand, the company said at a
meeting with analysts and investors last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
