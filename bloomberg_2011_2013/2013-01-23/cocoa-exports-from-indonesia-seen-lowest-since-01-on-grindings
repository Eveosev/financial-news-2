Cocoa bean exports from  Indonesia ,
the largest producer after Ivory Coast and  Ghana , will decline
for the fourth straight year to the lowest in more than a decade
on increased demand from local grinders, a growers’ group said.  Exports may tumble as much as 26 percent to 100,000 metric
tons this year, according to Dakhri Sanusi, secretary-general of
the Indonesian Cocoa Association. Shipments were 210,067 tons in
2011, 432,427 tons in 2010 and 439,305 tons in 2009, data from
the group showed. A total of 100,000 tons would be the smallest
amount since at least 2001, when the group’s data series begins.  Reduced supplies from Indonesia may help to halt the 18
percent drop in prices of the chocolate ingredient in  New York 
since September, when it surged to a 10-month high. World demand
may outstrip supply by 88,000 tons in 2012-2013, according to an
estimate from Rabobank International, and Macquarie Group Ltd.
forecasts rising average quarterly prices throughout 2013.  “Local processing capacity is increasing because of new
investment and upgrades by existing grinders,” Sanusi said in a
telephone interview from Kolaka, Southeast Sulawesi, today.
Grinding was about 300,000 tons last year, up from 250,000 tons
in 2011, he said.  Cocoa for March delivery rose 0.6 percent to $2,226 a ton
by 6:00 a.m. on the ICE Futures U.S. Cocoa will average $2,300
in the first quarter and $2,400 in the following three months as
sales from  Ivory Coast  and Ghana drop, Macquarie’s Kona Haque
said Jan. 17. Prices will average $2,450 in the third quarter
and $2,550 in the fourth, she said.  Declining Stockpiles  Grinding in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia climbed 3.6
percent to 606,622 tons in 2012, the Cocoa Association of  Asia 
said Jan. 21. Inventories with a valid grading certificate in
warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 43,020 tons as of Jan.
7, down more than 50 percent in the past year and the lowest
since 2003.  Harvesting in Sulawesi island, the country’s main producing
region, may be delayed by one or two months from the normal
start in May because of heavy rain, Sanusi said. Nationwide
output may be unchanged at about 450,000 tons this year, he
said.  “It’s hard to expect higher production this year, with the
extreme weather that may be disrupting flowering and
blossoming,” Sanusi said. “Bean quality will be affected too
if the weather is too wet. If we can match last year’s output
under these conditions, that’s good enough for us.”  Production growth may also be stagnant because of low
yields from aging trees and poor farming practices by small,
traditional farmers, he said. Indonesia has about 1.5 million
hectares (3.7 million acres) of cocoa plantations and more than
half were planted more than 20 years ago, Sanusi said.  Bad weather with high-intensity rain will occur in most
parts of Indonesia during the peak rainy season, which may run
until mid-February, the Meteorology, Geophysics and Climatology
Agency said Jan. 16. Heavy rains caused flooding in the capital,
Jakarta, last week, claiming 20 lives and forcing about 46,000
people to seek refuge away from their home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
