The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index swung between
gains and losses as inflation accelerated more than forecast,
bolstering speculation the central bank will increase borrowing
costs from record lows and reduce support for the economy.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA,  Brazil ’s second-
biggest steelmaker by market value, fell to its lowest level in
two months.  The Bovespa advanced less than 0.1 percent to 61,705.46 at
11:16 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real strengthened 0.1 percent to
2.0402 per dollar. The IPCA-15  consumer price index  rose 0.88
percent in the month through mid-January, compared with an
increase of 0.69 percent in the prior period, the national
statistics agency reported today. The median forecast of 38
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.82 percent advance.  “Investors are now more cautious because the monetary
authority may increase  interest rates ,” Lucas Brendler, who
helps manage about 6 billion reais at Banco Geracao Futuro de
Investimentos, said by phone from  Porto Alegre .  Usiminas dropped 2.1 percent to 11.06 reais, the lowest
level on a closing basis since Nov. 16.  The central bank held the benchmark interest rate at 7.25
percent for a second straight meeting on Jan. 16, saying the
domestic recovery was “less intense” than expected and the
balance of risks for inflation worsened in the short term.  Bull Market  The Bovespa entered a  bull market  on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern economic growth might miss
expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in Brazil
boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its advance to
18 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.6 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 11 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  yesterday was 6.29
billion reais ($3.1 billion), compared with a daily average of
7.25 billion reais in 2012, according to data compiled by the
 exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
