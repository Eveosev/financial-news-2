Simpo SIK, a Serbian wood processing
unit of furniture maker and retailer  Simpo AD (SMPO) , plans a biomass
plant with Slovakia’s  Grafobal Group Energy .  The two companies signed an agreement yesterday, Ljubomir
Ilkic, Simpo’s vice-president, said in a phone interview today.
The 5-megawatt, 20 million-euro ($27 million) plant fueled by
wood chips will produce steam for Simpo SIK’s presses,
electricity and communal heating for Kursumlija, the southern
Serbian municipality where the company is based, he said.  Bratislava, Slovakia-based Grafobal would finance the plant
for which a binding contract is expected in September, Ilkic
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
