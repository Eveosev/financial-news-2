KB Home (KBH) , a Los Angeles-based
homebuilder, rose to an almost three-year high after reporting a
54 percent increase in orders for the first seven weeks of its
fiscal first quarter.  The company announced the preliminary increase in orders
yesterday for the quarter ending in February. In a separate
statement, KB Home said it planned to underwrite public
offerings of $100 million of stock and $150 million of
convertible senior notes due in 2019, and may use the proceeds
for land acquisition and development. The announcements were
made after the close of regular U.S. trading.  “Order growth so far” in the quarter is “a solid
positive surprise,”  Michael Rehaut , William Wong and Jason Marcus, analysts at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , wrote in a note to
clients today. “These initial order results represent material
upside to our existing 1Q order-growth estimate of 9 percent,
which we now raise to 34 percent.”  Orders totaled 750 for the quarter through Jan. 18, up from
488 a year earlier, KB Home said. The company also said
yesterday that it’s using Citigroup Inc. to assemble a syndicate
of financial institutions to provide a new secured revolving
credit facility of as much as $200 million, with an option to
increase it to $300 million.  KB Home climbed 8.9 percent to $18.63 at the close of  New
York  trading. It was the highest price since May 2010. The stock
was the biggest gainer among the 11 companies in the Standard &
Poor’s homebuilding  index , which rose 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
