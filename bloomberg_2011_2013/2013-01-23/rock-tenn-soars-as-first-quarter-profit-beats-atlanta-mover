Rock-Tenn Co. (RKT) , the second-largest
U.S. maker of corrugated shipping boxes, rose the most in more
than a year after posting fiscal first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Rock-Tenn rose 8.1 percent to $80.03 at the close in New
York, the most since Aug. 9, 2011.  Net income in the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $86
million, or $1.18 a share, from $76.7 million, or $1.06, spurred
by higher prices for container board and shipping boxes, the
Norcross, Georgia-based company said today in a statement.
Profit excluding restructuring costs was $1.35 a share, topping
the $1.27  average  of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Rock-Tenn has been struggling in recent quarters” as it
has sought to reap improved operating efficiencies from its 2011
acquisition of shipping-box maker Smurfit-Stone Container Corp.,
 Mark Connelly , a New York-based analyst at Credit Agricole
Securities USA Inc., said today in an e-mail. “These results
suggest that the worst is over.”  The company expects full-year free cash flow of about $700
million, up from an earlier forecast of $650 million to $675
million, “on our improving performance and our outlook for the
remainder of the year,” Chief Executive Officer James Rubright
said today on a conference call.  International Paper Co. (IP) , based in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , is
the largest U.S. maker of corrugated shipping boxes, according
to a presentation on Rock-Tenn’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
