India ’s rupee rose, approaching a
three-month high, after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
said prudence will be a key theme in next month’s budget and
pledged to deepen an economic-policy overhaul.  The government raised the tariff on gold, India’s second-
biggest import, to 6 percent from 4 percent on Jan. 21 to help
reduce a record current-account shortfall. Chidambaram said in
an interview yesterday he plans to stick to a budget-deficit
target of 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the year
through March 2014, adding that he’d like  interest rates  to
moderate to revive economic growth.  “India’s reform story gained momentum via increased taxes
on gold imports,” analysts at Morgan Stanley, including New
York-based Rashique Rahman, wrote in a research report received
today. Inflows into local-currency bonds will increase and
support the rupee, they wrote.  The currency advanced 0.2 percent to 53.6925 per dollar as
of 9:30 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 53.3800 yesterday, the strongest level since Oct. 23.
One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 30 basis
points, or 0.30 percentage point, to 10 percent.  Bond Purchases  The capital-market regulator met its target to sell 176.61
billion rupees ($3.3 billion) of permits that allow global funds
to purchase government debt on Jan. 21, according to two people
familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because
they aren’t permitted to speak to the media. Foreign investor
 holdings  of rupee-denominated securities rose to a record $33.3
billion this month, stock exchange data show.  India’s central bank will lower its benchmark  repurchase
rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent at a Jan. 29 review,
according to 11 of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Two
predict a cut to 7.50 percent and one sees no change.  The rupee’s gains will be limited by demand for dollars
from importers, according to Yes Bank Ltd. The  Reserve Bank  of
India  eased rules  for exporters yesterday to purchase dollars.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.67 per
dollar, compared with 54.79 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.79 versus 54.60. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
