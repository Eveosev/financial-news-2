Safeway Inc. (SWY) , the second-largest
U.S. grocery-store chain, advanced the most in more than 15
months after Desjardins Securities Inc. said  Metro Inc. (MRU)  may bid
for its Canadian stores.  Safeway  climbed  5.4 percent to $19.85 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since Oct. 4, 2011. The shares sank 14
percent last year, compared with a 7.5 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s Consumer Staples Index.  Metro, Canada’s third-largest supermarket chain, may seek
grocery and pharmacy acquisitions after selling almost half of
its stake in  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (ATD/B)  for C$479 million
($479.6 million), Keith Howlett, an analyst at Desjardins
Securities in Montreal, said in a note today. Safeway Canada is
a possible target along with the Overwaitea, Familiprix and Jean
Coutu chains, he said.  Acquiring Safeway  Canada , a unit of the $4.75 billion
publicly traded company based in Pleasanton, California, would
give Metro more than 200 stores that generated $6.7 billion of
revenue in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Teena Massingill, a spokeswoman for Safeway, didn’t
immediately reply to a telephone call or an e-mail seeking
comment. Marie-Claude Bacon, a spokeswoman for Montreal-based
Metro, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
