Honeywell Flour Mill Plc (HONYFLOU) , a Nigerian
processor of flour and livestock feeds, advanced the most in 2
1/2 months after investment bank Greenwich Trust Ltd. said the
shares could almost double by the year end.  The company closed 4.8 percent higher at 2.84 naira in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the biggest increase since
Nov. 6. It was Honeywell’s eighth consecutive daily gain, the
longest winning streak since Oct. 21, 2009. Over 13.8 million
shares changed hands, or more than six times the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Honeywell Flour is attractive for short-term
investment,” analysts at Lagos-based Greenwich wrote in a note
to clients. The analysts maintained a ‘buy’ recommendation on
the stock, with a year-end target price range of 4.59-4.78
naira, compared with its closing price on Jan. 18 of 2.52 naira.  Net income for the three months through September climbed
to 1.3 billion naira ($8.3 million) from 959 million naira a
year earlier, Honeywell said on Nov. 14. The jump in net income
“is reason for investors to hope for higher dividends for the
2013 financial year,” the Greenwich analysts wrote, citing
Honeywell’s investor relations department.  Honeywell has gained 36 percent this year, ahead of a 7.7
percent rise for  Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc  and 2.4 percent for
 Dangote Flour Mills Plc. (DANGFLOU)  The Lagos-based company has a capacity
of 1,610 metric tons per day and is installing a new plant with
additional capacity of 1,000 tons a day, according to Greenwich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
