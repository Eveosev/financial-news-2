France ’s Seine River ports, Le
Havre, Rouen and Paris, handled less crude oil and refinery
products last year after refiner Petroplus Holdings AG
temporarily halted operations in the first half, port group
Haropa said.  The volume of bulk liquids handled dropped 12 percent to
47.2 million metric tons from 53.5 million tons in 2011, Haropa
wrote in an e-mailed statement today. Crude handling dropped 18
percent to 22.5 million tons, while refinery products handled by
the ports dropped 6.3 percent to 19.3 million tons.  Petroplus’s Petit-Couronne site near Rouen went into
administration after the company filed for insolvency in
January, before resuming operations in June under a so-called
tolling deal with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   “The context, particularly the temporary suspension of
activity by Petroplus in the first months of the year, explains
the noticeable drop in traffic,” the port wrote.  Solid bulk volumes fell 20 percent to 11.3 million tons,
led by a 28 percent slump in grain traffic to 5.45 million tons,
the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
