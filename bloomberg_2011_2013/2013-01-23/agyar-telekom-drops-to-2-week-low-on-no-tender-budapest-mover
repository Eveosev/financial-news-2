Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , dropped to the lowest in two weeks
after the government called off a tender for an electronic road
toll system in which one of its subsidiaries ran as a bidder.  The shares declined 1 percent to 397 forint, the lowest
closing level since Jan. 9. The benchmark BUX stock  index  slid
0.2 percent.  Getronics, which won the original tender, withdrew its bid
last week citing lack of cooperation by its sub-contractors.
Magyar Telekom’s T-Systems unit was a runner-up in the contest.  Hungary’s government decided not to repeat the public
procurement process for setting up the toll system, which will
be installed directly by the state instead, Prime Minister
Viktor Orban said at a press conference broadcast on the
government’s website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
