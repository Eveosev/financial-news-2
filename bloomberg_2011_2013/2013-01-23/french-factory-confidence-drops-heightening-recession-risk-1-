French industrial confidence
unexpectedly fell in January, the latest indication that
 Europe ’s second-largest economy may be edging closer to a
 recession .  Sentiment among factory executives fell to 86 from 89 in
December, national statistics office Insee said today in a
statement from Paris. Economists had expected a reading of 90,
the median of 22 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The decline brings the confidence reading close to the
three-year low of 85 reached in October and underlines the
challenge facing President Francois Hollande as he seeks
simultaneously to cut France’s budget deficit and to revive its
economy.  The “manufacturing recovery in November and December was
short-lived,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP
Paribas in Paris. “This fits with our forecast of another
quarter of GDP decline in the first quarter after the decline we
have forecast for the fourth quarter.”  Joblessness is at its highest since 1998 and climbing as
companies including PSA Peugeot Citroen SA,  Renault SA (RNO)  and
Alcatel-Lucent cut thousands of jobs. Gross domestic product
probably fell 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, Insee estimated
on Dec. 20. Insee will publish an update of its fourth-quarter
GDP estimate on Feb. 14.  The French economy is expected to contract 0.1 percent in
the current quarter after shrinking an estimated 0.3 percent
last quarter, according to the median of nine forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey published on Jan. 17. That suggests  France  has
slipped into a recession for the first time since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
