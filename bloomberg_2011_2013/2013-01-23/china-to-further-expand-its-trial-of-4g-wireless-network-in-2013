China  will expand its two-year-old
trial of fourth-generation mobile networks this year after
making “very good” progress in 2012, a government official
said.  China is “actively promoting” the 4G network trial, Zhang
Feng, director of the telecommunications development department
at the Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology , said
today at a briefing in Beijing. He didn’t give a time frame for
when the ministry will issue 4G licenses.  “Looking at the experimental results, the whole progress
has been very good,” Zhang said without elaborating. “The next
step in 4G development will be determined according to the test
situation.”  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the nation’s largest operator, is
counting on the move to a 4G network to stem its declining
market share among users who watch videos and play games on
their phones. The company is unable to support  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPhones among other handsets on its existing 3G network as it
uses a homegrown technology.  China Mobile’s share of wireless subscribers declined to 64
percent at the end of December, from 66.6 percent a year
earlier. Its share of high-speed third-generation subscribers
fell to 37.7 percent, from 40.2 percent in the same period.
 China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762)  and  China Telecom Corp. (728) , the
nation’s second and third-largest carriers, both offer iPhones.  The new 4G networks are based on TD-LTE technology. China
Mobile Communications Corp., the state-owned parent of China
Mobile, finished first-phase trials of the system in six cities
with 850 base stations in September 2011.  The trial was expanded to seven cities in the first half of
last year and it was due to reach 20,000 base stations in 13
cities in the following six months. This year, the program was
expected to reach 200,000 base stations, China Mobile said in
August.  Data traffic over the carrier’s wireless networks surged 61
percent from a year earlier in the first nine months of last
year to 626 billion megabytes, the company said in October. The
increase was driven by services including downloads of videos
and e-books, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
