Mortgage applications in the U.S.
increased for a third straight week as purchasing and
refinancing advanced.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  rose 7 percent in
the week ended Jan. 18 after a 15.2 percent increase in the
prior week, the Washington-based group reported today. The
refinance gauge went up 7.7 percent and the purchase index
climbed 2.5 percent.  The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan increased to 3.62
percent from 3.61 percent. The cost of a 15-year mortgage fell
to 2.87 percent from 2.88 percent.  The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan was
little changed at 81.6 percent, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
