China Railway Group Ltd. (601390)  plans to
sell its debut U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and  Fosun
International Ltd. (656)  has begun marketing debt after  Hengdeli
Holdings Ltd. (3389)  offered investors their first Chinese alternative
to property companies this year.  China Railway, the nation’s biggest construction company by
total assets, has hired six banks to arrange investor meetings
starting tomorrow, according to a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today. Fosun is marketing seven-year securities
at a yield of about 7.25 percent, a person familiar with the
matter said. Hengdeli, the Chinese partner of  Swatch Group AG (UHR) ,
raised $350 million from a sale of five-year debt yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Real-estate companies have dominated dollar bond sales by
Chinese corporate issuers this year, accounting for 94 percent
of the $6.1 billion in note offerings since Dec. 31, the data
show. The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds in Asia
from non-payment has fallen this year and was little changed
today, according to credit-default swap traders.  “We’re seeing more diversification in the pipeline now
simply for the fact that so many of the developers have already
tapped the window,” said Owen Gallimore, head credit analyst at
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Singapore . “There
will however continue to be a steady flow of Chinese property
issues.”  Hengdeli, Longfor  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 0.5 basis point to 107 basis points
as of 12:10 p.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark has ranged from 102.8 basis points to
110.1 basis points this year, according to data provider CMA.  Hengdeli’s notes, which priced at par, were trading at
100.8 cents on the dollar as of 2:21 p.m. in Hong Kong,  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  prices quoted on Bloomberg show.  Longfor Properties Co. raised $500 million via 6.75 percent
2023 bonds yesterday, the fourth Chinese developer to sell notes
in the U.S. currency this week, Bloomberg data show.  Greentown
China Holdings Ltd. (3900)  has hired banks to arrange investor meetings
as it considers a dollar bond, according to a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange.  Qatar Telecom (Qtel) QSC is considering pricing 15-year
bonds at about 250 basis points more than 10-year Treasuries, a
separate person with knowledge of that sale said.  Credit Risk  The Markit iTraxx Japan index stood at 140 basis points as
of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG prices. The
measure dropped to 137.9 basis points earlier this week, its
lowest since March, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 113.5 as of 10:41 a.m. in in Sydney, according to ANZ prices.
The gauge has ranged from 111.6 to 127.5 in 2013, CMA prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
