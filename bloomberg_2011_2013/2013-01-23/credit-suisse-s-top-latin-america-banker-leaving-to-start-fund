Credit Suisse Group AG’s Pedro Chomnalez, who oversees investment banking in Latin America,
plans to leave the firm to start an investment company.  Chomnalez, who worked at Credit Suisse for 13 years, said
in an interview today from New York that he is leaving to help
start a company called CG Capital, which will make private
equity investments in  emerging markets . He doesn’t have a
confirmed last day and will be transitioning out of his roles
with the company. The 48-year-old banker has been running  Credit
Suisse (CSGN) ’s Latin America Group since 2004.  His new firm “will have a focus on private equity, without
the focus of the typical funds that have to force themselves to
exit in five years -- or to force the company to do an IPO or
anything like that,” Chomnalez said by phone. “Emerging
markets in general are doing very, very well. Entrepreneurs in
that part of the world have an optimistic outlook for the
future. That’s the core of the message.”  CG Capital will try to create “value in the long term,”
Chomnalez said. Initial investors include families in Latin
America and some in  Europe , and the firm will do business with
Credit Suisse, he said.  Drew Benson, a spokesman at Credit Suisse, confirmed
Chomnalez is leaving the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
