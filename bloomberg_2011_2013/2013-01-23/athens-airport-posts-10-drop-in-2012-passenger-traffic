Passenger traffic at Athens
International Airport SA dropped 10 percent last year as the
European crisis cut trips by Greek and international travelers.  The number of people passing through  Greece ’s biggest
airport declined to 12.9 million from 14.4 million in 2011, the
airport said on its website. International passenger traffic
fell 12 percent to 8.4 million and domestic travelers dropped
7.9 percent to 4.5 million.  The decrease can be “mainly attributed to the country’s
overall critical political and financial situation and the
respective negative impact” on travel, the airport said.  Tourism, Greece’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs in
2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council . An economic contraction, broadcast images of protests,
a second round of elections in June and concern the country
might abandon the euro all weakened Greece’s attraction for
tourists.  International arrivals at the 15 airports that account for
as much as 95 percent of all foreign arrivals in Greece by air
declined 3.3 percent to 11.3 million last year, the Athens-based
Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises said in a separate
statement. Kavala, in the north, had the biggest decline with
international arrivals falling 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
