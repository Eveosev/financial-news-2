 Hanwha Group, a closely held South
Korean industrial conglomerate, invested $30 million in OneRoof
Energy Inc. to enable the company to finance residential solar
power systems in new markets.  OneRoof installs and owns rooftop solar panels that are
leased to homeowners at little to no upfront cost, and customers
on average save 5 percent to 25 percent a month on their
electricity bill, the San Diego-based company said today in a
statement.  Hanwha, which owns solar-panel manufacturer Hanwha SolarOne
Co., bought an $8 million stake in OneRoof in 2011. OneRoof
works with more than 100 U.S. installers and is expanding into
Hawaii,  Arizona  and  Colorado , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
