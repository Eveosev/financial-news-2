Omada Capital , a London-based
investment fund, said it plans to submit an application to buy
units of failed Lithuanian lender Bankas Snoras AB after another
bidder was rejected by the central bank.  “We hope to submit our own application within the next
three to four weeks” to acquire Snoras’s leasing unit and the
 Finasta Group , which controls an investment bank, Peter Hellman,
a partner at Omada, said today by phone.  Lithuania’s central bank rejected an unnamed investor’s
request for approval to buy the assets, the  Baltic News Service 
reported Jan. 21, citing the bank’s administrator Neil Cooper.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley,  Jeffrey Donovan   To contact the reporter on this story:
