South African Airways SOC Ltd. will
object to the planned takeover of liquidated 1Time Airline by
U.K.-based  Fastjet Plc (FJET)  because of laws banning majority foreign
ownership of local carriers.  The state-controlled company is citing legislation that
airlines “operating domestically within South Africa are owned
by companies with a minimum 75 percent South African
shareholding,” SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg today. Fastjet Plc signed
an option agreement in December to acquire the bankrupt 1Time as
part of its expansion across Africa.  Local carriers Comair and state-owned Mango have also
lodged objections to the takeover with the Air Services
Licensing Council, South Africa’s Business Day newspaper said
today.  1Time filed for liquidation in November. SAA, the biggest
airline in Africa, received a 5 billion rand ($550 million)
government guarantee in 2012 to operate “as a going concern.”
It owns Mango, a low-cost carrier.  Fastjet began operations last year and has ambitions to
build a low-cost network across  Africa . It is backed by Stelios
Haji-Ioannou, the founder of Easyjet Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
