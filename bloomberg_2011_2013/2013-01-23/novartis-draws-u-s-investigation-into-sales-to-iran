Novartis AG (NOVN) , Europe’s biggest
drugmaker by sales, said its Alcon eye-care unit is under U.S.
government investigation related to the export of products to
Iran and other countries subject to trade sanctions.  Alcon was notified last year that the U.S. Attorney’s
office for the Northern District of Texas is conducting an
investigation into its sales, Novartis said in a  regulatory
filing  today. The unit, run from  Fort Worth , Texas, received a
grand jury subpoena for documents dating back to 2005.  Alcon is cooperating with the investigation, according to
the filing. The U.S. government has programs that  prohibit  or
limit products made or held in the U.S. from being sold to
certain countries, including Iran, Syria and North Korea.  Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, took full control of
Alcon in 2010 after an 11 month dispute with minority
shareholders. Alcon was based in Huenenberg, Switzerland, with
U.S. headquarters in Texas. It generated $2.6 billion in sales
during the fourth quarter, Novartis said today.  Daniel Vasella , who oversaw the 1996 merger of Sandoz AG
and Ciba-Geigy AG that created Novartis, unexpectedly said today
he will leave the board after 17 years. Joerg Reinhardt,
currently  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s top health-care executive, will replace the
59-year-old Vasella as chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
