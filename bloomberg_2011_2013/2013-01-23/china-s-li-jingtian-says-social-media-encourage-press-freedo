Li Jingtian, Senior Vice President
of the Central Party School of the  Communist Party of China ,
said social media are helping his country move toward a greater
degree of press freedom.  “The social media is actually strengthening supervision of
the Chinese officials” and “this is a very good thing,” he
said today during a panel discussion at the  World Economic Forum 
in Davos. “To guarantee the freedom of the media, of the press,
this is the common goal of the administrations of all the
countries in the world, and this is an issue remaining to be
solved.”  Asked if he thinks the Chinese leadership will allow media
to report more freely in  China , Li said: “We need to minimize
our mistakes, we need to be supervised by different parties,
including the supervision from the society, from the people”
and “the media.”  Harvard professor  Kenneth Rogoff , who sat on the same
panel, said it is essential for China to relinquish controls on
the Internet to foster academic research.  “It’s hard to have a heavy hand over the Internet and
still have a very high level of research and be at the top
level,” he said. “You cannot compete at the top level without
a pretty free Internet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
