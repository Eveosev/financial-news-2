China ’s  yuan  rose to within 0.1
percent of a 19-year high after the central bank raised its
daily fixing rate for the currency for the first time this week.  The People’s Bank of China boosted the yuan’s reference
rate by 0.05 percent to 6.2762 per dollar today. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing. The stronger guidance for the currency was prompted by
the yen’s gains against the dollar after the  Bank of Japan 
deferred new monetary stimulus, according to Khoon Goh, a senior
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  “We expect the yuan to continue to trade at the strong
side of the trading band,” Singapore-based Goh said. “The PBOC
will probably continue to try and maintain a stable fix. There’s
no doubt the Chinese economy is improving.”  The yuan advanced 0.04 percent to 6.2176 per dollar as of
10:11 a.m. in Shanghai, a 0.9 percent premium to the  reference
rate , according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System data. The
currency reached 6.2124 on Jan. 14, the strongest level since
the government unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, increased one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.31 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the
yuan was little changed at 6.1988 per dollar.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.02 percent to
6.2790 per dollar in Hong Kong, a 1 percent discount to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s gross domestic product increased 7.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, after a 7.4 percent gain in
the previous three months, the government reported last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
