New Jersey’s Economic Development
Authority sold $2.2 billion in bonds today, William Quinn, a
spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said in a telephone
interview.  The state “hit all its targets” of terminating $750
million in  interest-rate swaps , refunding variable-rate debt and
refinancing state obligations, Quinn said. The deal was priced
to yield from 0.53 percentage point to 0.8 percentage point more
than a benchmark index.  The offer was oversubscribed, and the present-value savings
of $65 million that it generated exceeded estimates by $20
million, he said. The refunding won’t extend maturities of any
debt, and it was sold at a true interest cost of 2.9 percent, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
