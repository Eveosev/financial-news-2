Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB , the
operator of  Mexico ’s exchange, tumbled for a second day after
Itau BBA Securities cut its rating and said the stock already
reflects expected growth from new share offerings.  Bolsa Mexicana fell 1.6 percent to 32.94 pesos at 2:33 p.m.
in Mexico City. The benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks
rose 0.2 percent.  Net income at the Mexico City-based company may climb 20
percent this year as new equity offerings boost trading volume,
according to a report dated yesterday from Itau, a unit of Sao
Paulo-based  Itau Unibanco Holding SA. (ITUB4)  At that level of growth,
the shares should have a “fair value” of 33 pesos, according
to the report, about where they’re currently trading.  “We find it difficult to make a bullish case for BMV at
the current stretched valuation based solely on a strong equity-
offering pipeline,” analysts led by Alexandre Spada wrote in
the report. They cut the stock to the equivalent of sell from
hold.  Itau said its model didn’t account for the possible move of
Mexican over-the-counter derivatives trading to an exchange
environment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
