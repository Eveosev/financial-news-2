Rubber dropped for a third day after
the Japanese central bank deferred new monetary stimulus,
strengthening the yen and sapping investor appetite for the
commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in June lost as much as 1.1 percent to
308 yen a kilogram ($3,474 a metric ton) before trading at 310.3
yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 11:59 a.m. Futures have
advanced 2.6 percent this year.  Japan ’s currency held a two-day gain against the dollar,
weakening the appeal of yen-denominated contracts, after the
 Bank of Japan  said yesterday it will buy about 13 trillion yen
in assets per month from January 2014. The decision disappointed
investors who had expected immediate easing, said Hideshi
Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  “Futures lost support from the  currency market  after the
BOJ meeting,” Matsunaga said today by phone.  Losses were limited after the International Rubber Study
Group forecast a global surplus may contract this year and next
from a record in 2012 because of rising U.S. and China demand.  Production is set to outpace consumption by 179,000 tons
this year and 153,000 tons in 2014, said senior economist
Lekshmi Nair, who estimates last year’s glut at 460,000 tons.

producing and consuming nations and 120 industry members.  Rubber for delivery in May was little changed at 26,090
 yuan  ($4,196) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 98.70 baht ($3.32) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
