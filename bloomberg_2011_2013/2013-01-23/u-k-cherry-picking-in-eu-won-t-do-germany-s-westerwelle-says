The U.K. cannot expect to pick and
choose its level of participation in a European Union that needs
more integration to cope with the challenges of globalization,
German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said.  “Not all and everything must be decided in Brussels and by
Brussels,” Westerwelle told reporters in Berlin today, in the
first German reaction to Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s speech
pledging to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s relationship with
the EU and hold a referendum on its future membership. “We do
indeed differentiate, but cherry-picking is not an option.”  Germany and the U.K. “share a common destiny in
challenging times of globalization,” Westerwelle said. “And in
challenging times of globalization we as Europeans, we are all
in the same boat.”  Germany wants the U.K. “to remain an active and
constructive part of the European Union,” he said, delivering
his statement in German and then in English. “ Germany  wants an
ambitious reform of the economic and monetary union in such
decisive issues as the future of our common currency. We do not
need less, but more integration.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
