Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
praised U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s view on a referendum
on European Union membership, saying a vote would prompt
citizens to realize the benefits of staying in the group.  “I am confident that if there is to be referendum one day,
the U.K. citizens will decide to stay in the European Union and
contribute to shape its future,” Monti said today in a speech
to the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland . The EU
“doesn’t need unwilling Europeans. We desperately need willing
Europeans.”  Cameron today pledged a referendum on Britain leaving the
EU, describing British backing for the status quo in Europe as
“wafer thin.” The question, he said, would be put to popular vote
by the end of 2017 if Cameron is re-elected in two years and once
he has negotiated a return of some powers to the U.K.  “There is an advantage in the idea of eventually putting
to the people the real question in a referendum,” Monti said.
“I feel pretty confident that all the costs and benefits of
this decision will become explicit, and I think this will
facilitate a decision in the interests of all Europeans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
