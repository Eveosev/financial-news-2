Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the advisory firm
founded by Robert Greenhill, said fourth-quarter profit fell 6.1
percent as investment results deteriorated.  Net income slid to $15.1 million, or 50 cents a share, from
$16.1 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. The average adjusted estimate
of  seven analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg was for per-share profit
of 72 cents. The firm posted investment losses of $8.06 million
in the quarter, primarily on European bets, compared with $9
million in revenue a year earlier.  Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 53, told investors in
November that he expects a pickup in mergers and acquisitions in
2013 following a five-year downturn. Global mergers fell about 8
percent in 2012 from the year earlier, the first annual decline
since 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Given significant volatility in recent results, and a
lower level of activity in recent quarters, the timing of the
firm’s recovery may be further out than one-year forward
estimates reflect,” Devin Ryan, an analyst at New York-based
Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in a Jan. 18 research note.  Greenhill fell 0.8 percent to close at $58.95 in  New York .
The shares have climbed 13 percent this year, compared with a 6
percent gain by the 83-company Standard & Poor’s  Midcap
Financials Index. (S4FINL)   ‘Meaningful Pickup’  Revenue from advising clients rose 17 percent to $100.4
million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the firm
said. Full-year advising revenue dropped 3.7 percent to $291.5
million from 2011. The firm earned $1 million or more in fees
from 66 clients last year, down 11 percent compared to 2011,
according to the statement  Greenhill set aside $48.9 million for compensation in the
fourth quarter, or 53 percent of revenue, compared with $54.2
million, or 57 percent, a year earlier. Compensation costs for
the full year fell 6.6 percent to $151.8 million.  Net income for the full year was $42.1 million, down from
$44.6 million in 2011.  Bok has said that the firm experienced a “meaningful
pickup” in U.S. mergers-and-acquisition business in the second
half of 2012. Greenhill climbed to 19th on the financial
 advisory league tables  in 2012 from 42nd in 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  More Hires  Greenhill hired at least seven managing directors last year
as bigger bank rivals cut employees. The firm will probably hire
between five and 10 more this year, Bok said on a conference
call following the results.  Greenhill said in 2009 that it would exit the merchant-
banking business and has sought to realize value from its
remaining principal investments, primarily its stake in  Iridium
Communications Inc. (IRDM)   An increase in the firm’s effective tax rate from 35
percent in 2011 to 40 percent in 2012 negatively affected
profit, Greenhill said in the statement. This was partially due
to one-time  capital loss  on the sale of European investments in
the fourth-quarter, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
