President Gerard Rameix said a decision could be issued in a
case over  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ’s stake in  Hermes
International (RMS)  SCA by the summer.  Rameix said in a speech in Paris that recommendations have
been sent to the sanctions committee.  In October, Rameix said the AMF informed LVMH that its
board will recommend its sanctions committee fine the world’s
largest maker of luxury goods. A hearing may take place in early
2013, he said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
