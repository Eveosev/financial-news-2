Japanese  stock futures  gained before
a report that may show Chinese manufacturing expanded this
month. U.S. equity futures fell as  Apple (AAPL)  Inc. shares slumped in
after-hours U.S. trading.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Sharp Corp. (6753) , which makes
display panels for Apple’s iPhone 5, fell 1 percent as the
world’s most valuable company reported sales below analysts’
estimates. Apple shares dropped 10 percent in after-hours
trading in New York. Newcrest Mining Ltd. retreated 1.2 percent
as Australia’s largest gold producer reported a 15 percent
decline in output in the second quarter.  Futures on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,510 in Chicago yesterday, up from 10,470 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,470 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  was little changed and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced
0.1 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4
percent.  “Signs are mounting that the global equity bull market is
gathering momentum,” said Mikio Kumada, Hong Kong-based global
strategist for LGT Capital Management, which oversees more than
$20 billion. This week “we increased our exposure to Japanese
equities. Japanese companies are still attractively valued and
boast a very high operational leverage -- meaning they are well-
positioned to boost earnings significantly even in an
environment of moderate GDP growth.”  Election Boost  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  yesterday closed at the  highest  level
since December 2007 and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 is trading at
its best level since May 2011. Japan’s Nikkei 225 has risen 21
percent since elections were announced on Nov. 14, and last week
capped its longest weekly winning streak since 1986 on optimism
the central bank will ease monetary policy amid pressure from
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government. The gauge fell the
last three days as the yen climbed and the  Bank of Japan  said it
will wait a year to add open-ended stimulus.  The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its forecast
for global economic growth and the U.S. House voted 285-144 to
temporarily suspend the federal debt limit.  Apple reported first-quarter sales below analysts’
predictions, adding fuel to investor pessimism that has sent its
shares down 27 percent since September.  “Stepping back, and looking at the numbers as objectively
as possible, it seems the run has come to an end,” said Neil Campling, London-based analyst at Aviate Global LLP. “The long-
term buy case no longer stands. The cheap valuation argument
matters little when the earnings momentum fades.”  China Manufacturing  China’s manufacturing may expand in January, according to
economists’ estimates ahead of a monthly  Purchasing Managers ’
Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics due to be
released today. The index will climb to 51.7 from 51.5, the
survey predicts. A level above 50 indicates expansion. The
world’s second-largest economy is rebounding from a seven-
quarter slowdown after the government increased spending on
infrastructure and accelerated investment-project approvals.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 0.5 percent to 101.24
yesterday in New York.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.2 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
