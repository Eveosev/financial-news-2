Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) ,
a contract maker of phones for  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  Research in Motion
Ltd. (RIM) , said it will record a full-year net loss, citing lower
demand from its main customers.  The company’s gross profit margins also narrowed on
“unfavorable” pricing changes and higher costs and it will
record an impairment on some assets, according to a Hong Kong
stock exchange filing by Foxconn yesterday.  Analysts estimate on average that the company may report a
net loss of $187.3 million for 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with net income of $72.8 million in
2011. Foxconn, which also assembles the iPhone for Apple Inc.,
is controlled by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world’s
largest contract manufacturer of electronics, which indirectly
owns  68.2 percent .  Foxconn’s second-half net loss will be narrower than the
$226 million shortfall it recorded in the first six months of
last year, mainly due to its efforts to improve operating
efficiency, make cost savings and dispose of assets, the company
said.  Foxconn made the announcement after the Hong Kong stock
exchange closed yesterday evening. The stock declined less than
1 percent to HK$3.58 at the close, taking its decline so far
this year to 4.8 percent. The shares have fallen by 29 percent
over the past 12 months compared with a 18 percent gain in the
city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The company will publish its audited results later in the
year, Foxconn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
