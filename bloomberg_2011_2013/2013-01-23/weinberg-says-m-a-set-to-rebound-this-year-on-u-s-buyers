Mergers and acquisitions will
rebound this year after a strong finish to 2012, led by U.S.
acquirers, according to Perella Weinberg Partners LP partner
Peter Weinberg.  The final three months of 2012 “were really strong and an
indication of what’s going to happen in M&A activity for the
next 12 to 18 months,” Weinberg said in an interview on the
sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I
think the U.S. is going to be particularly acquisitive, both in
the U.S. and abroad.”  The volume of global takeovers in the fourth quarter rose
34 percent to $720 billion, led by  Softbank Corp. (9984) ’s $38 billion
acquisition of U.S. mobile operator  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  and
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s deal to combine its U.S. operations with
those of  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)   “The conditions of large multinationals are such that M&A
activity is bound to occur,” Weinberg said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
