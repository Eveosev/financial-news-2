South African inflation accelerated
to a seven-month high of 5.7 percent in December as food prices
rose, supporting expectations the  Reserve Bank  will keep
borrowing costs unchanged tomorrow.  The  inflation  rate climbed from 5.6 percent in November,
Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on its website
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 23
economists was 5.7 percent. Prices advanced 0.2 percent in the
month.  All 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the Reserve
Bank will keep the benchmark repurchase rate at 5 percent
tomorrow to support the economy while curbing price pressures
from a weaker rand and rising food costs. The central bank’s
goal is to keep inflation within a range of 3 percent to 6
percent.  “Food prices have been creeping higher, housing, fuel and
power and transport have been pressured, but  core inflation 
remains well-behaved,”  Razia Khan , the London-based head of
Africa economic research at Standard Chartered Plc, said in e-
mailed comments. “With a substantial negative output gap,
policy will remain accommodative for some time.  We see  interest
rates  on hold throughout 2013.”  The rand has dropped 4.6 percent against the dollar since
the beginning of the year, the worst performer of 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The price of wheat increased 4
percent on the South African Futures Exchange in the period.  The rand traded at 8.8794 at 10:46 a.m. in Johannesburg, up
from 8.8903 before the release of the inflation data. The yield
on the government’s 6.75 bonds due March 2021 dropped 2 basis
points to 6.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
