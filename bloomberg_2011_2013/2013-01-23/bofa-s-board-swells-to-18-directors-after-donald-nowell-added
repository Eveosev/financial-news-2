Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, named the ex-chairman of a tabletop
sweetener company and a former treasurer of  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  to
expand its board of directors.  Arnold Donald, 58, who served as chairman and chief
executive officer of Merisant Co., and Lionel Nowell III,
PepsiCo’s treasurer until 2009, joined the 16-person board
immediately, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said
today in a statement.  Bank of America, run by CEO  Brian T. Moynihan , is
overhauling the firm’s board as directors Donald Powell, Charles Rossotti and Virgis Colbert approach or exceed the retirement
age of 72. The firm named four directors in August, including
former Deloitte LLP Chairman Sharon Allen. Other directors came
from the defense, health care and pharmaceutical industries.  Donald was CEO of Chicago-based Merisant, a privately held
maker of sweeteners from 2000 to 2003, and before that spent
more than two decades at  Monsanto Co. (MON)  Nowell was treasurer of
Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo from 2001 to 2009. He was
previously a strategy and business executive of RJR Nabisco Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
