Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
largest bank, is closing its Brazil research unit and cutting
staff there amid a global restructuring, two people with direct
knowledge of the matter said.  Barclays will reduce the size of its equity-trading, fixed-
income and investment-banking business in Brazil, according to
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
decision hasn’t been made public.  Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins , 51, who took charge
in August after the bank was fined a record 290 million pounds
($460 million) for manipulating Libor, is preparing to announce
his restructuring plan. The firm has said it will eliminate
businesses that are a risk to its reputation and aren’t
profitable enough as regulators toughen capital requirements.  Bartolomeo Acquaviva was named country head for the Brazil
subsidiary in June to oversee all of the London-based lender’s
businesses there. Barclays has about 775 million reais ($379
million) in capital and assets of about 6.8 billion reais in
Brazil, according to the central bank’s website.  Kerrie Cohen , a spokeswoman for Barclays, declined to
comment on the job cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
