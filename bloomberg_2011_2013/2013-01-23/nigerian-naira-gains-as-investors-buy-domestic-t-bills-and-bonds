Nigeria ’s naira, the currency of
 Africa ’s biggest oil producer, strengthened as foreign investors
brought dollars into the country to buy domestic short- and
long-term debt.  The naira gained as much as 1.1 percent before trading less
than 0.1 percent higher at 157.29 a dollar by 12:39 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  will auction 164.9 billion
naira ($1.05 billion) of 91-, 182- and 364-day Treasury bills
today, the regulator said on Jan. 16. Nigeria will also sell as
much as 110 billion naira in bonds, the Abuja-based Debt
Management Office said in a  statement  on its website.  “Dollar inflows from foreign investors buying fixed income
securities are providing support to the naira today,” Tunde
Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone.  Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said relative stability
in the currency may be attributed to more foreign exchange from
 oil companies  and investor inflows, in comments to reporters
after keeping the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for an
eighth meeting on Jan. 21.  The yield on Nigeria’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose four basis points to 11.23 percent, according
to yesterday’s data on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association 
website. The yield on $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
was little changed at 3.725 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi retreated 0.2 percent to 1.9105 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
