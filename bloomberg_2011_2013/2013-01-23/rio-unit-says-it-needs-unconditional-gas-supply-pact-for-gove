Pacific Aluminium, a unit of  Rio
Tinto Group (RIO) , said it needed a clear and unconditional commitment
on gas supply from  Australia ’s Northern Territory government for
its Gove alumina refinery.  Rio started a review of the operation in October because of
higher fuel oil costs and low alumina prices, and may suspend
production. The territory’s government said today in an e-mailed
statement it needed more time to arrange gas supply. A pact
would also need a commitment from the federal government to
underwrite funding to build a pipeline to supply Gove as well as
finding replacement gas for local users, it said.  “Pacific Aluminium needs a clear and unconditional
commitment from the Northern Territory government for gas supply
to the Gove refinery,” Pacific Aluminium’s Chief Executive
Officer Sandeep Biswas said today in an e-mailed statement. A
decision on the future of the operation would be made after the
review concludes by Jan. 31, he said.  Rio Tinto  announced plans in October 2011 to sell 13
aluminum assets, including Gove, to improve the group’s
financial performance and transferred smelters, mines and
alumina plants to the new unit. Gove in 2012 produced 2.7
million metric tons of alumina and 7.9 million tons of bauxite,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
