HypoVereinsbank, the German unit of
Italian bank  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , is considering selling private-
equity fund stakes in a deal that would bring in capital for
future investments, said four people briefed on the matter.  The unit has selected  UBS AG (UBS)  to help explore a so-called
stapled secondary transaction, which could reach or exceed 600
million euros ($799 million), according to the people, who asked
not to be named because the information isn’t public..  Oliver Gadney, a spokesman at UBS, and Nicole Rappl, a
spokeswoman at HVB, declined to comment.  Under the deal being considered, a buyer would provide
capital to Milan-based UniCredit’s private-equity fund group,
which is led by Martin Langer. The team has historically relied
solely on UniCredit,  Italy ’s biggest bank, for capital.  Financial institutions have been selling private-equity
interests as they exit businesses that aren’t central to shore
up balance sheets and contend with regulatory pressure. Lloyds
Banking Group Plc, Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc,  Credit Agricole
SA (ACA)  and HSH Nordbank AG are among other banks that have turned to
the secondary market in recent years.  HVB used the secondary market in 2011 when it shopped a
portfolio of about 300 million euros, according to one of the
people. Campbell Lutyens & Co. ran that process.  HVB, based in Munich, was acquired by UniCredit in 2005 and
now operates as UniCredit Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
