The U.S. economy will grow at a
“sluggish” pace that could be challenging for the financial-
services industry, said  UBS AG (UBSN)  Chairman  Axel Weber .  “We are picking up momentum, but not in an accelerated
way,” Weber said today in an interview on CNBC. The economy
probably will grow at about 2.5 percent this year and “it’s
probably going to go back to 3 percent” in 2014, he said.  The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, grew at a 3.1
percent annual rate in the third quarter, according to Commerce
Department figures released Dec. 20.  “It’s going to be a sluggish and muted recovery that we’ll
see and that’s going to provide a challenging environment for
banks,” said Weber, 55, who was in Davos, Switzerland for the
World Economic Forum.  UBS, based in Zurich, is the biggest Swiss bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
