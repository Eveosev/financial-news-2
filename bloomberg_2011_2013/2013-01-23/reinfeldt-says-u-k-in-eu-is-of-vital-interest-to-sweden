Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said the U.K. staying in the European Union is of
“vital interest” to  Sweden .  Prime Minister David Cameron today pledged a referendum on
Britain leaving the European Union, allowing U.K. voters to
decide on breaking up the 27-nation bloc.  Cameron “took an initiative to make possible for the
United Kingdom to stay inside the European Union,” Reinfeldt
said in Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World
Economic Forum.  “I think he also was very clear that he was pushing his
political weight on a future campaign that the U.K. should stay
inside the European Union, which is of vital interest to Sweden,
because we view the U.K. as a like-minded country in many of the
important issues we are discussing concerning job creation and
competitiveness and free trade agreements,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
