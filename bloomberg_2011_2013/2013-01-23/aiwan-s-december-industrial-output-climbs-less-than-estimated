Taiwan ’s industrial output rose less
than economists estimated, as an uneven global recovery hurt
demand for the island’s goods and construction declined.  Production climbed 2.39 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 5.87 percent gain in November, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said in Taipei today. The median of
13 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was 6.8 percent.  Taiwan remains vulnerable to fluctuations in demand amid an
uneven recovery in the U.S. and  Europe , even as accelerating
growth in China has boosted exports. Sales of U.S. existing
homes unexpectedly fell in December as supply shrank, while some
European economies are also struggling to regain strength.  “There is still some uncertainty” about recoveries in the
U.S. and Europe, Ma Tieying, a  Singapore  based economist at DBS
Group Holdings Ltd., said before the report. “Europe and the
U.S. still account for a large share of Taiwan’s total export
demand, so it’s very sensitive to the global business cycle.”  Manufacturing in Taiwan gained 2.84 percent in December
from a year earlier, while construction fell 20.42 percent, the
report showed today.  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$29.092 against
its U.S. counterpart. The benchmark Taiex Index of stocks
declined 0.2 percent at the 1:30 p.m. close.  To contact the reporters on this story:
