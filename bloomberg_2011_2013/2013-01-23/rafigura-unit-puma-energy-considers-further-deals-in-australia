Puma Energy, a unit of commodities
trader Trafigura Beheer BV, is considering further acquisitions
and development of petroleum import terminals in  Australia  after
a deal to buy Neumann Petroleum and its petrol stations.  Switzerland-based Puma Energy, which is acquiring more than
120 service stations in Queensland and New South Wales states in
its first Australian investment, has been studying the
Australian market for about two years, Ray Taylor, Puma’s
general manager for Australia, said today in a phone interview.
Puma also plans to develop a new petroleum import terminal at
the Port of Mackay in Queensland, the company said today in a
statement announcing the Neumann purchase.  “When we enter into a market we tend to do things pretty
quickly,” said Taylor, who previously worked at BP Plc. “So we
would be talking 12 to 18 months in either announcing further
greenfield activities or further acquisitions.”  Puma Energy , formed in 1997, has expanded to include a
retail network of more than 1,300 petrol stations globally and
has operations in Europe, the  Middle East ,  Africa ,  Latin America 
and Asia, according to the company’s statement.      Puma didn’t
disclose the terms of the deal to buy the Australian company,
which runs petrol stations in Queensland and New South Wales
states under the Neumann and Matilda brands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
