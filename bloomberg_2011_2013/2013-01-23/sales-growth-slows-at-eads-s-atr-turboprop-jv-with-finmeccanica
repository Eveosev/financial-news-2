European Aerospace, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD)  and  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  will consider starting to develop a 90-
seat turbopropeller airplane this year through Avions de
Transport Regional, said Filippo Bagnato, chief executive
officer of the joint venture.  “We will have some discussions with our shareholders,”
Bagnato told reporters today in Toulouse. The aircraft would
enter service about five years after the program gets the go-
ahead, he said.  Airlines’ growing interest in larger and more fuel-
efficient aircraft has driven Toulouse-based ATR, the world’s
largest maker of turboprops, to explore expanding its product
range, which currently includes 50- to 70-seaters. Bagnato
expects 90-seat models to capture about 39 percent of a market
for 3,400 turboprops over the next 20 years.  Southeast Asia  is
among the strongest markets, he said.  “In 2012, we were able to give a little more solidity to
the project,” Bagnato said. Discussions were held with
potential buyers and suppliers to refine the concept, he said.  ATR is continuing talks with engine providers, including
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt &
Whitney  Canada , to power the new aircraft.  Safran SA (SAF) ’s Snecma
engine unit has also expressed general interest without having
real hardware to offer, Bagnato said.  Fuel burn rather than higher speed is the priority,
although the 90-seater could fly slightly faster at about 300
knots, Bagnato said. Engine makers would also have to provide
powerplants for the existing types, the ATR 72 and ATR 42.  Fuel Burn  Approval to proceed with the $2 billion effort from the two
companies’ boards is not a foregone conclusion. EADS is in the
midst of a strategy review and heavily focused on completing
development of the Airbus SAS A350, which is due to enter
service before 2015. Finmeccanica is concentrating on asset
sales as the Rome-based business tries to cut debt.  Although supplier concerns last year hobbled ATR efforts to
boost output, Bagnato said by the time the new aircraft reaches
that stage such issues should be resolved. ATR reported record
profit for 2012 today, even as it fell short of its shipment
target amid production delays.  ATR delivered 64 aircraft in 2012, short of a target of 72
units. Sales rose 11 percent to $1.44 billion, also missing the
$1.6 billion target. ATR is targeting 80 deliveries this year
and 90 in 2014 when sales should reach $2 billion.  Bloody Step  “The first step in any ramp-up is the bloodiest one,”
Bagnato said. “The initial problem of getting up to speed with
the supply chain is now overcome.”  The 50-seat ATR 42-600 began commercial operations last
year. ATR expects to book about 80 orders this year after
securing 74 firm orders in 2012. That was down from 157 a year
earlier, although ahead of a target of 70 bookings. It also
secured options for 41 further aircraft bringing 2012 bookings
to $2.6 billion. The backlog in 2012 reached a record 221
aircraft valued at $5.1 billion.  ATR increased list prices for the existing types an average
of 3 percent, with the ATR 72-600 now priced at $24.1 million
and the ATR 42-600 at $20.1 million  To contact the reporter on this story:
