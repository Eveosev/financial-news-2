Deputy Secretary of State Tom Nides,
a former chief operating officer at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , plans to
leave the Obama administration next month and may return to the
financial services industry, according to a person familiar with
the matter.  Nides hasn’t made a final decision about his next move,
said the person, who requested anonymity because the decision
hasn’t been announced.  Nides has been deputy under Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , who is set to leave her Cabinet post. President Barack Obama has nominated Massachusetts Senator  John Kerry  to replace
her.  A diplomat with a banker’s resume, Nides has navigated both
Washington and Wall Street. He worked on the Democratic
presidential campaigns of Walter Mondale in 1984 and Kerry in
2004 and has experience on Capitol Hill.  Nides also served in the Clinton administration as chief of
staff to Mickey Kantor when he was U.S. Trade Representative.  Before joining Morgan Stanley in 2005, Nides was president
and chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, the global public
relations company. He was the chief administrative officer of
Credit Suisse First Boston from 2001 to 2004 and served on the
firm’s executive board.  In 2010, Obama nominated Nides as deputy secretary of state
for management and resources.  Nides’ departure was reported earlier by the Washington
Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
