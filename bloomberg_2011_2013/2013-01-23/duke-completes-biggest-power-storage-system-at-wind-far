Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
utility owner, said the world’s biggest battery power storage
system has begun operating at the company’s 153-megawatt wind
farm in west Texas.  The 36-megawatt Xtreme Power Inc. system can release stored
power from the Notrees Wind project when needed and absorb it
during times of low demand,  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Duke
said in a statement today. Closely held Xtreme Power will manage
the unit at the facility, which sells electricity to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer.  The system, which Duke said in April would cost $44
million, can improve the reliability of the Texas power grid by
responding quickly to fluctuations in supply and demand. Such
systems may eventually help the state avoid blackouts as it
faces tightening power supplies.  “Energy storage will benefit our renewables business, our
customers and the energy sector as a whole,” said Greg Wolf,
president of Duke’s renewables unit. Power releases from battery
storage units can help provide electricity even when the wind
isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
