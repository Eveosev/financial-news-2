Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  told
shippers today that capacity was limited on its expanded Seaway
Pipeline, widening the spread between domestic benchmark West
Texas Intermediate crude and Brent.  The WTI-Brent differential widened by $1.83 a barrel to
$17.57 based on today’s settlements. Enterprise said the limited
capacity was due to “unforeseen constraints in outbound
takeaway” at the Jones Creek terminal.  “Now the question is how long it’s going to take before
the takeaway capacity gets cleared up,” said  Stephen Schork ,
the president of Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania ,
by phone.  The spread, which reached $26 in intraday trading Nov. 15,
narrowed to less than $16 last week.  The 30-inch (76-centimeter) line, which runs from Cushing,
Oklahoma, to Freeport, Texas, reopened on Jan. 11 with capacity
expanded to 400,000 barrels a day. On Jan. 16, the flow had
increased to 301,000 barrels a day, according to Hillary
Stevenson, a Louisville, Kentucky-based data integrity analyst
for Genscape Inc., which monitors pumping stations.  Inventories at Cushing, the delivery point for futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , reached a record
51.9 million barrels on Jan. 11, according to the Energy
Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy
Department. Stockpiles there were expected to fall with the
opening of Seaway.  “What you’re seeing now is, here we go again, the template
is set for the glut up in Cushing to blow out again,” Schork
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
