Cemex Latam Holdings SA (CLH) , a cement
maker with operations in Central and  South America , may surge 27
percent in the coming year as demand increases in Colombia, the
source of more than half of sales, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  Cemex Latam, based in Bogota, has the potential to reach
16,300 pesos in the next 12 months, HSBC analysts led by
Francisco Suarez wrote in a note dated yesterday. The shares
rose 0.3 percent today to 12,840 pesos at the close of trading
in Bogota.  The company will be able to “selectively expand” its
cement capacity in Colombia, where overall industry output is
expected to grow as much as 5.9 percent, according to the
analysts. Such additions should help the company to fend off
competitors in the market, including Jona, Switzerland-based
Holcim Ltd. and Medellin-based Cementos Argos SA.  The shares have the “most significant upside potential”
among peers, because it trades at a discount and is a “likely”
candidate for inclusion in stock indexes, which could attract
more investors, according to the report.  Cemex Latam is trading at 14 times estimated 2013 earnings,
compared with 44 times for Cementos Argos, according to a
separate report from the analysts yesterday.  The company’s shares have surged 13 percent this year after
Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA said Jan. 3 they would be
included in  Colombia ’s benchmark Colcap index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
