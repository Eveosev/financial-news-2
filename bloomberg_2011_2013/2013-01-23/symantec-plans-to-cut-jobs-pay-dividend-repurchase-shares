Symantec Corp. (SYMC) , the world’s largest
maker of antivirus software, announced plans to cut jobs, pay
its first dividend and buy back stock as part of Chief Executive
Officer Steve Bennett’s plans to streamline the business and
return cash to shareholders.  To become more flexible and more quickly meet customer
needs, Symantec will pare its ranks of executives and middle
managers, “resulting in a reduction of the workforce,” the
Mountain View, California-based company said today in a
statement. Symantec didn’t specify the number of jobs to be
eliminated.  As part of a plan to return about 50 percent of free cash
flow to shareholders, Symantec initiated a quarterly dividend,
expected to begin in the June period and targeting a yield of
2.5 percent based on yesterday’s closing price of $20.86. The
board also authorized a stock buyback of $1 billion, to begin in
the fiscal year starting in March. The new repurchase adds to
the $283 million left in the current buyback plan, the company
said.  Symantec earlier today reported fiscal third-quarter
revenue and profit that topped estimates, helped by strong
demand for data-management tools. The company’s shares have
risen 43 percent since Bennett’s appointment as CEO in July,
following the ouster of  Enrique Salem .  To contact the reporter on this story:
