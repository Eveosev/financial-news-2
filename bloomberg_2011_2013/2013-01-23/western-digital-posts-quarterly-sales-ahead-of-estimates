Western Digital Corp. (WDC) , a maker of
hard drives, reported fiscal second-quarter sales that beat
analysts’ predictions as its personal computer maker-customers
returned to ordering.  Sales rose 92 percent from a year earlier to $3.82 billion
in the three months ended Dec. 28. Net income more than doubled
to $335 million, or $1.36 per share, from $145 million, or 61
cents, the  Irvine , California-based company said in a statement
yesterday. Analysts estimated profit of $1.71 a share on sales
of $3.65 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Western Digital shares have surged amid signs that computer
makers have started buying components again after cutting demand
last year. The company’s ability to generate cash has also
sparked speculation that it may go private, following a
Bloomberg News report last week that  Dell Inc. (DELL) , the third-
largest personal computer maker, is in talks for a leveraged
buyout.  The company sees sales in the current quarter of $3.55
billion to $3.65 billion, Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl
said on a conference call. Analysts had predicted revenue of
$3.55 billion on average.  The hard disk drive market will be “flat to slightly
down” from the previous quarter’s 136 million units, he said.  While a weak economy is weighing on Western Digital’s
sales, the second half of 2013 may see demand increase, Chief
Executive Officer Steve Milligan said on the call.  “The overall market for hard drives is beginning to
stabilize,” he said.  The company’s shares climbed 2.9 percent to $48.44 at 10:56
a.m. in New York. Through yesterday, the stock had gained 36
percent in the past 12 months.  Seagate Technology Plc (STX) , a rival to Western Digital, said
Jan. 8 that sales in its fiscal-second quarter rose to at least
$3.6 billion, exceeding an earlier forecast for $3.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
