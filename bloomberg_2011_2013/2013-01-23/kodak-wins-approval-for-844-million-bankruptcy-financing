Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the bankrupt
photography pioneer, won court approval for $844 million in
financing that it will use to complete its restructuring.  The financing from a group of noteholders was approved at a
hearing today by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in
Manhattan. It can be converted into $644 million of exit
financing to fund Kodak’s emergence from court protection,
according to court papers.  Kodak is “well on its way” to completing its
reorganization and the financing will support the company as it
develops its plan, Andrew Dietderich, a Kodak attorney, said at
the hearing. Kodak said in a statement that it plans to emerge
from bankruptcy in the middle of this year.  Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, filed for bankruptcy
in January 2012, and Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez has
been selling businesses to shrink the company and fund its shift
into commercial printing and packaging. Earlier this month, it
won court approval to sell patents to a group of technology
companies including Apple Inc. and Google Inc.  “The financial picture is a stark contrast to the company
that filed for Chapter 11 this time last year,” Dietderich said
at the hearing.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
