Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) , the maker
of the da Vinci robotic system, rose the most in two years after
fourth-quarter profit and sales exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The company gained 9.4 percent to $567.06 at the close in
New York, the biggest single-day increase since Jan. 21, 2011.
Intuitive reported yesterday that  profit  in the quarter was
$4.25 per share, beating by 21 cents that average of 15 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Quarterly sales rose 23 percent to $609 million while
analysts had estimated $585 million. Procedures with the da
Vinci surgical system, which allows for minimally invasive
operations, increased 25 percent from a year earlier, fueled by
greater use in gynecology and general surgery, the Sunnyvale,
California-based company said.  Intuitive shares had gained 16 percent in the past 12
months through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
