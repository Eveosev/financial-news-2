Ascom Holding AG (ASCN)  rose the most in
more than two years after the Swiss provider of mobile
communications said its operating margin almost tripled in the
second half as it cut costs at the network-testing unit.  The stock rose as much as 9 percent, the steepest intraday
gain since August 2010. The shares were 5.3 percent up at 9.95
Swiss francs as of 10:31 a.m. in Zurich, giving the company a
market value of 358 million francs ($385 million). More than
200,000 shares were traded, more than triple the average daily
volume over the past six months.  Ascom implemented measures to reduce costs at its network-
testing unit by 20 million francs in 2013, the Dubendorf-based
company said in a statement today. The unit’s second-half sales
were 15 percent higher than in the first half, bringing its
full-year revenue to about 130 million francs.  “The fast and successful implementation of the
restructuring program already has surprised us positively,”
Panagiotis Spiliopoulos, an analyst at Bank Vontobel, wrote in a
note to investors. He has a hold recommendation on the stock.  Ascom’s total earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization were about 14 percent of sales in the second
half, compared with 5 percent in the first six months. Full-year
net income was about 20 million francs compared with 23.1
million francs in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
