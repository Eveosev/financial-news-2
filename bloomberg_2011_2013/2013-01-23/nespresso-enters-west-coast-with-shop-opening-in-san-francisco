Nestle SA (NESN)  is opening a Nespresso
boutique in  San Francisco , expanding the premium coffee brand
into the West Coast to boost sales as competition increases.  The San Francisco boutique, the fifth Nespresso shop in the
U.S., will be followed by one in Los Angeles later this year,
Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle said on its  website  today.  Nespresso , which has more than 300 stores worldwide, has
been one of the company’s fastest-growing businesses over the
past decade and had revenue of 3.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.8
billion) in 2011, or about 4 percent of Nestle’s sales. The unit
faces increased competition from companies including D.E Master
Blenders 1753 NV that sell single-serve capsules that are
compatible with its machines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
