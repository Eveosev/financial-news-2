International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said 2013 will be a “make-or-break”
year as the world faces a slow economic recovery.  Hours after the IMF cut its global growth forecast to 3.5
percent and projected a second year of contraction in the euro
region, Lagarde said uncertainties in the world economy need to
be lifted.  “If we continue to act, 2013 will be a defining year in
terms of finally getting beyond the crisis,” Lagarde said today
in an address to the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland 
according to her prepared remarks. “But more than that, I
believe we are standing in the antechamber of a new global
economy, marked by rapidly shifting circumstances and new modes
of thinking.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
