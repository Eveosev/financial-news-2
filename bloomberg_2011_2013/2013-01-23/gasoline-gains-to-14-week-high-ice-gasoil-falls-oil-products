European  gasoline  advanced to the
highest level in 14 weeks as BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
bought on the barge market.  Gasoil dropped from the highest in almost three months on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  PKN Orlen SA plans to halt diesel units at its Plock
refinery in the second and third quarters, the company said in
its 2013 maintenance schedule.  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub traded
from $1,006 to $1,008 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That’s the highest since Oct. 17, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Gunvor Group Ltd., Chevron Corp., Vitol Group and Total SA
sold the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added before being
sold at the pump. Cargill Inc. and Argos Groep BV also bought
barges, which usually trade in lots of 1,000 and 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to Brent, rose 1 cent to $8.96
a barrel as of 10:55 a.m.  London  time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined products broker. That’s the
highest since Oct. 11.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened for the
first time in five sessions, to $5.90 barrel, according to PVM
data. It was at $5.84 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for February delivery fell $1.25, or 0.1 percent, to
$968.50 a ton as of 1:19 p.m. on the ICE exchange in London.
February futures traded at a premium of $7.75 a ton to the March
contract, compared with $9 yesterday, as the market trades for a
second week in backwardation. This market structure can signal
rising near-term consumption or reduced supply.  Gasoil’s  crack  narrowed to $16.41 versus $16.96 yesterday.
Brent advanced 0.1 percent to $112.53 a barrel.  Refineries  The outages at PKN Orlen’s Plock refinery are scheduled to
last more than 30 days each, the company said on its website.  PKN Orlen plans to halt a reformer in the Mazeikiu refinery
in  Lithuania  in March for about 45 days, and a diesel unit of
the Kralupy refinery in the Czech Republic in September for more
than 30 days, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
