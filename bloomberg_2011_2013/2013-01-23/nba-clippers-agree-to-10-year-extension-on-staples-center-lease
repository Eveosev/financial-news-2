The  Los Angeles Clippers  agreed to a
10-year extension on their lease at the Staples Center, which
owner  Philip Anschutz  put up for sale in September.  Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed by the National
Basketball Association team, which played its first regular
season at the venue on Nov. 2, 1999. The new lease runs through
June 2024.  “It is indeed an honor to benefit from the sustained
stability that accompanies being part of the greatest venue in
the NBA, and we are glad to provide this state of the art
backdrop to our deserving and loyal fan base,” said Clippers’
President Andy Roeser in a statement.  The Anschutz Entertainment Group’s portfolio of 100 venues
on five continents includes the Staples Center as well as
interests in the Los Angeles Lakers, the L.A. Kings, who in June
won the  National Hockey League ’s Stanley Cup for the first time,
and the L.A. Galaxy professional soccer team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
