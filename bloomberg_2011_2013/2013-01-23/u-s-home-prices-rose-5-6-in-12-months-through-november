U.S. home  prices  climbed 5.6 percent
in the 12 months through November as buyers competed for a
dwindling inventory of properties, according to the  Federal
Housing Finance Agency .  Prices  rose  0.6 percent from October on a seasonally
adjusted basis, the FHFA said today in a report from Washington.
The average estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey was
for a 0.7 percent advance. The index is 15 percent below its
April 2007 peak and about the same as the August 2004 level.  Home prices  have been climbing as growing  employment  and
low borrowing costs fuel demand. Sales of existing homes fell 1
percent in December to a 4.94 million annual rate, restrained by
the tight supply of available properties, figures from the
National Association of Realtors showed yesterday.  “Rising prices are good news at this point and they are
making the difference,”  Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS
Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, said in a telephone
interview. “It brings in more buyers and sellers and lubricates
the housing market. It’s going to stimulate sales.”  The 12-month advance was led by a 15 percent jump in the
region that includes  Arizona , Nevada and Colorado. Prices
increased 11 percent in the area that includes California,
Washington and Oregon.  The smallest gain was in the region that includes New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where values rose 0.5 percent.  The FHFA data, which is based on single-family houses with
mortgages backed by  Fannie Mae  or  Freddie Mac , doesn’t provide a
specific price. The  median price  of an existing single-family
home, as measured by the National Association of Realtors, was
$180,800 last month, up 12 percent from a year earlier.  The real-estate agents’ report yesterday showed a total
of 4.65 million homes were sold last year, up 9.2 percent from
4.26 million in 2011 and the most since 2007. The annual advance
was the biggest since 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
