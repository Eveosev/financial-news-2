Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L) , Lithuania’s
state-controlled energy terminal operator, canceled plans to
approve this week a contractor to link a natural-gas terminal to
the country’s grid pending a probe of the tender terms.  “The company was obligated to suspend the procedure of
conclusion of the procurement contract” by order of the Public
Procurement Office in Vilnius, the Baltic nation’s capital, the
Klaipeda-based operator said today on its website.  Germany ’s PPS Pipeline Systems, whose bid to build the 20-
kilometer (21.8-mile) pipeline was rejected, last week said the
tender lacked transparency and should be held again. Klaipedos
Nafta shareholders planned on Jan. 25 to approve a group
including Kauno Dujotiekio Statyba AB and Siauliu Dujotiekio
Statyba UAB, both from  Lithuania , as the winner.  Lithuania is building a floating liquefied natural-gas
terminal on the Baltic Sea coast to diversify its gas imports
and reduce reliance on  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom. Klaipedos Nafta
said it would cooperate with procurement officials seeking to
resolve the matter swiftly and avoid delaying the late-2014
target date for completion of the LNG terminal project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
