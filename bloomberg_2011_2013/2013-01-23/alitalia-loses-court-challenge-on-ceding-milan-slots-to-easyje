Alitalia SpA lost an Italian court
challenge to an order by the country’s antitrust regulator that
it should cede slots at Milan’s Linate airport to rival  EasyJet
Plc (EZJ) , according to a court filing today.  Italy’s antitrust agency in October  assigned  seven slots to
EasyJet to allow it fly from Milan to  Rome ’s Fiumicino airport
from 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
