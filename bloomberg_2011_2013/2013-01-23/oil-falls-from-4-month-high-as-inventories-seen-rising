Oil dropped the most in a month in
New York, widening its discount to Brent as capacity on the
Seaway pipeline was reduced and the  International Monetary Fund 
cut its global growth forecasts.  West Texas Intermediate oil tumbled 1.5 percent as capacity
of the Seaway line, which runs from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to the
 Gulf Coast , was limited to 175,000 barrels a day at the Jones
Creek delivery point. The normal capacity is 400,000. Oil
slipped earlier after the IMF lowered its world growth forecast
to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in October.  “They are limiting the Seaway deliveries and the market is
concerned that the glut in Cushing could build again,” said
 Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in
 Chicago . “The IMF forecast disappointed the market and the
growth downgrade weighed on oil.”  WTI crude for March delivery fell $1.45 to settle at $95.23
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the largest
decline since Dec. 21. The February contract expired yesterday
at $96.24, the highest close for a front-month contract since
Sept. 17. Trading volume nearly doubled the 100-day average,
heading for the highest level in almost a year.  Prices were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported oil inventories increased 3.17 million
barrels last week to 364 million. Oil slid $1.10, or 1.1
percent, to $95.58 at 4:32 p.m. in electronic trading.  Brent Climbs  Brent for March settlement climbed 38 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $112.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The volume of futures exchanged was 45 percent
more than the 100-day average.  The European benchmark’s premium to WTI widened $1.83 to
$17.57, the biggest increase since Nov. 15.  WTI’s drop “was triggered by the Seaway headlines,” said
 Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “There will be less oil
getting to the Gulf. Some refineries might have to cut back
runs, which will hurt demand for WTI.”  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  limited
capacity, owners of the pipeline, advised shippers that Seaway’s
capacity limit is due to “unforeseen constraints in outbound
takeaway.”  “This is giving more weakness to WTI and pressuring the
Brent-WTI spread to the opposite direction,” said Tariq Zahir,
a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital
Advisors.  Seaway Restart  Enterprise and Enbridge restarted the Seaway line on Jan.
11, shipping oil from Cushing, the delivery point for New York
oil futures, to the Gulf Coast, at a capacity of 400,000 barrels
a day, up from 150,000 barrels. Shipments haven’t reached
capacity, according to Genscape Inc., a Louisville, Kentucky,
company that provides power supply information.  Stockpiles at the hub rose 1.78 million barrels to a record
51.9 million in the seven days ended Jan. 11, gaining for a
sixth week, according to the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Department’s statistics arm. The opening of Seaway
was expected to reduce Cushing’s total.  “If this backs up Cushing, that’s not going to be good,
given where inventories are already,” said  Andrew Lebow , a
senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “It
could pressure the spreads further.”  Hussein Allidina , an analyst at  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in New York,
forecast today that the premium will fall to as little as $6 by
the end of the year.  IMF Projection  Oil fell in early trading as the IMF projected a second
year of contraction in the euro region. It expects the 17-
country  euro area  to shrink 0.2 percent in 2013, instead of
growing 0.2 percent as forecast in October, as Spain leads the
contraction and Germany slows.  U.S. oil stockpiles probably rose 2.15 million barrels to
362.5 million in the seven days ended Jan. 18, according to the
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before
tomorrow’s report from the Energy Department. The industry-
funded American Petroleum Institute is scheduled to release
separate figures today.  “The market is waiting for tomorrow’s inventories data,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in Stamford, Connecticut. “Oil’s rally to a four-month high is
a little overextended and you may see some profit-taking.”  The relative-strength index of front-month oil futures rose
above 74 today before ending the day at 65.7. RSI readings above
70 suggest prices will decrease, while figures below 30 can be
buy signals.  “WTI had gone up so fast and so high, and this is the
paring of positions coming into tomorrow’s inventory numbers,”
said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and founder of
Iitrader.com in Chicago.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 901,612
contracts as of 4:36 p.m., the first time it has surpassed
900,000 since Feb. 8. It totaled 529,234 contracts yesterday,
8.7 percent above the three-month average. Open interest was
1.49 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
