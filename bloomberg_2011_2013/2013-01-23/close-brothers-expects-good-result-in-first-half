Close Brothers Group Plc (CBG) , a British
financial-services firm, expects to post a “good result” in
the first half, helped by its banking and asset-management
units.  The banking division’s loan book was at 4.4 billion pounds
($7 billion) at the end of December, up from 4.1 billion pounds
at the end of July, the London-based company said in a statement
today. Assets under management rose 3 percent to 8.5 billion
pounds, with trading at the securities division “subdued,” it
said.  “The group is well positioned for the remainder of the
2013 financial year,” Close Brothers said. The banking unit
“continues to see solid prospects for growth and asset
management remains on track to move into profitability during
the course of this financial year. ”  Close Brothers has been restructuring its funds business
and in 2011 sold its advisory, U.K. offshore and Cayman Islands
operations to focus on banking, securities and asset management.  The company will release its first-half results for the six
months ended Jan. 31 on March 12, it said.  Shares in Close Brothers fell 1 percent to 965 pence at
8:20 a.m. in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
