Munich city council today voted to
appoint Valery Gergiev, the director of the Mariinsky Theatre in
 St. Petersburg , as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic
Orchestra for a five-year term beginning in 2015.  Gergiev will succeed Lorin Maazel, whose contract expires
in two years, the  Munich Philharmonic  said in a statement.
Gergiev, 59, conducted the orchestra in a series of concerts of
the composer Dmitri Shostakovich in 2011 and 2012. He described
it as a “fantastic orchestra” in the statement.  “Valery Gergiev is indisputably one of the most important,
influential and effective conductors of our time,” said Hans-
Georg Kueppers, Munich’s chief culture official. He was the
city’s first choice, Kueppers said.  Moscow-born Gergiev has led the Mariinsky for 20 years, is
also the chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and
has founded festivals in St. Petersburg, Moscow and Rotterdam.
Maazel turns 83 this year.  Gergiev’s appointment was approved by the city council with
a “big majority,” according to the statement.  Muse highlights include  Warwick Thompson  on London theater,
 Richard Vines  on food,  Jorg von Uthmann  on Paris arts and  Ryan
Sutton  on  New York  restaurants..  To contact the writer on the story:
