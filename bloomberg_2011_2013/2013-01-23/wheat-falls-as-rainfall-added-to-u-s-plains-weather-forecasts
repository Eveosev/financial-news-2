Wheat futures fell for a second day
after weather forecasters predicted rain in parts of the
southern U.S. Great Plains, where the worst drought since the
1930s threatens crops.  Some meteorologists now expect “measurable moisture” in
parts of  Kansas  and  Oklahoma , where hard-red winter varieties
are grown, Omaha, Nebraska-based Telvent DTN said in a report.
Parts of the region have had little or no rain in the past three
months, National Weather Service data show.  “People are waiting to see if the precipitation comes
through,” Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity
Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana , said by telephone
before the DTN report was released. Forecasters are saying
“that an inch of precipitation is coming to Kansas by the end
of this week or this weekend,” he said.  Wheat futures for March delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
settle at $7.7475 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price is down 2.2 percent in the past month.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
