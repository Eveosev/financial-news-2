Colombia ’s peso bond yields fell to
a record on speculation policy makers will reduce benchmark
borrowing costs next week to shore up a slumping economy.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 5.26 percent, according to the central bank. That is
the lowest close since the securities were first issued in 2009.
The price rose 0.27 centavo to 140.027 centavos per peso.  “Economic numbers are not looking good,” said William Florez, a fixed-income strategist at  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) ’s brokerage in
Bogota. “The central bank will need to lower rates at least
once more.”  Banco de la Republica will cut the overnight lending rate
by a quarter-percentage point to 4 percent on Jan. 28, according
to 25 of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Two expect policy
makers to leave the rate unchanged.  Colombian Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said today in
an interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland,
that he will argue for a rate cut to 4 percent at this month’s
meeting.  Industrial output dropped 4.1 percent in November from a
year earlier, the biggest decline since July 2009, the
government said in a Jan. 18 report. That was weaker than all 21
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Central bankers may lower the  interest rate  by an
additional 25 basis points after this month’s cut if data
continue to indicate a slowing economy, Florez said.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 1,780.50 per U.S. dollar.
The currency touched 1,750.50 on Jan. 2, the strongest intraday
level since July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
