Crude options volatility rose for
the first time since Jan. 15 as futures slid after capacity was
limited on the Seaway pipeline from  Oklahoma  to  Texas .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.01 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4:55 p.m., compared with 19.02 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery fell
$1.45, or 1.5 percent, to $95.23 a barrel on the Nymex, the
largest decline since Dec. 21. WTI’s discount to Brent, the
London benchmark crude, widened $1.83 to $17.57.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  told
shippers today that capacity would be limited to 175,000 barrels
a day on the Seaway pipeline that links the Cushing, Oklahoma,
oil storage hub to the  Gulf Coast . The line was in the process
of increasing to 400,000 barrels a day.  “This could back things up at Cushing again and will put
pressure on the WTI-Brent spread,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil
market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research consulting
company in  London .  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts, which rose 37 cents to $1.58 a barrel on volume
of 2,499 contracts at 4:22 p.m. in New York. March $105 calls
were the second-most active with 1,805 lots. They declined 2
cents to 7 cents a barrel.  Puts Volume  Puts accounted for 62 percent of electronic trading volume
