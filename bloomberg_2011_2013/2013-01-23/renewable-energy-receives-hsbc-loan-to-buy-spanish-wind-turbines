Renewable Energy  Generation Ltd., a
developer and operator of wind farms, received a 15 million-euro
($20 million) loan from HSBC Holdings Plc to buy  wind turbines 
from Spain.  Renewable Energy used the so-called trade finance facility
to buy three, 2-megawatt machines from Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica
SA, the Jersey, Channel Islands-based developer said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The developer is installing the devices at an onshore wind
farm in Cambridgeshire, south-east England, according to the
statement. The project is expected to start working later this
year. Renewable Energy operates 11 wind farms totalling about
57.2 megawatts and has six projects with planning consent
awaiting construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
