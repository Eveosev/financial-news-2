Indonesia’s rupiah forwards snapped
a three-day gain on speculation importers took advantage of the
rally to purchase dollars at a more favorable  exchange rate .  Contracts to buy the local currency in one month reached
the highest level in more than four weeks yesterday. Its one-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, dropped 25 basis points,
or 0.25 percentage point, to 6.25 percent, the least in two
weeks.  Bank Indonesia  won’t let the rupiah continue weakening,
Investor Daily Indonesia reported Jan. 21, citing Governor
 Darmin Nasution .  “This is just a brief correction following the rally,”
said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, head of treasury research at PT Bank
Negara Indonesia in Jakarta. “Many people were waiting to buy
dollars at stronger rupiah levels. The market has become more
stable, which gives them confidence to do so.”  The currency’s one-month non-deliverable forwards declined
0.1 percent to 9,760 per dollar as of 3:05 p.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s 1.1 percent cheaper than the
spot rate, which dropped 0.4 percent to 9,655, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. A daily  fixing  used to settle
the contracts was set at 9,752 today by the Association of Banks
in  Singapore .  The yield on the 5.625 percent government bonds due May
2023 dropped one basis point to 5.22 percent, the lowest level
since Jan. 10, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
