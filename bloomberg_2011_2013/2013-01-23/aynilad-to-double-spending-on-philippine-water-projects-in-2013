Maynilad Water Services Inc. said it
plans to more than double spending on Philippine water projects
to 17.2 billion pesos ($423 million) this year, its biggest
 capital investment  since it was privatized in 1997.  The utility, which provides water to half of Manila, said
in a statement that it will use internal funds and a loan from
the World Bank to finance its infrastructure spending.  “The previous years have been about water service
transformation,” President Ricky Vargas said in the Jan. 20
statement. “Now that we have improved and expanded our water
services in the West Zone, our next challenge is to accelerate
our sewerage and septage coverage.’’  These projects ‘‘will require a lot of resources,’’ said
Maynilad, a venture of  DMCI Holdings Inc. (DMC)  and Metro Pacific
Investments Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
