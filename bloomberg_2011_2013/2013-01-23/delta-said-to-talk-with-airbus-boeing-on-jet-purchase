Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  is talking to
 Airbus SAS (EAD)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  about buying $1 billion or more of new
jets as the planemakers phase out their current single-aisle
models, people familiar with the matter said.  The order would be at a deeper discount to retail prices
than is customary, because Delta is studying current versions of
the  Airbus A320  and Boeing 737, not the newest variants, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
discussions are private. The talks are for an order of two dozen
to 30 planes, the person said.  A deal of that size would have a book value of at least $1
billion, based on prices tracked by consultant Avitas of
Chantilly, Virginia. New A320s or 737s would retail for about
$2.8 billion, according to published figures from Airbus and
Boeing, although airlines typically pay less.  Buying from planemakers’ existing lineups would fit Chief
Executive Officer  Richard Anderson ’s strategy of finding less-
expensive alternatives to refresh Delta’s fleet while unloading
some of its oldest jets. He has bought used Boeing MD-90s and is
subleasing 88 Boeing 717s from Southwest Airlines Co.  Delta is seeking an accord in which it would get new planes
while having Boeing or Airbus take some of its 50-seat regional
jets, similar to a deal with  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  in December, the
person said. The airline ordered as many as 70 Bombardier jets
with 76 seats and turned in 60 of its 50-seaters.  Share Performance  Anthony Black , a Delta spokesman, declined to comment on
the airline’s jet plans.  Marc Birtel , a spokesman at Boeing’s
commercial headquarters in  Seattle , declined to comment on
conversations with customers, as did Mary Anne Greczyn, a U.S.
spokeswoman for Toulouse, France-based Airbus.  Delta rose  1.1 percent to $13.93 at the close in  New York ,
while Boeing increased 1.4 percent to $75.32. Airbus parent
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. was little changed at
34.69 euros in Paris.  Single-aisle planes such as the Airbus A320 and  Boeing 737 
are the workhorses of the global airline fleet, and seat about
150 passengers, depending on the model and how they’re
configured.  New Boeing or Airbus single-aisle jets wouldn’t add to
Atlanta-based Delta’s capacity, and deliveries would start in
three to five years as planemakers wind down assembly of older
models and shift to the newer aircraft, the person said.  List Prices  Boeing’s upgraded 737 Max with improved engines lists for
as much as $107.3 million, while the Airbus A320neo has a
catalog price of $100.2 million. Anderson also bypassed those
models in August 2011, when he ordered 100 Boeing 737-900ERs
with a list price of more than $8.5 billion.  Getting rid of older aircraft is part of a $1 billion cost-
cutting program at Delta, the world’s second-largest airline.  Delta had 565 single-aisle jets in its fleet as of
September, three-fourths of them made by Chicago-based Boeing or
companies it has acquired, according to the airline’s most
recent quarterly regulatory filing.  The carrier also had 300 50-seat jets in its fleet as of
December, and Anderson said on a Jan. 22 conference call that
Delta has a “clear path” to shrink that figure to 100 to 125
within two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
