General Electric Co. (GE)  settled a
lawsuit filed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over losses
on mortgage bonds sold to  Freddie Mac , the regulator said.  FHFA, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sued GE
and underwriters  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) ,
saying  mortgage loans  backing about $550 million in securities
didn’t live up to their promised quality.  “This settlement resolves the dispute between FHFA and GE
consistent with FHFA’s responsibilities as conservator of
Freddie Mac,” Alfred M. Pollard, FHFA’s general counsel, said
in a statement. “FHFA is pleased this lawsuit has been resolved
and appreciates the work of Freddie Mac in this matter.”  Pollard didn’t disclose the terms of the settlement. A
spokesman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE couldn’t be
reached for comment.  The case against GE is among a group of lawsuits FHFA filed
against banks over mortgage securities sold to  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac.  The agency said in a court filing yesterday that it was
dropping claims against GE, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.  The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. General
Electric Co., 11-7048, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
