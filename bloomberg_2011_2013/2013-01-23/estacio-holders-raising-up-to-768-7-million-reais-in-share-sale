Estacio Participacoes SA (ESTC3) ,  Brazil ’s
second-largest publicly traded university operator by revenue,
is raising as much as 768.7 million reais ($377.6 million) in a
share offering, according to a regulatory filing today.  Rio de Janeiro-based Estacio and its shareholders are
selling as many as 14.7 million voting shares in a primary
offering and 3.6 million shares in a secondary offering for 42
reais each. The company was planning to raise as much as 623
million reais in the share sale, according to a Dec. 3
prospectus.  Estacio  rose  72 percent to 42.75 reais since 2010 as the
number of student loans granted under the Education Ministry’s
Fies program almost quadrupled to 366,566 by the end of last
year. The benchmark Bovespa index slipped 1.5 percent in the
same period.  “For-profit colleges are experiencing a very positive time
in Brazil as  student loans  increased, and all the companies are
taking advantage of this improvement in the situation to grow by
acquisitions,” Fabricio Freitas, an analyst at the asset
management firm Humaita Investimentos, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “Estacio’s offering had a very good demand because the
sector is pretty attractive.”  Estacio, the first company to sell shares in Brazil this
year, said in the prospectus that it plans to use the proceeds
to pay for acquisitions and expansion.  Brazilian technology company Linx SA and its investors plan
to sell shares worth as much as 459 million reais next month in
the country’s first initial public offering in six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
