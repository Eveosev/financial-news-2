The ruble strengthened to the
highest level in eight months as monthly tax payments boosted
demand for the Russian currency and oil, the nation’s chief
export, advanced.  The ruble appreciated for a third day, adding 0.2 percent
to 30.1765 per dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow, the highest level
since May 11. It gained 0.1 against Bank Rossii’s target dollar-
euro basket to 34.7063.  Demand for rubles from corporate taxpayers and banks will
lead to further strengthening in the coming weeks, according to
VTB Capital. The MosPrime interbank  overnight lending rate  rose
13 basis points yesterday to 5.88 percent, the highest level
since Jan. 9, before retreating to 5.48 percent today. Demand
for rubles at the central bank’s morning repo auction today was
more than four times the 10 billion rubles ($332 million)
offered, the regulator’s data show.  “ Interest rates  will rise to 6 percent and higher by the
end of this week and start of the next week,” Dmitry Polevoy,
an analyst at ING Groep NV, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Crude oil, Russia’s biggest export, rose 0.1 percent in
 London  to $112.52 per barrel.  Auctions Mixed  Yield on bonds maturing in July 2022 fell one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.74 percent. The rate on June 2017
debt slid two basis points to 6.24 percent, its lowest in a
week.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 10.5 billion ruble of January
2028 bonds at 7.09 percent after putting up 15 billion rubles of
the debt on sale today. The ministry placed its target of 35
billion rubles of bonds maturing in December 2019, according to
a statement.  Russia  may hold its first domestic bond auction with direct
settlement through Euroclear Bank SA this month, opening the
Treasury market to foreign investors, Deputy Finance Minister
Sergei Storchak said in Davos after the Russian market closed.  The next OFZ debt auction is scheduled for Jan. 30.  “We expect some additional inflows to the OFZ market once
Euroclear becomes operational, which we still expect to happen
by the end of January,” Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin,
analysts at VTB Capital, said in a research note e-mailed before
the auctions and Storchak comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
