Renaissance Capital  Africa, a unit
of the Russian investment bank controlled by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , said its winning market share in equities across the
continent as it chases rivals such as  Standard Bank (SBK)  Group Ltd.  “In 2011 our market share by volumes traded on the
Nigerian Stock Exchange was 12 percent and  Standard Bank ’s was
17 percent but in 2012 we caught up,” Clifford Sacks, chief
executive officer of RenCap Africa, said in an interview in
Johannesburg on Jan. 21. In Kenya, RenCap went from third
largest in equities in 2011 to second last year, he said.  RenCap, which doesn’t disclose detailed financial results,
began operations in sub Saharan Africa in 2006. Sacks, who had
been Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s joint chief executive
officer in  South Africa , joined RenCap as Africa CEO in January
2011. With a population of one billion people and faster growth
rates than many developed nations, banks including BNP Paribas
SA, Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc are expanding in
Africa as they search for new ways to boost profit.  The bank lost three senior members of staff in the past
month following Russian Onexim Group’s acquisition of all of
Renaissance Capital. Last year the investment bank closed
operations in China and India and faced increased competition in
South Africa and Russia.  Shareholders remain “very committed to the South African
markets and sub Saharan Africa,” John Hyman, joint CEO of
Moscow-based Renaissance Capital, said on Jan. 7  To contact the reporter on this story:
