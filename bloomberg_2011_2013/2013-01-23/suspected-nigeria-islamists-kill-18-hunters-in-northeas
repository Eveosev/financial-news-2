Suspected Nigerian Islamist
militants killed 18 people in a northeastern town for hunting
animals forbidden by Islam, a local official said.  Gunmen killed 13 people at a local market in Damboa while
five others died later in the hospital from their injuries, Abba
Ahmed, district head of the area, told Borno state Deputy
Governor Alhaji Zanna Mustapha, who visited the town with
reporters.  “The 18 victims were local hunters who engage in killing
monkeys and pigs, animals forbidden by Islam which they sell at
the market,” said Ahmed. The gunmen “came to the market in a
Volkswagen Golf car and hurriedly carried out the attack.”  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer and most populous
nation, is battling an insurgency by Boko Haram that has killed
hundreds of people since 2009. The group, which wants to
establish an Islamic state in Nigeria, has carried out bomb and
gun attacks in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja. Nigeria’s more
than 160 million people are almost evenly split between the
north and a largely Christian south.  In the northern city of Kano, unidentified attackers killed
three people and injured two others when they opened fire
yesterday on people near a bus stop, Ikedichi Iweha, a spokesman
for the joint military task force in Kano state, said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
