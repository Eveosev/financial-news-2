Gasoline jumped to the highest level
since October as refineries shut units for repair, which may
tighten supplies of the motor fuel.  Futures rose as refiners conducted maintenance at plants in
 Pennsylvania  that supply fuel to  New York  Harbor, the delivery
point of futures contracts. Gasoline  inventories  along the U.S.
East Coast as of Jan. 11 were at the lowest seasonal level since
2006, Energy Information Administration data show.  “There have been refinery glitches and shutdowns that have
helped support gasoline,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline for February delivery rose 1.88 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8487 a gallon at 10:08 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.8571, the highest
intraday level since Oct. 31. Volume was 42 percent above the
100-day average.  The more actively traded March contract climbed 2.07 cents
to $2.8618 a gallon.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions plans to shut the Girard
Point section of the largest plant near New York Harbor, the
delivery point for gasoline futures, this month, and a fluid
catalytic cracker at Delta Airlines Inc.’s Trainer,
Pennsylvania,  refinery  has been shut for repairs since December.  The EIA is scheduled to report last week’s inventories at
11 a.m. tomorrow. The report will probably show that gasoline
supplies rose 1 million barrels and distillate stockpiles
increased 500,000 barrels, according to the median estimate of
nine analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  Heating oil for February delivery gained 0.35 cent to
$3.0717 a gallon on the exchange. The March contract increased
0.44 cent to $3.0601. Volume was 18 percent below average.  The  retail price  for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 0.6 cent to $3.316 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.
That’s the sixth consecutive increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
