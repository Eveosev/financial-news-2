South Korea’s won,  Asia ’s best-
performing currency of 2012, fell toward this month’s low after
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan vowed to curb volatility, saying
recent gains were too steep. Sovereign bonds declined.  The government is “all ready” for new measures, Bahk told
reporters in Seoul today, declining to comment on when they will
be announced. The currency touched 1,054.49 on Jan. 15, a level
not seen since August 2011, after rallying 8.3 percent last
year. Overseas funds sold more South Korean shares than they
bought on all but one of the last eight days, cutting their
holdings by $844 million in that time, exchange data show. They
were net sellers again today.  “Rising speculation that  South Korea  may take steps on the
won’s gain, and the recent net sales in equities by foreigners
are weakening the currency,” said Hong Seok Chan, analyst at
Daishin Economic Research Institute in Seoul. “Some exporters
may want to take profit to convert their proceeds, which may
limit further declines in the won.”  The won fell 0.4 percent to close at 1,066.18 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched this
month’s low of 1,067.77 yesterday. One-month implied volatility
in the won, a gauge of expected moves in exchange rates used to
price options, dropped 23 basis points, or 0.23 percentage
point, to 5.80 percent, the data show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut South Korea’s economic growth
forecast for this year to 3.1 percent from 3.4 percent today. A
government report showed sales at major South Korean department
stores declined in December on weak demand.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 fell one basis point to 2.83 percent, Korea Exchange prices
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
