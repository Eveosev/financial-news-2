Wheat futures rose for the second
time in three sessions on renewed concern that the worst U.S.
drought since the 1930s is eroding prospects for crops in the
southern Great Plains.  Little or no rain has fallen in parts of south-central
 Kansas  and north-central  Oklahoma  in the past three months,
according to the  National Weather Service . As much as 25 percent
of the wheat crop may go unharvested this year, when farmers
begin collecting grain in June, analysts have said.  “It’s still dry out here, and there’s no moisture in the
forecast,” Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch manager at Paragon
Investments in  Silver Lake , Kansas, said in a telephone
interview. “The market should move higher from here.”  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to
$7.825 a bushel at 10:26 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price gained 19 percent last year, the most among 24 commodities
tracked by Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest wheat exporter. The crop is
the country’s fourth-largest, valued at $14.4 billion in 2011,
behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
