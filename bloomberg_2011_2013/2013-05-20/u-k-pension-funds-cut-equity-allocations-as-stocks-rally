Pension funds in the U.K. cut their
allocations to stocks even as the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) 
rallied to the highest level in more than five years, according
to data compiled by Mercer.  Managers of retirement assets reduced the amount they hold
in equities to 39 percent from 43 percent over the past 12
months, according to a  report  today from the pension-consultant
firm. Allocations were as high as 68 percent in 2003. U.K. funds
now have smaller proportion of investments in shares than
Ireland,  Belgium  and  Sweden .  Pension funds are cutting equity holdings in favor of bonds
even as central-bank stimulus helps push the FTSE 100 to the
highest level since October 2007. Some 30 percent of respondents
to the Mercer survey said they plan to reduce their allocations
to domestic stocks further, with 24 percent intending to cut
investments in overseas shares.  “Pension schemes across  Europe , but particularly in the
U.K., remain on a path towards a lower-risk investment
strategy,” Nick Sykes, European director of consulting in
Mercer’s Investments business, said in a statement today.  The survey covered more than 1,200 pension plans from 13
countries, with combined assets of more than 750 billion euros
($965 billion), according to Mercer, a unit of New York-based
Marsh & McLennan Cos.  While pension funds are trimming equity investments,
central banks are buying stocks in record amounts amid falling
bond yields. In a survey of 60 central bankers last month by
Central Banking Publications and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, 23 percent said they own shares or plan to buy them.  The  Bank of Japan , holder of the second-biggest reserves,
said April 4 it will increase investments in equity exchange-traded funds more than twofold to 3.5 trillion yen ($34.1
billion) by 2014. The  Bank of Israel  plans to almost double
stock holdings to as much as 6 percent of foreign-exchange
reserves, or about $4.5 billion, by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
