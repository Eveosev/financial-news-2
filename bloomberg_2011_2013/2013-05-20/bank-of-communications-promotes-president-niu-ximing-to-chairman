Bank of Communications Co. ,  China ’s
fifth-largest lender, promoted Niu Ximing to chairman in the
latest executive change at the nation’s state-controlled banks.  President Niu will replace Hu Huaibang, who was named party
secretary of China Development Bank Corp. last month, Shanghai-based Bank of Communications said in a statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange today. The appointment is subject to China
Banking Regulatory Commission approval.  The changes are part of a once-a-decade leadership
transition that culminated with Xi Jinping becoming president
and  Li Keqiang  named premier. The shift also saw the nomination
of a new finance minister,  Zhou Xiaochuan ’s reappointment as
central bank governor and new leadership at  Bank of China Ltd.   Niu joined Bank of Communications, also known as BoCom, in
December 2009 after serving in various positions at  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s largest bank by
market value, since 1986. Earlier he worked at the central bank,
according a  biography  posted on BoCom’s website.  Peng Chun, general manager of  Central Huijin Investment Co. 
and a former BoCom vice president, may become president, a
person familiar with the matter said on May 10.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
