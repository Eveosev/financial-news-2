Shipments of paper products increased
in  Japan  for the first time in eleven months last month as the
weaker yen made imported products more expensive, enabling
domestic paper producers to regain sales. 　  Domestic shipments of paper and paperboard, which includes
everything from newsprint and packaging to cardboard, increased
3.3 percent in April to 2.18 million metric tons, the Japan
Paper Association said today in a  statement . Japanese exports
surged 43 percent to 83,000 tons last month, whereas imports
dropped 33 percent to 141,000 tons in March from a year earlier.  Japan’s currency has fallen 19 percent since Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s election victory on Dec. 16, making domestic-made
goods including paper, vehicles and steel, more competitive than
those from abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
