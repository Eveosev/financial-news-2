PennyMac Financial Services Inc. (PFSI) , the
mortgage company founded by former Countrywide Financial Corp.
executives, rose 9 percent after Omega Advisors Inc.’s  Leon Cooperman  disclosed his hedge funds control a 22 percent stake.  Cooperman’s entities bought 2.75 million Class A shares at
$18 each of Moorpark, California-based PennyMac in the firm’s
initial public offering this month, according to a regulatory
filing today. Another 9,600 shares were purchased May 14 for
$19.71.  PennyMac rose  $1.88 to $21.88, the biggest gain since
its IPO, at 1:30 p.m. and traded for as much as $22.10.  PennyMac, founded in 2008 by former Countrywide Financial
President Stanford L. Kurland, makes and services U.S.
residential loans. Kurland left Countrywide in 2006,and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  bought the company in 2008 as losses from faulty
mortgages drove it to the brink of failure.  Countrywide’s loans have been blamed for helping to cause
the housing market bubble and costing  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America more than $40 billion in refunds, legal
costs and regulatory settlements.  Cooperman declined to comment on  his purchases . Omega,
founded in 1991 by Cooperman, had about $8.1 billion under
management as of April 30. Before starting Omega, he spent 25
years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and was a general partner and
chief executive officer of the asset-management division when he
left the New York-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
