ING U.S. Inc. (VOYA) , the insurer that had
an initial public offering this month, rose 5.4 percent in New
York trading after BTIG LLC recommended investors buy the shares
and said the company could be taken over.  The insurer, which will be renamed Voya Financial, advanced
to $26.26 at 4:15 p.m.. BTIG analyst  Mark Palmer  set his price
target at $31 for the New York-based company. The IPO price was
$19.50 a share.  ING Groep sold 25 percent of its U.S. unit this month in an
offering that raised about $1.27 billion as the Amsterdam-based
parent divests assets as part of the conditions of its 2008
bailout from the Netherlands. The U.S. business, which is also
an asset manager, still trades for less than half of book value,
a measure of assets minus liabilities. That compares with more
than 75 percent of book value at  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  Prudential
Financial Inc. (PRU) , the biggest U.S. life insurers.  “We believe Voya is significantly undervalued, and that
shares’ steep discount to book value is due in large part to
erroneous perceptions of the business attributable to its  hybrid
nature ,” Palmer wrote. “Voya is a legitimate takeover target
insofar as its $6.5 billion market capitalization wouldn’t be
particularly imposing for most of the firms that would
potentially be interested in acquiring it.”  Life insurers may pursue more acquisitions worldwide to add
business as capital builds while low bond yields and sluggish
economic growth weigh on results, Deloitte Services LP said in
January. Dana Ripley, a spokesman for ING U.S., declined to
comment on the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
