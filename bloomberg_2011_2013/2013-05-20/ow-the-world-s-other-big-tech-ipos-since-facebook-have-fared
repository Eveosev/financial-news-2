Given Facebook's one-year anniversary as a public company last week, the Global Tech team sought to answer: Did the other tech IPOs from around the world during that time span perform as poorly? Despite raising a whopping $16 billion, Facebook hasn't fared well since its market debut. The social networking company was  one of the worst performers  of the 124 stocks that went public during the same period, my colleague Brian Womack reported. As of Friday, Facebook shares were down 31 percent from the offering price. Here's a look at the performance of some of the biggest initial public offerings by technology and communications companies based outside the U.S. For most of them, what they lack in Facebook's size, they more than make up for in stock-market performance. Brazil Linx is a provider of cloud and retail software in Brazil. It raised $254 million in its IPO in February. Shares are up 37 percent from the offering price. China HC SemiTek, which went public in June of last year, makes electrical components, including light-emitting-diode chips. It raised $158 million in its IPO. Shares are down 26 percent from the offering price, which is not great but still not as bad as Facebook. Germany Telefonica Deutschland, which went public in October of last year, provides landline, mobile and Internet services throughout Europe and Latin America. It raised $1.87 billion in its IPO. Shares are up 1 percent from the offering price. India Bharti Infratel, which went public in December of last year, is a unit of India's largest wireless operator Bharti Airtel. It raised $758 million, India's biggest IPO in two years. Shares are down 17 percent from the offering price. Japan Broadleaf, which went public in March, provides software for the automotive industry. It raised $249 million in its IPO. Shares are up 97 percent from the offering price. Kazakhstan Kcell, a unit of Sweden's TeliaSonera, sells cellular and Internet services in Kazakhstan. It raised $578 million in its December IPO. Shares are up 49 percent from the offering price. Luxembourg Intelsat is a satellite services company that went public last month. It raised $400 million in its IPO. Shares are up 28 percent from the offering price. Russia MegaFon, which went public in November of last year, is Russia's second-largest mobile provider. It raised $1.83 billion in its IPO. Shares are up 55 percent from the offering price. South Korea CJ Hellovision, which went public in November of last year, sells cable TV services. The company raised $266 million in its IPO. Shares are up 12 percent from the offering price.
