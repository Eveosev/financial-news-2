Abu Qatada , the Islamic cleric the
U.K. is trying to deport to  Jordan  on terror charges, was denied
bail by a London judge who called him a threat to national
security.  Judge Stephen Irwin refused a request by Qatada’s lawyers
today to let him leave prison while the U.K. government tries to
reach a deal with Jordan that would allow him to be extradited.
Qatada said earlier this month that he would return voluntarily
if Jordan ratifies a treaty promising him a fair trial.  “His risk to national security is undiminished,” Irwin
said at a court hearing today. “Significant Jihadist material”
was found on a computer memory stick at Qatada’s home, he added.  The British government has failed in repeated attempts to
deport Qatada because of court decisions that evidence linked to
torture could be used against him in Jordan. Qatada, whose real
name is Mohammed Othman and who was 52 when he was re-arrested
in March, has been in and out of U.K. jails for more than a
decade.  Jordan may ratify the treaty within weeks, meaning Qatada
would be deported in the “near future,” Irwin said. A
spokesman for the U.K. Home Office declined to comment
immediately after the ruling.  Qatada’s lawyer,  Danny Friedman , told the court his client
had no intention of fleeing and just wanted to spend time with
his family. He said Qatada had no knowledge of any of the
material found at his house, and didn’t know what a memory stick
was.  To contact the reporter on this story:
