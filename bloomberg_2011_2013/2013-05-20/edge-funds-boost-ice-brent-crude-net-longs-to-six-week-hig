Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on Brent crude to their highest level in six
weeks, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 130,219 lots in
the week ended May 14, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report. The gain of 6,184
contracts, or 5 percent, is a third straight weekly increase and
brings net-long positions to the highest since April 2.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 348,081, down by
3,083, or 0.9 percent, from their highest since January 2011,
the starting point for the data.  Brent crude  dropped 1.7 percent to $102.60 a barrel in the
week to May 14 on the ICE exchange, and traded for $104.21 a
barrel as of 12:20 p.m. London time.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 260,686 lots, down 4,565, or
1.7 percent from a week earlier, the first decrease in 13 weeks.  Money managers’ net-short bets on European  gasoil  increased
by 5,041 contracts, or 51 percent, to 14,974. This was the third
week in which there were more shorts than longs since the data
was first published in January 2011.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
