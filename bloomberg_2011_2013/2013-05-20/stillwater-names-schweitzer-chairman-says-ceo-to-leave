Stillwater Mining Co. (SWC)  said former
 Montana  Governor Brian Schweitzer will become chairman of the
largest public company in his home state, taking over the role
from Chief Executive Officer Frank McAllister.  McAllister, 70, will continue as CEO until the board finds
a suitable candidate to replace him, the Billings, Montana-based
palladium miner said in a statement today. McAllister has been
chairman and CEO since 2001.  Schweitzer is one of four Clinton Group Inc. nominees voted
onto the board of Stillwater on May 2. The activist investor has
cited a declining stock price in calling for McAllisterâ€™s
retirement, cost-cutting and the sale of a mining project in
Argentina.  Schweitzer, who stepped down as governor in January after
serving the maximum two terms, has said he became skeptical of
Stillwater management after it bought Vancouver-based Peregrine
Metals Ltd. in 2011 for $262.9 million. The purchase gave
Stillwater a copper and gold project in Argentina that might
take as much as $2.5 billion to develop. The stock fell 22
percent on the day the deal was announced.  Clinton and Schweitzer want Stillwater to focus on its
palladium mining in Montana and reconsider a diversification
strategy that has also included buying Marathon PGM Corp. for
C$134.7 million ($131 million) in 2010 to gain a project in
Ontario.  To contact the reporter on this story:
