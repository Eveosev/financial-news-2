The  New York  Mets signed relief
pitcher David Aardsma, who posted two 30-plus save seasons with
the Seattle Mariners before injuring his elbow, to a minor-league contract, the team said in a statement.  Aardsma, 31, went to spring training with the Yankees and
was designated for assignment on March 29. He last appeared in
the major leagues in 2012 for them, pitching one inning and
allowing one run.  The former first-round pick of the  San Francisco Giants 
saved a combined 69 games for Seattle in 2009 and 2010. He had
elbow ligament-replacement surgery in 2011.  Aardsma will report to the Metsâ€™ Triple-A affiliate in Las
Vegas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
