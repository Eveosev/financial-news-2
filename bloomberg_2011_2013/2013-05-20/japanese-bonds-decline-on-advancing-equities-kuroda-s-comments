Japanese 10-year bonds declined by
the most in almost a week after the Topix Index of stocks
extended a 4 1/2-year high, curbing demand for the relative
safety of government debt.  Thirty-year rates climbed to the most in 11 weeks after a
Cabinet Office official told reporters that Bank of  Japan 
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it’s natural for yields to
increase gradually as the economic outlook improves. Kuroda also
said BOJ bond purchases make it hard to imagine that long-term
yields will surge, according to the official, who said the BOJ
governor made the comments at a meeting.  “Bonds are being sold on stock gains,” said Daisuke Uno,
the Tokyo-based chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp., a unit of Japan’s second-largest bank by market value.
“Yields are also rising in response to Kuroda’s comment.”  The rate on the benchmark 10-year bond increased 4 1/2
basis points to 0.84 percent as of 3:33 p.m. in  Tokyo , according
to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The last time it rose so much was May 14, when it
increased 5 1/2 basis points. The rate climbed as far as 0.92
percent last week, the most since April 2012. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Thirty-year yields rose as high as 1.82 percent today, a
level not seen since February.  The Bank of Japan increased its bond purchases in April to
more than 7 trillion ($68.2 billion) a month to spur economic
growth and combat deflation.  The Topix advanced 1.3 percent to close at the highest
level since August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
