PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TLKM) , the
nation’s biggest phone operator, rose to a five-year high in
Jakarta stock trading as Credit Suisse Group AG said it expects
the company to post “double-digit” profit growth in 2013.  Telkom  Indonesia , as the company is known, gained 5.4
percent at 2:34 p.m. local time, poised to close at the highest
level since October 2007. The stock provided the biggest boost
to the benchmark  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) , which surged 1.7
percent to a record, based on data compiled by Bloomberg dating
back to April 1983.  Telkom “looks set to deliver double-digit revenue growth”
in the 2013 financial year, Colin McCallum, analyst at Credit
Suisse, said in a report today. The “growth trajectory of the
fixed-line division is also finally improving,” he wrote.
McCallum kept his price target for the stock at 13,000 rupiah
and maintained his outperform rating.  Telkom’s rally pushed the stock’s 14-day  relative strength
index  to 70. A reading beyond 70 suggests to some investors that
shares are poised to fall. The RSI for the Jakarta Composite
climbed to 71.  The Jakarta Composite has rallied 21 percent this year,
compared with a 0.4 percent decline in the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index. The Jakarta gauge trades at 15.9 times 12-month projected
earnings, the highest level since January 2008, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
