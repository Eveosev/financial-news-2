OAO Rostelecom,  Russia ’s state-run
phone company, may sell about $490 million worth of treasury
stock to investors help cut debt which surged under previous
management, Chief Executive Officer Sergey Kalugin said.  Kalugin, speaking to reporters today in Moscow, said he is
“concerned” with the company’s high debt level of about $6.9
billion and that selling treasury shares is one option to reduce
it. The sale may happen this year and Rostelecom is in talks
with investment funds about a private placement, he said.  The phone carrier, based in Moscow, is trying to cut costs
and boost efficiency after Kalugin in March replaced Alexander
Provotorov whose spending had been criticized by the government.
Net debt rose 70 percent in the two years through 2012.  The stock Rostelecom may sell, a stake of about 4.6
percent, is currently held by the company’s Mobitel unit. The
stake is worth about $490 million based on today’s  trading .  Rostelecom had borrowed money to buy the shares from
billionaire Suleiman Kerimov and minority shareholders earlier,
Kalugin said.  Shares of Rostelecom fell 0.8 percent to 112.88 rubles at
4:13 p.m. in Moscow.  Kalugin said he is seeking to reduce the cost of purchases
and administrative personnel. Rostelecom hasn’t held talks about
buying mobile carrier Tele2 Russia from state-run lender VTB,
Kalugin said. VTB may sell the asset to Rostelecom to create a
larger phone carrier,  Renaissance Capital  has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
