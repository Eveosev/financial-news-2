Corn production in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower, may reach a record this year on yield
gains even after wet weather curbed planting to the slowest pace
in three decades, the U.S. Grains Council said.  With normal rainfall, the trendline  yield  may reach 163
bushels an acre, pushing the harvest to the highest ever, Kevin
Roepke, manager for global trade, said in an interview today.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates  output  will rise to
an all-time high of 359.2 metric million tons, assuming average
yield rebounds to 158 bushels from 123.4 bushels last year, when
the crop suffered from the worst drought since the 1930s.  Corn futures are headed for the first monthly gain in four
after the USDA said that about 28 percent of the crop was
 planted  as of May 12. That’s the slowest pace for the 19th week
of the year since at least 1980, USDA data show. The planting
progress raised concern that  acreage  may miss government
forecast of 97.28 million acres, the most since 1936.  “We have biotechnology, hybrids, and we have precision
agriculture dialed in so well that we now can produce huge crops
very efficiently, very sustainably on less acres,” said Roepke
in Bali,  Indonesia  where he addressed a grain transport
conference. “It matters what the yield is, not the acres.”  Corn for July delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.5675 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade by 4:42 p.m. Singapore time.
Futures are poised for a 1 percent gain in May after losing 12
percent in the three months through April.  U.S. farmers may plant 96.827 million acres, less than the
97.753 million estimated on March 22, Informa Economics Inc.
said in a May 17 report, after surveying producers and industry
representatives this month.  “If weather conditions remain favorable, we can still have
a record crop regardless of our slow planting pace,” said
Roepke, who was a trader at  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  before
joining the Washington-based grains council. “It’s not too late.
The biggest variable is the yield.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
