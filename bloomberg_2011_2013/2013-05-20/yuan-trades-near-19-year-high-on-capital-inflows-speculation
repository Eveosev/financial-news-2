China’s  yuan  rose to within 0.2
percent of a 19-year high on speculation capital inflows will
spur appreciation.  China may face “large scale” inflows of speculative funds
in the next few years, which will drive asset prices higher and
push up consumer prices, Su Ming, deputy head of the Ministry of
Finance’s research institute for fiscal science, said in an
article published in today’s People’s Daily newspaper. New-home
prices rose last month in 68 of 70 cities tracked by the
government, data showed May 18.  “When the property outlook is improving, more people tend
to bring capital into China,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Singapore. “Authorities
see that as a risk, creating a stronger  exchange-rate 
environment than what they are happy with.”  The yuan rose 0.05 percent to 6.1389 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System
prices. It touched 6.1307 on May 9, the strongest level since
the government unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993. The currency was 0.99 percent stronger than the
central bank’s  reference rate , which was little changed today at
6.1998.  The spot rate is allowed to diverge from the fixing by a
maximum 1 percent and China intervenes in the  currency market  to
prevent a breach of the trading band. The nation’s foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s largest, climbed $131 billion in
the first quarter to a record $3.44 trillion.  ‘Large Pressures’  The jump in the reserves is large enough for China to be
judged a currency manipulator by the U.S. Treasury,  Tim Condon ,
Singapore-based head of Asia research at ING Groep NV, wrote in
a note today. The nation faces “relatively large pressures”
from capital inflows and yuan appreciation, Ji Zhihong, an
official at the research bureau of the People’s Bank of China,
was quoted as saying in the People’s Daily.  In  Hong Kong , the yuan rose 0.15 percent to 6.1352 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards gained 0.2 percent to 6.2295, a 1.5
percent discount to the onshore exchange rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, held
at 1.805 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
