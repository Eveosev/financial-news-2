UBS AG (UBSN) , the biggest Swiss bank, hired
Sylvia Coutinho from  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , to be chief executive
officer of its Brazilian unit.  Coutinho, who was head of retail banking and wealth
management for Latin America at HSBC, will replace Lywal Salles,
according to a UBS’s statement distributed by Business Wire.
Salles, who was hired in October 2010, will retire, the Zurich-based bank said.  Coutinho, who takes over on June 24, will help the bank to
reach its “full potential in the country,” Robert J. McCann,
CEO of UBS Group Americas, said in the statement. “We are
confident she is the leader to help us in the next stage of
building a strong Brazil franchise.”  UBS bought broker Link Investimentos in February, four
years after it sold its Banco Pactual SA unit for $2.5 billion
to billionaire  Andre Esteves  and his partners, who created Grupo
BTG Pactual.  To contact the reporter on this story:
