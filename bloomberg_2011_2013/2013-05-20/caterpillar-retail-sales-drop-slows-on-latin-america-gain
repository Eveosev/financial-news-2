Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest
maker of construction and mining equipment, said global retail
sales declined at a slower pace as Latin America improved.  Total machine retail sales fell 9 percent in the three
months through April from a year ago, smaller than the 11
percent drop in the quarter through March, the Peoria, Illinois-based company said today in a filing.  Retail machine sales fell in every region except Latin
America, where they increased 28 percent, more than double the
gain for the period through March, according to the filing.  Construction and infrastructure projects in Brazil, which
will host the 2014  World Cup  and 2016 Olympic Games, drove the
gains in Latin America, said Larry  De Maria , a New York-based
analyst for William Blair & Co. De Maria, who has a buy rating
on the shares, commented in an e-mail today.  North American machine retail sales dropped 18 percent from
a year ago in the rolling three-month period, Caterpillar said.
The region likely “underperformed” because of wet, cold
weather, De Maria said.  The weather in North America has delayed crop planting and
slowed construction, Moline, Illinois-based  Deere & Co. (DE)  said May
15. Deere competes with Caterpillar in the manufacturing and
sale of construction machinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
