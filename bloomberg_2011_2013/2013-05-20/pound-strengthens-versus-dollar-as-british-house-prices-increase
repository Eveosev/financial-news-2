The pound strengthened from a six-week low against the dollar after an industry report showed U.K.
home sellers raised asking prices to a record, adding to
optimism Britain’s economy is improving.  Sterling advanced for the third time in four days versus
the greenback after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said in
an interview broadcast yesterday that a “modest recovery” is
underway, though “more needs to be done” to encourage growth.
The dollar weakened against most of its 16 major peers before
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke testifies to Congress
on Wednesday. U.K. government bonds declined for a second day.  “There’s a little bit of softness in the dollar versus the
pound today,” said  Daragh Maher , a London-based currency
strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc. “There’s a bit of position
squaring after the run we have seen and ahead of Bernanke this
week, but the dollar remains a buy on dips. The Bank of England
revised their growth outlook last week but it’s hardly the stuff
of legends.”  The pound strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.5226 at 4:41 p.m.
London time after declining to $1.5158 on May 17, the lowest
level since April 4. The U.K. currency gained 0.1 percent to
84.51 pence per euro after depreciating to 85.17 pence on May
14, the weakest since April 25.  Prices sought  by U.K. home sellers rose 2.1 percent in May
to an average 249,841 pounds, taking the increase in the first
five months of the year to 9.1 percent, property-website
operator Rightmove Plc said in a report.  London  asking prices
increased 3.3 percent to 509,870 pounds, also a record.  Boosting Exports  Britain has avoided some of the turmoil in Europe because
the drop in the pound is stimulating exports, King said in the
interview with Sky News television.  Asked whether the government’s plan to aid home buyers
would fuel a bubble in house prices, he said values were 14
percent below their peak.  “Interest rates are low right across the world and that
inevitably pushes up asset prices,” the BOE Governor said. U.K.
house prices have been “remarkably stable for the last few
years. That’s not a bad position to be in,” he said.  Sterling has weakened 2.4 percent this year, the second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 5 percent and the euro rose 2.1 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.91 percent after increasing to 1.95
percent on May 15, the highest since April 15. The 1.75 percent
bond maturing in September 2022 fell 0.25, or 2.50 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 98.61.  The annual rate of  consumer-price inflation  fell to 2.6
percent last month from 2.8 percent in March, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the Office for National Statistics
report tomorrow. The Bank of England is seeking to keep
inflation below 2 percent.  U.K. gilts handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this
month through May 17, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bunds fell 0.6 percent and Treasuries slid 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
