Boston  Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s first public court hearing was delayed to July 2 after defense lawyers and federal prosecutors filed a joint request for more time to prepare.  U.S. Magistrate Marianne Bowler in Boston approved the request for the delay in an order posted today on the case’s online docket. The hearing, on whether there is probable cause for the case to go to trial, had been set for May 30.  “In view of the complex factual and legal issues presented in this case and the need for adequate time to obtain and review evidence, the parties jointly move to continue the probable cause hearing,” lawyers for both sides said in a filing late yesterday.  Tsarnaev, 19, is accused of carrying out the April 15 attack that killed three and injured 260 with his brother Tamerlan, 26, who died after a shootout with police. Tsarnaev is being held at the Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayer,  Massachusetts , where he is recovering from wounds suffered while he attempted to elude capture.  Separately, Tsarnaev’s lawyer, Federal Public Defender Miriam Conrad, won a court ruling yesterday giving her team access to the suspect’s suicide watch logs in prison and other data kept to track his behavior behind bars.  The prison must also give Tsarnaev’s lawyers the suspect’s daily activity logs, psychology files, photographs and his “central file” in the prison, Bowler ruled.  Objection Possible  Conrad will have a chance to object to the government’s access, Bowler said. Conrad didn’t return a call for comment on the ruling.  Bowler issued the earlier decision in response to a sealed request from Tsarnaev’s lawyers. The judge denied a defense bid to keep the logs from prosecutors and gave the government the same access.  Tsarnaev made his initial court appearance in April in his hospital room at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was taken after his capture. He was wounded in the head, neck, legs and hand in two gunfights with police.  He is charged with two crimes involving the use of weapons of mass destruction. If convicted, he faces the death penalty if the U.S. decides to seek it.  Bowler on May 17 denied a request by Tsarnaev’s legal team to take periodic photographs of their client in prison to use as evidence of “his evolving mental and physical state.” The judge instead ruled prison staff could take the pictures and share the images with the defense lawyers and prosecutors.  Effective Counsel  In a sealed request filed May 7, Tsarnaev’s lawyers argued that his constitutional right to effective legal counsel, including the ability to carry out an “adequate investigation,” should trump the prison’s policy against cameras. Bowler disagreed.  Tsarnaev’s lawyers argued images of his “injuries over time” could in turn be used in arguments about the “voluntariness” of his earlier statements, according to last week’s ruling. Bowler didn’t specify which statements the legal team was referring to in their request.  After his arrest, Tsarnaev was questioned by federal agents in the hospital over a period of about three days before being apprised of his right to remain silent.  The case is U.S. v. Tsarnaev, 13-mj-02106, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story: Erik Larson in  New York  at  elarson4@bloomberg.net .
