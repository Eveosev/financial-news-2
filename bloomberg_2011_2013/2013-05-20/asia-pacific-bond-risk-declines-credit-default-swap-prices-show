The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 2 basis points to 101 basis
points as of 9:06 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The measure is on track for its biggest one-day
decline since May 6 and its lowest close since May 10, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1 basis point to
101 as of 10:18 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. prices. The index, which has ranged from 96.1 basis
points to 127.5 this year, is also poised for its lowest close
since May 10, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 2 basis points to
77 as of 9:13 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The benchmark is set for its first decline in a week and its
lowest close since May 13, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
