Corn in  South Africa , the continent’s
biggest producer of the grain, rose to the highest level in more
than two weeks after the rand declined against the dollar,
making imports more expensive.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
increased 0.4 percent to 2,187 rand ($231) a metric ton, the
highest since May 3, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in the same month
gained 0.8 percent to 2,177.80 rand a ton.  The rand fell 0.8 percent to 9.4702 per dollar, the weakest
level since April 2009, by the noon close of the grain-futures
market in Johannesburg after foreign investors sold South
African bank and retail stocks.  “We had a bit of rand weakening and that pushed prices
slightly higher,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Farmwise
Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.  White corn is used as a staple food in South Africa, while
the yellow variety is used for  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July rose 0.1 percent to 3,495 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
