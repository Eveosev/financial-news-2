Troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have retaken most of the strategic city of Al-Qusair in
Homs province in central  Syria , destroying tunnels used by
rebels and seizing large amounts of weapons, the state-run SANA
news agency said today.  The army is pursuing “armed terrorist groups” in some
areas in the city, the agency said.  The main opposition group, the National Syrian Coalition,
warned in a statement yesterday of a “civilian massacre” that
will soon take place in Al-Qusair. It said Assad’s troops have
leveled homes with artillery and rocket fire, while the air
force provided cover for the Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah
group fighting alongside the army.  “The Syrian Coalition warns about the outcome of these
distressing developments, which come as part of an organized and
predetermined military campaign,” said the statement, posted on
the group’s Facebook page.  Hadi al-Abdullah, an activist from Al-Qusair, told al-Arabiya television in an interview last night that 50 shells
were hitting the city every minute. He said 40,000 residents,
mostly women and children, had been unable to flee.  Al-Qusair is located near the highway linking Damascus to
the coast and has been a conduit for weapons coming from Lebanon
to the rebels. The government offensive began with attacks on
villages on the city’s outskirts last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
