Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , China’s largest search
engine, may seek an initial public offering of its iQiyi.com
video site as it taps into rising demand for online content.  “When the market is good, when the company is ready, we
will look for IPO opportunities,” Li Yipeng, vice president of
iQiyi, told the Chinict technology industry conference in
Beijing today. Baidu doesn’t currently have a timetable for a
share sale, he said.  Baidu Chief Executive Officer Robin Li is seeking a greater
share of advertising sales from online content. Revenue in China
from Internet videos is projected to rise to 16.2 billion  yuan 
($2.6 billion) in 2014 from 1.36 billion yuan in 2009, according
to iResearch, a Shanghai-based Internet consulting company.  Baidu bolstered the unit this month by agreeing to  buy  PPS
Net TV’s Internet video business for $370 million. That purchase
will make iQiyi the largest mobile platform for such content in
 China , Li Yipeng said today.  The iQiyi unit will do more in-house video production to
lower costs as it seeks to achieve profitability, Li Yipeng said.  “We don’t have very much bargaining power when we buy
content,” Li said. “Content is expensive in China. For us to
achieve profitability, we need to have different types of
content.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
