Gasoline declined on speculation that
higher prices at the pump will temper demand and supplies will
increase as refiners complete repairs.  Futures fell after the average pump price jumped 11.19
cents in the two weeks ended May 17, according to Lundberg
Survey Inc. Exxon Mobil Corp. is scheduled to end seasonal
repairs at the 238,000-barrel-a-day  Joliet refinery  in  Illinois .
Crack spreads widened.  “Everyone’s been talking about prices going higher the
past two weeks,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions LLC in Houston. “I do see more production coming. At
some point, we have to wonder how much we can charge for
gasoline if nobody is using it.”  Gasoline for June delivery fell 0.26 cent, or 0.1 percent,
to $2.9043 a gallon at 9:34 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, the first decline in five days. Trading volume was 39
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices
rose 1.6 percent last week.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 14 cents to
$26.21 a barrel. Gasoline’s  premium  over July Brent increased 27
cents to $17.07.  ULSD for June delivery rose 0.01 cent to $2.9371 a gallon
on trading volume that was 46 percent below the 100-day average.
Prices increased 1.1 percent last week.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
crude oil widened 15 cents to $27.49 a barrel. The  premium over
Brent  crude gained 25 cents to $18.64.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.4 cent to
$3.653 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
