Barloworld Ltd. (BAW) , a supplier of
construction equipment to  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  and  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  in
 South Africa , said the weak rand is positive for the company
because it has a number of dollar-based overseas contracts.  “If the rand stays at current levels, we will be happy
with that,” Barloworld Chief Executive Officer Clive Thomson
said in a phone interview from Johannesburg today. “It’s
unlikely that the rand will weaken at the same rate.”  The company earns dollars from contracts in Zambia,
Namibia, Mozambique and Russia, offsetting the impact of a
sliding rand in the domestic market. The overall impact is
“slightly positive,” according to Thomson.  The rand has declined 10 percent this year against the
dollar, the second-worst performer of 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. It weakened for an eighth day and was
trading down 0.7 percent at 9.4726 per dollar by 12:16 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
