Atlas Copco AB (ATCOA) , the world’s largest
maker of air compressors, rose to its highest price in three
weeks in Stockholm trading after  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  said aftermarket
sales will support margins and advised clients to buy the stock.  The company’s A shares rose as much as 1.4 percent to 180.6
kronor, the highest intraday level since April 29. Atlas Copco
traded 1.2 percent higher at 180.2 kronor at 10:31 a.m. local
time, making it the fourth-biggest gainer on the  OMX Stockholm
30 Index. (OMX)  The stock had dropped 4.4 percent in the three months
to May 17 and fell 5.4 percent in the week ending May 3 after
earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  The risks of weaker earnings from falling mining spending
are overestimated by the market, Anders Roslund, an analyst at
Swedbank in  Stockholm , wrote in a note to clients today.  “We see stable margins and the strong cash flow generation
from a growing aftermarket as the main valuation criteria.”
Roslund raised his rating on Atlas Copco to buy from neutral and
left his price estimate unchanged at 195 kronor.  First-quarter net income fell 12 percent to 2.99 billion
kronor ($447 million), Atlas Copco reported on Apr. 29. That
missed analysts’ estimates as customers reined in investment and
European markets slowed. Mining companies including BHP Billiton
Ltd., the world’s largest, are refraining from spending on new
equipment as demand and prices for metals decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
