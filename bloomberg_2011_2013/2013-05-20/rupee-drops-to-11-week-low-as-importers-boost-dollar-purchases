India ’s rupee fell to an 11-week low
on speculation importers stepped up dollar purchases to pay
month-end bills.  The currency extended this month’s loss to 2.4 percent as
some companies repaid or refinanced overseas loans raised around
the start of the last fiscal year, which began in April 2012,
according to Andhra Bank. The Dollar Index, which tracks the
greenback against six major counterparts, rose more than 1
percent in each of the last two weeks on bets the Federal
Reserve will slow asset  purchases , which have fueled fund flows
into  emerging markets , on signs the U.S. economy is improving.  The rupee declined 0.4 percent to 55.1150 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 55.1350 earlier, its weakest since March 4. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 8.48 percent.  “Both importers and exporters” were in the market today,
said Vikas Babu, a foreign-exchange trader in Mumbai at state-run  Andhra Bank. (ANDB)  “Investors will be awaiting Bernanke’s
testimony this week” for signals on the prospects of U.S.
stimulus policies, he said.  The Fed is buying $85 billion a month of Treasury and
mortgage bonds to push down borrowing costs and spur growth. Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke is scheduled to speak to the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress on May 22. Minutes of the Fed’s
last policy meeting will be released the same day.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.04 per
dollar, compared with 55.79 on May 17, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.88 versus 55.94. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
