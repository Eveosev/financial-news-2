 Michael Houlihan and Bonnie Harvey 
founded Barefoot Wine in their laundry room, made it a best 
seller, and successfully sold the brand in 2005. As they publish
their story, "The Barefoot Spirit", Houlehan and Harvey explain 
how teaching entrepreneurship is their new venture. They talk 
with Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn on Bloomberg
