AC Milan scored twice in the last six
minutes to win 2-1 at Siena and seal Italy’s final  Champions
League  soccer spot ahead of Fiorentina, which beat Pescara 5-1.  Milan had been facing a fourth-place finish in Serie A
yesterday after falling behind to Claudio Terzi’s 25th-minute
goal.  Mario Balotelli ’s 84th-minute penalty kick tied it before
Philippe Mexes won it from close range three minutes later.  Milan, a seven-time European Cup winner, will enter a
playoff for a place in the Champions League’s 32-team group
stage. German rivals Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund will
contest this season’s final May 25 at  London ’s Wembley Stadium.  Bundesliga champion Bayern two days ago fought back from
3-1 down to beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-3, while Dortmund
closed its league campaign with a 2-1 home loss to Hoffenheim.  Elsewhere, Porto wrapped up its 27th Portuguese league
title by finishing its season unbeaten with a 2-0 win at Pacos
de Ferreira. Porto finished one point ahead of Benfica, which
beat Moreirense 3-1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
