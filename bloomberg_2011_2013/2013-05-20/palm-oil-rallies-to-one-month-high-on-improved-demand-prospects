Palm oil  closed near a one-month high
on improved demand prospects ahead of Ramadan, with data from a
surveyor showing that shipments from Malaysia dropped at a
slower pace.  The contract for August delivery ended little changed at
2,335 ringgit ($775) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Futures closed at 2,336 ringgit on May 17, the
highest price at close since April 12.  Export demand from the Middle East and South Asia usually
climbs before the Muslim fasting month, when communal meals
boost total consumption. While shipments from the second-largest
producer fell 9.4 percent to 799,405 tons in first 20 days of
May from a month ago, according to Intertek, that’s less than
the 17 percent drop over 10 days. Exports fell 6.6 percent to
807,232 tons, Societe Generale de Surveillance said. Ramadan
starts in July.  “There is lot of expectation that demand may improve
because of Ramadan,” Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank
Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “The decline in exports
from Malaysia has narrowed from early part of the month, and
this is because of a pickup in demand.”  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell 0.5 percent to
end at 6,046  yuan  ($985) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while  soybean oil  closed little changed at 7,480 yuan. On the
Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery rose 0.3
percent to $14.525 a bushel and soybean oil for the same month
little changed at 49.51 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
