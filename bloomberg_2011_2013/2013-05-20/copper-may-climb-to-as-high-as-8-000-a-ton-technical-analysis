Copper may rise almost 10 percent to
as much as $8,000 a metric ton if it climbs above May’s high of
$7,480, according to  technical analysis  by Marex Spectron Group.  The attached chart shows that copper last week held above
the 50 percent retracement of a rally from about $6,762 a ton on
April 23 to $7,480 on May 8, signaling prices may rebound back
to this month’s peak, according to Justin Froome, a broker at
Marex Spectron in London.  “A confirmed move above $7,480 would increase the odds of
a move to $7,645 and possibly even $8,000,” Froome said by e-mail May 17. Purchases by commodity-trading advisers to close
out bets on declines may accelerate the move upward, he said.  Copper for delivery in three months traded at $7,290.75 a
ton by 6:56 a.m. on the  London  Metal Exchange. Prices climbed
3.3 percent this month amid so-called  short-covering  by traders
after the metal dropped to the lowest price since October 2011
last month.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
