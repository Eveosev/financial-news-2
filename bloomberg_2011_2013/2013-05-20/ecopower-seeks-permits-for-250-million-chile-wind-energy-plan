Ecopower SAC, a Chilean renewable-energy developer, filed for permits to develop a $250 million
wind farm in the countryâ€™s Los Lagos region.  Work on the 100.8-megawatt Chiloe project is expected to
start in January 2016, the Santiago-based company said today in
a filing with environmental licensing agency Servicio de
Evaluacion Ambiental.  The wind project will include 42 turbines, each with a
capacity of 2.4 megawatts, and a 28.1-kilometer (17.5-mile)
power line, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
