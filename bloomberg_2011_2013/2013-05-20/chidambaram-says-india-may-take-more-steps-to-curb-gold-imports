Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram comments on gold imports and India’s credit rating.
He spoke to reporters in New Delhi today.  “At our instance, the  Reserve Bank  of India has now
instructed banks they should not import gold or offer gold
except to jewelers for export. Some more steps, if necessary,
will have to be taken.”  On credit ratings:  “ Standard & Poor’s  discussed the matter with the Ministry
of Finance officials. They have not changed their position.
They’ve not made the rating any worse. They’ve not made the
outlook any worse. Our case is that we deserve an upgrade, both
on the outlook and the rating. Standard & Poor’s may not have
been convinced about that, but the fact is that they’ve simply
maintained their rating and their outlook. There’s nothing to
worry. Our macroeconomic position today is much better than what
it was in August 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
