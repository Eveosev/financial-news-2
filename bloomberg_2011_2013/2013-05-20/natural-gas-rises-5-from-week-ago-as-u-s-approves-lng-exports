Natural gas futures advanced to the
highest settlement price in almost three weeks on forecasts for
above-normal temperatures that would boost demand for the power-plant fuel to run air conditioners.  Gas gained 0.9 percent after Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland, predicted warmer-than-average weather in the
Northeast and Great Lakes region through May 24. The high in  New
York  on May 22 may be 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), 13
more than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  “The weather continues to confound the bears,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst for Price Futures Group in
 Chicago . “Temperatures have gone from colder than normal to
warmer than normal. There’s been an incredible amount of
volatility with the weather situation.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 3.5 cents $4.09 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement price since May 1. Trading
volume was 28 percent below the 100-day average at 2:42 p.m.
Prices have climbed 22 percent this year.  The discount of June to October futures, a measure of
supply expectations for the summer, widened 0.6 cent to 8.8
cents.  June $3.95 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading, falling 1.5 cents to 2.6 cents per million Btu on
volume of 641 at 3:06 p.m. Puts accounted for 56 percent of
trading volume.  Hedge Funds  Hedge funds  reduced bullish natural gas bets by the most in
three months last week. Money managers cut net-long positions,
or  wagers  on higher prices, by 3.7 percent in the seven days
ended May 14, the biggest drop since Feb. 12, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s May 17 Commitments of
Traders report.  The measure climbed last month to the highest level in
records dating back to January 2010.  The high in Cleveland on May 22 may be 80 degrees
Fahrenheit, 10 more than average, according to AccuWeather.
Power generation accounts for 33 percent of U.S. gas demand,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Futures jumped the most in three weeks on May 17 after the
U.S. conditionally approved the Freeport LNG liquefied natural
gas export project in  Texas .  The Freeport project was the second to receive approval
from the Energy Department to send gas to countries that don’t
have free-trade agreements with the U.S. The terminal would be
able to export 1.4 billion cubic feet a day. The Freeport
development, partly owned by  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) 
and  Osaka Gas Co. (9532) , must still win approval from the  Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission .  LNG Exports  In May 2011, the department conditionally approved Cheniere
Energy Inc.’s Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana for a rate
of as much as 2.2 billion cubic feet a day. The project won FERC
approval in April of 2012. The government has weighed 20
applications for export terminals in recent months, which could
ship the equivalent of 41 percent of U.S. total production this
year, Energy Department data show.  The U.S. may export 6.5 billion to 8.5 billion cubic feet a
day of gas by 2020, Adam Longson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley
in New York, said in an e-mailed report today.  The Energy Department “will only need to approve two more
projects by early- to mid-2016 in order for U.S. LNG exports to
reach the low end of our estimates,” Longson said.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $3.80 per million British thermal units this year,
higher than the previous estimate of $3.52, the EIA said May 7
in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. The average may slump
to $3.77 in the third quarter before climbing to $3.92 during
the final three months of the year.  Gas inventories totaled 1.964 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended May 10, 4.1 percent below the five-year average and
26 percent less than last year’s level, the EIA’s weekly storage
report showed on May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
