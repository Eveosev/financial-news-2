Thailand ’s onshore  interest-rate
swaps  fell to a one-week low after first-quarter economic growth
missed analysts’ estimates, fueling speculation the central bank
will cut borrowing costs next week.  Southeast  Asia ’s second-largest economy grew 5.3 percent,
official data showed today, compared with a revised 19.1 percent
gain in the previous three months and the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey for a 6 percent expansion. The National
Economic and Social Development Board scaled back its forecast
for 2013 growth to as much as 5.2 percent today, from an earlier
projection of 5.5 percent. The Bank of Thailand will review
policy on May 29.  The weaker data indicates the central bank is “probably
going to go ahead with the rate cut,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja ,
a Singapore-based economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.
“It’s now a matter of how much they are going to cut. We
believe a 50-basis-point rate cut is quite likely.”  The one-year onshore swap rate, the fixed cost needed to
receive a floating payment, declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.37 percent as of 10:33 a.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge touched 2.36
percent earlier, the lowest level since May 13.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due May
2015 decreased one basis point to a one-week low of 2.68
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong, who has led calls for
lower rates, said May 10 the monetary authority must reduce
borrowing costs by more than a quarter of a percentage point or
implement  capital controls  to slow inflows that drove the baht
to a 16-year high. The central bank lowered the benchmark rate
in October and has held it at 2.75 percent since.  The baht was unchanged at 29.86 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It has advanced 2.4 percent this
year, the best performance in Asia. The currency reached 28.56
on April 22 and April 19, the strongest level since July 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
