The following table shows the largest weekly
changes in the 90%-110% skew spread, a measure of how expensive puts, or
bearish bets, are relative to calls. The data was calculated using 30-day
implied volatility of S&P 500 companies. The stocks in the screen had
a daily average of more than 500 contracts trading in the past 20 days and
an open interest of more than 10,000 options, according to data as of May 17
compiled by Bloomberg. To see the skew data from the Bloomberg Function:

model. The implied volatility value is computed across expirations using the
Hermite spline interpolation method and across strikes using the quadratic
fitting interpolation technique.
