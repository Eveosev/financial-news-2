The yen may decline to its weakest
level against the dollar in more than four and a half years
after breaking a key level of support, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Japanese currency will face a test at 103.50 per dollar
after breaching the 103-to-103.10 area on May 17, according to
Niall O’Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan in New York. If
the yen declines past that support level, it may target 105.50,
the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the currency’s 2007
high, O’Connor said. That would be its weakest level since
October 2008.  “It could pause a little bit near-term, but the bottom
line is that the dollar-yen breakout is still holding,”
O’Connor said in a telephone interview. “The jury is still out
on the 103 level, but the overall upside bias is still intact.”  The yen increased 0.9 percent to 102.28 per dollar at 2:23
p.m. in New York after reaching 101.97. The currency gained 0.5
percent to 131.85 per euro.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
