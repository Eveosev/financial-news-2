The  National Football League  and its
players union are working toward an agreement that would move
the 2014 draft to a month later, according to the NFL’s  website .  The  NFL  will try the later date -- probably May 15 -- on a
one-year trial before deciding whether to make it permanent, the
website reported. The draft, in which teams select players who
have completed their college eligibility or renounced their
remaining eligibility, is a three-day, made-for-television event
that gets the NFL publicity during the offseason.  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  confirmed that the league may
move the draft to May, but said no decision has been made.  The league is also considering whether to move the NFL
Scouting Combine and the start of the league year. That hasn’t
been decided and would have to be approved by the union, the
website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
