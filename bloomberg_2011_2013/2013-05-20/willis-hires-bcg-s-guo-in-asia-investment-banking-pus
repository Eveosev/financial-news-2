Willis Group Holdings Plc (WSH) , the third-largest insurance broker, hired Michael Guo as head of  Asia  in
the capital-markets operation as the company seeks more
investment-banking business.  He will be based in  Hong Kong  and report to Tony Ursano,
chief executive officer of Willis Capital Markets & Advisory,
the London-based company said today in a statement. Guo joins
from Boston Consulting Group Inc. where he was a partner and
managing director of the financial-services practice, covering
insurance, banking, brokerage and fund management.  The hire “underscores our commitment to becoming a major
player in the insurance investment-banking arena in Asia,”
Ursano said in the statement. Guo’s experience will be
“invaluable as we continue to expand our strategic advisory and
capital markets offerings on a global basis.”  The capital-markets unit advises insurers and reinsurers on
mergers and acquisitions. It also underwrites insurance-linked
securities such as  catastrophe bonds , which pay higher-than-benchmark yields to investors who risk losing their principal in
the event of disasters that meet predefined conditions.  Willis slipped 0.8 percent to $41.36 at 11:02 a.m. in  New
York . The broker has climbed 23 percent this year, beating the
13 percent advance in the 78-company Bloomberg World Insurance
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
