The falling cost of financing U.K.
water assets may boost merger activity in the industry even amid
a regulatory price review, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “The M&A interest in the U.K. water sector reflects the
low cost of finance for regulated assets despite a regulatory
tariff reset next year” by Ofwat, Goldman Sachs analysts Andrew Mead and Fred Barasi wrote in a May 17 note to clients, citing
declines in yields of U.K. government bonds this year that are
index-linked.  Part of the attraction in U.K. utilities stems from a
decline in real  interest rates , with index-linked gilt yields
from the U.K. government bonds now in negative levels, Goldman
Sachs wrote, adding that real interest rates are expected to be
negative for 10 years.  The Goldman note came after  Severn Trent Plc (SVT) , the U.K.’s
second-largest publicly traded water utility, rejected a
possible takeover approach last week from Kuwait Investment
Office, Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc. and Britain’s
Universities Superannuation Scheme, saying it undervalued the
company.  Severn Trent shares have risen 12 percent in the past week
compared with 5.3 percent by the U.K.’s biggest publicly traded
water company,  United Utilities Group Plc (UU/) , and 7.5 percent by
 Pennon Group Plc (PNN) , the U.K.’s third-largest water utility.  The Severn approach occurred at a time when Ofwat is
consulting on prices that water and sewerage companies must
deliver for the years 2015 to 2020, with final prices to be
published next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
