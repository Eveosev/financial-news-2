Japanese stock futures fell,
indicating the Topix Index will retreat from the highest level
since August 2008, as the yen rose and investors weighed the
pace of Federal Reserve stimulus efforts.  American Depositary Receipts of Sony Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest
consumer electronics exporter, lost 0.9 percent. Those of Canon
Inc., which gets about 80 percent of sales abroad, slid 0.5
percent. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-largest oil producer, gained 0.3 percent after crude climbed to
a seven-week high.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring next
month traded at 15,320 in  Chicago  yesterday, down from 15,390 at
the close in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
15,320 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. The Nikkei closed
yesterday at the highest since Dec. 27, 2007.  “When markets are this elevated, investors generally look
for any excuse to exercise caution,” said Stan Shamu, a
Melbourne-based strategist at Markets Ltd., a provider of
trading services. “It just seems we are starting to see a bit
of consolidation ahead of the FOMC meeting minutes and Fed chief
Ben Bernanke’s testimony on Thursday.”  Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.1
percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.2 percent.  Contracts on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were little
changed and those on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong retreated 0.2
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 1.7 percent in New York
yesterday.  Japan Rally  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, surged 12 percent this year, led by Japanese
shares, yesterday closing at the highest level since June 2008.
Shares have risen as U.S. data signaled improvement in the
world’s No. 1 economy and the Bank of Japan took steps to
counter deflation.  That left the gauge trading at 14.6 times average estimated
earnings compared with 15.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 13.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPX)  were little changed today after the
gauge yesterday retreated 0.1 percent from a record high. U.S.
shares erased gains after Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said the economy has improved “quite a lot.” The question
now is whether “improvements that have been made will continue
and be sustained,” he said.  Some Fed officials in recent months have signaled they
favor scaling back the quantitative-easing program in the next
few months. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said he would continue
stimulus until the jobless rate falls to 6.5 percent or
inflation rises above 2.5 percent. The Fed publishes minutes of
its last policy meeting on May 22.Bernanke will testify that day
on the economic outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
