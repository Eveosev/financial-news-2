India ’s benchmark bonds declined on
speculation yields near the lowest level in three years will
deter buyers.  The 10-year yield dropped 30 basis points so far in May,
set for the biggest decline in 11 months, as the slowest
inflation since 2009 spurred speculation of further interest-rate cuts. The  Reserve Bank  of India, which has lowered the
 repurchase  rate by 75 basis points to 7.25 percent this year, is
scheduled to review policy next on June 17.  “Bonds have dropped slightly as there could be some profit
taking by investors after a big rally this month,” said  Paresh
Nayar , head of money-markets and currency at FirstRand Ltd. in
Mumbai. “The overall view for bonds remains bullish given the
lower inflation trajectory and increasing possibilities of rate
cuts.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.43 percent as of
9:58 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched 7.40 percent on May 16, the lowest
level for a benchmark 10-year bond since May 2010.  The wholesale-price  index  rose 4.89 percent from a year
earlier in April, the smallest increase in 41 months, and RBI
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said the data will be factored into
decisions at the next meeting.  “We certainly will take note of the softening of inflation
and the external payments situation in the next mid-quarter
policy,” Subbarao said in  Frankfurt  on May 14.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 7.12 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
