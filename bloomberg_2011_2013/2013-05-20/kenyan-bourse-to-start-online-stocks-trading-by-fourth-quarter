The Nairobi Securities Exchange, the
world’s third-best performing equities market this year, will
begin online trading in the fourth quarter as it tries to enable
more people to have access to the bourse.  “The design work for online trading is complete” Donald Ouma, head of market and product development, said today in
response to e-mailed questions. “Setup and testing is
ongoing.”  The value of trades on the Kenyan exchange jumped 77
percent in the year to May 14 from the same period in 2012,
figures from the bourse show. The benchmark NSE All Share index
rose  34 percent  this year and the market is valued at 1.7
trillion shillings ($20 billion), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Investors will be able to check their portfolios,
statements and contracts as well as send and cancel orders
online, Ouma said.  The NSE is also establishing a futures and options market
for equity and debt derivatives as long as the market undergoes
demutualization, according to the Capital Markets Authority,
which regulates Kenyan exchanges. Directors approved
demutualization in March 2010.  Draft rules for the derivatives exchange, as well as a
planned commodities market, are open for public input until the
end of this month, the CMA said on its website. It said it will
invite applications to set up the commodity-futures exchange in
the world’s biggest exporter of the black variety of tea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
