Taiwan ’s dollar rose for the first
time in four days as global funds added to their holdings of the
island’s equities amid a government review on capital gains
taxes. Bonds declined.  Overseas investors bought $118 million more Taiwanese
shares than they sold today after net purchases of $996 million
in the week ended May 17, stock exchange data show. The  tax rate 
on investors with NT$1billion ($33 million) trading volume or
more will be lowered to less than 0.1% from 2.25%, while
individuals will be exempted, Taipei-based Economic Daily News
reported May 15, without citing anyone. Deputy Finance Minister
Tseng Ming-chung said May 9 that the levy would be reviewed.  The local dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$30.03 versus
the greenback in Taipei, prices from Taipei Forex Inc. show. The
currency earlier touched NT$30.110, the weakest level since
August 2012.  “There’s more room for appreciation in the currency” due
to capital inflows into stocks, said Shawn Shih, an economist in
Taipei at Sinopac Financial Holdings Co. Still, “the central
bank is trying to make the  Taiwan dollar  weaker in line with the
yen’s slide to protect exporters,” he said.  Taiwan’s central bank has intensified intervention in the
foreign-exchange market to keep the island’s currency relatively
stable and prevent it from rising faster than regional peers,
after a surprise interest-rate cut by  South Korea  and the recent
drop in the yen, the Wall Street Journal reported today, without
citing anyone.  Forwards Gain  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 10 basis points to
4.99 percent. One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.5
percent to NT$29.930, ending a seven-day losing streak. The
island’s current-account surplus was $11.09 billion in the first
quarter, down from a record $15.93 billion in the previous three
months, according to data released today.  The yield on the 1.125 percent Taiwan government bonds due
March 2023 increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 1.294 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was at 0.386 percent,
the same as on May 17, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  A government report today showed export orders, indicative
of shipments in three months, contracted 1.1 percent in April
from a year earlier, compared with a 6.6 percent drop in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
