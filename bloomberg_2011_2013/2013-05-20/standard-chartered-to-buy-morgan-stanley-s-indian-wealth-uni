(Corrects to remove erroneous reference to  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ’s review of India operations in third paragraph.)  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  agreed to buy
Morgan Stanley’s Indian wealth management assets for an
unspecified price as it seeks to capture more private banking
business in the South Asian nation.  The sale is expected to be completed by the year’s end, New
York-based Morgan Stanley said in an e-mailed statement today,
without disclosing terms of the deal. The unit accounted for
less than 5 percent of its India revenue in 2012, it said.  The transaction will significantly increase  Standard
Chartered ’s private banking assets in the country, the U.K. bank
said in a separate e-mailed statement. Morgan Stanley said it
will focus on businesses including  investment banking , asset
management and institutional securities in India after the sale.  Standard Chartered, which earns most of its profit in Asia,
will initially pay $8 million for the unit, which has about $800
million of assets under management, a person familiar with the
matter said on May 9. It will follow up the payment with an
undisclosed sum later, the person said.  India is the British lender’s third-largest market, after
 Hong Kong  and Singapore, company figures show. The London-based
bank generated $676 million in profit before tax from the
country last year, according to its annual report. That’s almost
10 percent of its total worldwide.  To contact the reporters on this story:
