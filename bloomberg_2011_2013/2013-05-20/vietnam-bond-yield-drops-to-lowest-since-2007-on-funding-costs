Vietnam ’s five-year bond yield fell
to the lowest level since 2007 on speculation low funding costs
are spurring demand for government securities. The dong dropped.  The  overnight interbank deposit fixing  fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.99 percent, the lowest in
Bloomberg data going back to June 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. While deposits rose 5.2 percent in the
first four months of 2013, credit grew 2.1 percent, according to
a May 15 posting on the government website, citing the central
bank.  “Funding costs in the whole system are quite low,” said
Pham Tri Hieu, a fixed-income trader at Military Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi. “Surplus funds are putting pressure
on banks to make investments, which supports demand for bonds.”  The five-year yield declined five basis points to 8.45
percent, the lowest level since November 2007, according to a
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong slid 0.1 percent to 20,995 per dollar as of 4:35
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set its reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since
December 2011, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Diep Ngoc Pham
