Boeing Co. (BA) , the No. 1 planemaker,
said it’s close to sealing the first order for a 737-8 Max
airliner in a business jet layout, and that government buyers
are showing interest in the new 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 models.  The sale of the first Boeing Business Jet based on the
reengined 737-8 Max short-haul plane could come this week, BBJ
President  Steve Taylor  told reporters at the Ebace conference in
Geneva today. The aircraft would be delivered in 2018.  Boeing, based in  Chicago , has sold only three BBJs -- a
737, 787 and 777 -- in the past 12 months as sales of  business
jets  have been held back by political turmoil in the  Middle East 
and weak European economic output. Boeing’s BBJs are all derived
from its airliner offerings.  “It is a very tough market but we continue to find
opportunities,” Taylor said. “I see a very strong market for
the Max.”  Boeing is also marketing the larger 737-9 Max as a BBJ and
sees demand for both 737 models spurred by replacement of more
than 140 737s used as private jets today, Taylor said. The
company hasn’t decided whether the 737-7 Max, the smallest
version, for which Southwest Airlines recently became the first
customer, will be marketed as a BBJ, he said.  Airbus Sales  Airbus SAS still has to secure the first sale as a business
jet of an A320neo, its reengined short-range plane, even though
it’s due to enter service in 2015, ahead of the Max. The
Toulouse, France-based aircraft maker is focused on deals with
nearer-term deliveries, said David Velupillai, marketing
director for the Airbus Corporate Jet unit.  Sales efforts include continued marketing of the A318
airliner model in a business jet role even though there are no
more planes in Airbus’s backlog. Demand remains in markets such
as  China , the Middle East and  Southeast Asia , said Francois Chazelle, vice president for the Airbus unit.  At Boeing, sales of wide-body BBJs to private individuals
are being driven by demand from governments looking to replace
and augment their state fleets.  The first of 12 BBJ 787 Dreamliners is scheduled for
handover before the end of the year, Taylor said. Deliveries of
passenger models were delayed when the jet was grounded for more
than three months over an electrical fault. Taylor said the
company is in advanced talks for the sale of two more 787 BBJs
and there are additional prospects on the horizon.  Boeing Talks  Airbus has sold only one A350 in a VIP configuration.
Chazelle said the A330 will compete with the 787 for orders and
projected the Boeing jet would suffer additional cancellations.  Boeing is also in negotiations over the sale of two more
747-8s as private planes for heads of state, Taylor said,
without naming the possible buyers. He dismissed the Airbus A380
superjumbo, which has only one private sale, as “not a
player.”  Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal  Al Saud, only private buyer of an
A380 -- and the world’s 24th-richest person -- has sold the jet,
Velupillai confirmed, without identifying the new owner or when
the changeover will occur. Airbus signed the original deal
during the Dubai air show in 2007  To contact the reporter on this story:
