(Corrects  Oklahoma City  mayor’s name in third paragraph after Durant heading. For more storm coverage, see EXT6.)  Rescue operations are winding down a day after a killer tornado more than a mile wide flattened hundreds of homes and two schools in an  Oklahoma  City suburb, killing at least 24 and injuring another 237.  The powerful storm, topping the National Weather Service scale for tornadoes, cut a swath of devastation through  Moore (8776MF) , a town of 55,000, destroying the  Plaza Towers Elementary School  and a medical center. Winds in excess of 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) ripped off roofs and twisted sheet metal around splintered trees and utility poles. President  Barack Obama  called it “one of the most destructive tornadoes in history.”  Governor Mary Fallin, who surveyed the damage by air, said entire blocks were wiped out. The lack of street signs and debris made it difficult to find the way around, she said today at a news briefing. State lawmakers were at work on legislation to use $45 million of Oklahoma’s rainy-day fund to help pay for recovery, she said. The fund totals $660 million, according to the  Associated Press .  Officials at a news briefing said they planned to finish searching by nightfall. Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird said he’s “98 percent sure” there were no more survivors or bodies to recover under the rubble, according to the AP.  ‘Nothing Left’  “There ain’t nothing left, nothing,” said Patrick Duffy, 62, a computer programmer, as he and his wife, Kathern, sifted through a four-foot (1.2-meter) pile of soggy insulation, mud, leaves, a single shoe, a torn book and a broken table lamp --all that was left of their three-bedroom, ranch-style home. “This will all have to be scraped away.”  The tornado was an EF5, the most powerful tornado type on the Enhanced Fujita scale for measuring twisters, according the  National Weather Service  in Norman, Oklahoma. The storm cut a 17-mile-long path that was 1.3 miles across at its widest point.  The state medical examiner’s office has received 24 bodies, Amy Elliott, chief administrative officer, said. Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty said there may be more deaths. Earlier reports had pegged the toll as high as 91.  Joplin Anniversary  The twister hit two days before the second anniversary of the deadliest single U.S. tornado in almost 60 years, which slammed into Joplin,  Missouri , about 225 miles northeast of Moore. That storm killed 161 people and caused more than $2 billion in damage, according to the state insurance department.  In May 1999, 40 people died and 675 were injured in Oklahoma after dozens of tornadoes swept through the Great Plains in the largest such  outbreak  recorded in the state, according to the National Weather Service.  “Oklahoma needs to get everything it needs, right away,” Obama said today at a White House news briefing. “Americans from every corner of this country will be right there with them.”  The twister was one of 14 reported from  Colorado  to  Kansas  yesterday. The National Weather Service issued its first warning at 2:40 p.m. local time, 16 minutes before the tornado touched down about 10 miles west of the city. Moore residents had about 36 minutes to prepare for the tornado, 23 minutes longer than the average lead time, according to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  Christina Morris, 45, said she, her husband, her sister and 4-year-old niece crowded into a tiny bedroom closet as the tornado bore down on their one-story house, causing it to shake and sway. It sounded like 40 freight trains, she said.  “We’re not churchgoers, but we prayed,” she said in an interview today on her front porch. “We prayed to my mother to watch over us. She passed away a few years ago.”  ‘We’re Lucky’  The twister’s center passed just north of their house, blowing out their back windows and covering the kitchen wall with mud. A car bumper was deposited about 20 feet up in a front-yard tree. Two short blocks away, the medical center took a direct hit, its windows blown out and parts of the building facade toppled.  “We’re lucky,” Morris said. “A lot of other people around here weren’t.”  Mark Ellerd, 49, saw the tornado approaching the movie theater across from his home of 23 years and took shelter in his master bedroom closet. He emerged to find his roof and walls torn away. He pulled a tent and other camping gear from the wreckage of a shed and spent the night in his front yard. He said he’s seen four tornadoes in the vicinity, including the 1999 twister that passed within a few miles.  “I’m glad I was here, I experienced it,” he said. “I’m glad I lived.”  Durant Donation  Residents mourned those who didn’t, and communities began mobilizing to help one another. Donations began pouring in, including a $1 million gift to the American Red Cross from Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder of the  National Basketball Association . The team also donated the same amount to relief efforts. Churches opened their doors, and the University of Oklahoma said it would provide housing for displaced families.  The state set up a website to help those affected find services, said Fallin, a 58-year-old Republican. State employees who lost their homes would be given 15 days of leave, she said, adding that she wasn’t aware of any who lost their lives or loved ones.  “This was the storm of storms,” Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said at the news briefing.  Obama last night declared a major disaster in Oklahoma, making government funding available to people affected by the storm in five counties.  Craig Fugate , the head of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency , arrived today.  Twister Prone  Oklahoma City has been struck by tornadoes more times than any other place in the U.S., according to government data. Yesterday’s storm came the day after two people were killed and 39 injured in separate storms in the state. At least 30 tornadoes were reported on May 19 from  Illinois  to Oklahoma.  The twister was on the ground for 40 minutes, said Ryan Barnes, a weather service meteorologist in Norman, Oklahoma. A second school, Briarwood Elementary, a mile and a half from Plaza Towers, was also heavily damaged.  The damage may top $2 billion, Charles Watson, research and development director at Kinetic Analysis Corp., a hazard-research company in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland , told CNBC. The 1999 outbreak in the state caused an estimated $1.2 billion in damage, according to the National Weather Service.  Insurance Shares  Insurance company shares dropped on the news. Travelers Cos., the lone property insurer in the 30-company  Dow Jones Industrial Average  sank 2.2 percent to $83.63 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York .  Allstate Corp., (ALL)  the largest publicly traded U.S. auto and home insurer, fell 1.5 percent.  Moore was also hit hard by a tornado in 1999, with the highest winds ever recorded near the earth’s surface. The suburb is a middle-class community with an average household income of $64,297 in 2010, well above the national average of $50,221, according to city budget documents and U.S. Census data.  Susan Pierce, superintendent of the Moore Public School district, the third largest in the state, said the twister wouldn’t ruin graduations for the town’s three high schools. They’ll take place as planned in downtown Oklahoma City this weekend, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Michael B. Marois in Sacramento at  mmarois@bloomberg.net ; Esme E.
