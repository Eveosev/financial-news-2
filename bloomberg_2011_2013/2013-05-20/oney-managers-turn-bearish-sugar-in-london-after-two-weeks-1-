Money managers  turned bearish  white,
or refined, sugar traded in  London  in the seven-day period ended
May 14 after betting on higher prices for two consecutive weeks,
according to NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.  Net-short positions, or wagers on a lower market, totaled
4,073 futures and options in the period, the Commitments of
Traders report published on the exchange’s  website  today showed.
That compares with a net-long position, or a bet on higher
prices, of 1,351 contracts a week earlier. The sweetener slid
3.2 percent in the period.  In robusta coffee, money managers  boosted their net-long 
position by 87 percent, exchange data showed. Net-long positions
rose to 4,684 futures and options from 2,502 contracts a week
earlier. The beans used to make instant coffee and espresso
advanced 2 percent in the period.  Money managers’  net-long position  in cocoa climbed to
42,134 contracts from 42,068 lots a week earlier, the data
showed. The beans fell 0.1 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers reduced their net-short
position to 396 contracts from 422 a week earlier. The grain was
unchanged percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
