German stocks  advanced for a 10th
consecutive day, their longest winning streak since July 2005,
as shares of carmakers climbed.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  each rose
more than 2.5 percent.  Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  gained 2.9 percent as
Deutsche Bank AG raised its recommendation on the maker of car
parts and weaponry.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-largest

8,426.48 at 1:15 p.m. in Frankfurt. The equity benchmark rallied
1.4 percent last week as measures of U.S. consumer sentiment and
leading indicators beat economists’ estimates, and car sales in
the European Union rose in April for the first time since
September 2011. The broader HDAX Index also increased 0.3
percent to its highest-ever level.  “The DAX has underperformed some European markets this
year and there are a lot of very good companies in there, so the
rally will probably continue a bit further,” said Richard Scrope, who helps oversee about $160 million as a  fund manager 
at Oriel Asset Management LLP in London, in a telephone
interview. “Carmakers are doing well on the back of European
production numbers last week, which had a positive reading for
the first time in quite some months.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 41 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Markets in
Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Luxembourg
were closed today for the Whit Monday holiday.  Carmakers Rally  BMW, the world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles , added

euros.  Daimler AG (DAI)  rose 2 percent to 49.96 euros. A  gauge of
carmakers  posted the best performance of the 19 industry groups
in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation on European
automobile manufacturers to overweight, similar to a buy rating,
from neutral. The brokerage said that the trend of earnings
downgrades for the industry may stop as sales improve in
Europe’s largest economies.  Rheinmetall climbed 2.9 percent to 39.21 euros as Deutsche
Bank raised its recommendation on the maker of automotive parts
to hold from sell. The bank said that European demand for cars
and trucks may improve in the second half of the year.  Commerzbank increased 3.6 percent to 8.09 euros.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  rose 2.6 percent to 15.91 euros as
