Germany’s two-year notes declined for
the first time in four days amid signs the global economic
recovery is gathering pace, damping investor demand for the
safest government assets.  The extra yield that investors get for holding Italian 10-year securities instead of German bunds narrowed to the least
since January as a report showed  Italy ’s industrial orders
increased in March more than economists predicted. German 10-year yields approached the highest in seven weeks and Dutch
bonds snapped a two-day gain.  “Bunds are certainly trading on the rich side,” said
Norbert Aul, a European rates strategist at  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) 
in London. “What we’ve seen already over the past week is bunds
trying to push higher in yield terms, and that’s only been
derailed when we got specific weak data.”  Germany’s two-year note yield increased two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to minus 0.01 percent at 4:26 p.m.
London time. The zero percent security maturing June 2015 lost
0.04 or 40 euro cents per 1,000 euro ($1,286) face amount to
100.01. A negative yield means investors who hold the security
until it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  The 10-year yield rose four basis points to 1.37 percent,
after climbing to 1.41 percent on May 15, the most since March
25. Yields fell to a record-low 1.127 percent in June.  Italian Orders  Italian  industrial orders  increased 1.6 percent in March
after slipping 2.5 percent in February, the statistics office in
 Rome  said. The median forecast of four analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.6 percent gain.  A report on May 23 will show a gauge of services and
manufacturing in the euro area improved in May even as the
measure stayed below the 50 level that marks expansion,
according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  The rates on Italian 10-year bonds and similar-maturity
Spanish debt were little changed, at 3.90 percent and 4.21
percent, respectively.  The yield spread between Italy’s 10-year bonds and German
bunds shrank three basis points to 254 basis points after
contracting to 250 basis points, the narrowest since Jan. 30.
The extra yield investors demand to hold similar-maturity
Spanish bonds instead of bunds fell four basis points to 284
basis points.  Germany  is due to sell 5 billion euros of new bonds due in
May 2023 on May 22.  Austrian Debt  Bunds also underperformed their Austrian counterparts with
the yield difference between the countries’ 10-year bonds
narrowing to as low as 33 basis points today, the least since
April 16.  France ’s yield premium over bunds dropped to 51 basis
points from 53 basis points last week.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1 percent on May 17
after a report showed confidence among American consumers
climbed this month to the highest level in almost six years. The
stock index was little changed today.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is scheduled to
speak to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on May 22 and
the Federal Open Market Committee will release the minutes of
its April 30-May 1 meeting on the same day.  “Overall for the day, there’s a risk-on sentiment,” said
Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . “Everyone’s going to be waiting for
the combination of the FOMC minutes and Bernanke’s speaking to
the senate. The overall theme for us is a continual grind
tighter of peripheral spreads.”  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of  Austria  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  The yield on Dutch securities maturing in July 2023
increased four basis points to 1.68 percent and that on
 Finland ’s 10-year security gained three basis points to 1.58
percent.  Italian government bonds returned 5 percent this year
through May 17, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
securities gained 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
