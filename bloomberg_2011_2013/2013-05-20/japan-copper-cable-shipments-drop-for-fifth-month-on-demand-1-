Japan ’s copper wire and cable
shipments fell 2.9 percent in April from a year earlier,
slumping for a fifth month on subdued demand even after the
country’s economy expanded the most in a year last quarter.  Shipments totaled 54,400 metric tons last month, compared
with 56,036 tons a year earlier, the  Japanese Electric Wire &
Cable Makers’ Association  said today in a statement. Deliveries
were 58,514 tons in March, down 2.4 percent from a year earlier.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  rose an annualized 3.5
percent, a Cabinet Office release showed on May 16. Private
consumption, making up 60 percent of GDP, contributed 2.3
percentage points to the jump. The report showed that while
consumers -- aided by a stock-market surge -- are responding to
the reflation campaign mounted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and
Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda, companies remain cautious.  “The cable industry’s recovery is normally lagging behind
consumers, such as producers of cars, electric-machinery and
electronics,” said Keiichi Ohki, an official at the
association’s research department. “We may have to wait a bit
longer to see signs of a recovery in demand this year.”  Copper-cable shipments to the export industry dropped 21.1
percent in April from a year earlier, while those to automakers
fell 18.2 percent and deliveries to the electric-machinery
industry declined 7.9 percent, the association said.  The Japanese currency has fallen 19 percent against the
dollar this year amid Abe’s calls for aggressive monetary easing
to end deflation. The yen touched 103.31 on May 17, the weakest
level since October 2008.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,308 a ton at 11:55 a.m. in
 Tokyo  after declining 7.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
