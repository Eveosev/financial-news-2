Ibovespa futures  dropped as
economists covering  Brazil  lowered 2013 and 2014 forecasts for
manufacturing growth, adding to concern that the recovery in
 Latin America ’s largest economy will falter.  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the shipbuilder controlled by Brazilian
billionaire  Eike Batista , may move after announcing a new
business plan where it pledged to prioritize cash-generating
projects in its leasing unit and to reduce the speed of the Acu
shipyard construction. Card-payment processor  Cielo SA (CIEL3)  may be
active after Banco Itau BBA SA lowered its recommendation to the
equivalent of hold.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in June lost 0.1
percent to 55,000 at 9:09 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real weakened
0.2 percent to 2.0321 per dollar.  Brazil’s industrial output will grow 2.50 percent this year
and 3.50 percent in the next, according to the median estimate
from about 100 economists surveyed by the central bank. They had
forecast expansion of 2.53 percent and 3.55 percent respectively
a week earlier.  The Ibovespa has declined 9.5 percent this year, the most
among 19 major  emerging markets , data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Brazil’s benchmark equity index  trades  at 12.2 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with a multiple of 10.9 for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 6.94 billion
reais ($3.42 billion) on May 17, compared with a daily average
of 7.72 billion reais this year through May 16, according to
data compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
