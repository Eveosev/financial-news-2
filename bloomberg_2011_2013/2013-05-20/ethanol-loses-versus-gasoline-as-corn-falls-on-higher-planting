Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation that dry, warm weather in the U.S.
Midwest led to an increase in corn planting, cutting costs for
the biofuel’s feedstock.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 0.27 cent to
23.86 cents a gallon as weather deemed favorable may have helped
farmers put machines in the fields to make progress toward
planting the 97.28 million acres, the most since 1936,  predicted 
by the Agriculture Department. One bushel of the grain makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “You always see ethanol follow corn prices,” said  Terry Reilly , senior commodity analyst at Futures International LLC in
Chicago. “Even though ethanol is down, the weakness in corn can
be good for margins.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 0.4 cent to $2.667
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The futures have gained
22 percent this year.  Gasoline for June delivery slipped 0.13 cent to $2.9056 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., compared with
sugarcane in  Brazil . The worst drought since the 1930s last year
pushed prices for the grain to a record and forced biofuel
companies to temper output or idle operations.  Corn Declines  Corn for July delivery fell 3.25 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$6.495 a bushel in  Chicago .  The corn crush spread for July was 18 cents, up from 17
cents on May 17. The spread was minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  “Margins look pretty good for most producers,” Reilly
said.  Ethanol  production  in the week ended May 10 averaged
857,000 barrels a day, the highest level since April 26 and down
5.2 percent from a year earlier, data from the Energy
Information Administration show.  Below-average output  has helped deplete  stockpiles  of the
fuel. Inventories that week slid 2.5 percent to 16.4 million
barrels, the lowest since Dec. 3, 2010, the Energy Department’s
statistical agency said in a May 15 report.  Reilly said ethanol’s discount to gasoline, demand from the
summer driving season, which starts this weekend, and cheaper
corn may help spur an increase in production.  Ethanol RINs  Corn-based ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers  for
2013, or RINs, rose 1.8 percent to 86.5 cents at 4 p.m.  New York 
time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which
cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, gained
4.4 percent to 94 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf decreased
6 cents to $2.77; in Chicago the additive lost 3 cents to
$2.655; on the West Coast prices dropped 1 cent to $2.805; and
in New York the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to $2.805 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. hasn’t  imported  any of the fuel since April 19,
EIA data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended May 10, down from a record
97 percent the previous week, according to EIA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
