Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , the world’s
fifth-biggest wind-turbine maker, is in talks to repay investors
after defaulting on $209 million of U.S. dollar-denominated
convertible bonds in October, according to two people familiar
with the matter.  The company, the subject of India’s biggest convertible
debt default, may issue notes denominated in the U.S. currency
to fund the 2012 repayment, the people said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  Suzlon, based in the western Indian city of Pune,  declined
to comment today in an e-mailed response to questions, saying
it’s “in a silent period” ahead of a quarterly earnings report
due May 30.  Suzlon Energy failed to redeem $175.8 million of zero-coupon notes and $32.8 million of 7.5 percent bonds which fell
due Oct. 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its stock
was little changed as of 12:09 p.m. in Mumbai, after rising as
much as 3.1 percent to the highest since April 30.  India ’s top wind-turbine maker ceded that position in the
financial year ended March 31 for the first time in at least a
decade, according to data from the Indian Wind Turbine
Manufacturers’ Association. Suzlon completed a 95 billion rupee
($1.7 billion) debt restructuring last month, which included
issuing shares to its lenders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
