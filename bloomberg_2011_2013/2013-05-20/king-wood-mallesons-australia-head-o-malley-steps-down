Tony O’Malley, King & Wood Mallesons’
managing partner of the law firm’s Australian offices, agreed to
resign immediately and will retire as a partner at the end of
2013.  King & Wood Mallesons’ board has formed a subcommittee to
replace O’Malley with a new managing partner for  Australia 
expected to be named in two or three weeks, Stuart Fuller, the
firm’s global managing partner, said in an e-mailed statement
today. O’Malley had been with the firm for 13 years, it said.  King & Wood and Mallesons Stephen Jaques combined last year
to form  Asia ’s biggest law firm, which now has about 2,200 legal
professionals.  Fuller gave no reason for O’Malley’s resignation in the
statement.  O’Malley’s departure was  reported  earlier by the Australian
