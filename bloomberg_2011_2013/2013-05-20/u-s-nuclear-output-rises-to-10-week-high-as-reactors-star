U.S.  nuclear-power generation  rose to
the highest level in 10 weeks as reactors in  Connecticut  and
 Michigan  finished refueling.  Nationwide production advanced  1.9 percent  to 83,841
megawatts from May 17, or 82 percent of capacity, the most since
March 12, according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was  0.7 percent higher  than a year
ago with 17 of 104 plants offline.  Dominion Resources Inc. (D)  started the 1,227-megawatt
Millstone 3 reactor in Connecticut, which was operating at 64
percent of capacity early today. The unit, about 3 miles (5
kilometers) southwest of  New London , was shut for five weeks.  American Electric Power Co. (AEP)  boosted the 1,009-megawatt D.C.
Cook 1 reactor in Michigan. The unit, about 26 miles northwest
of South Bend,  Indiana , was operating at 30 percent of capacity
after being offline for almost eight weeks for refueling and
maintenance.  FirstEnergy Corp. raised production at the 1,261-megawatt
Perry 1 reactor, 35 miles northeast of  Cleveland ,  Ohio , to 97
percent from 28 percent of capacity May 17.  N.Y. Reactor  Constellation Energy Group Inc. increased output at the
621-megawatt Nine Mile Point 1 reactor, about 6 miles northeast
of Oswego, New York, to 100 percent of capacity from 75 percent
on May 17, NRC data show. The plant was taken offline last month
for scheduled refueling, according to Jill Lyon, a company
spokeswoman based at the plant.  Generation in the Midwest climbed today to 18,395
megawatts, or 86 percent of capacity, the most since March 17.
 Northeast reactors  were producing 20,245 megawatts of
electricity, 82 percent of capacity, the most since April 14.  The South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Co. raised
production at the 1,410-megawatt South Texas 1 unit to full
capacity from 70 percent on May 17. The reactor, about 80 miles
southwest of Houston, was shut a week earlier for maintenance in
preparation for the summer peak demand period, according to
Buddy Eller, a spokesman based at the plant.  The South Texas Project is co-owned by NRG Energy Corp. and
the municipal utilities for Austin and  San Antonio .  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  shut the 938-megawatt Brunswick 1 reactor
in  North Carolina , which was operating at full capacity on May
17. Production at Unit 2 at the plant, 130 miles south of
Raleigh, was boosted to 100 percent from 78 percent during the
same period.  NextEra Energy Inc. reduced output at the 720-megawatt
Turkey Point 4 reactor in  Florida  to 49 percent from 92 percent
of capacity May 17. The plant is 20 miles south of Miami.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 46 days in 2012, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporters on this story:
