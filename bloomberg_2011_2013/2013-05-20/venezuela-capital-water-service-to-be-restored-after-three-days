Water service will be restored today
after a three-day outage in parts of Caracas, capital of  South
America ’s biggest oil producer, the Venezuela state news agency
AVN said.  A water pipeline failure that the state company
Hidrocapital said was caused by valves at La Gauirita treatment
plant cut supplies to southeast and northeast areas of the
nation’s most populous city for much of the weekend, AVN said on
its website. Water supplies yesterday were 37 percent lower than
normal, Hidrocapital said in a website statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
