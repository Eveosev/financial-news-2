Italy ’s bonds rose for a fourth day
as a government report showed the nation’s industrial orders
increased more than economists predicted, adding to optimism
the region’s economy is recovering.  The extra yield investors receive to hold Italy’s 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German securities narrowed to
the least since January. Spanish 10-year bonds also advanced
for a fourth day, the longest run of gains in almost three
weeks. German 10-year bunds snapped a two-day advance as
demand for the region’s safest assets waned.  Italy’s 10-year yields fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.88 percent at 3:09 p.m. London time. The
4.5 percent security maturing in May 2023 gained 0.12, or 1.20
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,285) face amount, to 105.365. The rate
on Spanish 10-year bonds slid one basis point to 4.20 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.34 percent
after climbing to 1.41 percent on May 15, the most since March
25. The rate on the nation’s two-year note added two basis
points to minus 0.015 percent. A negative yield means investors
who hold the security until it matures will receive less than
they paid to buy it.  To contact the reporters on this story:
