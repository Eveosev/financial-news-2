XenoPort Inc. (XNPT) , the maker of the drug
Horizant for Restless Legs Syndrome, sank the most in almost
three years after an experimental medicine failed to meet goals
of a late-stage clinical trial.  XenoPort dropped 13 percent to $5.87 at 10:57 a.m. New York
time after touching $5.03 for the biggest intraday decline since
July 2010. The shares of the Santa Clara, California-based
company had fallen 13 percent this year through May 17.  XenoPort is stopping development of arbaclofen placarbil,
an experimental treatment for spasticity in multiple sclerosis
patients, after the therapy didn’t help more than placebo, the
company said in a statement today.  Brian Abrahams , an analyst
with  Wells Fargo (WFC) , had estimated sales of $77 million by 2017 for
the drug.  “This is disappointing, given promising phase 2 data,”
Abrahams wrote in a research note today. “The failure does
remove a potential floor in valuation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
