Seven more horses that had been in the
care of Sheikh Mohammed’s former trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni have
tested positive for anabolic steroids, the British Horseracing
Authority said.  Last year’s St Leger winner Encke is among seven animals
that tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol, the BHA
said in a statement on its website today. The thoroughbreds will
be banned from racing for six months.  Last month, Al Zarooni was suspended for eight years by the
BHA for administering anabolic steroids to 15 horses he trained 
at the Goldolphin stables in Newmarket,  England . Al Zarooni
has appealed the suspension.  Goldolphin is owned by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
