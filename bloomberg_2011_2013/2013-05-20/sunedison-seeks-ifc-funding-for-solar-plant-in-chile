MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) ’s
SunEdison LLC unit is seeking funding from the  World Bank ’s
private-sector financing arm to build a 50-megawatt solar plant
in Chile that plans to sell power at commercial rates.  The International Finance Corp.’s board plans to take a
decision on June 18, according to an  investment proposal  on the
IFC’s website. The IFC didn’t disclose how much it may invest in
the project. SunEdison said in March that the project would cost
$120.5 million.  The plant expects to sell power at prevailing spot-market
electricity prices, according to the proposal. It will be built
in Copiapo in Chile’s Atacama region using crystalline panels
from MEMC.  Solar plants normally get paid above-market rates in places
including Europe and  Japan  because solar power is more expensive
to generate compared to traditional fossil fuel-based grid
electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
