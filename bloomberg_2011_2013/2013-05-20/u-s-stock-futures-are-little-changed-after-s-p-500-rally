U.S. stocks  declined, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed four straight weeks, as investors weighed the pace of central bank stimulus efforts amid corporate dealmaking.  Procter & Gamble Co . and Coca-Cola Co. retreated at least 1.2 percent as companies that make food, beverages and household products slumped. Yahoo! Inc. climbed 0.2 percent after agreeing to buy blogging network Tumblr Inc. for $1.1 billion. Actavis Inc. rallied 1.3 percent as it reached a deal to acquire  Warner Chilcott  Plc.

The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 19.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 15,335.28. About 6 billion shares traded hands today, or 5.1 percent below the three-month average.  “Some minor pullback should be expected after the steady gains we’ve achieved,” Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens BancShares Inc., which manages $5 billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina , said in a phone interview. “I don’t think that we’re going to see any immediate tapering off of monetary policy, though we can expect from hawkish members or others outside the FOMC questioning the policy, which might lead to market volatility.”  The S&P 500 added 2.1 percent last week, its fourth straight weekly gain, as gauges of leading economic indicators and consumer sentiment beat estimates. The U.S. bull market has entered its fifth year, adding about $11.5 trillion in market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  S&P 500  has  surged  146 percent from a 12-year low in 2009, driven by better-than-estimated corporate earnings and three rounds of bond purchases from the  Federal Reserve .  ‘Escape Velocity’  Stocks erased gains from earlier in the session after Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans  said the  U.S. economy  has improved “quite a lot” as the central bank maintains record stimulus. The question now is “how much confidence we have that the improvements that have been made will continue and be sustained,” said Evans, who holds a vote on the  Federal Open Market Committee  this year.  Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said in an interview on CNBC that the odds favor dialing back the central bank’s purchase of $85 billion in bonds per month. He said he would have started tapering stimulus at the last FOMC meeting.  Unprecedented Stimulus  Some Fed officials in recent months have signaled they favor scaling back the quantitative-easing program in the next few months. Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke  has said he would continue unprecedented stimulus until the jobless rate falls to 6.5 percent or inflation rises above 2.5 percent. The Fed publishes minutes of its last policy meeting on May 22, while Bernanke will testify that day on the economic outlook.  “Keep in mind we are at all-time highs so even a moderate cautious comment will be met with some selling,”  Larry Peruzzi , senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets LLC in  Boston , wrote in an e-mail. “Investors are looking for a reason to take profits.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 127 days without a retreat exceeding 5 percent or more, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The index dropped 7.7 percent from a Sept. 14 peak through Nov. 15. The advance is the longest without a 5 percent drop since a 173-day stretch ended Feb. 20, 2007, about eight months before the financial crisis sent the market plunging 57 percent.

His firm manages about $117 billion. “While all of us know there will be some pullback at some point, it’s hard to be the person to bet that tomorrow will be the case.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, rose 4.6 percent to 13.02 The equity volatility gauge, which moves in the opposite direction to the S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, has slipped 28 percent this year.  The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index retreated the most among 10 industry gauges, falling 1 percent as Procter & Gamble slid 1.2 percent to $79.09 and Coca-Cola fell 1.4 percent to $42.38.

Oil prices  advanced for a fourth day as the dollar declined and turmoil in the  Middle East  bolstered concern that shipments from the region will be disrupted.  WPX Energy Inc. climbed 7 percent to $19.76. Taconic Capital Advisors LP disclosed a 6.39 percent stake in the natural gas and oil company and said it may seek ways to enhance  shareholder value , according to a regulatory filing.

Yahoo rose 0.2 percent to $26.58. The biggest U.S. Web portal is buying Tumblr as Chief Executive Officer  Marissa Mayer  seeks to lure users and advertisers with her priciest acquisition to date.
