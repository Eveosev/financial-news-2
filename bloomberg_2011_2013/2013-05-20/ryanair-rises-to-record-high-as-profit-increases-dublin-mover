Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  rose to a
record-high after  Europe ’s biggest discount airline said full-year profit increased 13 percent.  Ryanair rose as much as 6.9 percent to 6.76 euros in
Dublin, and traded at 6.73 euros as of 10:17 a.m. Trading volume
in the stock was 40 percent the average for the past three
months at about 0.8 million shares.  The Dublin-based carrier’s earnings after tax rose to 569
million euros in the 12 months to March 31, minus one-time
items, from 503 million euros a year earlier, it said
today in a statement. The company said it expected “another
year of profit growth in full-year 2014 which - subject to
winter yield outturns - should increase to a range of between
570 million euros to 600 million euros.”  “The outlook was always going to be the key,” said Donal
O’Neill, an analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin, who has
a buy rating on the company. “Ryanair has guided exactly where
we expected it would.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
