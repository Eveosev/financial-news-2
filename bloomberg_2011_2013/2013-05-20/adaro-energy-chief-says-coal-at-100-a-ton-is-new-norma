PT Adaro Energy (ADRO) , Indonesia’s second-biggest producer of power-station coal, said miners will have to
adjust to prices of about $100 a metric ton, which is half a
peak reached in 2008.  “The new normal, I think, would be $95 to $100 a ton,
based on the marginal cost of production in the region,” Adaro
Energy President Director Garibaldi Thohir said in an interview.  A slump in coal prices will help ease oversupply as it
would prompt some small and high-cost miners to reduce output or
stop production, Thohir said in his office in Jakarta on May 17.
Adaro is expected to report lower net income this year than in
2012, Thohir said, without giving a specific forecast.  The price of  coal  has fallen by more than half since a peak
in mid-2008 amid slowing Chinese imports and rising output from
producers including  Indonesia  and Colombia. The decline is
forcing companies including Adaro to trim costs to safeguard
margins. Thohir said the price may have bottomed.  Coal at the Australian port of Newcastle, Asia’s benchmark
price, dropped 15 cents to $86.65 a ton for the week ended May
17 from the previous week, data from IHS McCloskey show. The
price reached a record $192.50 a ton in July 2008, and averaged
$94.29 a ton last year.  Adaro  shares  fell as much as 3.6 percent to 1,080 rupiah as
of 1:59 p.m. in Jakarta trading. Before today, they had lost 30
percent in Jakarta this year, compared with a 21 percent jump in
the  Jakarta Composite Index. (JCI)   Margin Pressure  Adaro targets earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization of $850 million to $1 billion in 2013, down
from $1.1 billion in 2012. That compares with the $966.5 million
median of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Thohir said Adaro is poised to achieve the full-year target
after reporting Ebitda of $190 million for the three months
through March.  Falling coal prices have depressed Adaro’s  Ebitda margin ,
which fell to 23.2 percent in the last quarter of 2012, the
lowest since the company went public in July 2008. The margin
recovered to 25.6 percent in the first quarter. The company
declined to provide guidance for the full-year Ebitda margin.  Adaro reported a 66 percent drop in first-quarter net
income to $41.6 million on April 30.  The decline in earnings “shows the impact of margin
compression as Adaro’s cost cuts could not fully cover the drop
in coal price,” Erindra Krisnawan and Erisca Wiraatmadja,
analysts at PT CIMB Securities Indonesia, wrote in a report
after earnings. CIMB has an  underperform  rating on the stock.  The stock  traded  at 10.7 times 12-month projected earnings
as of the close yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s lower than the price-to-earnings ratio of 15.8
for the Jakarta Composite Index, and higher than the 9.3 ratio
for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Metal and Mining Index.  Efficiency Gains  Adaro targets cash costs of $35 to $38 a ton to produce
coal this year by increasing efficiency. This will include a
plan to cut reliance on dump trucks by operating a conveyor to
remove soil waste from the Tutupan mining site, according to the
company’s  annual report . Thohir said the conveyor will start
running within two months.  Adaro’s cash cost was $37.1 a ton in the first quarter and
$38.9 a ton in 2012, excluding royalties, according to the
company.  “Nobody can control the price,” Thohir said. “What’s
within our control is how we can manage costs.”  Adaro plans to produce 50 million to 53 million tons of
thermal coal this year, compared with 47.2 million tons in 2012.
The company has already sold all its fuel for this year, Thohir
said.  Creating Demand  “We still see strong demand for coal,” Thohir said,
noting record demand from  China  and India last year. “While we
are experiencing volatility in the industry, we believe the
long-term fundamentals for coal remain intact supported by
robust demand in the Asia-Pacific region for moderate and low-rank coal.”  Adaro plans to invest more in power plant projects to tap
rising electricity demand in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy,
Thohir said.  “We are creating our own demand by participating in power
stations projects,” Thohir said.  Electric Power Development Co. (9513) ,  Itochu Corp. (8001)  and Adaro
Energy won the right in June 2011 to build a 2,000-megawatt
coal-fired power plant in Central Java for an estimated $4
billion. The project is expected to be completed in 2017.  Indonesia was Adaro’s  biggest buyer  of coal in 2012,
accounting for 23 percent of its sales at 48.9 million tons,
based on data provided by the company.  India  and Spain ranked
second and third, respectively.  “Miners who are inefficient will collapse,” Thohir said.
“Only producers with the lowest costs will survive. I believe
Adaro will be the champion.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
