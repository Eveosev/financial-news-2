West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for the first time in four days on speculation that prices
climbed more than justified last week.  Futures declined as much as 0.8 percent in New York as U.S.
 equity indexes  were little changed after advancing for four
straight weeks. Oil futures and equities surged last week on
signs that U.S. economic growth will accelerate, bolstering
demand for fuel.  “Crude oil and other risk assets were a little
overcooked,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division
at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “The rally in
equities and oil at the end of the week isn’t sustainable.”  WTI oil for June delivery fell 51 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$95.51 a barrel at 9:17 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices rose 86 cents to $96.02 on May 17, the highest
settlement since May 10. The volume of all contracts traded was
15 percent below the 100-day average for this time of day.  June futures expire tomorrow. The more-active July contract
slid 51 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $95.78.  Brent for July settlement dropped 60 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $104.04 a barrel on the London-based ICE exchange. Volume for
all contracts was 49 percent lower than the 100-day average. The
front-month European benchmark was at a premium of $8.26 to WTI
contract for the same month.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which increased to a
record 1,667.47 on May 17, was little changed at 1,667.90 at
9:40 a.m.  ‘Unforeseen Headline’  “We should drift lower today barring some unforeseen
headline,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research
at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Volume is very
light as well.”  WTI advanced to $96.26 in earlier trading as Syrian
government forces started an offensive against rebels.
Government troops retook most of the strategic city of Al-Qusair
in central  Syria , state-run SANA news agency said.  “Syria is a microcosm of the unrest across the  Middle East 
and could spread to other countries,” said  Christopher Bellew ,
a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in  London .  Speculative bets that Brent prices will rise, in futures
and options combined, outnumbered short positions by 130,219
lots in the week ended May 14, ICE said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. The gain of 6,184 contracts, or 5
percent, is a third straight weekly increase and brings net-long
positions to the highest since April 2.  Money managers increased  net-long positions , or wagers on
higher prices, in WTI by 606 futures and options combined, or
0.3 percent, to 205,140, in the seven days ended May 14,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s May 17
Commitments of Traders report. It was the third weekly gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
