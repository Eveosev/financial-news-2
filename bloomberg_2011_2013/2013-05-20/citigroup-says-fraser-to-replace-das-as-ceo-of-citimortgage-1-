Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named private-banking boss Jane Fraser to
replace Sanjiv Das as chief executive officer of the
CitiMortgage unit.  Das, a former  Morgan Stanley (MS)  executive hired by ex-CEO
Vikram Pandit, is leaving to pursue “other professional
opportunities,” Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said today in an
internal memo. Fraser was CEO of the New York-based company’s
private bank for the past four years.  Corbat, 53, is reshuffling Citigroup’s executive team after
replacing Pandit, 56, as CEO in October. The departure of Das,
51, follows the exits of Vice-Chairman Lewis “Lew” Kaden,
emerging-markets head Hamid Biglari and consumer-operations boss
Richard Garside. Corbat also reduced the duties of operations
and technology head Don Callahan.  “Sanjiv took over CitiMortgage in the depth of the
financial crisis,” Corbat wrote. “His leadership has helped
stabilize the business during the most difficult of times.”  Mark Mason, head of the  Citi Holdings  division that
contains the bank’s unwanted assets, will replace Fraser as CEO
of the private bank. Francesco Vanni d’Archirafi, former head of
the transaction-services business, will become CEO of Citi
Holdings, the company said.  Das will remain at Citigroup for the next few months and
work on “mortgage issues related to the government,” Corbat
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
