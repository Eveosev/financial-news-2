Gold futures may rebound to $1,500 an
ounce in June after hitting a “double bottom” yesterday,
according to  technical analysis  by R.J. O’Brien & Associates.  The price may climb 8.4 percent from yesterday’s settlement
after touching $1,336.30, a month after slumping to a two-year
low of $1,321.50 on April 16, said Matthew Schilling, a
commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien in  Chicago . A double bottom is
a chart pattern showing a drop, a rebound and then another
decline approaching the previous low, usually indicating
support.  “This shows that gold is probably ready to climb,”
Schilling said in a telephone interview from Chicago. “The
reversal was proof that we have found a bottom.”  On April 15, gold plunged 9.3 percent, the most in 33
years. A session earlier, the price slumped into a  bear market 
as some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
amid economic optimism, low inflation and a rally in equities.  Yesterday, gold futures for June delivery rose 1.4 percent
to settle at $1,384.10 on the Comex in New York. The price
gained as much as 2.4 percent after slumping 2.1 percent.
Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold surged by
$1.7 billion in 10 minutes as futures rallied.  Yesterday, assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest ETP,
fell 0.7 percent to 1,031.5 metric tons, extending a slump to
the lowest since 2009. Gold futures have dropped 17 percent in
2013. The price climbed in the previous 12 years.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
