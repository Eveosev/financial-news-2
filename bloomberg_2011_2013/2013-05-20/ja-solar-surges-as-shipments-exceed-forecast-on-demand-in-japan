JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , the largest
solar-cell producer by capacity, surged the most on record as
first-quarter shipments exceeded the company’s forecast on
strong demand in  Japan .  JA Solar’s American depositary receipts rose 70 percent to
$9.56 at the close in New York, the most since trading began in
February 2007. Each ADR is worth five ordinary shares. They have
more than doubled this year.  Deliveries of solar cells and modules in the quarter
reached 442.7 megawatts, surpassed the company’s March forecast
of 410 megawatts to 430 megawatts, Shanghai-based JA Solar said
today in a statement.  “We performed especially well in Japan, which accounted
for a record 38 percent of our module shipments during the
quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Jin Baofang said in the
statement. The country is promoting wider use of solar energy
after reconsidering its dependence on nuclear power following
the March 2011 disaster in Fukushima.  JA Solar expects second-quarter deliveries of 410 megawatts
to 430 megawatts and maintained its forecast for 2013 shipments
of 1.7 gigawatts to 1.9 gigawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
