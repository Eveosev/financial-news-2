The California Public Employees’
Retirement System voted in favor of splitting  Jamie Dimon ’s dual
roles as chairman and chief executive officer ahead of  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s annual shareholder meeting tomorrow.  Calpers, which cast votes for 12.9 million of the New York-based bank’s shares, also withheld support for three members of
the board’s risk committee: Ellen Futter, president of the
American Museum of Natural History, Honeywell International Inc.
CEO David Cote and James Crown, president of Henry Crown & Co.
The pension fund cited “failures in risk oversight” during
last year’s record trading loss as a reason for withholding the
votes, according to results posted on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
