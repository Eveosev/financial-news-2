The cost of credit-default swaps
insuring subordinated European bank debt fell to the lowest in
three years amid speculation changes to rules governing the
securities will devalue existing contracts.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the junior debt
of 25 banks and insurers declined for a fourth day, dropping
16.5 basis points to 181.5, according to Bloomberg data at 1
p.m. in  London .  The  International Swaps & Derivatives Association  is
planning the biggest overhaul of the $24 trillion credit
 derivatives market  since 2003. Investors are selling outstanding
swaps in anticipation new contracts will include greater
protection against so-called bail-ins, in which governments
force bondholders to share the cost of bank rescues.  “It’s unlikely the changes will be applied
retroactively,” said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  in London. “There will have to be new contracts.”  Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  There are a total 2.12 million contracts covering a gross
$24 trillion worth of credit products, according to the
 Depository Trust & Clearing Corp ., which runs a central registry
for the derivatives market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
