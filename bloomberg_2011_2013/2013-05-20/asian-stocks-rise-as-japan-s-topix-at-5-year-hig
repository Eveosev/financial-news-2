Asian  stocks  rose the first time in
three days, with a regional gauge set for the highest close
since June 2008, after U.S. consumer sentiment beat estimates
and Tokyo Electric Power Co. led Japanese utilities higher.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothing that gets
63 percent of its sales in the U.S., gained 2 percent in Hong
Kong.  Osaka Gas (9532)  Co. advanced to the highest in more than five
years after the U.S. conditionally approved a  Texas  liquefied
natural gas project partially owned by the energy supplier.
Tokyo Electric Power soared 16 percent after the Yomiuri
newspaper said it will apply to restart reactors.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.2 percent to 144.25 as
of 8:13 p.m. in Tokyo. The measure surged 12 percent this year,
led by Japanese shares, as U.S. data signaled improvement in the
world’s No. 1 economy and the  Bank of Japan  took steps to
counter deflation.  “The numbers continue to confirm a recovery,”  Mark Matthews , head of Asia research at Bank Julius Baer & Co., said
in a Bloomberg TV interview in Hong Kong. His firm has $282
billion under management. This year’s advance in equities “will
continue. It’s a steady improvement in the data and the next
step is to see stronger evidence of a consumer recovery. Stocks
are not too expensive.”  The regional benchmark gauge was trading at 14.5 times
 estimated earnings  on May 17, compared with 15.1 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hong Kong  Japan ’s Topix Index advanced 1.3 percent to 1,269.51, the
highest close since August 2008, with volume 12 percent higher
than the 30-day average. The gauge climbed 48 percent this year,
the best gain among major equity indexes. Australia’s  S&P/ASX
200 Index (AS51)  rose 0.6 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was
little changed.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.8 percent as Tencent
Holdings Ltd., China’s largest Internet company, jumped 6.3
percent. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.8 percent, while
Taiwan’s Taiex Index added 0.1 percent. Singapore’s Straits
Times Index rose 0.1 percent, and South Korea’s Kospi Index slid
0.2 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell less than 0.1 percent. The
measure closed at a record on May 17 as an index of U.S. leading
indicators climbed in April and  consumer confidence  rose to the
highest level in almost six years.  Exporters Climb  Asian exporters to the U.S. gained. Li & Fung rose 2
percent to HK$11.34. Sony Corp., a Japanese consumer-electronics
maker that gets 16 percent of sales in the U.S., advanced 5.7
percent to 2,162 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest
auto manufacturer, climbed 1.9 percent to 6,590 yen.  Osaka Gas jumped 4.2 percent to 477 yen, the highest since
December 2007, after the U.S. Energy Department conditionally
approved exports from the Freeport LNG project to countries that
don’t have free-trade agreements with the U.S. The development,
partly owned by ConocoPhillips, Dow Chemical Co. and Osaka Gas,
must still win approval from the  Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission .  Nippon Yusen KK (9101) , the largest publicly traded operator of
LNG ships, surged 11 percent to 295 yen, its biggest gain since
October 2008. Rates for transporting the fuel jumped 28 percent
last week. The shipper also agreed to take a one-third stake in
an LNG export facility with trading companies Mitsui & Co. and
Mitsubishi Corp.  Nuclear Restarts  Mitsui advanced 4 percent to 1,472 yen, while Mitsubishi
gained 1.7 percent to 1,925 yen.  Tokyo Electric  soared after a Yomiuri report yesterday that
the power producer will request to restart nuclear facilities.
The company will do so after new regulations on nuclear power
operation take effect in July, the Yomiuri said without citing
anyone. The company said it is assessing whether its
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant meets safety rules, according to a
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.  Tepco, as the utility is known, surged 16 percent to 726
yen, extending its advance since the start of December to 458
percent. Chubu Electric Power Co. jumped 7.8 percent to 1,459
yen.  Tencent gained 6.3 percent to HK$309.40, a record closing
high, with trading volume more than twice as high as the three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares
of  China ’s largest Internet company extended gains after beating
estimates for first-quarter profit on May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
