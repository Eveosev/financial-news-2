The U.K. government should introduce
an immediate two-year freeze on business rates, a tax to pay for
local services, to help ailing retail outlets hit by the rise in
Internet shopping, the Policy Exchange research institute said.  “The main issue in retail is clearly the continuing rise
of the Internet as a rival to traditional stores,” Alex Morton,
head of housing and planning at  Policy Exchange  in London, said
in an e-mailed statement. “We believe that there is a case for
a two-year freeze on business rates. But this only makes sense
in the context of giving breathing space for further changes to
retail policy to bring it into the 21st century.”  Traditional town-center shopping areas need to be given the
“the best chance to reinvent or renew themselves” and
government policy should focus on “removing barriers to
consumer choice that push up the cost of living and must not
assume all high streets can or should remain as shopping
centers,” Morton said.  Business rates are calculated by local authorities taking
the so-called “ratable value” or annual rental value of a
business if it’s on the open market and multiplying it by a rate
set by central government. In the 2013-14 fiscal year, that
multiplier was set at 47.1 percent across England while in
 London  it was set at 47.5 percent,  according to government
figures .  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
