Rubber advanced to a one-week high
after  Japan ’s currency slid to the lowest level in more than
four years, boosting the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in October on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange gained 0.6 percent to settle at 289.5 yen a kilogram
($2,823 a metric ton), the highest level at the close since May
13. Futures pared this year’s loss to 4.3 percent.  The yen traded at 102.63 per dollar after touching 103.31
on May 17, the weakest level since October 2008. Japan’s
currency came under pressure after data showed U.S. leading
indicators and consumer sentiment advanced more than estimated,
adding to optimism that the recovery of the world’s largest
economy may be picking up.  “A weakening yen gave the biggest support to rubber
futures,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in
Tokyo, said by phone today.  American confidence in the economy climbed in May to the
highest level in almost six years as rising real estate values
and record stock prices boosted household wealth. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment rose to 83.7, the highest since July 2007.  Thai rubber free-on-board rose 1.1 percent to 89.85 baht
($3.01) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . The nation, the biggest producer and
exporter, is targeting a price of 110 baht a kilogram for this
year and 2014, according to Thai Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives agency.  Rubber for delivery in September on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange fell 0.4 percent to close at 20,510  yuan  ($3,340) a
ton. Natural-rubber inventories dropped for a second week by 930
tons to 120,160 tons, the bourse said on May 17 based on a
survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan
and Tianjin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
