India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark stock gauge fell
from its highest level in more than two years as concern the
rally has exceeded the outlook for earnings growth outweighed
inflows from foreign funds.  The S&P BSE Sensex slid 0.3 percent to 20,223.98 at the
close in Mumbai, erasing an intraday climb of 0.8 percent. The
gauge has risen for five straight weeks, the longest run of
gains since October.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,  India ’s largest private
lender, declined 1.7 percent, leading financials lower.  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  slumped 2.4 percent, the most in a week.  The Sensex rebounded 11 percent from a seven-month low on
April 9 as foreign investors extended  purchases  amid easing by
central banks from India to  Europe . The 30-stock gauge trades at
13.9 times  forecast 12-month profits , near the highest level
since Oct. 6, compared with a multiple of 10.7 times for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Valuations are expensive,” P. Phani Sekhar, a  fund
manager  at Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai, said by phone today.
“We’ve seen a liquidity-driven rally. We are cautious.”  The Sensex closed on May 17 at its highest level since Jan.
5, 2011. It has risen 4.1 percent this year, the most among
benchmark measures in the BRIC group of the largest emerging
nations. Foreigners purchased a net $227 million of stocks May
16, taking their investment in local stocks  this year  to a net
$13.4 billion, a record for the period and the largest among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, behind  Japan , data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  ICICI Bank lost the most since May 3 to close at 1,209.80
rupees. The stock, which rallied 5.4 percent last week, was the
biggest drag on the Sensex today. ONGC, the nation’s  largest 
explorer, slumped 2.4 percent to 332.70 rupees after climbing
3.7 percent last week.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the nation’s largest
mobile-phone operator, sank 2.5 percent to 307.80 rupees, its
lowest close since April 25.  Earnings Scorecard  Profit at just two of the 17 Sensex companies that have
reported March-quarter  earnings  so far has trailed estimates,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with about 43
percent that missed forecasts in the three months ended Dec. 31,
and 40 percent in the previous two quarters.  The wholesale-price index, a measure of  inflation , rose
4.89 percent in April, the least in 41 months, official data
showed last week. That prompted  Reserve Bank  of India Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao to say the data will be taken into account at
the June 17 policy meeting. The RBI reduced interest  rates  this
month to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent, joining policy makers in
 Australia , Europe and  South Korea  in cutting funding costs to
support growth.  India’s record current-account gap, along with elevated
consumer prices, has deterred the RBI from reducing rates at a
faster pace even as growth in  Asia ’s third-largest economy
slowed to a decade-low of 5 percent in the year ended March,
according to an estimate from the government.  The 50-stock  CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange
of India Ltd. lost 0.5 percent to 6,156.90, while its May
futures traded at 6,173.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
