Cattle futures rebounded from a 10-month low on signs of increasing U.S. demand for beef. Hogs also
rose.  As of May 17, wholesale  beef  rose for the fifth straight
week, the longest rally since July 2011, to a record $2.0951 a
pound, the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.
Meatpackers processed an estimated 652,000 head of cattle last
week, up 3.3 percent from a week earlier, government data show.  “The big change in the last couple of weeks is the beef
packing processing margins, which are quite fabulous,”  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial Services in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview. “In the past, they’ve demonstrated
the ability to fire up when they have profits like this and
front run each other to buy cattle.”  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.18675 a pound at 11:23 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price fell as much as 0.6 percent to
$1.17825, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 12.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.2
percent to $1.4315 a pound. Earlier, the price touched $1.42325,
the lowest since April 12.  Hog futures for July settlement climbed 0.6 percent to 91.5
cents a pound. Through May 17, the price climbed 6.1 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
