Corn climbed a second day before a
government report that will show whether farmers in the U.S.,
the biggest grower, accelerated planting after the slowest start
in the Midwest in three decades boosted supply concerns.  Corn for July delivery gained as much as 1.1 percent to
$6.5975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$6.5875 by 9:56 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices climbed 2.6 percent
last week and are up 1.4 percent this month.  Wet, cold weather has meant 28 percent of the crop was  sown 
in the first 19 weeks of 2013, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said May 13. That’s the lowest since at least 1980,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The USDA is set to
release its crop progress report today. Stockpiles will total
19.29 million metric tons in the year that ends Aug. 31, down 23
percent from a year earlier, after the worst U.S. drought since
the 1930s cut output, USDA data show.  “The real strength is in the old crop and concerns around
old-crop tightness,” said  Michael Pitts , a commodity sales
director at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. There are
“concerns around if there’s going to be enough old crop
availability until the new crop harvest comes in,” he said.  Soybeans for July delivery gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$14.54 a bushel, the highest since March 28, before trading at
$14.52. Wheat gained 0.6 percent to $6.87 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
