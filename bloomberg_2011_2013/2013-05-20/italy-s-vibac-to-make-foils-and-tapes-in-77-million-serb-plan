Vibac SpA, an Italian maker of
packaging materials, will start a plant in  Serbia  next year as
the government pledged to subsidize 20 percent of the total
investment to support 300 new jobs.  Vibac’s 60 million-euro ($77 million), 40,000 square-meter
plant in the central Serbian town of Jagodina will make adhesive
tapes and packaging foils worth about 150 million euros a year
for the Russian, U.S. Canadian and EU markets, the Finance and
Economy Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
