West Texas Intermediate crude snapped
a three-day gain. Syrian government forces started an offensive
against rebels, renewing concern that conflict may destabilize
the Middle East.  Futures declined in New York after rising for a third day
on May 17. Government forces retook most of the strategic city
of Al-Qusair in central Syria, state-run SANA news agency said.
 Iraq  resumed crude exports via  Turkey  after a bomb attack
targeted an oil pipeline on May 17. Hedge funds and other money
managers raised  bullish bets  on Brent to their highest level in
six weeks, according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  “Syria is a microcosm of the unrest across the Middle East
and could spread to other countries,” said  Christopher Bellew ,
a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in London.  WTI for June delivery dropped as much as 69 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $95.33 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $95.50 at 12:42 p.m. London
time. The more-active July future slid 53 cents to $95.47.
Front-month prices increased 86 cents to $96.02 on May 17, the
highest close since May 10.  Brent for July settlement dropped 53 cents to $104.13 a
barrel on the London-based ICE exchange. The front-month
European benchmark was at a premium of $8.37 to WTI, up from
$8.35 on May 17.  ‘Civilian Massacre’  The main opposition movement, the National Syrian
Coalition, warned in a statement yesterday that there may be a
“civilian massacre” in Al-Qusair. It said President Bashar al-Assad’s troops have leveled homes with artillery and rocket
fire, while the air force provided cover for Hezbollah fighters.  “Traders always get nervous when these kinds of things are
going on, as Middle East tension plays on prices,” said Robin Mills, the head of consulting at Dubai-based Manaar Energy
Consulting and Project Management. “If fighting in  Syria  spills
over into Iraq and interrupts production there, that would be
problematic.”  Brent’s rally is stalling as prices approach technical
resistance along the 50-day moving average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures halted an intraday advance on May
17 near this indicator, around $105.05 a barrel today. Sell
orders tend to be clustered close to chart resistance levels.  OPEC Exports  Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, shipped 7.42 million barrels a
day in March, down 30,000 barrels from February, figures
published yesterday from the Joint Organizations Data Initiative
show.  Angola  and Nigeria both increased shipments, with Angola
exporting 1.74 million barrels a day, up from 1.59 million, to
the highest in three years, according to the data.  Speculative bets that Brent prices will rise, in futures
and options combined, outnumbered short positions by 130,219
lots in the week ended May 14, ICE said today in its weekly
Commitment of Traders report. The gain of 6,184 contracts, or 5
percent, is a third straight weekly increase and brings net-long
positions to the highest since April 2.  Money managers increased  net-long positions , or wagers on
higher prices, in WTI by 606 futures and options combined, or
0.3 percent, to 205,140, in the seven days ended May 14,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s May 17
Commitments of Traders report. It was the third weekly gain.  To contact the reporters on this story
