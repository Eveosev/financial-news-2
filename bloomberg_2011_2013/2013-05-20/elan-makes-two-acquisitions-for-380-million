Elan Corp. (ELN)  acquired AOP Orphan
Pharmaceuticals AG for 263.5 million euros ($340 million),
expanding its business into medicines for rare diseases as it
resists a takeover bid from Royalty Pharma.  The purchase of Vienna-based AOP Orphan is the second
acquisition this month. Elan also bought a 48 percent stake in
Dubai-based NewBridge Pharmaceuticals for $40 million, and plans
to issue $800 million in debt to take advantage of attractive
 interest rates , the company said in a statement today.  More acquisitions will be announced over the next six to 18
months, Chief Executive Officer Kelly Martin said in an
interview. The Dublin-based company is resisting a takeover bid
of about $5.7 billion by Royalty Pharma. Elan made a $1 billion
investment in  Theravance Inc. (THRX) ’s royalties this month.  “We still see very significant opportunities in terms of
molecules, geographic businesses and commercial products,”
Martin said. With the additional debt capital, “we will have
plenty of powder to spend over the next six to 18 months.”  AOP Orphan had 59 million euros in revenue in 2012, mostly
in central and eastern Europe. The company has four experimental
drugs in late-stage testing in hematology, cancer,  heart disease 
and lung disease.  NewBridge, focused on Africa, the Middle East and Turkey,
specializes in “in-licensing, acquiring, registering and
commercializing approved pharmaceuticals and biologics
products,” Elan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
