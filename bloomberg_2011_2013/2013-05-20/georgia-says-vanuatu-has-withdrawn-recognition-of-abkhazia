The Pacific island nation of  Vanuatu 
withdrew its recognition of Georgia’s breakaway region of
Abkhazia, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s
administration said today on its Facebook Inc. page.  Vanuatu, which lies about 1,500 miles northeast of Sydney,
had become the fifth country to recognize Abkhazia’s
independence, agreeing to set up diplomatic relations with the
self-declared republic in 2011.  Abkhazia and  South Ossetia , another separatist region of
Georgia, declared independence after a five-day war between
Russia and the former Soviet republic in August, 2008. Only
Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Nauru, another country in the
South Pacific, recognize their independence. Georgia maintains
Russia occupied the two regions after the conflict.  Vanuatu’s Department of  Foreign Affairs  and Trade didn’t
answer the phone when contacted by Bloomberg outside of office
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
