Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co. (ALARKAN)  declined the most in more than four months after the board
of the Saudi developer recommended not to distribute a dividend
for last year.  The shares fell 4.7 percent, the most since January 8, to
9.1 riyals at 12:39 p.m. in  Riyadh , making it the biggest
decliner on the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index. About 56.7
million Dar Al Arkan shares traded, or 2.9 times the three-month
daily average. The stock had gained 14 percent in the previous
two trading days. The Tadawul index gained 0.3 percent.  “Retail investors will not like” the lack of a dividend,
said Tariq Qaqish, head of asset management at Dubai-based Al
Mal Capital PSC. Given the gains in the previous two days “we
should expect profit taking.”  Dar Al Arkan also said today it plans to sell dollar-denominated Islamic bonds to fund projects and the issue would
be the first of a series over the next 12 months. First-quarter
profit at the biggest publicly traded Saudi property company by
assets declined 19 percent, missing analyst estimates, it said
last month.  The shares have gained 10 percent this year, outperforming
a 7.6 percent increase in the Tadawul. Seven  analysts  have a buy
rating on the stock, while six recommend investors hold the
shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
