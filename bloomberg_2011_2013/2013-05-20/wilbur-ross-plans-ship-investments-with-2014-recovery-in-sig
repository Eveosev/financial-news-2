Wilbur Ross , the billionaire founder
of WL Ross & Co., said he intends to add to his shipping
investments as slowing growth of the merchant fleet spurs an
industry recovery as soon as next year.  Ross was among investors who bought a fleet of 30 tankers
hauling gasoline and diesel two years ago in a $900 million
transaction. His company also has a majority stake in  Navigator
Holdings Ltd. (NVIGF) , which controls one-third of the world’s mid-sized
carriers of liquefied petroleum gas.  “We’re going to do a lot more in shipping even than we
have,” New York-based Ross said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse” today. “Shipping has a great
oversupply of vessels that came from over-ordering a few years
back. We think 2014 may be when it turns around.”  Expansion of the merchant fleet will slow to about 3.6
percent next year, the lowest growth since at least 2009,
according to data from Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest
shipbroker. There were about 20 percent more vessels than
cargoes across the industry in March, the biggest glut since the
early 1980s, according to Clarkson.  “We’ve actually been quite happy with our shipping
investments so far,” Ross said.  One-year charters for 20,500-cubic-meter semi-refrigerated
gas carriers like those operated by Navigator rose 15 percent in
the past year to $905,000 a month, within 5 percent of the 2008
record, according to Clarkson data. Spot rates for the largest
LPG carriers jumped 47 percent this month to $70.50 a metric
ton, the highest since September, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , the London-based publisher of shipping costs.  Daily earnings for product tankers hauling 37,000 tons of
gasoline to the U.S. from  Europe , the benchmark route for the
type of ship Ross bought in 2011, rose 16 percent this year to
$13,647, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
