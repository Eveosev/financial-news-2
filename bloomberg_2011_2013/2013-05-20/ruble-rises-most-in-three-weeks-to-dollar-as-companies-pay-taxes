The ruble climbed the most in three
weeks as Russian companies converted export revenue into local
currency to pay taxes.  The Russian currency strengthened 0.6 percent against the
dollar to 31.2410, the largest increase on a closing basis since
April 29. The ruble climbed 0.4 percent against Bank Rossii’s
basket of dollars and euros to 35.2810. The yield on benchmark
OFZ bonds due February 2027 was unchanged at 6.94 percent by 1
p.m. in Moscow.  Russian companies will probably pay about 200 billion
rubles ($6.4 billion) of taxes today, according to Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at ING Groep NV in Moscow. A further
100 billion rubles are due May 27 with 200 billion rubles of
corporate income tax to be paid on May 28, OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  analyst
Vladimir Kolychev said by e-mail.  “The market remains sensitive to export flows,” Kolychev
said.  Brent oil declined 0.3 percent to $104.31 per barrel in
 London , snapping three days of gains. Oil and natural gas
contribute about half of  Russia ’s budget revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
