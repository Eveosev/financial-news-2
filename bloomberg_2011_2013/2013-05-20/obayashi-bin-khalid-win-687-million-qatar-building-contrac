Obayashi Corp. (1802) ,  Japan ’s biggest
builder by market value, and Hamad Bin Khalid Contracting won a
a 2.5 billion riyal ($687 million) contract to redevelop
properties in the center of  Qatar ’s capital, Doha.  Msheireb Properties, which is building a 20 billion-riyal
development of the same name, commissioned the construction of
11 residential buildings, two office blocks and 84 shops in
addition to a hotel and mosque, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Qatar, holder of the world’s third-largest natural gas
reserves, is investing in infrastructure and development as it
prepares to host the 2022 World Cup soccer tournament. The Gulf
nation, with the world’s highest per capita income, is planning
to spend $200 billion on projects including roads, air-conditioned stadiums and a metro line. It’s also aiming to
provide housing for a population projected to climb by about 50
percent to 2.6 million by 2030.  Msheireb, which covers 350,000 square meters (3.8 million
square feet), is owned and initially financed by state-controlled  Qatar Foundation , which is headed by the Qatari
Emir’s wife, Sheikha Mozah Nasser bint Nasser Al-Missned.  The development is being built in four phases, the company
said today. The third phase will include 350 homes and 20,000
square meters of retail space. The hotel will include 187 rooms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
