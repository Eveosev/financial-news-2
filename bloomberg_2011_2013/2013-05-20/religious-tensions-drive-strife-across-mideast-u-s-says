Sectarian tensions that are tearing
apart  Syria  and driving violence in Iraq are evident across the
Middle East as Sunni and Shiite Muslims clash, according to a
report on religious freedom by the U.S. State Department.  The report was released today shortly after a car bombing
killed 13 people in a Shiite neighborhood in  Baghdad , the latest
in a wave of attacks in Shiite neighborhoods that have left an
estimated 70 dead. In Syria, the regime is an offshoot of the
Shiite sect, while three-quarters of the country’s 22 million
people are Sunni.  The International Religious Freedom Report for 2012,
mandated by Congress, details the state of religious freedom in
almost 200 countries. These include U.S. allies such as Saudi
Arabia, which is cited for beheading someone for “sorcery,”
and nations the Obama administration wants to cooperate with,
such as  Russia , which is cited for targeting religious
minorities.  The report says anti-Semitism continues to increase, and
anti-Muslim rhetoric and actions are “clearly on the rise” in
Asia and Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
