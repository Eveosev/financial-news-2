Crude from the Bakken shale formation
weakened against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate after
monthly production hit a record in March and rig counts for
 North Dakota  rose.  Bakken fell $2.75 a barrel to a discount of $5.75 a barrel
below WTI at 12:13 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The number of drilling rigs in North Dakota increased to
179 from 176 last week,  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  said on May 17. The
state Mineral Resources Department’s website today showed  190
rigs . Crude production increased 0.5 percent to 718,791 barrels
a day in March, the state Industrial Commission said May 15.  “We’ve been setting new records fairly regularly,” said
Monte Besler, owner of Williston, North Dakota-based hydraulic
fracturing consulting firm FRACN8R.  Oils produced in the Gulf Coast weakened against WTI. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet shrank by 20 cents a barrel to a premium of
$9.85 a barrel over WTI, and Light Louisiana Sweet was unchanged
at a $10.85 premium.  Southern Green Canyon lost 25 cents a barrel to a $2.25
premium over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium fell 5 cents to $4.65 a barrel over WTI
and Mars Blend fell 15 cents to $4.85.  Thunder Horse  slipped 25
cents to a premium of $7.35 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
