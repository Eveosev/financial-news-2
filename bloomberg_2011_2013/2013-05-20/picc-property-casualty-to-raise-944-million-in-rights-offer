PICC Property & Casualty Co. (2328) , China’s
biggest non-life insurer, plans to raise 5.8 billion  yuan  ($944
million) in a rights offer in  Hong Kong  and China to help meet
 capital requirements .  The company will offer 1.1 new shares for every 10 existing
shares held, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday. PICC said it will price the Hong Kong-listed shares
at HK$5.38 each, a 47 percent discount to yesterday’s close, and
the domestic shares at 4.30 yuan each.  The proceeds “will be used to strengthen the capital base
of the company and to improve its solvency margin,” PICC said
in the statement. The Beijing-based company plans to issue
418.2 million H shares and 930 million domestic shares,
according to the filing.  Cash flows at China’s life insurers will be squeezed this
year by customers canceling contracts out of frustration with
low returns and an increase in maturing policies, according to
analysts at BoCom International Holdings Co. and  Capital
Securities Corp. (6005)  The China Insurance Regulatory Commission said
last month that it will strengthen oversight of solvency.  People’s Insurance Company Group of China Ltd. , PICC’s
parent, will pay 3.99 billion yuan for all of PICC’s domestic
rights shares, keeping its stake in the company’s issued stock
at 69 percent, according to a separate Hong Kong exchange filing
yesterday. PICC’s yuan-denominated shares aren’t listed,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  American International Group Inc. will subscribe for
HK$718.1 million ($92.5 million) of PICC shares to keep its
stake at 9.9 percent, according to a statement on the New York-based insurer’s website.  PICC  rose  1.2 percent to HK$10.20 in Hong Kong yesterday,
before the announcement. The stock has dropped 6.1 percent this
year, compared with the Hang Seng Index’s 3.7 percent gain.
People’s Insurance, also based in Beijing, was unchanged at
HK$4.08 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
