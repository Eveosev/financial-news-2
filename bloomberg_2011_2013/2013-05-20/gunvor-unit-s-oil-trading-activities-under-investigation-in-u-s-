A subsidiary of Gunvor Group Ltd.,
the independent energy trader, was served a subpoena by the U.S.
Attorney’s office in April 2011 for documents relating to its
oil-trading activities.  Castor Americas Inc., a Delaware-incorporated member of the
group, and three of its staff received subpoenas, Gunvor said in
a preliminary bond prospectus obtained by  Bloomberg News . A
Gunvor employee was also served.  In a separate investigation, the offices of oil companies
 BP Plc (BP/) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  and energy pricing
service Platts were visited last week by European Union
inspectors over allegations they “colluded in reporting
distorted prices” to manipulate the published prices of crude,
oil products and biofuels, according to the European Commission
in Brussels. Gunvor is privately held by billionaires Gennady Timchenko and Torbjorn Tornqvist and does not regularly disclose
its financial information.  While the Department of Justice “has not served any
additional subpoenas to any companies or employees of Gunvor,
Gunvor continues to cooperate,” according to the prospectus.  Seth Pietras, a Geneva-based spokesman for Gunvor, declined
to comment on the subpoenas when contacted by telephone. Gunvor
acquired Castor in 2009. Platts is a unit of  McGraw Hill
Financial Inc. (MHFI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
