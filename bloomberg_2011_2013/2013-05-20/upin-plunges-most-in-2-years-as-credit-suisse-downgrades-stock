Lupin Ltd. (LPC)  is poised for its biggest
drop in more than two years after brokerages including Credit
Suisse Group AG cut their recommendation on the stock of the
drugmaker controlled by Indian billionaire Desh Bandhu Gupta.  The  shares  slumped 4.6 percent to 766.55 rupees at 1:22
p.m. in Mumbai, heading for their steepest decline since Jan.
28, 2011. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.5 percent. Mumbai-based Lupin was downgraded to neutral from outperform at Credit
Suisse, while IIFL analyst Bino Pathiparampil lowered his
recommendation to reduce from add. The stock closed at a record
806.9 rupees on May 15.  Competition will intensify for Lupin after Mylan Inc.
started sales of the generic form of TriCor, an anti-cholesterol
drug, which accounts for about 20 percent of the Indian
drugmaker’s profit, Credit Suisse analysts Anubhav Aggarwal and
Chunky Shah wrote in a note to clients today.  Lupin’s will see “slowing earnings momentum” over the
next two years after the entry of Mylan last week with generic
TriCor, Aggarwal and Shah wrote in the report. High dependence
on two products, TriCor and antibiotic Suprax, make the “risk-reward appear unfavorable,” they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
