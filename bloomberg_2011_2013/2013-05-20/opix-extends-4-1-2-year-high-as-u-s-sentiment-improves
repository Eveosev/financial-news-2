Japanese shares gained for a second
day, with the  Topix Index (TPX)  extending a 4 1/2-year high, as
utilities climbed on optimism nuclear power plants may be
restarted and Nippon Yusen KK and  Osaka Gas (9532)  Co. advanced on
prospects for U.S. shale gas imports.  Osaka Gas added 4.2 percent after the U.S. conditionally
approved exports of liquefied natural gas from a plant partly
owned by the company. Nippon Yusen, the world’s largest publicly
traded operator of ships that carry the fuel, surged 11 percent
after a record gain in cargo rates.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) 
jumped 16 percent after the Yomiuri newspaper reported it and
other utilities will apply to restart reactors. Tepco said
nothing has been decided.  “Even though the company is denying the report, investors
are increasingly optimistic that nuclear power plants will
restart,” said  Yoshihiro Okumura , a general manager at Chiba-Gin Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “The U.S. LNG export story
is also a positive.”  The Topix advanced 1.3 percent to close at 1,269.51 in
Tokyo, the highest since Aug. 12, 2008. More than two shares
gained for each that fell. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.5
percent to 15,360.81, with volume about 21 percent higher than
the 30-day average.  The Topix has risen 48 percent this year, outperforming all
major equity indexes amid unprecedented easing from the  Bank of
Japan . The gauge traded at 1.3 times book value, compared with
about 2.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.7 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Toyota, Sony  Exporters gained as an index of U.S. leading indicators
climbed in April and  consumer confidence  rose to the highest
level in almost six years. Toyota Motor Corp., which counts
 North America  as its largest market, advanced 1.9 percent to
6,590 yen. Sony Corp. jumped 5.7 percent 2,162 yen.  Japanese stocks also rose today after Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe last week vowed to increase private investment to the level
before the 2008 financial crisis and triple infrastructure
exports as part of his strategy to overcome deflation.  Shipping companies and utilities led  gains  among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups.  Osaka Gas jumped 4.2 percent to 477 yen, its highest close
since December 2007, after the U.S. Energy Department
conditionally approved exports from the Freeport LNG project to
countries that don’t have free-trade agreements with the U.S.  The development, partly owned by ConocoPhillips, Dow
Chemical Co. and Osaka Gas, must still win approval from the
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .  Shale Gas  Shippers gained after LNG cargo rates jumped 28 percent
last week, the largest weekly gain on record as surging U.S.
exports of the cooking fuel and chemicals feedstock strains
vessel supply. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd.,  Japan ’s second- and third-biggest shipping lines,
increased 7.6 percent and 6 percent.  Nippon Yusen (9101) , the No. 1, surged 11 percent to 295 yen, its
biggest gain since Oct. 2008. The shipping company last week
agreed to take a one-third stake in a U.S. LNG export facility
with trading companies Mitsui & Co. and Mitsubishi Corp.  Mitsui & Co. advanced 4 percent to 1,472 yen, while
Mitsubishi gained 1.7 percent to 1,925 yen.  Tokyo Electric led utilities higher after the Yomiuri
newspaper reported yesterday that Tepco and four other power
producers will file to restart nuclear plants in July.
Separately, Japan’s economy minister Akira Amari said on public
broadcaster NHK yesterday that restarting reactors was a
possible way to lower the cost of rising fuel imports amid the
yen’s weakness.  Reactor Restarts  Tepco, operator of the wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
nuclear plant, surged 16 percent to 726 yen, extending its
advance since the start of December to more than 400 percent.
Kansai Electric Power Co. jumped 7.5 percent to 1,447 yen.  The Topix Electric Power & Gas Index jumped 5.9 percent to
its highest level since March 25, 2011. The gauge has risen 44
percent so far this quarter, the second-biggest gain among
industry groups after securities firms, which have advanced 58
percent.  Builders of nuclear  power plants  and suppliers of reactor
parts jumped today after the Nikkei newspaper reported Japan and
 India  will resume atomic energy talks that collapsed after the
Fukushima disaster.  Japan Steel Works Ltd., which forges reactor containment
vessels, surged 16 percent to 723 yen. Toshiba Corp., a builder
of power plants, rose 4.6 percent to 545 yen.  Sharp Corp. rose 17 percent to 552 yen to lead gains on the
Nikkei 225. The display maker extended its advance for the year
