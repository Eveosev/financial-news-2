The U.K. government laid out rules
for steelmakers and ceramics companies to claim as much as 113
million pounds ($172 million) in compensation for the extra
power costs caused by the European carbon market.  Eligible companies classed as energy-intensive users will
be able to apply starting June 3 for aid to cover electricity
costs, the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The cash is part of a wider fund totaling 250 million
pounds that is also intended to compensate for the cost of the
government’s minimum price for carbon emissions. The cash was
allocated in 2011 after the Confederation of British Industry
said carbon pricing may lead units of Tata Steel Ltd. and
chemicals maker Ineos Group Holdings Plc to fail.  “It is essential that as we put in place policies to
generate the necessary investment in energy infrastructure we do
not undermine the competitiveness of U.K. industry,” Business
and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said in the statement. “This
compensation package will support firms, protect jobs and help
reduce the risk of industries leaving.”  Companies have until the end of July to apply for
compensation for costs incurred since Jan. 1, the department
said. Compensation for the carbon floor price is currently being
examined by the European Commission to ensure it meets state aid
rules, and details will be announced later in the year, it said.  The aid package is aimed at covering costs through the tax
year ending in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
