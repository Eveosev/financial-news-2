Turkey ’s bond yields rebounded from a
record low on investor expectations the lira’s longest losing
streak in 11 years will dissuade the central bank from cutting
interest rates.  Yields on two-year benchmark notes rose 14 basis points,
the most on a closing basis since March 19, to 4.93 percent at
the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul. The rate fell to a record 4.79
percent on May 17. The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to
1.8465 a dollar, set for its lowest level since June 4. The lira
is heading for an eighth day of declines, its longest stretch of
losses since May 2002.  The currency slid 2.9 percent this month as the central
bank cut  interest rates  by a larger-than-expected 50 basis
points after the regulator’s preferred currency measurement,
known as REER, rose to 121.10 last month. That’s the highest
level since January 2011 and above the 120 threshold at which
the monetary authority says it would consider the currency
overvalued.  “If the weakening in the lira accelerates and brings the
REER below 120, then the possibility of a rate cut will
disappear,” Onder Turker, a fixed-income trader at Finansbank
AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Turkey to investment
grade last week, fueling bets the central bank may cut rates
further to slow a surge in capital inflows. The central bank
lent 200 million liras ($108 million) in its one-week repurchase
agreements auction today at 4.5 percent, the minimum it can
offer in a day.  Erkin Isik, a fixed-income strategist at  Turk Ekonomi
Bankasi AS (TEBNK) , estimates the current level of REER is 118.5. “The
central bank is lowering the excess liquidity,” Isik said in e-mailed comments.  Three-month volatility for the lira rose to 5.47 percent
from 5.44 percent on May 17, the lowest among major  emerging
markets  in  Europe , the Middle East and  Africa , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Lira forwards show the currency will weaken to 1.89 a
dollar by end of the year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It will reach 1.8850 in December, according to
currency futures traded in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
