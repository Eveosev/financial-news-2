Chinese teenage golfer Tianlang Guan
will play in next week’s Memorial Tournament, his third U.S. PGA
Tour event since making the two-round cut at last month’s
 Masters Tournament .  Guan, a 14-year-old amateur, failed to advance to weekend
play at last week’s Byron Nelson Championship with rounds of 70
and 77.  He finished 71st at the New Orleans tournament on April 28,
two weeks after becoming the youngest player to appear in a
major golf championship in 148 years at the Masters. He was the
only one of six amateurs to make the 36-hole cut and advance to
the final two rounds at Augusta National Golf Club.  “This young man has a wonderful future,” Memorial host
 Jack Nicklaus  said in a statement on the event’s  website . “For
the growth of the game internationally, he is a role model for
all aspiring Asian amateurs, as well as young boys and girls
around the globe, so it is only appropriate to give him another
opportunity to compete on a world-class stage.”  An eighth-grade student, Guan is ranked 78th in the World
Amateur Golf Rankings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
