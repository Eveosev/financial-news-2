Brazil ’s economy will grow below 3
percent in 2013, economists predicted for the first time in a
central bank survey of about 100 analysts published today.  Latin America ’s largest economy will grow 2.98 percent this
year, down from the previous week’s projection of 3 percent. It
would be the first time in a decade that Brazil grows below 3
percent for three consecutive years.  Brazil’s economy has struggled to recover from last year’s
expansion of 0.9 percent as accelerating inflation undermines
consumer demand. While economists raised their 12-month
 inflation  forecast to 5.64 percent from 5.57 percent, they
maintained their projection for inflation this year and next at
5.8 percent, according to the survey.  The central bank raised the benchmark  interest rate  in
April to 7.5 percent after keeping it at a record low 7.25
percent since October. Economists project GDP will accelerate to
3.5 percent next year.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government is trying to boost
investments in infrastructure and is reducing taxes as it seeks
to accelerate growth without further stoking inflation.  Economists expect policy makers will lift the Selic rate to
8.25 percent by year-end in a bid to slow inflation that is
close to the upper end of the 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target
range. Inflation slowed to 6.49 percent in April.  “The central bank is vigilant and will do what’s needed,
in a timely way, to put inflation in a declining trend in the
second half, and to ensure that that trend will continue next
year,” central bank President Alexandre Tombini said May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
