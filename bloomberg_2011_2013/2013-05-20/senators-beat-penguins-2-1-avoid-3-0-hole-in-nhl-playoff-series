The  Ottawa Senators  beat the
Pittsburgh Penguins 2-1 in double overtime to avoid falling
behind three-games-to-none in their National Hockey League
playoff series.  Colin Greening scored in the second overtime in Ottawa
after Daniel Alfredssonâ€™s short-handed goal with 29 seconds left
in the third period had tied it for the Senators.  Ottawa will host Game 4 on May 22.  The Boston Bruins beat the New York Rangers 5-2 earlier
today to take a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinal.  Johnny Boychuck scored to snap a 2-2 tie midway through the
second period in Boston, while Brad Marchand and Milan Lucic
added third-period goals for the fourth-seeded Bruins.  After two games in  Boston , the series moves to New York for
Game 3 on May 21.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
