Copper dropped for the first time in
three days on speculation that  China  will continue to curb its
 property market , reducing demand from the world’s biggest
consumer. Tin, lead and zinc also fell.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to $7,260 a metric ton and
was at $7,265 at 10:45 a.m. in  Tokyo . The metal retreated 1
percent last week. Futures for delivery in July on the Comex
were down 0.8 percent at $3.2970 per pound.  China’s new-home prices rose last month in 68 of 70 cities
tracked by the government, indicating Premier  Li Keqiang  will
need to maintain efforts to cool the property market even as
economic growth slows. The nation’s policy makers are trying to
avoid property bubbles and make homes more affordable while
bolstering an economy that lost steam in the  first quarter .  “Any measures to cool down China’s property market would
be negative for metals,” Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea
Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. An increase in LME
stockpiles and an outflow of funds to stock markets also weighed
on copper, he said.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME rose 0.9 percent to
629,950 tons, the highest since Aug. 20, 2003, data from the
bourse showed on May 17.  Inventories of refined copper monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange fell to 190,330 tons last week, the lowest
since October, data showed. The contract for September delivery
on the bourse fell 0.9 percent to 52,520  yuan  ($8,553) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
