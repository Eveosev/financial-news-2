Euro adoption would give the  Czech
Republic  better protection against market speculators such as
billionaire  George Soros , President Milos Zeman said.  A majority of entrepreneurs Zeman has met see membership in
the euro area as beneficial for their businesses and the country
that joined the European Union in 2004 should be technically
ready to adopt the common currency in five years, he said at a
conference in Prague today.  “A national currency is much more at risk of attacks by
speculators, such as Soros, than a strong currency, such as the
euro, dollar, and maybe the yen,” Zeman said.  The Czech Republic, now in the longest recession since
records began in 1996, doesn’t have a projected date for joining
the euro. Premier Petr Necas has said the country will have to
hold a referendum on joining  Europe ’s monetary union because the
debt crisis is changing conditions for euro users.  In 1992, Soros and his then-chief strategist Stan Druckenmiller made a $10 billion wager that the  Bank of England 
would be forced to devalue the pound, a trade that netted $1
billion.  Soros’s Quantum hedge fund gained about 20 percent a year
on average since 1969, before he decided in 2011 to return money
to outside clients. The fund now only manages assets for Soros
and his family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
