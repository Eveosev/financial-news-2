Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , the container-terminal arm of China’s largest shipping group, agreed to sell
its stake in the world’s largest shipping-container manufacturer
to its parent for $1.22 billion.  The company will sell Cosco Container Industries Ltd., the
major asset of which is its 21.8 percent holding in  China
International Marine Containers Group Co. (2039) , to a unit of China
Ocean Shipping Group Co., according to a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday.  The sale allows the company to “realize a return on its
investment in CIMC” and to “redeploy its resources into
business which are expected to create enhanced value to
shareholders” and aid profitability, Cosco Pacific said.  Cosco Pacific’s first-quarter net income fell 14 percent
from a year earlier to $66.1 million as operating costs from the
terminal business increased. CIMC’s quarterly  profit  fell to
219.4 million  yuan  ($35.7 million) from 375.3 million yuan a
year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The deal is subject to approval by the independent
shareholders of both Cosco Pacific and immediate controlling
shareholder China Cosco Holdings Ltd., according to yesterday’s
filing.  Cosco Pacific rose 3.6 percent, the  biggest gain  since Jan.
3, to close at HK$10.80 in Hong Kong yesterday, before the
announcement. China Cosco advanced 2.7 percent to HK$3.42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
