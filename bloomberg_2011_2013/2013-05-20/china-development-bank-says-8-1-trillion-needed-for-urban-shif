China  needs at least 50 trillion yuan
($8.1 trillion) in new investment by 2020 to accommodate a
burgeoning population of city-dwellers, according to the
president of  China Development Bank .  China must urgently find special financing channels to
support the urbanization process because local governments can’t
afford the spending, Zheng Zhijie, the bank’s president, wrote
in an article in the May 16 issue of China Finance, a journal
run by the  People’s Bank of China . Zheng didn’t elaborate on the
estimate, which is about equal to the nation’s nominal gross
domestic product in 2012.  The figure shows the extent to which China will need to
come up with funds for roads and benefits as part of Premier  Li Keqiang ’s efforts to make urbanization a key engine of growth.
China Development Bank, the world’s largest policy lender,
created the the nation’s system of local financing for
infrastructure projects.  “In the coming 20 years, China’s urbanization ratio will
increase by another 20 to 30 percentage points,” with another
300 million to 400 million people moving into cities, Zheng
said. “By then, China will have more than 1 billion people
living in cities -- the number will be larger than the
population of all industrialized countries combined.”  The 50 trillion yuan is necessary to bring the urban
population share to 60 percent by 2020 and increase benefits for
the almost 200 million migrant workers already living in cities,
Zheng wrote.  At the end of last year, 52.6 percent of China’s  population 
lived in urban areas, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics, after becoming a majority in 2011. China’s fixed-asset investment excluding rural households was 36.5 trillion
 yuan  in 2012, according to government data.  CDB has already made 6 trillion yuan in loans to finance
China’s urbanization process, with 3.4 trillion yuan of
outstanding loans at the end of 2012 directly linked to urban
development programs, or 71 percent of the bank’s total
outstanding loans, Zheng wrote.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
