Carnival Corp. (CCL)  fell the most in more
than 16 months after the world’s largest cruise operator lowered
its forecast for the rest of the year, saying price cuts
undertaken following a series of mishaps will hurt margins.  Carnival  dropped  5.2 percent to $33.47 at 9:45 a.m. in  New
York  and earlier fell 6.8 percent for the biggest intraday
decline since Jan. 17, 2012, after delivering the lower view for
the second half of 2013 yesterday. Before today, the shares had
fallen 3.9 percent this year while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  added  17 percent.  The lower forecast demonstrates the continuing fallout from
several incidents at sea involving ships operated by Miami-based
Carnival that attracted news coverage. They included an engine-room fire on the Triumph in February that left 3,100 passengers
with limited food and toilet service for several days.  Full-year profit will total $1.45 to $1.65 a share,
Carnival said yesterday in a statement. That’s down from a
previous forecast of $1.80 to $2.10. Analysts were projecting
$1.99, the average of 27 estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.  The company began cutting prices to fill cabins, dropping
the fare for some trips in April to as little as $38 a night per
person. While bookings increased, the amount of revenue captured
from each customer has declined, Carnival said yesterday.
Cancellations were also higher than expected, the company said.  Higher fuel and marketing costs, as well as less-favorable
exchange rates, will also crimp profit, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
