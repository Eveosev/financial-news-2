Speco Co. (013810)  led gains among South
Korean defense-related stocks after  North Korea  test-fired four
short-range missiles over the weekend.  Speco, a maker of defense products such as fin stabilizers
and water jets, rose 9.5 percent to 3,640 won at 11:50 a.m. in
Seoul, poised for its biggest gain since April 9.  Victek Co. (065450) , a
manufacturer of electronics warfare equipment, increased 6.6
percent, while Firstec Co., a maker of components for
helicopters and armored vehicles, rose 2.5 percent.  North Korea launched a short-range guided missile into
waters off its eastern coast yesterday afternoon in defiance of
international sanctions and diplomatic efforts to convince the
totalitarian nation to return to talks. The North fired three
more projectiles on May 18.  “The defense-related stocks are definitely rising due to
the ongoing North Korea threats,” said Park Sung Hyun, an
analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities. “They will probably
head back down because the unstable political situation in the
Korean peninsula is unlikely to be sustained in the long term.”  South Korea’s benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  index rose 0.1 percent to
1,988.97.  013810@KS
