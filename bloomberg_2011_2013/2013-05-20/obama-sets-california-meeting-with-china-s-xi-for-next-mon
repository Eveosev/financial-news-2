President  Barack Obama , turning the U.S. strategic focus to Asia, will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in their first face-to-face talks since China’s power transition ended in March.  The meetings June 7 and 8 at the 200-acre Walter and Leonore Annenberg estate in Rancho Mirage,  California  will follow stops by the Chinese leader in Costa Rica, Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago.  Xi’s talks with Obama may be aimed at improving ties strained by U.S. charges that the Chinese government is behind a cyber-espionage campaign, as well as differences over territorial disputes in the region and nuclear and missile tests by North Korea, a Chinese ally of six decades.  “ China  is eager to stabilize the relationship because this is the first year of our president,” Shen Dingli, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in  Shanghai , said by phone. “We need to have a stable peripheral environment in our neighborhood.”  Shen said with growth slowing -- gross domestic product  last year expanded  at 7.8 percent, the lowest rate since 1999 -- China needs to reduce international tensions to focus on the economy.  Obama held 12 face-to-face meetings with Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, over the last four years. Xi met with Obama in  Washington  last year when he was still vice president.  Review Progress  Obama and Xi “will review progress and challenges in U.S.- China relations over the past four years and discuss ways to enhance cooperation, while constructively managing our differences, in the years ahead,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement.  The U.S. president, who visited China in November 2009, said in his first term that he was looking to pivot American foreign policy toward Asia after a decade where the focus was on the Middle East following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  Trade and economic issues between the world’s two biggest economies have dominated past summits. The  yuan  has gained more than 10 percent against the dollar since Obama took office, making U.S. exports to China cheaper. The currency advanced to near a 19-year high today as the People’s Bank of China strengthened its reference rate to 6.1911 per dollar, the strongest since a peg to the greenback ended in July 2005.  Regional Issues  Now, the focus is on cyber security and regional issues, as the U.S. tries to persuade Chinese leaders to restrain North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. The Pentagon this month accused China for the first time of a cyber-espionage campaign, saying the country’s military has targeted U.S. government computers with intrusions that seek sensitive data.  Speaking at a briefing today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the U.S. has no hard evidence that China is behind cyber attacks. He said cyber-security is an issue faced by both countries.  “China and the U.S. have some differences and problems which need proper handling and active management,” Hong said. “The healthy development of China-U.S. relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries as well as the peaceful development of the whole world.”  Obama’s National Security adviser Tom Donilon will travel to Beijing May 26-28, Carney said in the statement.  In a March speech, Donilon said China’s campaign of cyber-espionage threatens to derail Obama’s goal of improving ties. He warned that it was time to hold the country accountable for “a growing challenge” to economic relations.  Very Serious  Secretary of State John Kerry met last month in Beijing with officials including Xi and said afterward that China is “very serious” about trying to bring North Korea in line. Kerry asked Xi to make a greater effort to enforce United Nations sanctions and urged China, which provides North Korea with fuel and consumer goods, to toughen its message to leaders in Pyongyang.  Xi will visit Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and  Mexico  on May 31-June 6, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang.  The visit to Mexico may include announcements on Chinese investments, helping to repair a relationship hampered by economic competition as both countries seek export markets in the U.S. and other countries, said Matt Ferchen, a scholar at Beijing’s Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy who focuses on China’s ties with Latin America.  “Without a doubt the most dysfunctional relationship China has had with a major Latin American country has been with Mexico,” Ferchen said by phone. “The economic relationship is one of a great deal of competition in which Mexico has been losing out.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:  Julianna Goldman  in Washington at  jgoldman6@bloomberg.net ; Michael Forsythe in Beijing at  mforsythe@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Rosalind Mathieson at  rmathieson3@bloomberg.net
