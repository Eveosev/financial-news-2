U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened for
a fourth day, falling to the  lowest level  in almost six weeks,
after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  completed a restart of its Sweeny, Texas,
refinery. Crack spreads widened.  The  247,000-barrel-a-day Sweeny plant  is operational after
a  power failure  caused the plant to temporarily shut down and
flare gases on May 11, according to  Rich Johnson , a company
spokesman based in Houston.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
weakened 1.75 cent to  22.25 cents  a gallon versus futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:58 a.m., the lowest level
since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, dropped 0.75 cent to
a premium of 0.25 cent a gallon.  Supplies of motor fuel in the region, known as PADD 3,
gained 1.78 million barrels to  74.4 million barrels  in the week
ended May 10, a second consecutive weekly advance, according to
U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Stockpiles of
distillate fuel rose 3.36 million barrels to 39.7 million, the
 biggest  increase since 2008.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel on the Gulf Coast slipped 0.25
cent to a discount of 5.25 cents to futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , dropped 70 cents to $21.59 a barrel. The same spread
based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell 70 cents to $10.74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
