Robusta coffee fell to a one-week low
on signs of more supplies from  Vietnam , the world’s biggest
producer, and  Indonesia , the third largest. Sugar also declined.  Buyers of coffee from Vietnam are paying a lower premium as
farmers boosted sales because of gains in futures prices,
Volcafe, the coffee unit of trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said
in a report e-mailed on May 17. Weather may help dry beans in
Indonesia, it said. Arabica coffee prices have dropped 5.2
percent this year while robusta gained 5.2 percent.  “Weak arabicas and ideas that producer selling in Vietnam
would improve weighed on values,” Sterling Smith, a futures
specialist a Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a report e-mailed on May 17. “Indonesian weather will bring a mix of
scattered showers and sunshine, but overall it should be drier
and this will be beneficial to the harvest and movement of
coffee, which should allow the robusta market to ease further.”  Robusta coffee futures for July delivery fell 0.5 percent
to $2,027 a ton by 9:46 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . Prices
earlier today dropped to as low as $2,025 a ton, the lowest
since May 13. Arabica coffee futures for July delivery retreated
0.3 percent to $1.365 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  A lack of sun was hindering bean drying and delaying coffee
deliveries from Vietnam farms, according to Nedcoffee BV in
Amsterdam.  Vietnamese coffee for shipment in June and July were last
week at a premium of $100 a ton to the NYSE Liffe price, down
from $110 a week earlier, Volcafe said. Farmers will probably
sell more if local prices rise to 45,000 dong ($2.14) to 46,000
dong a kilogram (2.2 pounds), it said. Vietnamese coffee was
trading at 42,800 dong a kilogram on May 17,  data  from the
Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed.  European Stockpiles  Robusta coffee stockpiles with a valid grading certificate
in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 127,270 tons as of
May 13, up from 126,100 tons two weeks earlier, according to
data on the exchange’s website. Traders expected inventory data
to be unchanged to a “small” drawdown, brokerage ABN Amro
Markets (U.K.) Ltd. said in a report e-mailed today.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August fell 0.2
percent to $476.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery
