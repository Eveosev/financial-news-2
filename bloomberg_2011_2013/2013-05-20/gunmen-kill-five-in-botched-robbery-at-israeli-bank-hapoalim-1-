Two gunmen tried to rob a branch of
 Bank Hapoalim (POLI)  Ltd. today in the southern Israeli city of
Beersheba, and shot four people dead, police said. One then
killed himself and the other was injured.  Police closed off the area and sought to negotiate with the
gunmen before a woman who had been taken hostage walked out of
the bank and said her captor was dead, police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said.  “They started firing and killed four people before taking
her hostage,” Rosenfeld said in a phone interview. “Police on
the scene tried to negotiate and then he killed himself.”  The second gunman was taken for treatment to a local
hospital, Rosenfeld said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
