Japanese portfolio investors cut
holdings of Australian-dollar debt by the most in at least eight
years on speculation the South Pacific currency is poised to
decline.  Investors  offloaded  439.4 billion yen ($4.6 billion) more
of bonds and notes denominated in the so-called Aussie dollar
than they bought in January, the Tokyo-based Ministry of Finance
said today, the biggest reduction in data going back to 2005.
Japanese holdings were lowered for a third month, the longest
stretch since the six months ended July 2007.  “We sold a few months ago,” said Hiromasa Nakamura, a
senior investor at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which
oversees the equivalent of $34.5 billion and is a unit of
Japan’s third-largest bank. “The Australian dollar may
decline,” said Nakamura, who sees the currency at 95 U.S. cents
by year-end.  Japanese investors  held  13.98 trillion yen of debt
denominated in Australian dollars as of the end of 2011, based
on the latest figures available from the Bank of Japan. At the
time, the figure was equivalent to A$178.1 billion ($182.4
billion). The size of Australia’s sovereign bond market was
A$210.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As of
March 8, The South Pacific nation had a total of A$267.2 billion
in  securities outstanding , according to government figures.  The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0244 as of
3:37 p.m. in Sydney. It has declined 1.5 percent this year after
climbing 1.8 percent in 2012. It touched a 4 1/2-year high of
97.75 yen today.  Bond Losses  Australia’s government bonds handed investors a 0.4 percent
loss this quarter, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index figures. The securities, which hold the highest credit
score and a “stable” outlook from all three of the biggest
ratings companies, fell 0.5 percent in January, the fourth month
of declines. That’s the longest stretch since the period ended
December 2010, the data show. They rebounded 0.7 percent in
February.  The South Pacific nation’s benchmark  10-year debt  fell
today, pushing the yield up to 3.56 percent, the highest since
Feb. 21. The rate has advanced 28 basis points, or 0.28
percentage point, this year. It touched an all-time low of 2.698
percent on June 4, 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
