Bank of Nova Scotia ,  Canada ’s third-
biggest lender, awarded Chief Executive Officer Richard Waugh
C$11.1 million ($10.8 million) in total compensation last year,
a 4.6 percent increase, as the bank posted record profit.  Waugh, 65, received C$1.5 million in salary, C$4.11 million
in share awards, C$4.11 million in options, C$1.38 million in
annual incentives and C$1,196 in other compensation, the
Toronto-based firm said today in a regulatory  filing . A year
earlier, Waugh received C$10.6 million, excluding costs to
service his pension.  Scotiabank’s profit last year was C$6.47 billion, an all-
time high and a 21 percent increase from 2011. Waugh
relinquished the role of president at the end of October to
Brian Porter, the former head of international banking.  Michael Durland, co-CEO of the investment-bank unit, was
awarded C$8.25 million, up 14 percent from a year earlier. His
co-CEO, Stephen McDonald, 56, received C$5.4 million, a 4.9
percent increase.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender, said in
February that CEO Gordon Nixon, 56, was awarded C$12.6 million
in 2012. Toronto-Dominion CEO  Edmund Clark , 65, got C$10.9
million.  Company Apology  Scotiabank apologized this week to its Canadian-based
workers for the way changes to employee benefits were handled.
The lender’s previous benefits plan, which hadn’t been
significantly altered in 15 years “was not working,” according
to spokeswoman Ann DeRabbie, as costs increased and employees
weren’t being treated equally. She declined to be more specific
about how the plan was changed.  “It is clear that we have made mistakes with the launch of
the new ActiveFlex benefits program,” Waugh said in a memo to
employees this week, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. “There have been unintended consequences as a result and,
on behalf of the bank, I want to personally apologize to each of
you for this.”  In the March 5 memo, Waugh said the firm plans to ask for
input on potential adjustments to the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
