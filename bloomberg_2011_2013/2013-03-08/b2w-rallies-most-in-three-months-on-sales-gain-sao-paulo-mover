B2W Cia. Global do Varejo ,  Brazil ’s
biggest online retailer, gained the most in three months as
sales increased 33 percent in the fourth quarter and beat
analysts’ estimates.  Shares rose 5.5 percent to 15.63 reais at 1:41 p.m in Sao
Paulo after earlier soaring as much as 8.5 percent in the
biggest intraday gain since Dec. 12.  Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4) , which
controls B2W, added 1.9 percent to 18.24 reais, extending its
three-day advance to 4.2 percent. The benchmark Bovespa index
fell 0.6 percent.  B2W’s sales increased to 1.6 billion reais ($821 million)
in the three months through December from 1.2 billion reais a
year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg after the
company released results yesterday. That compares with an
average estimate of 1.4 billion reais among 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  “Sales acceleration is the crucial driver to dilute the
company’s heavy expense structure, ultimately driving margin
expansion and cash-flow generation in the long term,” Tobias Stingelin, Ronaldo Kasinsky and Bruno Soares Taveira, analysts
at Banco Santander Brasil SA, wrote today in a note to clients.  B2W declined 13 percent this year through yesterday while
Lojas Americanas retreated 2.4 percent and the benchmark Bovespa
index slid 3.5 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
