The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in Australia and  Japan  declined to the lowest
since 2011, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 3 basis points to
108 basis points as of 11:41 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The gauge is on course for its
lowest close since May 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 4 basis points to 109 as
of 9:44 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
benchmark is dropping for an eighth straight day, a streak of
declines that has taken it to the lowest levels since March
2011, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1.5 basis points to 103 basis
points as of 8:50 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The measure is set for its
lowest close since Jan. 7, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
