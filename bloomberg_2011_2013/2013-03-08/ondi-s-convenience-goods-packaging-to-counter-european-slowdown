Mondi Group (MND) , the largest producer of
office paper in Eastern Europe, expects demand for its packaging
materials to be immune from economic woes as smaller households
mean increased spending on wrapped convenience food and goods.  “There is positive growth in mature markets and very good
growth in the developing markets” for packaging, Chief
Executive Officer David Hathorn said today in an interview.  With about 70 percent of such wrappings used in fast-moving
 consumer goods  such as food, demand will grow regardless of the
economy, Hathorn said in Johannesburg, the company’s base.  Mondi is expanding market share in higher-margin consumer
packaging as shrinking European families buy more convenience
products such as soup in stand-up pouches. The company bought
Nordenia International AG for 240 million euros ($312 million)
of cash and took on 398 million euros of its debt last year.  This year Mondi will “focus on bedding down acquisitions”
totaling about 1.2 billion euros last year, Hathorn said.  Mondi fell 0.1 percent to 122.35 rand by 3:56 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading after rising to a record yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
