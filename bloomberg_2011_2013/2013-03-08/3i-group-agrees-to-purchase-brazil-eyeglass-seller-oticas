3i Group Plc (III)  and investors Neuberger
Berman Group LLC and Siguler Guff & Co. agreed to buy Oticas
Carol, the second-largest eyeglass retailer in Brazil, to profit
from the nation’s growing middle class.  The three firms will invest a total of 108 million reais
($55 million) in Sao Paulo-based Oticas Carol, 3i said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. Chief Executive Officer Ronaldo
Pereira will retain his position and is increasing his stake,
according to the statement.  “We like the Brazilian middle-class consumer story a
lot,” Marcelo Di Lorenzo, 3i’s managing director for Brazil,
said in a telephone interview. “Carol is also a non-cyclical
story, linked to health care and to the aging Brazilian
population.”  Brazil  added about 35 million people to its middle class in
the past decade, according to Data Popular, a research firm that
specializes in the low-income market. Average annual economic
growth of 3.8 percent from 2002 to 2011 helped boost the middle
class and  reduce  the jobless rate to a record low 4.6 percent in
December.  Oticas Carol , founded by Marcos Amaro, has 490 stores in 19
Brazilian states, according to the statement. The company owns
five and the rest are operated as franchises, said Lorenzo, who
added that the total network will increase to about 600 stores
by the end of this year.  Investors expect to complete the acquisition at the end of
this month, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
