Tiger Woods  leads the U.S. PGA
Tour’s Cadillac Championship in Miami going into the third
round, two strokes ahead of Graeme McDowell.  The No. 2 player in the Official World Golf Ranking, Woods,
who had four birdies and five pars through his first nine holes
yesterday at the TPC Blue Monster course at Doral Resort and
Spa, scored a 7-under 65 to end the day at 13-under 131.  “I feel like I’m playing well,” Woods said in a televised
interview. “With the forecast of wind on Sunday, hopefully I
can hit the ball a little bit better and still maintain my
balance and feel on the greens.”  McDowell hit a 4-under 67 to hold second place at 11-under
133.  Phil Mickelson  and  Steve Stricker  each carded 67 to share
third at 10-under 134.  “Tomorrow is not about winning the golf tournament,
tomorrow is about maintaining position, maintaining the way I’m
playing and trying to give myself a chance come Sunday
afternoon,” McDowell said.  Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, the world’s No. 1 player,
had a 69 yesterday to finish 36 holes at 2-under 142, a two-
round score shared with eight others, including  Lee Westwood ,
Jim Furyk and Ernie Els.  This week’s World Golf Championship tournament features a
limited field of the top 65 players, based on the Official World
Golf  Ranking  and other performance criteria. The purse is $8.8
million, including $1.4 million for the winner, with no cut for
weekend play and a paycheck for everyone who completes the four
rounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
