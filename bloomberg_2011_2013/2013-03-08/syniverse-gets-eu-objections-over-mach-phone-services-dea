Syniverse Holdings Inc. received
objections from European Union antitrust regulators listing
concerns with its plans to buy Mach, a rival provider of
services to mobile-phone companies.  “We’ve received a statement of objections,” Margaret
Goldberg, a spokeswoman for Tampa, Florida-based Syniverse, said
in an e-mail. “The statement does not represent the final
findings” of the European Commission and “is an interim
step.”  Syniverse said in a regulatory filing this week that the EU
was examining the deal’s effect on markets for data clearing and
near real-time roaming data exchange. Syniverse, owned by
 Carlyle Group LP (CG) ,  agreed  to buy Luxembourg-based rival Mach for
about 550 million euros ($714 million) in July.  Companies can defend deals in writing or at an oral hearing
and can propose concessions to eliminate EU concerns before the
agency makes a final decision on whether a bid would damage
competition.  The EU opened an in-depth probe in December, saying the
merger may hamper competition by forming the largest data-
clearing house “by a very wide margin” for settling usage
records for consumers making calls or using data on telephone
networks for telecommunications providers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
