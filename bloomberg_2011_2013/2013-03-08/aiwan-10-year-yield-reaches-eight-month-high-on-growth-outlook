Taiwan ’s government bonds fell for a
fourth day, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to the highest
level in eight months, on optimism demand for the island’s
exports will improve as the  U.S. economy  recovers.  Payrolls in the U.S., the island’s second-biggest overseas
market, increased by 165,000 in February after a 157,000 gain
the prior month, while the jobless rate likely held at 7.9
percent, separate Bloomberg News surveys showed before data due
today. Global funds bought $42 million more Taiwanese stocks
than they sold yesterday, taking net purchases this year to $2
billion, according to exchange data.  “Recent U.S. data has been quite encouraging,” said
Stanford Chen, fixed-income manager at KGI Securities Co. in
Taipei. “Yields may not have a lot of room to rise further” if
investors stick with a buy-and-hold strategy, he said.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due March 2023 rose
one basis point to 1.231 percent as of 9:41 a.m. local time, the
highest level since July 4, according to prices from Gretai
Securities Market. It climbed two basis points this week.  Earlier this week, a private report from ADP Research
Institute showed U.S. employers added 198,000 jobs last month,
topping the median economist forecast for 170,000.  Taiwan’s exports dropped 15.8 percent last month from a
year earlier, following a 21.8 percent increase the previous
month, official data showed yesterday. The decline was probably
due to seasonal factors, Credit Agricole CIB analysts led by
Adam Myers in  London  wrote in a note.  Currency Market  The  Taiwan dollar  climbed 0.2 percent today and 0.1 percent
from the end of last week to NT$29.632 against its U.S.
counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.77 on March 5, the weakest level since September. One-
month  non-deliverable forwards  were unchanged at NT$29.63,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts gained
0.1 percent during the five-day period.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
3.95 percent today. The gauge slumped 83 basis points this week.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
