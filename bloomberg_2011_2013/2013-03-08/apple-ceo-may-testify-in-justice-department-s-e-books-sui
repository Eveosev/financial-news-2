Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Tim Cook  may testify in the U.S. Justice Department’s lawsuit
against the world’s biggest technology company over e-books
pricing.  The U.S. sued Apple and a group of book publishers last
year, claiming they conspired to raise prices for electronic
books in violation of U.S. antitrust law. Cook’s possible
testimony was disclosed today in a brief order by U.S. District
Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan, who is overseeing the case.  In a three-sentence order, Cote set a telephone conference
for March 13 after the U.S. asked her in a letter on March 6 for
“assistance in settling a discovery dispute” with Cupertino,
California-based Apple over Cook’s deposition. The March 6
letter wasn’t part of the publicly available court file.  Apple is the only defendant remaining in the case.
Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH’s Macmillan unit,  CBS
Corp. (CBS) ’s Simon & Schuster,  Lagardere SCA (MMB) ’s Hachette Book Group,

settled with the government.  Tom Neumayr , a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment on
the order.  The case is U.S. v. Apple Inc., 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
