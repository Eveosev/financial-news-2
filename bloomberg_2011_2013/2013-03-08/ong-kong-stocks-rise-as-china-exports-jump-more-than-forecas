Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  closing at its highest level in more than two weeks,
as U.S. jobless claims dropped and after a report showed  China ’s
exports rose more than forecast.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., gained
1.5 percent.  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , a Chinese maker of personal
computers that gets more than half its revenue outside the
country, advanced 1.9 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , a state-owned Chinese
offshore energy explorer, increased 2.3 percent after oil prices
rose.  Chong Hing Bank Ltd. (1111)  surged 11 percent after its chief
executive officer said the Hong Kong lender is open to
prospective buyers.  The Hang Seng Index gained 1.4 percent to 23,091.95, its
highest close since Feb. 20. The measure advanced 0.9 percent.
About seven stocks rose for each that fell. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland companies climbed 1.5 percent to
11,484.35.  “It’s an ongoing trend of recovery in China,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at brokerage KGI Asia Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “We are seeing some signs of improvement in the U.S.
We still have to see whether the recovery trend in those major
economies can be sustainable.” Chinese bank stocks are being
bought ahead of earnings reports this month, he said.  Hong Kong’s benchmark index in February capped its first
monthly decline since August, led by developers in China and
Hong Kong amid concern more measures will be introduced to curb
property prices. The index dropped 1.1 percent this month
through yesterday.  The Hang Seng Index traded at 11.1 times average  estimated
earnings  yesterday, compared with 14 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Stocks  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPX)  climbed 0.3 percent today. The U.S.
equity gauge gained 0.2 percent yesterday and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed to another record as the number of
Americans who filed for unemployment benefits fell to a six-week
low.  Li & Fung rose 1.5 percent to HK$10.98. HSBC Holdings Plc,
which received about a fifth of its revenue from North America
last year, climbed 1.8 percent to HK$84.95.  In China, exports rose 21.8 percent in February from a year
earlier while imports declined 15.2 percent, the customs
administration said today in Beijing. That compares with the
median estimate for a 8.1 percent gain in exports and a 8.5
percent drop in imports in a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Economic indicators in the first two months of the year are
distorted by the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which was in
January in 2012 and February this year.  Oil Prices  Lenovo climbed 1.9 percent to HK$8.72, while  AAC
Technologies Holdings Inc. (2018) , a Chinese maker of acoustic
components that gets most of its revenue outside the country,
gained 0.8 percent to HK$32.20.  Cnooc advanced 2.3 percent to HK$15 after crude oil for
April delivery climbed 1.3 percent yesterday in New York.  Chong Hing Bank surged 11 percent to HK$17.58 after Chief
Executive Officer Lau Wai-man said the company is open to
proposals from prospective buyers for all or part of the lender.  Bank of Communications Co., the mainland’s fifth-largest
lender, climbed 2 percent to HK$6.06, before the release of its
full-year earnings at the end of this month.  Coal Shares Rise  China Shenhua Energy Co. (1088) , the country’s biggest coal
producer, rose 3.9 percent to HK$29.55, and China Coal Energy
Co. increased 3.4 percent to HK$7.53, the second- and third- biggest gains  in the Hang Seng Index. Both stocks were down at
least 14 percent this year through yesterday.  “The funds are now in rotational buying, and they are
looking for laggards,” said KGI’s Kwong. Coal producers are
being bought “because share prices were down quite a lot.
They’re bound to have some technical rebound.”  Snack-maker  Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (151) , which yesterday
snapped a record winning streak as brokerages downgraded its
rating, jumped 6.3 percent to HK$12.10, closing at its highest
level since its listing. The stock’s short-selling turnover
surged yesterday and the day before to the highest in two years.
The stock had the  biggest gain  in the Hang Seng Index.  Hang Seng Index futures rose 1.8 percent to 23,102. The HSI
Volatility Index slid 4.4 percent to 14.61, indicating traders
expect a swing of 4.2 percent for the equity benchmark in the
next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
