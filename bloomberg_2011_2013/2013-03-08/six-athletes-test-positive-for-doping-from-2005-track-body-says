Four Belarussian and two Russian
athletes were found to have doped when  track and field ’s
governing body re-tested samples taken at the 2005 world
athletics championship, the sport’s governing body said today.  Disciplinary action has begun against Belarussian shot-
putters  Andrei Mikhnevich  and Nadzeya Ostapchuk, and hammer
throwers Ivan Tsikhan and Vadim Devyatovskiy along with Russian
long jumper  Tatyana Kotova  and hammer thrower Olga Kuzenkova,
the International Association of Athletics Federations said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The IAAF used improved tests to look at several samples
taken during the 2005 championships in Helsinki,  Finland , and
found evidence of cheating by the six athletes, it said.  “The IAAF’s message to cheaters is increasingly clear
that, with constant advancements being made in doping detection,
there is no place to hide,” the governing body’s President
Lamine Diack said in the statement. “The IAAF will continue to
do everything in its power to ensure the credibility of
competition, and where the rules have been broken, will
systematically uncover the cheats.”  Two athletes -- Vladislav Piskunov of Ukraine and  India ’s
Neelam Jaswant Singh -- had already been sanctioned and
disqualified for doping violations at the 2005 event, the IAAF
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
