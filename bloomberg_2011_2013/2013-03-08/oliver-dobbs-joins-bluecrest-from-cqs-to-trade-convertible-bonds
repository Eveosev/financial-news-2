Oliver Dobbs, who was CQS U.K. LLP’s
chief investment officer of portfolio management, has joined
BlueCrest Capital Management LLP to trade convertible bonds.  Dobbs, 48, started working at BlueCrest, a London-based
hedge fund with $34 billion of assets, this month, according to
a filing published today by the U.K.’s Companies House. He
traded convertible bonds at a Citigroup Inc. hedge fund before
joining London-based CQS.  BlueCrest, which focuses on fixed income and uses computer
algorithms to profit from asset-price trends, is adding traders
after its funds more than doubled since the end of 2009. Michael Platt, 44, founded the firm in 2000 after leaving a proprietary
trading desk at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Dobbs, Ed Orlebar, a spokesman for BlueCrest, and Michael Rummel, a spokesman for CQS, declined to comment.  CQS, a $12 billion hedge fund started in 1999 by former
Credit Suisse Group AG trader Michael Hintze, invests in
convertible bonds, corporate debt and asset-backed securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
