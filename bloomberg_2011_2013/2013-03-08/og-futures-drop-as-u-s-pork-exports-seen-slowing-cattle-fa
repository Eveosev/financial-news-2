Hog futures dropped from a one-week
high on speculation that U.S. pork exports declined even before
 Russia  imposed a ban on the meat last month. Cattle also fell.  A U.S. Department of Agriculture report today may show
exports slipped in January, before the ban was implemented, said
 Dennis Smith , a senior account executive at Archer Financial
Services Inc. Russia, the sixth-largest buyer of U.S. pork, on
Feb. 11 banned imports because of concern the meat contains a
feed supplement called ractopamine.  “Exports are going to be down in January,” Smith said in
a telephone interview from Chicago.  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.1 percent to 81.7
cents a pound at 10:41 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Yesterday, most-active futures surged 3.2 percent, the biggest
increase since Nov. 7. Prices still are down 4.7 percent this
year.  Cattle futures for April delivery slid 0.4 percent to
$1.27825 a pound on the CME, heading for their fourth straight
decline. Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement fell 0.7
percent to $1.4385 a pound, heading for the third loss this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
