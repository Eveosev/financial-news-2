Gulf of  Mexico  oils on the spot
market weakened against futures as Brent’s discount to West
Texas Intermediate narrowed after a pipeline system in the North
Sea returned from an unplanned five-day shutdown.  The Brent Pipeline System is approaching its targeted flow
rate of 80,000 barrels a day, an official for  Abu Dhabi National
Energy Co. (TAQA)  said. Brent’s premium to WTI, the U.S. benchmark
crude, narrowed as much as 6.7 percent. Gulf crudes compete for
space in coastal U.S. refineries with foreign oils priced
against Brent, the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil ’s premium to WTI futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange weakened by 70 cents at 1:57
p.m. in New York to $20.50 a barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet narrowed by
40 cents to $21.20 a barrel.  Mars Blend, a medium sour crude from the Gulf, weakened by
85 cents to a premium of $15.55 a barrel. Poseidon and Southern
Green oils slid 85 cents each, to premiums of $15.75 and $13.55
a barrel, respectively. Thunder Horse weakened by $1.10 to
$18.40 a barrel more than the U.S. benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
