Thailand ’s 10-year bonds were headed
for a second weekly decline as an improving outlook for the
economy spurred demand for riskier assets. The baht was set for
a third weekly gain.  The benchmark  SET index  of shares reached its highest level
since 1994 yesterday after a report from the University of the
Thai Chamber of Commerce showed a consumer sentiment  index  rose
to 84 in February, the highest since July 2011. Bank of Thailand
Deputy Governor Pongpen Ruengvirayudh said yesterday the
monetary authority’s 2013 growth estimate of 4.9 percent, made
in January, will “most likely” be revised up to more than 5
percent and the benchmark interest rate of 2.75 percent is
“accommodative.”  “Local optimism on potential growth in Thailand is making
the outlook for stocks more bullish than bonds,” said Wee-Khoon
Chong, a rates strategist in  Hong Kong  at Societe Generale SA.
“The economy is growing and strong, and no prospect of monetary
easing by the central bank is making bonds less attractive.”  The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent government notes due
June 2023 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
3.66 percent as of 8:53 a.m. in Bangkok, the highest level since
Feb. 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was
unchanged today.  Global funds bought $17 million more local equities than
they sold this week through yesterday and offloaded a net $37
million of sovereign debt, official data show.  The baht rose 0.1 percent this week to 29.73 per dollar and
was little changed today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 18 basis points
this week to 5.1 percent. It rose two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
