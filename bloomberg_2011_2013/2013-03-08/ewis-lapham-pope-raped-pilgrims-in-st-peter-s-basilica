When Pope John XII was elected in
955, he didn’t give up his secular interests. He drank, invoked
pagan gods when gambling and loved the ladies.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  John had sex with his father’s concubine, his own niece and
many other women, turning the Lateran Palace into a “brothel
and resort for harlots.” He even raped women pilgrims in St.
Peter’s Basilica.  Otto I convened a synod to have John removed from the
papacy and replaced with Leo, but when the emperor left  Rome ,
John returned and deposed Leo as a usurper. He took revenge on
those who had betrayed him, cutting off the right hand of one
man, and the tongue, two fingers and nose of another.  John fled when Otto came back to Rome, and died when he was
caught in bed by a cuckolded husband and severely beaten.  I spoke with Paul Collins, author of “The Birth of the
West: Rome, Germany, France, and the Creation of Europe in the
Tenth Century,” on the following topics:  1. Collapse & Chaos  2. Bad Popes  3. Church & State Intertwined  4. German Stability  5. Feudal Protection Racket  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
