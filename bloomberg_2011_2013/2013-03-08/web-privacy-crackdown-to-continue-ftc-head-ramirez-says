New U.S. Federal Trade Commission
Chairman Edith Ramirez said protecting the privacy of consumers
is a vital enforcement mission of the agency that she intends to
continue.  “We haven’t been shy about taking on the tech giants”
such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc., which are under consent
decrees with the agency, Ramirez said today at a gathering of
privacy professionals in  Washington .  “That has been just tremendous and that’s all, in my mind,
vital and will continue,” said Ramirez, who became chairman
March 4.  In August, Google agreed to pay $22.5 million, the largest
fine ever levied by the FTC, to settle allegations that it
breached Apple Inc.’s Safari Internet browser.  The record fine marked the FTC’s first for a violation of
Internet privacy policies, following online privacy settlements
with Google, Facebook, Twitter Inc. and MySpace Inc. The
enforcement actions came as the agency stepped up enforcement of
consumers’ online rights.  Ramirez, who has served as an FTC commissioner since 2010,
was designated as chairman by President  Barack Obama .  To contact the reporter on this story:
