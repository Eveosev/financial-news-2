Rubber was poised for the first
weekly gain in four as  Japan ’s currency slid to the lowest level
in three-and-a-half years against the dollar, boosting the
appeal of yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in August climbed as much as 1.1
percent to 294.7 yen a kilogram ($3,095 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, the highest level since Feb. 28.
Futures traded at 294.4 yen at 11:55 a.m. extending this week’s
advance to 3.6 percent, the best performance since the week
through Feb. 1.  The yen dropped to 95.31 per dollar, the weakest since
August 2009. Data showed today Japan had a  current account
deficit  for a third-straight month, damping the currency’s value
as a haven. A separate report showed the nation’s economy
returned to growth last quarter, raising the outlook of demand
for the commodity used in tires.  “Futures drew support from a weakening yen and optimism
about economic recovery,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Japan’s gross domestic product rose an annualized 0.2
percent in the three months through December, the Cabinet Office
said in Tokyo today, compared with a preliminary calculation of
a 0.4 percent contraction. The current account deficit in
January was 364.8 billion yen.  The contract for September delivery in  Shanghai  fell 0.2
percent to 23,870  yuan  ($3,839) a ton. Thai rubber free-on-board
rose 0.6 percent to 89.75 baht ($3.02) a kilogram yesterday,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
