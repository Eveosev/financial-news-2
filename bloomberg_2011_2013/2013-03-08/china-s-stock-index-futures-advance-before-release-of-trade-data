Chinese stocks  fell, capping a
weekly decline, as import growth lagged behind exports in the
year’s first two months and investors awaited the release of
data from inflation to industrial production tomorrow.  Combined exports for January and February increased 23.6
percent from a year earlier, compared with a 5 percent gain in
imports, data showed today. Ping An Bank Co. dropped among
financial shares after the lender’s non-performing loans
increased. Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co., a milk
producer, sank the most in six weeks. SAIC Motor Corp. advanced
2 percent after reporting higher vehicle sales.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.2 percent to 2,318.61
at the close, taking its loss for the week to 1.7 percent amid
concern the government will tighten monetary policy and
regulators will allow the resumption of initial public
offerings. The CSI 300 Index retreated 0.5 percent to 2,606.93.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  climbed 1.4 percent.  “Import data today shows the economy isn’t improving as
much as we hoped for,” said Cao Xuefeng, an analyst at Huaxi
Securities Co. in Chengdu. “If inflation is high tomorrow,
there will be more concern about tightening, while IPO worries
persist.”  Overseas shipments increased 21.8 percent in February from
a year earlier, the customs administration said, compared with
the 8.1 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Imports fell a more-than-estimated 15.2 percent, leaving a trade
surplus of $15.25 billion.  Stock Volatility  Economic indicators in the first two months of the year are
distorted by the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, which was in
January in 2012 and February this year.  Inflation probably quickened to 3 percent in February,
compared with 2 percent in the previous month, a report tomorrow
may show, while industrial output may have grown 10.6 percent.  Volatility (SHSZ300)  on the CSI 300 surged this week as the gauge
tumbled 4.6 percent on March 4 before jumping 4.1 percent in the
following two days as investors speculated whether the
government would take steps to avert asset bubbles. The gauge
slid 1.2 percent yesterday as the Shanghai Securities News said
regulators may allow IPOs from June. Volatility as measured by a
30-day index climbed to a one-year high on March 5.  A gauge tracking financial companies lost 0.4 percent
today, accounting for a third of the CSI 300’s decline. Ping An
Bank dropped 3.7 percent to 22.86 yuan. The company said non-
performing loans at the end of December rose from three months
earlier. Credit Suisse Group AG cut its recommendation on the
shares to neutral.  China  Vanke Co. slid 2.2 percent, taking its
loss for the week to 9 percent.  Inflation Goal  China may need to raise interest rates should gains in the
consumer-price index stay at more than 3.5 percent for three
months,  Chen Dongqi , the deputy head of the National Development
and Reform Commission’s macroeconomic research institute, said
yesterday.  Speculation that China will raise borrowing costs for the
first time since mid-2011 is increasing as the world’s second-
largest economy recovers from the weakest growth in 13 years,
credit expands and property prices rebound. Premier Wen Jiabao
this week set a 3.5 percent inflation goal for 2013, down from 4
percent last year.  The People’s Bank of China will allow branches to raise the
downpayment and interest rate on second homes, according to
local governments’ property control targets, the China
Securities Journal reported, citing the central bank.  An  index  of consumer staples producers retreated 1.2
percent, second-most among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups.
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial sank 3 percent to 28.52  yuan .
Chongqing Brewery Co. declined 4.4 percent to 18.94 yuan. The
stock jumped 24 percent in the previous three days after
Carlsberg A/S offered to boost its stake in the company.  Stock Valuations  Among automakers, SAIC Motor gained 1.8 percent to 16.12
yuan. The company said combined January-February sales rose 16.8
percent.  The Shanghai Composite, up 18 percent since reaching an
almost four-year low on Dec. 3, trades for 9.5 times  projected 
12-month earnings. That compares with the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index’s 10.5 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  advanced 0.2 percent in New
York yesterday. The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the
largest Chinese  exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 0.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
