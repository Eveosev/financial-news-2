 Aggregate world  soybean  production
will decline from last month’s forecast because of dry weather
in  Argentina , the biggest shipper of soy-based  animal feed  and
vegetable oil. Inventories will rise because of slowing demand,
the U.S. government said.  Argentina’s crop will be 51.5 million metric tons, down 2.8
percent from February’s forecast, while world production will
decline 0.6 percent to 268 million tons, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. A Bloomberg survey showed
analysts expected production in the world’s third-biggest grower
to be 51.2 million tons after dry weather damaged crops earlier
this year.  Global  inventories  of the oilseed at the end of this
marketing year will be 60.21 million tons, up from 60.12 million
forecast in February, the USDA said. A year earlier, supplies
totaled a 55.25 million.  Brazil , which began harvesting last month, is projected to
pass the U.S. as the top producer and exporter for the first
time. The country’s output was forecast at a record 83.5 million
metric tons, unchanged from a month earlier while up from 66.5
million a year ago. U.S. production was pegged at 3.015 billion
bushels (82.06 million tons), unchanged from February.  U.S.  stockpiles  on Aug. 31 will be 125 million bushels (3.4
million metric tons), also unchanged from February and down from
169 million a year earlier. All other estimates for the U.S.
crop were left unchanged from a month ago.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$14.7875 a bushel at 9:22 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Soybean meal rose 0.7 percent to $439.10 for 2,000 pounds. The
high-protein animal feed surged 34 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
