Indonesia’s two-year bond yield is
headed a fifth straight weekly drop as investors favor shorter-
dated debt after inflation accelerated to a 20-month high.  Consumer prices  climbed 5.31 percent in February, a March 1
government report showed, the quickest pace since June 2011 and
more than the 4.81 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  Bank Indonesia  kept  interest rates  unchanged for a 13th
consecutive meeting yesterday, as predicted by all 21 economists
in a separate survey.  “Given the recent inflation pressures, a lot of investors
are shortening duration to the shorter end of the curve,” said
Ezra Nazula, head of fixed income at PT Manulife Asset
Management Indonesia in Jakarta. “If inflation still picks up,
and the government needs to increase the overnight rate, there
will definitely be some pressure on the short-end bonds.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent debt due October
2014 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week
and today to 4.27 percent as of 9:06 a.m. in Jakarta, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. That is nine
basis points off an all-time low of 4.18 percent reached on Feb.
15. 2012.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards
strengthened 0.1 percent to 9,704 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They traded at a 0.2 percent discount to the
spot rate, which climbed 0.1 percent to 9,687, prices from local
banks show. A daily  fixing  used to settle the rupiah derivatives
was set at 9,699 yesterday, from 9,688 on March 6 by the
Association of Banks in  Singapore .  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
7 basis points this week and one basis point today to 5.86
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
