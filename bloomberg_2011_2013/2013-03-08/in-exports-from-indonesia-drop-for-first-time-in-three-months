Refined tin shipments from
 Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter, declined for the first
time in three months in February after rains disrupted mining.  Exports dropped 8.7 percent to 8,354.5 metric tons from
9,154.7 tons in January, data from the Trade Ministry showed
today. Overseas sales were 8,324.7 tons in February 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tin, used in soldering and packaging, climbed 22 percent
last year, the best performer among the main industrial metals
on the London Metal Exchange. Falling supplies from Indonesia
may help extend the rally, potentially boosting revenues at  PT
Timah (TINS) , the country’s biggest producer. Futures rose 0.3 percent
to $23,725 a ton today.  “February was the peak of rainy season,” Toto Rusbianto,
head of mining exports at the ministry, said by phone from
Jakarta. The rain disrupted mining, reducing tin ore supplies to
smelters, he said.  The decline in shipments was the first since November, when
exports fell 28.1 percent from a month ago,  data  compiled by
Bloomberg showed. Indonesia shipped tin to 10 countries last
month, with  Singapore  taking about 68 percent of shipments, or
5,711 tons. Other destinations included Malaysia, China and
 Thailand .  Heavy rains are forecast over Bangka-Belitung province, the
country’s main tin producing region this week, the Meteorology,
Climatology and Geophysics Agency said March 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
