Gold imports by  China  from Hong Kong
fell for the first time in four months in January after a surge
in purchases in the previous months to meet Lunar New Year
demand and as investors curbed buying on falling prices.  Mainland China bought 51,303 kilograms (51.303 metric tons)
of gold, including scrap and coins, down from a record 114,405
kilograms in December, according to  export  data released by Hong
Kong’s Census and Statistics Department yesterday. Mainland
China doesn’t publish such data.  Gold has fallen about 6.5 percent this year as the U.S.
stocks extended a record rally amid speculation that the Federal
Reserve may rein in stimulus as the recovery gains traction,
curbing demand for safe-haven assets. Billionaire investor
 George Soros  cut his stake in the  SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) , the biggest
exchange-traded fund backed by gold, by 55 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to government filings.  “The mainland Chinese gold consumption is highly
correlated to the seasons -- usually peaking in the months
leading to the Lunar New Year,” Song Heping, assistant general
manager at Xiamen City Commercial Bank Co., said by phone from
Xiamen yesterday. The weeklong Lunar New Year holiday was in
February this year and in January in 2012.  Purchases in January were 56 percent higher than the 32,948
kilograms a year earlier, the data showed. Shipments almost
doubled to 834,502 kilograms in 2012 from a year ago, according
to Bloomberg calculations, as rising incomes in the world’s
second-largest economy underpinned increased demand and helped
the metal to post a 12th annual gain.  Price Weakness  “Apart from the usual season-related demand issue,
investors also shied away from bullion due to perceived weakness
in prices,” Jiang Shu, a senior analyst at Industrial Bank Co.,
said from  Shanghai .  Gold futures for April delivery slumped 0.6 percent to
$1,566 an ounce at 9:34 a.m. on the Comex in New York. A close
at that price would mark the largest drop for a most-active
contract since Feb. 28, capping a fifth straight weekly decline.  Exports to Hong Kong from China were 31,723 kilograms in
January, according to a separate Statistics Department
statement, up from 29,718 kilograms in December, and compared
with 5,102 kilograms in January 2012. Net imports by China,
after deducting flows to Hong Kong from China, were 19,580
kilograms in January, compared with 84,687 kilograms a month
earlier.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
