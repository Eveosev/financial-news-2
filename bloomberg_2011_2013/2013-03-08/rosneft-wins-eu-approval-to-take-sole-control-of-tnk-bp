OAO Rosneft won European Union
approval to take sole control of TNK-BP, a 50-50 joint venture
between  BP Plc (BP/)  and a group of billionaires.  The European Commission said it saw no competition concerns
with the deal. It also examined whether state-owned Rosneft
acted independently of the Russian government without drawing
any conclusions, it said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
