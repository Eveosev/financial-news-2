The number of tax-delinquent federal
workers and retirees increased by 11.5 percent in 2011,
according to Internal Revenue Service data.  The delinquency rate rose to 3.2 percent from 2.9 percent
the previous year. The 311,566 delinquent taxpayers owe a total
of $3.5 billion in federal taxes, according to the IRS data
released today.  Among large executive branch agencies, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development had the highest percentage of
delinquent workers at 4.4 percent. The Treasury Department,
which includes the IRS, had the lowest, at 1.1 percent.  Employees of the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve
System  had a 5.6 percent delinquency rate, while active-duty
military had a 2 percent rate.  Federal employees are more compliant in paying taxes than
the  U.S. population  as a whole. According to the IRS, 8.2
percent of the population was delinquent on their federal taxes
at the end of fiscal 2011, up from 7.8 percent the year before.  The delinquency rate at the Executive Office of the
President was 2.1 percent, while the rates for employees of the
U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate were 3.7 percent
and 3.3 percent, respectively.  Highest Rates  The highest delinquency rates among federal employees were
at two small agencies -- the U.S. Commission on  Civil Rights  and
the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National
Environmental Policy Foundation. Both had a 9.1 percent
delinquency rate, or four people at the rights commission and
five at the scholarship foundation.  The House passed a bill last year that would require the
government to fire federal workers who are “seriously
delinquent” in paying their taxes. The bill, sponsored by
Representative  Jason Chaffetz , a Utah Republican, passed 263-
114, and didn’t advance in the Senate.  The data present a snapshot as of the conclusion of the
2011 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2011. It includes
taxpayers who owe balances, haven’t filed tax returns and have
balances deemed not collectible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
