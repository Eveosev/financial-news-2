Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  told  Bank of Montreal  officials he didn’t like the
company’s reduction in a five-year mortgage rate to 2.99 percent
at a time he is warning households about excessive debt.  “I spoke with them about that this week and expressed my
concern,” Flaherty told reporters in Ottawa today. “I thank
those Canadian financial institutions that have not chosen to
reduce their rates further.”  Flaherty reiterated there have been welcome signs the
housing market is slowing after a surge that helped push
consumer debt loads to record highs.  “I encourage responsible lending,” Flaherty said. He
didn’t specify who he spoke to at  Bank of Montreal. (BMO)   Bank of Montreal, Canada’s fourth-biggest bank, said in a
March 4 statement that it cut the mortgage rate from 3.09
percent.  “BMO’s efforts to encourage Canadians to pay down debt and
build equity in their homes have been aligned with Minister
Flaherty’s timely and prudent actions to encourage moderation in
the housing market,” Ernie Johannson, senior vice president of
personal banking  Canada , said in the statement.  Paul Deegan, spokesman for the Toronto-based bank, declined
to comment on Flaherty’s reaction today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
