Gold swung between advances and
declines before a report that is forecast to show the U.S. labor
market improved, damping expectations for further stimulus and
boosting the dollar. Silver fell.  Bullion for immediate delivery traded at $1,579.40 an ounce
at 3:20 p.m. in Singapore from $1,578.97 yesterday. The metal is
up 0.2 percent this week following a four-week slump. Silver
slid 0.2 percent to $28.8625 an ounce, also retreating for a
second day. The dollar strengthened against a six-currency
basket before the report that may show U.S. employers added more
jobs in February.  Gold dropped for a fifth month in February, the longest run
of declines since 1997, amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  may
rein in stimulus as the recovery gains traction. Assets in
exchange-traded products sank to 2,486.16 metric tons yesterday,
the lowest level since September.  “The really important number is going to be the non-farm
payroll tonight, which may drag  gold prices  lower,” Steven Dooley, Melbourne-based head of research at brokerage Forex
Capital Trading Pty Ltd., said by phone today. “People are
moving away from gold into other assets. We are very cautious.”  Gold for April delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,577.80 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York  after earlier gaining 0.3 percent.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey estimate that the Labor
Department will say today that payrolls expanded by 165,000 in
February after a 157,000 gain the prior month, while the jobless
rate probably held at 7.9 percent.  The same economic optimism that depressed gold is boosting
platinum and palladium, which are used in the auto and other
industries, Dooley said. Platinum gained 0.4 percent to
$1,601.50 an ounce, and was set for a 1.8 percent increase this
week, snapping three weeks of declines. Palladium was little
changed at $758.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
