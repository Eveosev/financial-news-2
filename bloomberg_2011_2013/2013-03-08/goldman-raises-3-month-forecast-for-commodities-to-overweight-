  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised its
three-month outlook for raw materials to “overweight” after
prices declined.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will
advance 3 percent in 12 months, led by gains of 7 percent in
industrial metals, 5 percent in livestock and 3 percent in
energy, the bank said in its monthly asset allocation report
dated yesterday. On Feb. 8, Goldman forecast a 1 percent return.  “The recent sell-off in commodities on worries about
Chinese growth is overdone in our view and we upgrade to
overweight on a 3-month horizon,”  Jeffrey Currie , head of
commodities research in  New York  at the bank, said in the
report.  The S&P GSCI Enhanced  gauge  slid 5.6 percent the past four
weeks and is down about 0.5 percent this year. Hard red winter
wheat traded in  Kansas City  is down the most, at 12 percent this
year and copper fell 2.9 percent.  Goldman forecasts copper will rise to $9,000 a metric ton
in six months as demand from top consumer  China  picks up “both
seasonally and on the back of continued growth in construction
completions, property sales and power infrastructure related
demand,” Currie said in the report. Prices will fall to $8,000
a ton in 12 months as Chinese construction completions diminish,
the bank said.  Copper for delivery in three months fell 0.5 percent to
$7,729 a ton by 10:19 a.m. in the London Metal Exchange. Brent
oil for April delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $110.52 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Exchange.  Limited supplies of oil will support front-month prices
near current levels, while longer-dated Brent pries will be
“well-anchored” at about $90 a barrel, Goldman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
