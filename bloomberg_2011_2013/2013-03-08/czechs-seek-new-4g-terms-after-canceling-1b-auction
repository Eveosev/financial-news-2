The Czech telecom regulator said
it’s working on developing “new conditions” to allocate radio
frequencies after canceling an auction because bids rose above
$1 billion, the regulator said.  “We are intensively working on new, modified conditions
for granting the frequencies,” Frantisek Malina, spokesman for
the Cesky Telekomunikacni Urad, said by phone today from  Prague .  The regulator, known as CTU, said earlier today that it had
canceled the auction after offers from the four groups taking
part -- Telefonica AS, T-Mobile Czech Republic AS, Vodafone
Czech Republic AS and PPF Mobile Services AS -- totaled more
than 20 billion koruna ($1 billion) and “were still rising,”
according to an e-mailed statement.  “Such excessive prices of the auctioned frequencies would
have to negatively translate into excessive charges for fast
mobile Internet,” CTU Chairman Pavel Dvorak said in the
statement. “We therefore consider it necessary to step in and
prevent future negative consequences for the customers.”  The telecommunications office was offering radio
frequencies in the 800 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2,600 MHz ranges. The
auction should help develop high-speed mobile broadband
services, ensure an effective usage of frequencies and boost
competitiveness on the market by an entry of a new provider.  Shares in  Telefonica Czech Republic AS (SPTT)  rose as much as 1.4
percent after the cancelation was announced. They were trading
up 1.1 percent at 328 koruna as of 1:27 p.m. in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
