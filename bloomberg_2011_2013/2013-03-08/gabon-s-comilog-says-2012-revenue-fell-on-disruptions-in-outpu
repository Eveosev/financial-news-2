Comilog SA-Cie. Minière de l’Ogooué,
the manganese mining venture controlled by Eramet and the
Gabonese government, said revenue fell last year because of
technical and logistical problems.  Revenue fell 9.8 percent to 1,023 billion  CFA francs  ($2
billion) from 1,123 billion CFA francs in 2011, the Moanda,
Gabon-based company said in a statement delivered to reporters
today in Libreville, the country’s capital. Net income wasn’t
disclosed.  Manganese production dropped 7 percent to 730,100 tons
after first-half technical problems halted operations for six
weeks, Comilog said.  The company ships its manganese via the 650-kilometer (404-
mile) railway linking Franceville with Libreville and the port
of Owendo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
