Asian stocks rose for a third week,
with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average recouping losses from before
the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., as U.S.
reports added to optimism in the global recovery and  Japan ’s
central bank officials said they will continue stimulus.  Toyota Motor Corp. climbed 3.4 percent, the most in five
weeks, as the yen touched the lowest since August 2009.
Mitsubishi Estate Co. soared 8.3 percent on speculation earnings
at Japan’s biggest property developer will rise as the economy
expands.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688)  led Hong-Kong
listed property developers lower as  China  tightened mortgage
rules to limit price increases the property market.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 0.6 percent to 135.56,
extending gains for a third week as economic data from the U.S.
added to signs the global economy is recovering, while Japan’s
economy returned to growth and speculation grew its central bank
will step up efforts to stimulate the expansion.  “We’re in a sweet spot for equities with lots of
corporates in a much more solid position,” said James Lindsay,
an Auckland-based fund manager at Tyndall Investment Management
Ltd., which oversees about $23 billion. “Data releases in the
U.S. have been more positive.”  The Nikkei 225 climbed 5.8 percent, the biggest weekly gain
in 15 months, as the yen slid to a 3 1/2-year low and revised
figures showed fourth-quarter gross domestic product rose an
annualized 0.2 percent. Toyota climbed to 4,910 yen, the highest
in a month.  Japan Stimulus  Mitsubishi Estate (8802) , Japan’s biggest property developer,
soared 8.3 percent to 2,654 yen as landlords seek rent increases
and investors consider acquisitions while Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe pursues fiscal and monetary stimulus. Sumitomo Realty &
Development Co. gained 5.3 percent to 3,495 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific measure climbed 4.8 percent this year
as central banks around the world maintained loose monetary
policies to support economic growth. That pushed valuations to
15 times average estimated earnings compared with 13.9 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.6 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., the economy expanded at a modest pace across
most of the country amid rising consumer demand for homes and
autos, the Fed said in its Beige Book report, a summary and
analysis of economic conditions in 12 U.S. districts. Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen said March 4 the central bank
should press on with $85 billion in monthly bond buying.  ‘Monetary Largess’  “The continued penchant for monetary largess by the major
central banks around the world still does provide an
unprecedented cushion for investors,” said Benjamin Yeo,
Singapore-based head of Asian investment strategy at Barclays
Plc’s wealth management unit, which has about $250 billion under
management. “The risk-on mode will prevail for the remainder of
2013.”  China Overseas Land sank 3.1 percent to HK$22.40, leading
Hong-Kong listed property developers lower.  Swire Properties Ltd. (1972) 
declined 1.9 percent to HK$28.45 and Shimao Property Holdings
Ltd. slid 8.1 percent to HK$14.38.  China on March 1 imposed its toughest curbs in a year,
ordering the central bank to raise down-payment requirements and
interest rates for second mortgages in cities with excessive
price gains, enforcing a property sales tax and telling local
governments with the biggest price pressures to tighten home-
purchase limits.  China maintained its economic-growth target at 7.5 percent
for 2013 and raised its budget deficit forecast as the
government cuts taxes and boosts measures to support consumer
demand. The median estimate of 43 analysts surveyed in February
by Bloomberg News expected 8.1 percent growth in 2013.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 0.9 percent on the
week and  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index added 0.6 percent.
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.7 percent and South Korea’s
Kospi Index lost 1 percent. Asian funds posted inflows of $763
million in the week through March 6, Citigroup Inc. analysts
wrote in a report March 8, citing data from EPFR Global.  To contact the reporter on this story:
