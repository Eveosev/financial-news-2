Colombia ’s peso posted its biggest
weekly gain this year after a surprise drop in the U.S.
unemployment rate boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency climbed 0.1 percent to 1,801.50 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Bogota, extending its advance this week
to 0.6 percent.  Five of the six most-traded Latin American currencies
gained today after a report showed U.S. job growth surged last
month. Payrolls rose 236,000, exceeding the 165,000 median
forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The jobless
rate dropped to 7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008.  “The jobs data came out very positive, and the market has
been trading on that,” Diego Usme, an analyst at brokerage
Ultrabursatiles SA, said in a telephone interview from Bogota.
“It increases risk appetite.”  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.89 percent, according to the central
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
