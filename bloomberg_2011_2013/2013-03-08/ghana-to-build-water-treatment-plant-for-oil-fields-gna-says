Ghana , the West African nation that
started oil exports about two years ago, will build a water-
treatment plant to cater to oil fields in the country’s Western
region, the Ghana News Agency reported.  The Ghana Water Co., the state utility, is losing out
because oil companies buy treated water from neighboring Ivory
Coast, the GNA cited Water Resources, Works and Housing Minister
Alhaji Collins Dauda as saying.  Tullow Oil Plc operates Ghana’s offshore Jubilee oil field
and is developing other sites in the area. Eni SpA, Kosmos
Energy Ltd. and Hess Corp. are also working in the country’s
growing crude industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
