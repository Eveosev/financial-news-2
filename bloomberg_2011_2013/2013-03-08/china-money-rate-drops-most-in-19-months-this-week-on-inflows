China ’s money-market rate had its
biggest weekly decline since August 2011 as rising capital
inflows boosted the supply of cash to the banking system.  Yuan   positions  at local lenders accumulated from sales of
foreign exchange to the central bank, an indicator of cross-border inflows to China, rose a record 684 billion yuan ($110
billion) in January, official data showed March 5. The
government reported today that exports climbed 21.8 percent in
February from a year earlier, more than the median estimate of
economists for 8.1 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  The seven-day  repurchase rate  dropped 1.94 percentage
points this week to 2.49 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai ,
the biggest decline since the period ended Aug. 6, 2011,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It fell four basis points today.  “Rising capital will continue to support cash supply in
the  interbank market ,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in
Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest
lender.  Money-market rates decreased even after the central bank
 drained  cash from the financial system for a third week. The
People’s Bank of China withdrew a net 5 billion yuan in the five
days, the same as the previous week, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  China’s  trade surplus  was $15.3 billion in February, down
from $29.2 billion in January, the customs bureau reported today.
That compared with the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey for a $6.9 billion deficit.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, dropped five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.22 percent this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was
unchanged today.  The yield on the 3.39 percent government bonds due August
2022 fell one basis point this week to 3.57 percent, according
to the Interbank Funding Center. It rose one basis point today.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
