The pound was poised for a fourth
weekly decline versus the dollar as demand for the U.S. currency
increased before a report that economist said will show American
employers added more jobs in February.  Sterling dropped to a 2 1/2-year low against the greenback
yesterday. The U.K. currency snapped a three-day decline versus
the euro. The  Bank of England  yesterday left its asset-purchase
 target  at 375 billion pounds ($562 billion). The Debt Management
Office is scheduled to auction 4 billion pounds of one-, three-
and six-month bills today.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.4995 at 7:51 a.m.  London 
time after sliding to $1.4967 yesterday, the weakest level since
July 2010. It has depreciated 0.3 percent this week. Sterling
was little changed at 87.27 pence per euro.  The pound has dropped 6.1 percent this year, the second-
worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The euro rose 1.8 percent and the dollar gained 2.7 percent.  U.K. government bonds lost 1.4 percent this year through
March 1, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
