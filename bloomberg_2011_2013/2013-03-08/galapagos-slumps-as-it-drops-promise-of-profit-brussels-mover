Galapagos NV (GLPG) , a Belgian drug
developer, fell the most in more than a year after reporting a
full-year loss and dropping a promise to become profitable.  Galapagos fell 5.6 percent to 19.25 euros in Brussels, the
biggest decline since February 2012. More than 522,000 shares
traded, almost nine times the three-month daily average. The
stock has gained 53 percent in the past year,  compared  with a 16
percent advance for  Belgium ’s benchmark Bel20 Index.  Galapagos reported a full-year loss of 5.7 million euros
($7.5 million), the Mechelen-based company said in a statement
today, after forecasting “positive” net income in August. The
company also missed its own cash position target, and stopped
repeating a pledge it has made in past years to be profitable.  “This profitability ambition is very difficult to maintain
and they don’t promise it any more,” said Jan De Kerpel, an
analyst at KBC Securities in Brussels. “That’s kind of an eye-
opener” to some investors who aren’t specialized in the biotech
industry.  Galapagos also said that  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  decided to end an
agreement under which it paid Galapagos to develop fibrosis
drugs because of a strategic change. The company said it has
received 16 million euros in payments from Basel, Switzerland-
based Roche and plans to find another partner for the products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
