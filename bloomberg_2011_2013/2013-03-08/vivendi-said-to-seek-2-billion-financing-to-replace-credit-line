Vivendi SA (VIV) , the owner of record
company  Universal Music Group , is seeking to raise 1.5 billion
euros ($2 billion) of loans to refinance existing debt,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The company has asked lenders to propose terms for a five-
year credit line, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private. The request for
proposals includes an interest margin of 85 basis points more
than the euro interbank offered rate, they said. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Paris-based Vivendi signed a 1.5 billion-euro five-year
revolving credit facility paying an 85 basis-point margin in
January 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company is  rated  Baa2 by Moody’s investors Service and BBB by
 Standard & Poor’s , the second-lowest investment-grade rank, the
data show.  Solange Maulini, Vivendi’s director of press and
shareholder relations in Paris, declined to comment on the
financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
