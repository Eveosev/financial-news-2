     March 8 (Bloomberg) --Nuclear-power production in the U.S.
Midwest fell the most since January after  Exelon Corp. (EXC) ’s Clinton
1 plant tripped offline.  Nationwide generation declined 1.1 percent to 85,092
megawatts, or 83 percent of capacity, the first drop in five
days, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 1.8 percent higher than a year
ago, with 16 of 104 reactors offline.  Clinton 1, a 1,065-megawatt unit, shut yesterday because of
a main generator trip, a commission  filing  showed. The cause was
under investigation. The plant is about 23 miles (37 kilometers)
southeast of Bloomington,  Illinois .  Output in the Midwest, which includes Clinton, fell 5.1
percent, the biggest drop since Jan. 22.  Production in the Southeast declined 0.3 percent as
 Southern Co. (SO) ’s Vogtle 2, a 1,127-megawatt reactor, fell to 84
percent of capacity from 90 percent yesterday. The unit 26 miles
southeast of Augusta,  Georgia , began to slow Feb. 12 in
preparation for refueling.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
