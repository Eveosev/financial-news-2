Dan M. Berkovitz, the top lawyer at
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will step down at
the end of the month after helping the agency write derivatives
regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Berkovitz, the CFTC’s general counsel since June 2009,
didn’t disclose his future plans in an e-mail statement today
announcing that he will leave the agency. A former counsel for
the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Berkovitz
counseled CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  during congressional talks
that led to enactment of Dodd-Frank in 2010.  “The commission’s initiatives in these and other areas
have made our financial and commodity markets more transparent,
more accountable, and safer for the American public,” Berkovitz
said in his statement.  Dodd-Frank was enacted as lawmakers sought to reduce risk
and increase transparency in the $639 trillion swaps market
after unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The
law calls for most swaps to be guaranteed at clearinghouses and
traded on exchanges or other platforms.  The regulations will govern trades on exchanges including
those operated by  CME Group (CME)  Inc. and conducted by companies such
as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
