Tom Hill, head of  Blackstone Group
LP (BX) ’s hedge funds-of-funds business, sold $19 million of stock in
three weeks as the New York-based investment firm’s shares
gained about 25 percent this year.  Hill sold a combined 1 million shares on March 5 and Feb.
22, according to regulatory  filings  with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. This week’s sale yielded $10.5 million, and
he got $8.55 million from the previous transaction.  Blackstone’s stock has benefited from rising markets, with
the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging to record levels this
week, as well as a 30 percent increase in the company’s 2012
profit. Hill, 64, who joined the firm in 1993 and has built its
hedge-fund management business to $46.1 billion of assets, was
paid $13.7 million in 2012 salary, bonus and stock awards, up 7
percent from the previous year.  The firm’s president, Tony James, has also taken advantage
of the stock’s performance. James received about $64.2 million
selling 3.5 million shares from Feb. 13 to Feb. 15, according to
a separate regulatory filing last month.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity firm by
assets, sold shares to the public in June 2007 at $31 apiece.
Its stock  dived  during the U.S. financial crisis, reaching a low
of $3.87 in February 2009, and has since more than quadrupled in
value to close yesterday at $19.05.  Peter Rose, a company spokesman, declined to comment on the
share sales. The firm oversaw $210.2 billion as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
