Pakistan Telecommunication Co. (PTC)  fell
as much as 5 percent in Karachi trading, leading declines among
the country’s long-distance phone service providers after a U.S.
commission order.  Pakistan Telecommunications dropped 4.6 percent to 20.80
rupees as of 2:32 p.m., poised for its lowest since Feb. 14.
 Wateen Telecom Ltd. (WTCL)  declined 6.6 percent to 2.98 rupees, headed
for its lowest since Feb. 4.  Worldcall Telecom Ltd. (WTL)  fell 6.8
percent to 3.02 rupees, poised for lowest since Feb. 19.  The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has asked all
U.S. phone carriers to not pay more than 2 cents per minute as
settlement or termination rates to Pakistani long-distance
carriers, according to the March 5  order  posted on its website.
 Pakistan ’s 14 long-distance carriers increased call rates to 8.8
cents a minute from previous levels of about 2 cents a minute
after forming a single gateway for incoming calls in August
called International Clearing House.  “There is a risk about the future profitability of the
business considering the risk of similar decisions from other
countries,” Zeeshan Afzal, an analyst at Topline Securities
Pakistan Ltd., wrote in a note to clients today. “The U.S.
contributes as much as 30 percent of the total incoming
international traffic.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
