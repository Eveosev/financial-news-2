Canadian  stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index to a 19-month high and its third straight weekly
gain, as gold and energy shares advanced after better-than-
forecast jobs data.  Semafo Inc. (SMF)  and Iamgold Corp. climbed more than 5.5 percent
as the price of gold rose for a second day.  Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO) 
jumped 7.5 percent on news it received “significant” offers
for some assets. Athabasca Oil Corp. and Encana Corp. advanced
at least 1.6 percent as oil increased.  SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) 
fell 6.2 percent as Canada’s biggest engineering company
forecast lower profit this year than analysts estimated.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 9.09 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,835.61 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the highest
close since July 2011. The S&P/TSX added 0.5 percent this week.
Trading volume was 6.8 percent higher than the 30-day average.  “The market liked the jobs numbers but didn’t get carried
away,” said  John Kinsey ,  fund manager  with Caldwell Investment
Management, who helps manage about C$1 billion ($972.1 million).
“I think it confirms what we’ve been seeing out of the U.S.,
which is that the economy is gaining some traction.”  U.S. employment rose more than forecast and unemployment
unexpectedly dropped, touching its lowest level since December
2008, Labor Department figures showed today. Canada’s jobs data
also showed better-than-predicted gains. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  extended its record high, and the  S&P 500
index  traded within 1 percent of its all-time mark.  Oil Rises  Oil for April delivery rose 0.4 percent to settle at $91.95
a barrel in New York, after falling as much as 0.8 percent
earlier. Prices advanced 1.4 percent this week, the most since
the five days ended Feb. 1.  Niko Resources added 45 Canadian cents to C$6.48. The
company, which explores for oil and gas in  Southeast Asia  and
parts of  Africa , said it is in talks to sell non-core assets.  Athabasca Oil advanced 3.8 percent to C$9.65 and Encana,
Canada’s largest natural gas producer, gained 1.6 percent to
C$19.92.  Raw-materials companies advanced 0.8 percent, contributing
the most to the S&P/TSX’s gains, as gold and silver prices rose.
Banro Corp. jumped 10 percent to $1.96, after falling the most
in four years yesterday on news its chief executive officer was
resigning.  Semafo rose 14 Canadian cents to C$2.62, and Iamgold added
35 Canadian cents to C$6.75. Gold for April delivery rose 0.1
percent to settle at $1,576.90 an ounce.  First Quantum  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  rose 6.2 percent to C$20.42
ahead of a March 11 deadline for its C$5 billion hostile
takeover bid for Inmet Mining Corp. The bid received approval
from Canada’s ministers of industry and state today, even as
Inmet’s board sent a letter to shareholders advising them to
reject the offer.  Inmet shares added 1.2 percent to C$68.52. The company said
it is in talks to sell a minority stake in its Cobre Panama
copper project.  Financial stocks fell. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
lost 0.6 percent to C$82.78. Royal Bank of Canada slid 0.4
percent to C$62.43.  SNC-Lavalin slumped C$2.84 to C$43.01. Net income this year
will probably climb 10 percent to 15 percent as softer commodity
prices and challenges in the hydrocarbon and chemicals business
erode gains from other units, SNC said. Analysts had predicted
earnings of C$2.84 a share this year, a 39 percent increase.  The Montreal-based firm also reported fourth-quarter profit
of 63 Canadian cents a share, missing analysts’ estimates of 92
cents according to a Bloomberg survey.  MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates Ltd. (MDA)  fell 4.2 percent to
C$69.70 after the satellite maker announced yesterday it will
issue 3.6 million shares to help pay down outstanding debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
