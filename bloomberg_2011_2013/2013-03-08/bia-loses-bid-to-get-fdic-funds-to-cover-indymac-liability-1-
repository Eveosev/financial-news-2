     March 8 (Bloomberg) -- MBIA Inc. (MBI)  lost an appeals court bid
to recover from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. at least
$244 million of claims and expenses stemming from mortgage-
backed securities issued by IndyMac Bancorp Inc.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, upholding a lower
court ruling, rejected the insurer’s claims that it should have
access to as much as $654 million in funds the FDIC collected
from its sale of the failed bank. MBIA argued that pooling and
servicing agreements with the IndyMac were approved by the FDIC,
thereby giving its claims priority over other creditors.  “Under MBIA’s broad interpretation of ‘approved,’ mere
assumption, oral agreement, or partial performance would accord
priority status to any damages stemming from a non-repudiated
contract,” U.S. Circuit Judge  Judith Rogers  wrote in today’s
opinion.  The case involves IndyMac securitized mortgage loans from
2006 and 2007. MBIA sought to be indemnified for the losses it
incurred when borrowers defaulted and investors made claims
under their insurance policies because IndyMac deceptions led
MBIA into issuing the policies.  After the FDIC took over the failed subprime mortgage
lender in 2008, MBIA argued that payments made to investors were
“administrative expenses” of the receivership.  Kevin Brown , a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based MBIA,
declined to comment on the ruling.  The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., 11-05317, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
