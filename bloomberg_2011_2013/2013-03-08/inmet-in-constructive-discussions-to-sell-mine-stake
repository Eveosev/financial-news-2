Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN) , which is trying
to fend off a C$5.1 billion hostile takeover bid from  First
Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , is in talks to sell a stake in its Cobre
Panama copper project.  Absent an improved offer from First Quantum, selling a
minority stake in the project would offer more  shareholder
value , Toronto-based Inmet said today in a statement. Inmet
continues to recommend that its shareholders reject First
Quantum’s bid because it’s too low, the company said.  Inmet is currently engaged in talks with a potential
strategic investor to sell a stake in Cobre Panama at “ a
significant premium to the value implied by the First Quantum
offer,” the company said in the statement.  First Quantum’s C$72 ($70-) a share offer for Inmet is
scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. Toronto time on March 11.
Gaining control of Cobre Panama would enable Vancouver-based
First Quantum to create one of the world’s five largest copper
producers.  Inmet rose 1.8 percent to C$68.92 at 12:33 p.m. in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
