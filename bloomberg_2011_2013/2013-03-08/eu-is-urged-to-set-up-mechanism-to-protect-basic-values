The European Union said four EU
nations are urging the establishment of a mechanism to protect
“fundamental values” that unite the bloc.  In a letter to European Commission President  Jose Barroso ,
the foreign ministers of  Germany , the Netherlands,  Finland  and
Denmark said the EU “must be able to react swiftly and
effectively to ensure compliance” among its 27 member states
with the bloc’s basic values.  While the letter didn’t mention any specific EU member,
 Hungary  has been criticized by Germany and other countries for
violating rights such as the independence of the judiciary that
are seen as fundamental to the bloc’s cohesion. Barroso has
received the letter, spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen told
reporters today in Brussels.  “There are limits to our institutional arrangements when
it comes to ensuring compliance,” the four countries said in
the letter. “Neither the procedures enshrined in the treaties
nor the EU fundamental rights charter provide for sufficiently
targeted instruments.”  They said the commission, the EU executive, “should have a
stronger role” in safeguarding fundamental values. The proposed
mechanism “should be swift and independent of political
expediency,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
