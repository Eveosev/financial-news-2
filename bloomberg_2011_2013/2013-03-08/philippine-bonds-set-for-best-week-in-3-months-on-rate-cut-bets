Philippine  government bonds  rose,
with seven-year debt completing its best week in three months,
on speculation the central bank will cut borrowing costs to curb
gains in the nation’s currency.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which lowered the rate it pays
on $46 billion in  special deposit  accounts to 3 percent from
more than 3.5 percent in January, cannot rule out a further cut,
Governor Amando Tetangco said in a March 4 e-mail. “Any further
action on the SDA and its operations will depend on data coming
from the advanced economies as well as price action” in
markets, he wrote. On March 3, 76.44 billion pesos ($1.9
billion) of sovereign bonds matured.  “The market is anticipating another cut in the SDA rate
next week, and the rally was helped by the maturing debt,” said
Dave Estacio, an assistant vice president at First Metro
Investment Corp. in  Manila .  The yield on the 3.875 percent peso bonds due November 2019
fell 50 basis points, or 0.50 percentage point, this week to
2.85 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. That
was the biggest weekly drop since the notes were first sold in
November. The rate declined 13 basis points today to the lowest
level since the sale.  The peso closed little changed this week at 40.675 per
dollar from 40.688 on March 1, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency rose 0.1 percent today.  Best Performer  The peso is the best-performing Asian and emerging-market
currency in the past 12 months.  Net inflows  into the nation’s
stocks and bonds reached $1.3 billion in January, or almost six
times the $213 million level in December, the central bank
reported Feb. 14.  Bangko Sentral will keep its benchmark  overnight borrowing 
rate at a record low 3.5 percent, according all 10 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey before the March 14 meeting. Consumer
prices rose 3.4 percent in February, a five-month high,
government data showed March 5. Inflation remains manageable,
Tetangco said after the report.  Bangko Sentral issued this week an order capping local
banks’ non-deliverable currency forward positions at 20 percent
of capital and 100 percent for foreign institutions. The move
was announced in December and banks have two months to comply
with the change.  The government may shun global bond sales this year as it
plans to boost domestic borrowing, Treasurer Rosalia de Leon
said on March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
