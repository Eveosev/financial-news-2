Asian  stocks  gained, with the
regional benchmark index headed for the highest close since
August 2011 amid signs the global economy is recovering. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average erased losses from the 2008 collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets 44 percent of its car sales
from North America, climbed 2.7 percent in  Tokyo  after U.S.
jobless claims fell and a weaker yen boosted the earnings
outlook for Japanese exporters.  Sekisui House (1928)  Ltd. jumped 15
percent after the Japanese builder forecast a rise in profit.
Rio Tinto Group gained 1.8 percent in Sydney after the world’s
second-biggest mining company reopened its coal project in
Mozambique.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.5 percent to 135.92
as of 9:31 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost three shares rising for
each that fell. The gauge is poised for a 0.9 percent gain this
week, as economic data from the U.S. and  China  showed signs of
recovery. The Nikkei 225 capped its biggest weekly advance this
year amid speculation the central bank will stimulate growth.  “The GDP data in  Japan  provides a good start for the
future,” said Mikio Kumada, a Hong Kong-based global strategist
for LGT Capital Partners, which oversees more than $20 billion.
“We know that Japan is going to have an aggressive monetary
policy and China’s economy is bottoming out too, so it’s all
good for the outlook.”  Japan Rally  Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 2.6 percent to the highest close
since before Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15,
2008. The gauge had its biggest weekly advance since December
2011 after the yen slid to a 3 1/2-year low and revised fourth-
quarter gross domestic product figures showed the economy exited
recession. A weaker yen boosts the value of the nation’s exports
when repatriated.  “There’s a lot of expectations Japan will be quite
aggressive in stimulating the economy,” said Belinda Allen, a
senior investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion.
“There’s a few more catalysts in the U.S. for the market to
rally compared to Asia.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 1.4 percent, while
 Taiwan ’s  Taiex Index (TWSE)  gained 0.7 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index added 0.5 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3
percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.1 percent.  Chinese Exports  China’s Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent. The
nation’s exports exceeded forecasts in February, an indication
that improving global demand may help sustain the rebound in the
world’s second-biggest economy.  The country’s exports increased 21.8 percent in February
from a year earlier, the customs administration said today in
Beijing. That compares with the median estimate for an 8.1
percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 33 analysts and a 25
percent increase the previous month. Imports fell 15.2 percent,
almost double the 8.5 percent drop forecast by analysts.  Shares on the  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  traded at 15 times
estimated earnings compared with 13.9 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. The U.S. equity gauge gained 0.2 percent
yesterday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to
another record as the number of Americans who filed for

estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Exporters advanced. Honda climbed 2.7 percent to 3,660 yen

rose 2.8 percent to 514,000 yen. Japan Drilling Co. surged 17
percent to 4,780 yen.  Rio Tinto gained 1.8 percent to A$64.36 in Sydney. The
company reopened its coal mines in  Mozambique  as rail services

will introduce additional measures to cool the housing market.
CapitaLand Ltd., Southeast Asia’s biggest property company, sank
2.4 percent to S$3.64. City Developments Ltd. declined 2.1
percent to S$11.16.  Along with Hong Kong and China, Singapore has been
grappling with a surge in housing prices fueled by low interest
rates and capital inflows that drive up demand and make housing
unaffordable.  “Whatever the governments do, doesn’t seem to cool the
property market,” said Jason Hughes, head of premium client
management at IG Markets in Singapore. “Tightening measures are
on the cards as housing prices stay at elevated levels.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
