Spain’s bonds rose, with 10-year
yields dropping to the lowest in more than two years, as a
report showing industrial production shrank less than economists
forecast added to signs  Europe ’s economy is stabilizing.  The nation’s  five-year yields  fell to the lowest level
since November 2010 after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday that the region’s economy will stabilize
this year. German bunds fell for a fifth day as data showed U.S.
payrolls increased more than economists forecast in February,
damping demand for safer assets.  Portugal ’s  10-year bonds  headed
for their biggest weekly gain in two months after  Standard &
Poor’s  raised the nation’s credit-rating outlook yesterday.  “If we continue in a prevailing low interest-rate
environment overall, investors will be looking for higher-
yielding assets,” said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in London. “In terms of carry and outright
performance potential, Spain is still the place to be in the
euro area.”  Spanish  10-year yields  dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 4.76 percent at 4:34 p.m.  London  time,
after sliding to 4.75 percent, the lowest level since Nov. 23,
2010. The 5.4 percent bond maturing in January 2023 rose 1.06,
or 10.60 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,299) face amount, to 104.955.  The  five-year  yield fell 13 basis points to 3.44 percent
after declining to 3.42 percent, the least since Nov. 4, 2010.  Contraction Eases  Spanish industrial output shrank 5 percent in January from
a year earlier, after declining a revised 7.1 percent in
December, the National Statistics Institute said. That compared
with the median estimate of a 6 percent drop in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  “Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover,
supported by a strengthening global backdrop and our
accommodative monetary policy stance,” Draghi told a press
conference in Frankfurt yesterday after an ECB policy meeting.  Spain ’s 10-year bonds gained for an eighth day today, the
longest streak since February 2012. Yields have dropped from a
euro-era record 7.75 percent on July 25, the day before Draghi
vowed to do whatever it takes to safeguard the euro’s future.  Italy ’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 4.59 percent,
still higher than before elections on Feb. 24-25 left the nation
with a hung parliament. The benchmark yield was 4.45 percent on
Feb. 22, the last trading day before the vote.  Spanish securities are outperforming Italy’s as it has
avoided contagion from the latter’s inconclusive elections,
according to Carmignac Gestion SA.  Contagion Absent  “With elections failing to produce a clear majority,
moderate pressure was generated on Italian yields,” Didier Saint-Georges, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac
Gestion, wrote in a note to clients. “However, there was a
notable absence of contagion to Spain, whose long-term yields
were stable over the month.”  German bunds fell as the U.S. Labor Department said
employment rose 236,000 last month after a revised 119,000 gain
in January. The median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected an increase of 165,000.  The yield on  Germany ’s  10-year bund  rose three basis points
to 1.52 percent, after reaching 1.54 percent, the highest since
Feb. 25. The yield has jumped 11 basis points this week.  Portugal’s  10-year yields  were little changed today at 5.93
percent, having dropped 45 basis points this week, the most
since the period ended Jan. 4.  S&P raised Portugal’s credit-rating outlook to stable from
negative yesterday, saying the “revision reflects additional
evidence that European institutions will continue to support
Portugal’s adjustment program.”  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of Finland and Germany, according to
measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-
year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish  government bonds  returned 1 percent this month
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italy’s securities advanced 0.6 percent, while German bunds lost
0.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
