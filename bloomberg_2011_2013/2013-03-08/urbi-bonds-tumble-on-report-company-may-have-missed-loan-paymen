Bonds sold by Mexican homebuilder
Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB tumbled  after a column  in the
Mexico City daily El Universal said the homebuilder may have
missed a loan payment to Prudential Financial Inc.  Columnist Alberto Aguilar reported that Urbi may have
missed a loan payment of $60 million to Prudential without
saying how he obtained the information.  Urbi bonds due in 2022 fell 8.39 cents to 75.19 cents on
the dollar at 2:29 p.m. in Mexico City, pushing the yields up
1.63 percentage points to 14.86 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price is the lowest on a closing
basis since the securities were issued in January 2012.  Alma Beltran, a press official at Urbi, said executives
werenâ€™t immediately available to comment because they were
attending an industry event in New York. John Chartier, a
spokesman at Prudential, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
