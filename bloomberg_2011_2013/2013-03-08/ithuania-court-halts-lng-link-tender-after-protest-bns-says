A Lithuanian court ordered  Klaipedos
Nafta AB (KNF1L)  to halt a tender to build a link between a liquefied
natural-gas terminal and the country’s grid after a protest from
a bidder,  Baltic News Service  reported.  Kauno Dujotiekio Statyba AB, whose initial offer would have
won the contract, filed a complaint after state-controlled
Klaipedos Nafta asked bidders to resubmit their offers, the
newswire said, citing an official at Klaipeda district court.  Germany ’s PPS Pipeline Systems offered to build the
pipeline for a lower price than Kauno Dujotiekio Statyba in
their revised bids submitted this week, the newswire reported,
without saying where it got the information.  PPS sued Klaipedos Nafta earlier this year after its
initial bid in the tender was rejected, BNS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
