Gold futures rose for the second
straight day as a government report showed U.S. unemployment
remains above a target set by the Federal Reserve, signaling the
central bank will continue stimulus measures.  The jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent, the lowest since
December 2008, from 7.9 percent, Labor Department figures showed
today. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke had said that he wants to
drive down unemployment to 6.5 percent. Gold rallied 7 percent
in 2012, the 12th straight annual gain, on mounting concern that
inflation would accelerate as the Fed kept interest rates near
zero and began a third round of asset purchases.  “People realize that this will not be a game changer for
the Fed, even though the numbers are positive,” Dave Lutz, the
head of exchange-traded fund trading and strategy at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said in a telephone interview. The
Fed probably remains concerned that more people are leaving the
workforce, he said. Today’s report showed the so-called
participation rate, or the percentage of working-age people in
the labor force, slipped to 63.5 percent, the lowest since 1981.  Gold futures for April delivery gained 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,576.90 an ounce at 1:55 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices ended 0.3 percent higher this week, ending a four-
week slump.  Futures trading volume was 50 percent above the average in
the past 100 days for this time of day.  Gold dropped for a fifth month in February, the longest run
of declines since 1997, on speculation that the Fed will rein in
its $85 billion in monthly bond buying, and on mounting
confidence that economies are recovering.  Silver futures for May delivery added 0.5 percent to
$28.948 an ounce in New York, the sixth straight gain and the
longest rally since Jan. 23.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery advanced 0.6 percent to $1,603.90 an ounce,
extending this week’s gain to 1.9 percent.  Palladium futures for June delivery jumped 3.1 percent to
$782.75 an ounce, the largest rise since Nov. 13. The metal
climbed to $788.45, the highest since September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
