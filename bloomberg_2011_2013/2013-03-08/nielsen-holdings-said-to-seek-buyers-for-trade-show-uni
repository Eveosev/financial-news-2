Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN) , the biggest
provider of U.S. television ratings, plans to sell its
conferences unit, according to people familiar with the
situation.  The company is working with Credit Suisse Group AG to seek
buyers for Nielsen Expositions, which organizes trade shows in
industries including sports and health care, to focus on its
core audience measurement business, said the people, who sought
anonymity because the deliberations are private.  Nielsen Expositions generated sales of $183 million in
2012, according to the company’s annual report. The unit, which
competes with Reed Exhibitions Ltd., Advanstar Communications
Inc. and Hanley Wood LLC, represented 3.3 percent of total
revenue.  Flavie Lemarchand-Wood, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Nielsen, declined to comment yesterday.  Nielsen rose 1.7 percent to close at $34.89 yesterday in
 New York , the highest since the company’s January 2011 initial
public offering. The plan to sell the business was reported
earlier by Debtwire.  Nielsen recently agreed to buy radio-ratings firm  Arbitron
Inc. (ARB)  for about $1.26 billion in cash, and formed a partnership
with Twitter Inc. to monitor discussions of TV shows on the
social network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
