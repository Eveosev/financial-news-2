The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  may
climb to 1,600 this year as more stocks participate in the
market rally, Bank of America Corp.’s Mary Ann Bartels said.  That would represent a 3.6 percent gain from the benchmark
gauge’s closing level of 1,544.26 yesterday and surpass its
record of 1,565.15 reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The index may drop
as much as 10 to 15 percent after it rallied this year without a
retreat of more than 3 percent, and investors should take
advantage of any pullback to buy equities, Bartels said.  “There are so many sectors and stocks breaking out of the
10-year trading range, that I’ve never seen in my career,”
Bartels, New York-based head of U.S. technical and market
analysis at Bank of America, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview
with  Carol Massar . “This is a strong market.”  The bull market is entering its fifth year this month as
the  S&P 500  more than doubled from its bottom in 2009, fueled by
better-than-expected corporate earnings and monetary stimulus
from the  Federal Reserve .  Three of the 10 S&P 500  industries  have climbed this month
to levels not seen before as consumer and health-care companies
surged. Other equity gauges making new highs include the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones Transportation Average, the
Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies, and the S&P Midcap 400
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
