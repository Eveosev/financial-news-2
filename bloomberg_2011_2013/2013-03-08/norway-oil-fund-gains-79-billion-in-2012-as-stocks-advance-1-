Norway ’s sovereign wealth fund, the
world’s largest, rose 447 billion kroner ($79 billion) last year
as central bank stimulus measures boosted global stock markets.  The Government Pension Fund Global  returned 13.4 percent in
2012, after falling 2.5 percent the year before, the Oslo-based
investor said today. The annual return was the second best in
the $713 billion fund’s history. Stocks returned 18.1 percent,
while its bond investments climbed 6.7 percent. Real estate
investments returned 5.8 percent.  Stocks rallied last year after  European Central Bank 
Governor  Mario Draghi  in July pledged to do “whatever it
takes” to save the euro and later presented a bond buying
program to bring down interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve
announced a third round of quantitative easing to stimulate the
world’s biggest economy. The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks, which
fell to a six-month low in June, gained 13.2 percent in 2012.  “Returns were especially high in the second half of 2012
and can in part be related to actions taken by the European
Central Bank that were announced in July,” the fund said.  Strategy Shift  Europe ’s biggest equity investor is undergoing a shift in
strategy to capture more global growth to safeguard the nation’s
wealth. The fund, which is moving asset allocation away from
Europe as emerging markets in  Asia  and  South America  gain a
bigger share of global output, is “halfway” through its
adjustment process, Slyngstad told reporters today.  European holdings accounted for 48 percent of the fund at
the end of 2012, down from 53 percent a year earlier, after an
increase in investments in emerging markets. The fund is
reducing European holdings to about 40 percent.  “While in 2011, the fund invested 150 billion kroner of
the year’s capital transfers in European equities, in 2012, the
fund invested nearly an equivalent amount in emerging bond
markets”, Slyngstad said in a statement.  The investor’s holdings in French government debt fell 25
percent to 44 billion kroner in the fourth quarter. The fund
held 79.7 billion kroner in French government debt at end-2011.
Investments in Japanese government debt increased 9 percent in
the fourth quarter. The fund, which held 22.6 billion kroner in
Mexican government debt on Dec. 31, is retooling its bond
portfolio to a gross domestic product weighting from a market
weighting to avoid nations with growing debt burdens.  Unusually Good  “There’s been an unusually good start to this year. We’ll
see how it goes in 2013,” Slyngstad said. “What will be
particularly challenging in the next five to ten years is that
the  bond market  will have difficulties yielding good returns
with the low  interest rates  we’re seeing.”  The MSCI World Index of stocks has gained 6.8 percent so
far this year, while emerging-market stocks rose 0.9 percent.  The fund , which gets its investment guidelines from the
government, held 61.2 percent in stocks, 38.1 percent in bonds
and 0.7 percent in real estate at the end of 2012. It’s mandated
to hold about 60 percent in stocks, 35 percent in bonds and 5
percent in real estate. While the investor mostly follows global
indexes, it has some leeway to stray from those benchmarks.  Norway generates money for the fund from taxes on oil and
gas, ownership of petroleum fields and dividends from its 67
percent stake in  Statoil ASA (STL) , the country’s largest energy
company. Norway is western Europe largest oil and gas producer.
The fund invests abroad to avoid stoking domestic inflation.  The government deposited 276 billion kroner of petroleum
revenue into the fund in 2012. The return exceeded by 0.2
percentage point the benchmark set by the  Finance Ministry .  Large Holdings  The fund’s largest stock holding at the end of the year was
 Nestle SA (NESN)  at a value of 30.1 billion kroner.  The largest bond holdings were in U.S. Treasuries at a
value of 324 billion kroner, followed by Japanese and German
government bonds.  The fund got its first capital infusion in 1996 and has
been taking on more risk as it expands globally, raising its
stock portfolio from 40 percent in 2007. It first added stocks
in 1998,  emerging markets  in 2000 and real estate in 2011 to
boost returns and safeguard wealth. It’s struggling to meet a 4
percent return target after rates plunged to record lows and
global stock markets failed to retrace a 2007 peak.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
