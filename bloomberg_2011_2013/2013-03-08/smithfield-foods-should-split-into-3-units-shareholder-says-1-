Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the world’s
largest hog producer, should consider splitting up into three
businesses after the shares underperformed some competitors,
investor Continental Grain Co. said.  The three units would be hog production, fresh pork and
packaged meats, and Smithfield’s international operations,
Continental said in a letter yesterday. The company should also
start paying a dividend, add “several” new directors to its
board, and hire an investment bank to evaluate the proposals,
said Continental, which holds a 5.8 percent  stake  in Smithfield.  Smithfield will review the letter, the Smithfield,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement.  “It’s time for Smithfield to get serious about creating
 shareholder value ,” Continental said in the filing. “This is
an exciting time in the world of food and agribusiness.”  Smithfield jumped 11 percent yesterday, its biggest gain in
two years, after saying the hog business will return to
profitability in 2013. Hog farms give Smithfield a competitive
advantage and selling them would be a “big mistake,” Chief
Executive Officer C. Larry Pope said yesterday in a response to
a question on the company’s third-quarter earnings conference
call.  Smithfield rose 3.7 percent to $25.60 at 8:50 a.m. before
the start of regular trading in  New York . The stock has climbed
10 percent in the year through yesterday. U.S. competitors
 Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL)  and  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  advanced 34 percent and
21 percent, respectively, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
