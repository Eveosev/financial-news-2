Following is the text of the
February employment report from the Labor Department.  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 236,000 in
February, and the  unemployment rate  edged down to 7.7 percent,
the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Employment
increased in professional and business services, construction,
and health care.  Household Survey Data  The unemployment rate edged down to 7.7 percent in February
but has shown little movement, on net, since September 2012. The
number of unemployed persons, at 12.0 million, also edged lower
in February.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for
whites (6.8 percent) declined in February while the rates for
adult men (7.1 percent), adult women (7.0 percent), teenagers
(25.1 percent), blacks (13.8 percent), and Hispanics (9.6
percent) showed little or no change. The jobless rate for Asians
was 6.1 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a
year earlier.  In February, the number of long-term unemployed (those
jobless for 27 weeks or more) was about unchanged at 4.8 million.
These individuals accounted for 40.2 percent of the unemployed.  The employment-population ratio held at 58.6 percent in
February. The civilian  labor force  participation rate, at 63.5
percent, changed little.  The number of persons employed part time for economic
reasons, at 8.0 million, was essentially unchanged in February.
These individuals were working part time because their hours had
been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time
job.  In February, 2.6 million persons were marginally attached
to the labor force, the same as a year earlier. (The data are
not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the
labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked
for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted
as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4
weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 885,000
discouraged workers in February, down slightly from a year
earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged
workers are persons not currently looking for work because they
believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.7
million persons marginally attached to the labor force in
February had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the
survey for reasons such as school attendance or family
responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 236,000 in
February, with job gains in professional and business services,
construction, and health care. In the prior 3 months, employment
had risen by an average of 195,000 per month.  Professional and business services added 73,000 jobs in
February; employment in the industry had changed little
(+16,000) in January. In February, employment in administrative
and support services, which includes employment services and
services to buildings, rose by 44,000. Accounting and
bookkeeping services added 11,000 jobs, and growth continued in
computer systems design and in management and technical
consulting services.  In February, employment in construction increased by 48,000.
Since September, construction employment has risen by 151,000.
In February, job growth occurred in specialty trade contractors,
with this gain about equally split between residential (+17,000)
and nonresidential specialty trade contractors (+15,000).
Nonresidential building construction also added jobs (+6,000).  The  health care industry  continued to add jobs in February
(+32,000). Within health care, there was a job gain of 14,000 in
ambulatory health care services, which includes doctorsâ€™ offices
and outpatient care centers. Employment also increased over the
month in nursing and residential care facilities (+9,000) and
hospitals (+9,000).  Employment in the information industry increased over the
month (+20,000), lifted by a large job gain in the motion
picture and sound recording industry.  Employment continued to trend up in retail trade in
February (+24,000). Retail trade has added 252,000 jobs over the
past 12 months. Employment also continued to trend up over the
month in food services and drinking places and in wholesale
trade. Employment in other major industries showed little change
over the month.  In February, the average workweek for all employees on
private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours. The
manufacturing workweek rose by 0.2 hour to 40.9 hours, and
factory overtime edged up by 0.1 hour to 3.4 hours. The average
workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private
nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.2 hour to 33.8 hours.  Average hourly earnings for all employees on private
nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents to $23.82. Over the year,
average hourly earnings have risen by 2.1 percent. In February,
average hourly earnings of private-sector production and
nonsupervisory employees increased by 5 cents to $20.04.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for December
was revised from +196,000 to +219,000, and the change for
January was revised from +157,000 to +119,000.  The Employment Situation for March is scheduled to be released
on Friday, April 5, 2013, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Labor  To contact the reporter on this story:
