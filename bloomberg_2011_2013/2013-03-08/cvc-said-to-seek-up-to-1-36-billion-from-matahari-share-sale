PT Matahari Department Store (LPPF)  owners
including CVC Capital Partners Ltd. are seeking as much as $1.36
billion selling shares in the Indonesian retailer, said people
with knowledge of the matter.  CVC and partner Lippo Group, who together control 98
percent of Matahari, set a price range of 10,000 rupiah ($1.03)
to 11,250 rupiah per share for the sale, three people said,
asking not to be identified because the information is private.
The sale of a 40 percent stake values the company at up to $3.4
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  CVC is attempting what may be Indonesia’s biggest share
sale in five years as it raises about $3 billion for its fourth
Asia fund. Companies from Apple Inc. to  Japan ’s Fast Retailing
Co. are expanding in Indonesia as a swelling middle class
underpins  spending  in the world’s fourth-most populous nation.  CVC is seeking a valuation for Matahari that is up to 30
percent higher than the $2.6 billion  Aeon Co. (8267) , Japan’s largest
retailer, was willing to pay for the company. Aeon decided to
withdraw a non-binding bid because the valuation CVC was seeking
was too high, according to a Feb. 9 letter sent by Aeon to the
fund and seen by  Bloomberg News .  The sale values Matahari at as much as 28 times estimated
profit for this year, a person familiar with the matter said
last month. PT Ramayana Lestari Sentosa, the biggest Indonesian
department store by floor space, trades at 19.3 times  estimated
2013 earnings , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Middle Class  Matahari, founded in 1958, has 116 stores across  Indonesia ,
according to its website. A venture between CVC and Lippo-backed
PT Matahari Putra Prima bought 91 percent of the department
store in January 2010 for about $772 million, and acquired the
rest of the stake soon after. Matahari Department Store was a
unit of Matahari Putra Prima at the time.  Indonesia’s middle class, or those spending more than 2
million rupiah a month, is set to double to 141 million people,
equaling about half the total population, by 2020 from 74
million people last year, according to a Boston Consulting Group
report. Just a third of the middle class frequent larger retail
stores, the report showed.  The offering may be Indonesia’s largest share sale since a
$4.4 billion rights issue by PT Bakrie & Brothers in April 2008,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Companies raised $3.6 billion
in Jakarta stock sales last year, the data show.  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are
managing the offering, the people said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
