Sherutei Bar Grains Import Ltd., an
Israeli importer, bought 50,000 metric tons of corn from Louis
Dreyfus on behalf of its clients, according to three people with
knowledge of yesterday’s tender.  The company bought a 25,000-ton corn cargo for delivery in
the first half of May at $56.50 a ton more than the May contract
on the Chicago Board of Trade, said two of the people, who asked
not to be identified because the tender results haven’t been
announced publicly. The second cargo, due in the first half of
June, was priced at $81 a ton above the July contract on the
CBOT, they said.  The corn probably will be from Ukraine, the three people
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
