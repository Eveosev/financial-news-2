Nigeria’s naira depreciated for the
third time in four days after the central bank paid out maturing
Treasury bills, boosting money supply and freeing up local
currency for buyers to seek dollars.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.1
percent to 157.85 per dollar as of 2:50 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, paring a weekly gain to 0.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Abuja-based Central Bank of Nigeria settled maturing
bills amounting to 263.93 billion naira ($1.7 billion)
yesterday, the  Financial Markets Dealers Association , said on
its website. The institution sells bills to help manage currency
supply within the market.  “The maturities boosted money supply as they hit the
market, making dealers more able to seek dollars,” Sewa Wusu,
an analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone.  The regulator held the benchmark interest rate at a record
high 12 percent for an eighth time on Jan. 21 to control
inflation and stabilize the naira. The nation’s inflation rate
fell to 9 percent in January from 12 percent in December, the
statistics bureau said Feb. 18.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell 20 basis points to 4.08 percent.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose 24 basis points to 11.1 percent, according to
yesterday’s data compiled on the FMDA website.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.2 percent to 1.9175 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
