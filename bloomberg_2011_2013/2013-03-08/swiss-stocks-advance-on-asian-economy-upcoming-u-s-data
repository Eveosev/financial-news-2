Swiss stocks rose, with the
benchmark index extending a 4 1/2-year high and heading for its
fourth weekly rally, as data signaled economic gains in  Asia  and
as investors awaited a report on U.S. payrolls.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Switzerland ’s second-largest bank,
advanced 2.8 percent after UBS AG recommended the shares.
Schmolz & Bickenbach AG surged the most in six weeks after
amending credit agreements with banks for 930 million euros
($1.2 billion).  Gategroup Holding AG (GATE)  jumped 3.4 percent after
winning a five-year catering order from Spanish airline Iberia.  The Swiss Market Index added 0.6 percent to 7,752 at 1:02
p.m. in Zurich, its highest level since May 2008. The gauge has
rallied 2 percent this week, the biggest increase since Jan. 18,
amid speculation that central banks around the world will
continue to support economic recovery. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also rose 0.5 percent today.  “We like the state of global recovery which is quite
broadly based, and it’s keeping us fully invested as we see it
broadening out,” Colin McLean, co-founder of Edinburgh-based
SVM Asset Management, told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg
Television.“In Europe, markets are certainly getting better.”  In  Japan , gross domestic product rose an annualized 0.2
percent in the fourth quarter, the Cabinet Office said in  Tokyo .
That surpassed a preliminary calculation of a 0.4 percent
contraction. In  China , exports gained 21.8 percent in February
from a year earlier, the customs administration said. That beat
the 8.1 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Job Gains  U.S. payrolls probably gained last month, economists said
before a Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . An
additional 165,000 workers were hired last month after a 157,000
increase in January, according to the median forecast of 90
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The jobless rate held at 7.9
percent, the survey showed.  Credit Suisse advanced 69 centimes to 25.69 Swiss francs.
UBS raised its recommendation on the stock to buy from neutral,
with analysts led by Daniele Brupbacher saying the lender may
soon be able to pay a cash dividend.  Schmolz & Bickenbach, the supplier of steel to carmakers,
rose 8.6 percent to 2.54 francs. The company said it completed
negotiations with banks to amend  credit agreements  due in March
and April 2015.  The company sought to preserve its financial health after
slowing steel demand in  Europe  put pressure on its balance
sheet. Handelsblatt reported in January the company may be sold,
prompting Schmolz Chairman Hans-Peter Zehnder to say he had no
information on possible takeover attempts.  Gategroup Order  Gategroup, which provides catering services to airlines,
increased 65 centimes to 19.80 francs. The Kloten, Switzerland-
based company said it won a new 425 million-franc contract ($451
million) from Iberia and its subsidiary Iberia Express. The new
order will take effect when the current agreement ends in 2015.  Coltene Holding AG jumped 13 percent to 41.25 francs, its
biggest rally since August 2009. Profit rose to 9.53 million
francs in 2012, from 5.66 million francs the previous year, the
dental-products company reported today.  PubliGroupe SA added 1.6 percent to 150 francs after the
advertising company said net income rose to 50.2 million francs
last year, from a restated 27.7 million-franc profit in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
