The U.K.’s opposition Labour Party
will force a vote in Parliament on March 12 on a tax on the most
expensive houses as it seeks to sow division between the two
parties in Prime Minister David Cameron’s coalition government.  The proposed tax, a policy espoused by Cameron’s Liberal
Democrat coalition partners, would be levied on properties
valued at more than 2 million pounds ($3 million). Labour is
forcing the vote a week before Conservative Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne’s annual budget to highlight divisions
in the government. The Tories oppose such a levy.  “After going along with a Tory tax cut for millionaires, a
failing economic plan, a VAT rise and a trebling of tuition
fees, this is a chance for the Liberal Democrats to finally vote
for something that was in their manifesto,” Labour finance
spokesman Chris Leslie said in an e-mailed statement.  The money raised from the so-called mansion tax would be
used to cut taxes for people on middle and low incomes, Leslie
said. The vote is not binding and would not introduce a levy if
Labour was to win backing for its motion in the House of
Commons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
