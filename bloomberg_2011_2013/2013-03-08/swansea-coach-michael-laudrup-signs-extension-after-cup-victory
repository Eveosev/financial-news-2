Swansea manager Michael Laudrup
signed a one-year contract extension after leading the Welsh
soccer club to its first major trophy.  The 48-year-old is in his first season at Swansea. He
guided the Swans to the first title in their 101-history by
winning last month’s League Cup final and has the club currently
in eighth place in the Premier League.  “You can never guarantee how things will work out when you
employ a new manager, especially after the success we’ve had in
recent seasons, but I think everyone has seen for themselves
that Michael has helped take this football club to another
level,” Swansea Chairman Huw Jenkins said in a  statement  on the
club’s website.  Laudrup, a former Denmark international, had been linked
with a move to several major teams, including Real  Madrid ,
Chelsea and Manchester City.  “We’ve started something this season that I want to
continue,” Laudrup said. “I know there has been a lot of
speculation, but I’ve always said that I am happy here and I
never had any doubts I would stay.”  Laudrup signed a two-year contract in June to replace
Brendan Rodgers, who took over at Liverpool. He previously
coached at Mallorca, Brondby, Getafe and Spartak Moscow and also
served as assistant manager of the Denmark national team from
2000 to 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
