Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, is opening its first community for older
buyers that’s west of the  Mississippi , on Colorado land that
competitor  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  sold in December 2011.  Toll Brothers purchased 387 lots at Anthem Ranch, about 20
miles (32 kilometers) north of Denver, to develop homes for
buyers age 55 and older, said Kira Sterling, a spokeswoman for
the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based builder. Terms of the deal
weren’t disclosed.  Sales of  new homes  jumped 15.6 percent from a year earlier
in January to their fastest pace since July 2008 as buyers take
advantage of low interest rates and the supply of existing
houses on the market shrinks. Toll, which has developed “active
adult” communities since 1999 in eastern U.S. states, is
betting that demand will grow faster from couples who want
smaller luxury residences after their children have moved away
from home, Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said.  “As waves of baby boomers continue to enter their 55-plus
years, we are expanding our active-adult brand across the
nation,” Yearley said today in a statement.  About 50 of Toll’s 225 selling communities were restricted
to older residents as of the quarter ended Jan. 31, Sterling
said. Last year, 11 percent of the company’s homes were sold in
age-restricted developments.  The first lots at Anthem Ranch will go up for sale in May.
Finished homes, which will be ready for occupancy next year,
will sell for $300,000 to $400,000.  Del Webb  The original developer of Anthem -- Del Webb, a unit of
PulteGroup -- sold the 1,700-acre (690-hectare), master-planned
community of Anthem in December 2011 for about $28 million to
Wheelock Street Capital LLC and Oread Capital & Development,
said Jeff Handlin, president of Oread, a Broomfield, Colorado-
based investor in Colorado and Florida real estate.  The announcement was made after the close of regular U.S.
trading. Toll fell 1 percent to $35.26 in New York today. Its
shares are up 55 percent in the past year, compared with a 77
percent gain for the 11-member Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite
Homebuilding  Index. (S15HOME)  Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based PulteGroup,
the largest U.S. builder by market value, has risen 138 percent,
making it the index’s biggest gainer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
