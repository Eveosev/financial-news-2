Derek Jeter  was cleared to resume
baseball activities following ankle surgery and is expected in
training camp today, the New York Yankees said.  Jeter, 38, had a “routine and scheduled” visit yesterday
in Charlotte, North Carolina, with Robert Anderson, who
performed the operation in October.  Jeter broke his left ankle on Oct. 13 in the American
League Championship Series against Detroit. The shortstop has
said repeatedly that he’ll be ready to play by the Yankees’
season opener on April 1.  Manager  Joe Girardi  said he wasn’t sure when Jeter would
participate in preseason games.  “I’m not just going to throw him at shortstop and leave
him out there for a long time,” Girardi told reporters
yesterday.  The Yankees announced two days ago that All-Star first
baseman  Mark Teixeira  would miss as many as 10 weeks because of
a strained wrist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
