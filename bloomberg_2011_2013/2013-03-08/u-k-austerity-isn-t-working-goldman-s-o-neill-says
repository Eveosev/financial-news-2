U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
commitment to cutting Britain’s debt isn’t working and is
leaving the country in a similar position to the “weaker”
euro-area nations, Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman  Jim O’Neill  said.  Political expediency will lead Cameron and Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  to change their strategy as the
2015 election approaches, O’Neill said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s  Mark Barton  in Cernobbio, Italy.  “They’ve put themselves into a bit of a box” with an
unwavering commitment to debt reduction, O’Neill said. “The
strategy of the coalition, three years in, is ‘let’s cut debts,’
and what has it done other than in fact not cut debts?”  When Cameron and Osborne get closer to the election they
will need to rethink their strategy, O’Neill said. Osborne is
facing pressure to ease the pace of his fiscal-consolidation
plans in his March 20 annual budget as the economy stagnates.  “We’re now into the second half of their office and it
makes common sense for them that they cannot just carry on,” he
said. “Whatever they call it, they will shift the broad net
fiscal stance because it doesn’t seem to be delivering what they
thought it would.”  It is unclear what further quantitative easing by the  Bank
of England  would do to improve the U.K. economy as the weakness
of the pound is increasing import costs and “cramping”
consumers, O’Neill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
