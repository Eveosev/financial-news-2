Mako Vunipola will make his first
start for the  England  rugby team in this weekend’s Six Nations
match against Italy.  Vunipola replaces Joe Marler at loosehead prop, one of five
changes made by coach  Stuart Lancaster  from the 23-13 win over
France two weeks ago. Vunipola made his first seven appearances
for England as a substitute.  The other changes for the match at London’s Twickenham
Stadium in two days have  Toby Flood  taking over at fly-half for
Owen Farrell, who left the France game with a thigh injury;
 Danny Care  replacing Ben Youngs at scrum-half, Tom Youngs coming
on for Dylan Hartley at hooker and  James Haskell  getting the
call at blindside flanker in place of Courtney Lawes.  England leads the Six Nations standings having won its
first three matches. Italy has lost its last two games after
opening with a 23-18 upset of pre-tournament favorite France.  “Italy will be highly motivated for this game and we will
have to perform for the full 80 minutes,” Lancaster said. “I
am sure those starting will seize their chance and the bench
will also have a significant part to play as the game goes on.”  Tom Croft  returns to the England team for the first time in
a year following his recovery from a broken neck. He’ll be a new
addition to the substitutes’ bench, along with Freddie Burns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
