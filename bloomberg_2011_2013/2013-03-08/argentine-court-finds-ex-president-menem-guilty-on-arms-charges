Former Argentine President Carlos Menem and his Defense Minister Oscar Camilion were found guilty
by a Buenos Aires court of helping smuggle weapons to Ecuador
and Croatia during the 1990s.  Menem, who ruled Argentina from 1989 to 1999, is currently
a senator in Congress and has immunity. The ruling revokes a
2011 court decision to dismiss the case, state-run news agency
Telam  reported . The crime is punishable by prison terms of 10 to
15 years, C5N television reported. Another tribunal will
establish Menem’s sentence.  In 2001, the  Supreme Court  cleared him of charges he
organized illegal sales of 6,500 tons of arms and released him
from house arrest in Buenos Aires. His former Economy Minister
 Domingo Cavallo  spent nine weeks in prison in 2002 related to
the weapons smuggling case.  Menem, 82, established a 1-to-1 peg of the Argentine peso
to the  U.S. dollar  in 1991 that was abandoned in 2002 after
South America’s second-largest economy defaulted on a record $95
billion of debt. A lawyer by profession, Menem supported
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s decision to seize oil
producer  YPF SA (YPFD)  from Repsol SA last year after authorizing its
sale to the Spanish energy producer in 1999.  Argentine troops were part of the United Nations
peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia, and Buenos Aires
was a guarantor of the peace process for a border conflict
between Ecuador and Peru.  To contact the reporter on this story:
