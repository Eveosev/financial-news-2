Chief Executive Officer  Helena Morrissey  will head an
independent inquiry into the U.K. Liberal Democrats, the junior
partners in Prime Minister David Cameron’s coalition government.  The review will examine the party’s culture and attitudes
toward women after allegations of sexual harassment against
former Liberal Democrat CEO Chris Rennard, the party said in an
e-mailed statement today.  “While prompted in difficult circumstances, this review is
a very important step in giving everyone, especially women, a
greater confidence in politics and the Liberal Democrats,”
Morrissey said. “We can only make changes in society when those
at the top in business and politics lead by example.”  The inquiry was set up by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg,
the Liberal Democrat leader, after the party was accused of
suppressing the allegations of sexual harassment against Rennard
by not properly investigating them. Rennard denies the
allegations against him and Clegg has denied that there was a
cover-up.  “As a political party which prides itself on equality, we
must give everyone confidence they will be treated fairly and
equally and that they will be listened to,” said the party’s
current CEO, Tim Gordon. “It is vital this review is done
independently of the party, in a way which can be frank and can
scrutinize thoroughly, and I am delighted Helena has agreed to
chair the review.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
