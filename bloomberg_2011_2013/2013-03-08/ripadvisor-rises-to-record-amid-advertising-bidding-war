TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) , operator of a
travel-research website, surged to a record high amid
anticipation that a bidding war for display advertising will
bolster sales growth.  The shares rose less than 1 percent to $51.03 at the close
in  New York  for the highest price since they began trading in
2011. The shares have risen 22 percent this year, compared with
an 8.8 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  TripAdvisor’s website, a repository for user-generated
reviews of hotels and other travel businesses, helps consumers
search for the best deals available from online travel agencies.
As  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the biggest Internet travel site by
market value, and its smaller rival  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  compete for
bookings, they’re spending more for display ads on TripAdvisor,
said Tom White, an analyst at Macquarie Capital USA Inc. in New
York.  “As long as the big online travel agencies are competing
with each other and spending money it’s good for TripAdvisor,”
White said in an interview today. “They think about TripAdvisor
like they think about search.”  TripAdvisor’s sales will probably increase 23 percent to
$935.2 million this year, according to the average of analysts’s
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Most of the Newton,
Massachusetts-based company’s revenue comes from advertising,
White said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
