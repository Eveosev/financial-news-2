CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) 
will share the right to list options on equity indexes owned by
Russell Investments, whose gauges serve as benchmarks for $3.9
trillion in investments.  The agreement includes the six indexes which have listed
options such as the Russell 2000  gauge , whose contracts are on
multiple U.S. exchanges, the companies said today. Trading in
the index-based derivatives will begin in late April. The other
indexes are the Russell 1000, Russell 1000 Growth, Russell 1000
Value, Russell 2000 Growth and Russell 2000 Value.  CBOE, home of the biggest U.S. options market, already has
an agreement with S&P Dow Jones Indices to list contracts linked
to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which only trade at the
company’s  Chicago Board Options Exchange . Exclusive rights to
trade Russell stock-index futures are held by Intercontinental
Exchange Inc., the energy and commodity futures bourse that in
December agreed to acquire NYSE Euronext in a $8.2 billion deal.  Russell Investments, based in  Seattle , said in January that
distribution of real-time data for its indexes is switching to
NYSE Euronext from Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. as the two firms plan
to create new options on the gauges.  Exchanges are seeking to boost revenue amid declining
volume. Options trading slowed to a daily average of 15.9
million contracts last year from a ninth-consecutive record of
18.1 million in 2011, data from the Chicago-based Options
Clearing Corp. show. Daily average stock volume slipped to 6.42
billion shares in 2012 from 9.77 billion in 2009, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
