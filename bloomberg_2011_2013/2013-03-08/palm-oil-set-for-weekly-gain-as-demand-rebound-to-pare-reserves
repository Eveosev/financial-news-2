Palm oil headed for the biggest
weekly gain in more than a month on speculation that stockpiles
in  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer, may decline as
demand rebounds.  The contract for May delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent
to 2,451 ringgit ($789) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, before trading at 2431 ringgit at 11:37 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures have advanced 2.7 percent this week, the biggest
such increase since the five days ended Feb. 1.  Futures may advance this year as the global economy
recovers, Malaysian Plantation Industries and Commodities
Minister Bernard Dompok said this week. Demand for the commodity
used in everything from candy to instant noodles will increase
after prices fell, according to Dinesh Shahra, managing director
of Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.,  India ’s biggest importer.  “An increase in Indonesian exports tax this month and the
recent decline in prices have made Malaysian palm oil exports
attractive,” Ryan Long, a vice president of futures and options
at OSK Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone from Kuala Lumpur.
“Speculators may also be covering short positions,” he said,
referring to investors reversing bets on further declines.  Indonesia , the biggest producer, raised export tax on crude
palm oil to 10.5 percent for this month from 9 percent in
February. Malaysian  inventories , which were at 2.58 million tons
in January, may have decreased to 2.44 million tons last month,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Official data from the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board are due for release on March 11.  Soybean oil for May delivery was little changed at 50.60
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for May
delivery gained 0.2 percent to $14.77 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September gained 0.7
percent to 6,618  yuan  ($1,064) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.8
percent to 8,324 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
