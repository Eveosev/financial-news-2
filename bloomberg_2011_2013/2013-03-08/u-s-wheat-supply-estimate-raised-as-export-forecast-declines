U.S. wheat inventories at the end
of the current marketing year will be 3.6 percent higher than
forecast a month ago because of declining exports, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said.  Stockpiles will total 716 million bushels (19.5 million
metric tons) as of May 31, up from last month’s estimate of 691
million, the USDA said today in a report. In a Bloomberg
survey, 21 analysts expected 702 million bushels, on average.
Exports will total 1.025 billion bushels, down from a February
forecast of 1.05 billion, according to the government.  “We missed our big opportunity to be a big exporter in
the first half of the marketing year” when high prices
discouraged overseas buyers from purchasing U.S. grain, said
 Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler Commodities LLC in Augusta,
 Kansas , in a telephone interview. “Exports were never as good
as people were expecting.”  As of the end of February, orders for U.S. wheat from
overseas buyers for this marketing year were down 5 percent
from a year earlier.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 0.3 percent to $6.9325
a bushel at 7:41 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The price
has dropped 11 percent this year, partly on expectations for
higher U.S. crop yields after recent wet weather in growing
regions.  Global inventories at the end of May will total 178.23
million tons, 0.8 percent higher than last month’s estimate of
176.73 million, mostly because of bigger supplies in  India  and
the U.S., the USDA said. Analysts expected 176.53 million, on
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
