Suntech Power Holdings (STP)  Co. has been
sued by  Bank of China Ltd . over a loan contract dispute, the
21st Century Business Herald said yesterday, citing a person it
didn’t identify.  A hearing on the case will be held later this month, the
newspaper said. A board of seven Chinese lenders led by Bank of
 China  was formed in the fourth quarter to cope with Suntech’s
debt due to mature, the report said. Suntech has a $541 million
convertible bond due on March 15.  The board agreed to loan more to the company only if Shi Zhengrong, the founder and former chief executive officer, gives
away his stake or quits Suntech, the Herald said. Shi, who
founded Suntech in 2001, was ousted as chairman this week.  “Suntech is aware of the litigation and we intend to
resolve it amicably,” a company spokesperson, who declined to
be named, said by e-mail today in response to the report. Two
calls to  Bank of China ’s news department went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
