Sixty-three guests became sick after
eating last month at Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant that
charges $440 for its food and wine menu and that was voted the
world’s best eatery, Danish health authorities said.  Guests from 12 dinner parties over a four-day period
experienced diarrhea and vomiting, and staff also reported
illness, the national health inspection agency said in a  report 
published on its website. The restaurant said in the report it
was taking measures to correct issues raised by inspectors.  Noma, which specializes in Nordic foods and has served
dishes such as poached sea urchin and powdered cucumber, was in
April named the world’s best restaurant for the third straight
year, in voting organized by Restaurant magazine. Health
inspectors said in the report Noma failed to react in time to e-
mails from dinner guests and one of its kitchen workers who
reported they had fallen ill.  “We acknowledge that the internal procedures haven’t been
good enough and because of busyness, employees didn’t check e-
mails,” the report quoted Noma as saying.  The report didn’t mention any sanctions on the restaurant,
whose 20-serving menu, including wine, costs 2,500 kroner
($440). Noma will have to pay for a follow-up check, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
