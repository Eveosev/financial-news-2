U.S. civil rights leader Reverend
 Jesse Jackson  spoke today in Caracas at the funeral of
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , who died on March 5 after a
two-year battle with cancer.  “Today we’re here not because Hugo Chavez has died but
because he lived.  ‘‘Venezuela cries today.  ‘‘To Nicolas Maduro, grant him wisdom and support as he
keeps hopes and dreams alive, as he picks up the baton and makes
a great nation greater.  ‘‘We are neighbors, we share the same hemisphere, we play
ball together, we trade resources together, we fight drugs
together, we share dreams together, we are bound by culture and
environment.  ‘‘How do we measure a great leader? By how he treats the
least of these. Hugo fed the hungry. He lifted the poor. He
raised their hopes. He helped them realize their dreams. And so
today we do mourn because we lost a lot. But we have a lot left:
a stable government, an orderly transition.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
