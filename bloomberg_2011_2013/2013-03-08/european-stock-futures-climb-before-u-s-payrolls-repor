European stocks  rallied to a 4 1/2-
year high as U.S. payrolls rose more than forecast, sending the
jobless rate in the world’s biggest economy to the lowest since
2008, and Chinese exports increased.  Fugro (FUR)  NV surged the most in four years after the deepwater-
oilfield surveyor posted full-year earnings that beat analysts’
estimates.  Lagardere (MMB)  SCA climbed to its highest since July 2011
after swinging to profit in 2012. Clariant AG slid 2.4 percent
as Nomura Holdings Inc. downgraded the chemical maker’s shares.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  added 0.8 percent to 295.55 at
the close of trading, the highest level since June 2008. The
benchmark gauge has gained 2.3 percent this week, the biggest
jump since the first week of the year, amid optimism that
central banks around the world will continue stimulus measures
to support economic recovery.  “The payrolls number is significantly better than
expected, implying that the underlying growth in the U.S. is
strong,” said Espen Furnes, who helps oversee $75 billion as a
 fund manager  at Storebrand Asset Management in Oslo. “This
gives good support to the rising equity markets and the
increasing optimism for outlook for 2013 and beyond.”  U.S. payrolls increased more than forecast in February, a
Labor Department report showed. An additional 236,000 workers
were hired last month, exceeding the 165,000 median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The jobless rate unexpectedly
fell to 7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008.  The volume of Stoxx 600 shares changing hands was 14
percent greater than the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National Indexes  National benchmark indexes climbed in all 18 western
European markets, except Ireland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7
percent to a five-year high and  Germany ’s DAX added 0.6 percent.
France’s CAC 40 jumped 1.2 percent.  In  Japan ,  gross domestic product  rose an annualized 0.2
percent in the three months through December, the Cabinet Office
said in  Tokyo . That compares with a preliminary calculation of a
0.4 percent contraction.  China’s exports increased 21.8 percent in February from a
year earlier, the customs administration said today. That beat
the 8.1 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Fugro jumped 14 percent to 42.59 euros, the biggest gain
since March 2009, after reporting full-year net income of 292
million euros ($382 million), beating the average analyst
estimate of 282 million euros.  Lagardere added 4.8 percent to 28.81 euros after  France ’s
largest publisher posted 2012 net income of 89 million euros,
compared with a loss of 707 million euros a year earlier.  Credit Suisse  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  advanced 3.9 percent to 25.97 Swiss
francs after UBS AG raised its recommendation on Switzerland’s
second-biggest bank to buy from neutral, citing its “solid”
capital ratios and dividend outlook.  DNB ASA climbed 4.5 percent to 92.50 kroner, its highest
price since at least 1992, after Norway’s largest bank said it
will raise lending rates by as much as 0.3 percent because of
stricter  government regulation .  Bankia SA (BKIA)  gained 3.1 percent to 27 euro cents after
Expansion reported the lender is in talks with 20 funds to sell
its real estate platform Bankia Habitat.  Clariant (CLN)  slipped 35 centimes to 14.32 Swiss francs after
