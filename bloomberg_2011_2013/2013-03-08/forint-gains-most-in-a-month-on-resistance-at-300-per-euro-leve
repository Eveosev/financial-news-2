The forint strengthened the most in
a month, rebounding after crossing a key level of 300 per euro.  Hungary ’s currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 296.81 per
euro by 12:46 p.m. in Budapest, paring a fourth week of
declines. The forint breached the 300-mark for the first time in
nine months on March 6, weakening to as low as 300.33 per euro
yesterday, as traders speculated the government may use central
bank currency reserves to provide relief to foreign-currency
mortgage borrowers.  “The forint lost momentum after it didn’t stay above
300,” Akos Ruzsonyi a Budapest-based trader at Commerzbank AG,
wrote by e-mail.  The forint lost 1.9 percent in the month to March 6, the
worst performance among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on the
day Hungary must be “very careful” with its foreign reserves.  Emerging-market stocks rose, heading for the biggest weekly
advance in more than two months, as economic data from  China  to
 Japan  and the U.S. bolstered confidence in the global expansion.  “No further unsettling news came,” Ruzsonyi said. “The
forint had badly underperformed recently, now it is correcting
the most in the other direction,” Ruzsonyi said.  Yields on the government’s 10-year forint-denominated bonds
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.396
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
