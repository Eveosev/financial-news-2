Indian  bonds  completed the biggest
weekly gain in two months on speculation the central bank will
reduce interest rates to revive economic growth.  Asia’s third-largest economy  grew  4.5 percent from a year
earlier in the final three months of 2012, the weakest pace in
almost four years, the government reported last week. Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said this week he hopes
interest rates will be cut. The monetary authority, which
reduced the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent
in January, will review borrowing costs next on March 19.  The yield on the 8.15 percent securities maturing in June,
2022 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.84
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the biggest decline in yields since the week
ended Jan. 4.  “The Reserve Bank is likely to cut rates this month as
growth is slowing and inflation is easing,” said  Anubhuti
Sahay , an economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Mumbai.
“Measures to curb the budget deficit are also a positive
sign.”  Chidambaram, in his budget speech on Feb. 28, said he aims
to reduce the fiscal  deficit  to 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product in the year starting April 1, from an estimated 5.2
percent this year.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 7.57 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
