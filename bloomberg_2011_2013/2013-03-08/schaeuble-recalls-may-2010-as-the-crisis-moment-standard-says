 German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the week in May 2010 between approving the first
Greek bailout and the creation of the European rescue fund is
the crisis moment he recalls most vividly, according to an
interview in Austria’s  Der Standard .  “I never seriously doubted that the euro would remain
stable and probably emerge strengthened from the crisis,”
Schaeuble was quoted as saying by the newspaper. “But a moment
that indeed made you pause was when we created the first
temporary rescue mechanism in spring 2010, just after the
decision to provide bilateral loans to Greece.”  Only two days after debating the first 110 billion-euro
($143 billion) aid program for Greece in the German parliament,
euro-area leaders began to work on a program for the entire bloc
with a volume of 750 billion euros as the crisis worsened,
according to Schaeuble. “That moment I do remember very well,”
he said.  Schaeuble said  Italy  was following the right policy under
Prime Minister  Mario Monti , and should continue along this path.
“We haven’t turned the corner yet, but we’re on a good path,”
Schaeuble said. While the domestic political situation is
“complicated,” he said he is sure that Italians will succeed
in forming a coalition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
