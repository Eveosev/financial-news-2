German prosecutors are investigating
Windreich AG, the country’s biggest developer of sea-based wind
farms, on suspicion it may have manipulated its balance sheet.  A total of 35 police officers and four prosecutors raided
the main office of a renewable energy company and four private
apartments on March 5 and confiscated about 1,200 binders and
large amounts of digital data, Claudia Krauth, a spokeswoman for
the Stuttgart prosecution office, said today by telephone.  “The allegations will prove groundless,” Windreich said
in a statement on its website, confirming it’s the target of the
probe. The developer, based in Wolfschlugen, said it’s
cooperating “to the full extent” with prosecutors. Windreich
Chief Executive Officer Willi Balz didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  Stuttgart prosecutors accuse “five current and former
management board members of embellishing yearly and company
financial statements as well as group reports by overvaluing
assets,” they said in a statement. The investigation, which
centers on suspicion of investment fraud, market price
manipulation and loan fraud, was triggered by an anonymous
complaint received late November, Krauth said from Stuttgart.  Windreich, which has about 8 gigawatts of approved German
sea-based parks or sites, is seeking to benefit from  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s target of operating 25 gigawatts of turbines at
sea by 2030 as the country shutters nuclear reactors. The
offshore wind expansion has been delayed due to hold-ups in
connecting turbines to the mainland  power grid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
