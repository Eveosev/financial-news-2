Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near the lowest level in more than two months as
 steel mills  increased output and spot market price dropped.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to 3,890  yuan  ($625) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,927 yuan at 11 a.m. local time.
The most-active contract on March 4 closed at 3,905 yuan, the
lowest level since Dec. 27.  China’s daily crude steel output in late-February was
estimated to have risen by 1.4 percent from the middle of the
month to 2.03 million tons, according to industry consultancy
Custeel.com. The average spot  price  for rebar fell for the
fourth session yesterday to 3,764 yuan a ton, according to data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  “The low-priced spot steel is widely available, which then
enticed steel mills and trading companies to sell their products
onto the higher-priced futures market, suppressing the futures
market especially in the forward-months,” Nanhua Futures said
in a report yesterday.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent to $146.30
a ton yesterday, according to data compiled by The Steel Index
Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
