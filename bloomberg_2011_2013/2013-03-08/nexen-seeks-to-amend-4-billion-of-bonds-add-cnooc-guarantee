Nexen Inc. (NXY)  is asking holders of
almost $4 billion of bonds to amend the terms of the debt,
allowing the Canadian energy company to remove some covenants
and add  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  as a guarantor.  Nexen, which was bought by Cnooc for $15.1 billion, is
seeking the consent from investors in eight securities worth
$3.93 billion, according to a  statement  from the company. The
borrower wants to delete or amend certain restrictive covenants,
add a guarantee from Cnooc and include some terms relating to
the Beijing-based company, it said in the statement, without
elaborating on the nature of the covenants.  Cnooc’s takeover of Nexen, the biggest overseas purchase by
a Chinese company, got Canadian government approval in December
when the state also announced that it would prohibit future
state-owned acquisitions in the oil sands barring “exceptional
circumstances.” China’s biggest offshore oil and natural gas
producer is controlled by the Chinese government.  Nexen bondholders that agree to the changes by 5 p.m. in
New York on March 18 will receive $1 for every $1,000 of
principal, according to the statement. The final deadline for
consent is 5 p.m. on March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
