Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, paid 95 employees more
than 1 million pounds ($1.5 million) last year.  RBS paid its top 10 executives about 21 million pounds in
total compensation in 2012, compared with about 25.3 million
pounds in the previous year, the Edinburgh-based lender said in
a  remuneration report  today. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester was paid 3.27 million pounds for the year, up from 3.24
million pounds in 2011. He won’t receive a pay increase in 2013.  Britain’s largest banks are under pressure to rein in
executive pay and cut costs after a series of regulatory
missteps. RBS said last month it will cut its bonus pool and
claw back some compensation to help pay the $612 million fine on
interest-rate rigging. At Barclays Plc, CEO Antony Jenkins has
said he won’t take a bonus following the Libor scandal.  RBS’s head of U.S. operations, Ellen Alemany, is the
highest-paid employee below board level, earning 4.78 million
pounds in 2012, said a person familiar with the matter, who
declined to be identified because the details are private.  Hester, 52, spurned a bonus for 2012 after a computer
failure left many of the bank’s 17 million customers unable to
access their accounts for several days.  About 81 percent of RBS employees eligible for a bonus will
receive less than 5,000 pounds, with 68 percent in line for a
payout of less than 2,000 pounds, the firm said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
