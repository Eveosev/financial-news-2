Iceland’s economy  grew in the fourth
quarter as  consumer spending  picked up and investment in the
island’s tourism industry surged.  Gross domestic product gained 0.5 percent from the previous
quarter, after rising 4.8 percent in three months through
September, Reykjavik-based  Statistics Iceland  said in a
statement on its website today. Output expanded 1.4 percent from
a year earlier and 1.6 percent overall in 2012, the office said.  Iceland is emerging from its 2008 banking meltdown and
economic collapse even as  Europe  struggles to contain a debt
crisis in its fourth year. The island’s central bank in December
halted a cycle of interest rate increases to protect the economy
from the fallout of the euro-area crisis.  Exports fell 0.1 percent from the previous quarter, while
household spending increased 1.5 percent, recovering from a 0.5
percent decline in the third quarter, the agency said. Gross
fixed capital formation rose a quarterly 4.3 percent.  The  central bank  said in February that “as spare capacity
disappears from the economy, it is necessary that monetary
policy slack should disappear as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
