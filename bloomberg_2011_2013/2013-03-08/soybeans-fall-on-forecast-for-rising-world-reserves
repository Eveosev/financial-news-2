Soybeans fell from a two-week high
after the U.S. said global inventories before the start of the
harvest will rise more than forecast. Corn climbed on signs of
increasing demand for livestock feed, and wheat dropped.  Aggregate worldwide  stockpiles  of soybeans as of Aug. 31
will be 60.21 million tons, up 0.1 percent from the forecast in
February, and 8.8 percent from a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expected a drop to 59.31 million, on
average.  The crop in  Argentina , the world’s biggest shipper of soy-
based  animal feed , will be 51.5 million metric tons, larger than
the 51.2 million forecast in a Bloomberg Survey.  Brazil , which
is projected to pass the U.S. as the top producer and exporter
for the first time, will harvest 83.5 million tons, unchanged
from last month and 26 percent more than last year, the USDA
said.  “The world is going to see record supply coming very soon
from South America, reducing demand for U.S. soybeans,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services
Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “People were
disappointed that USDA did not cut the size of the  South America 
crops more” after dry weather earlier this year, Grow said.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell less than 0.1 percent
to $14.7325 a bushel at 12:41 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade
after slumping as much as 1.6 percent. Earlier, the price
reached $14.8475, the highest for a most-active contract since
Feb. 22.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 1.2 percent to $6.9925 a
bushel, heading for the biggest gain in a week.  The amount of corn used for animal feed in the U.S. will be
2.2 percent more than forecast a month ago as the government
projected higher beef, chicken, turkey and milk production. U.S.
inventory will fall to 632 million bushels, the lowest since
1996, the USDA said.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $6.9425
a bushel. On March 6, the price touched $6.80, the lowest since
June 22, after rain and snow boosted prospects for the U.S.
winter crop that farmers will begin harvesting in late May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
