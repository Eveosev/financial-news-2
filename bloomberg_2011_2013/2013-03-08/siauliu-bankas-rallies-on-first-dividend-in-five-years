Siauliu Bankas AB (SAB1L)  climbed to a 15-
month high in Vilnius trading after the Lithuanian lender
proposed its first dividend in five years and announced plans to
give shares to its owners free of charge.  The stock rose as much as 5.1 percent and closed 4.4
percent higher at 0.285 euro, valuing the bank at 67 million
euros ($88 million) and extending this year’s gain to 24
percent. Volume of 269,894 shares was 418 percent of the three-
month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Siauliu proposed a dividend of 1.17 million litai
($446,490) from its 2012 profit of 14.9 million litai, according
to  draft decisions  of a March 28 shareholders meeting published
on its website. The lender also plans to give its shareholders
15.1 million shares in proportion to the size of their stakes,
it said. The share issue will be financed from the bank’s
capital reserve.  The bank last paid a dividend in 2008, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg .  The Siauliai-based lender, which is 19.6 percent owned by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, agreed
last month to assume insured deposits from  Ukio Bankas (UKB1L)  AB in a
deal that will almost double its size.  Siauliu is  Lithuania ’s only publicly traded bank after
regulators closed Ukio on Feb. 12, citing risky lending to
related companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
