Rapid-American Corp. filed for
bankruptcy protection in New York to deal with debt related to
asbestos personal-injury claims.  Rapid-American, based in New York and formerly a holding
company for McCrory variety stores, “was never engaged in an
asbestos business” and inherited about 275,000 asbestos claims
through a series of acquisitions, according to an account in
court papers by company Vice President Paul Weiner.  “Recently, Rapid has experienced an increase in the number
of mesothelioma claims being filed against it and an increase in
the dollar amount sought to settle claims,” Weiner said.  Philip Carey Manufacturing Co. , established in 1888, made
and sold building products, some of which contained asbestos.
Through a series of mergers, Rapid incurred successor liability
for claims arising from exposure to asbestos-related products,
according to court papers.  “Although total claims filed have declined in recent
years, mesothelioma claims, which generally result in higher
settlement values, now represent approximately 34 percent of
newly filed claims against Rapid,” Weiner said.  The  Riklis Family Corp.  owns 100 percent of the stock of
Rapid-American Corp., court papers show.  The company listed assets of $86.9 million and didn’t
immediately specify indebtedness.  The case is In Re Rapid-American Corp., 13-10687, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
