Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s third-
largest uranium producer, said Chairman Victor Zaleschuk will
step down at the company’s next annual meeting.  A. Neil McMillan, a member of the Canadian company’s board
of directors since 2002, will replace Zaleschuk, Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan-based Cameco said today in a statement. Zaleschuk
will continue to be a director, if re-elected at the May 14
meeting, the company said.  “It’s time for me to step down as chair to assure healthy
renewal of board leadership,” Zaleschuk, who served as chairman
for a decade, said in the statement.  The change comes as the uranium industry grapples with
depressed prices for the nuclear reactor fuel component
following meltdown of three reactors in  Japan  after the March
2011 earthquake and tsunami. The move also comes as Cameco
prepares to begin output from its Cigar Lake uranium mine in
Saskatchewan, a projected delayed by a series of underground
floods beginning in 2006.  Cameco fell 0.3 percent to C$21.49 at 11:43 a.m. in
Toronto. The shares have risen 9.7 percent this year.  Kazatomprom,  Kazakhstan ’s state-owned producer, and Paris-
based  Areva SA (AREVA)  are the biggest uranium miners as of 2011, the
most recent data available from the  World Nuclear Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
