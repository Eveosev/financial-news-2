Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Employment rose by 51,000 in February, following a slight
decline the previous month. This increase was spread between
full- and part-time work. The unemployment rate remained at 7.0%
as more people participated in the labour force.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment grew by 1.9% or
336,000, predominantly in full-time work. Over the same period,
the total number of hours worked also increased by 1.9%.  Provincially, employment increased in Ontario, British
Columbia,  Nova Scotia ,  New Brunswick  and Prince  Edward Island ,
while Manitoba saw a decline.  Employment gains in February were in professional,
scientific and technical services; accommodation and food
services; public administration; and agriculture. Manufacturing
was the lone industry to post a notable decline.  In February, there were more people working as employees
(+39,000), while the number of self-employed was little changed.
Compared with 12 months earlier, the number of private sector
employees rose by 236,000 or 2.1%, and public sector employment
increased by 72,000 or 2.0%. Self-employment was little changed
over the same period.  Employment increased among people aged 55 and over in
February, while it was little changed among youths and people
aged 25 to 54.  Employment gains in several provinces  Employment in Ontario rose by 35,000 in February, led by
gains among youths. Despite this increase, the  unemployment rate 
remained at 7.7% as more people participated in the labour force.
Year-over-year gains in the province were 1.7%, slightly below
the national growth rate of 1.9%.  Following a decline the previous month, employment in
British Columbia increased by 20,000 in February. As more people
participated in the labour force, the unemployment rate remained
at 6.3%. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the
province was little changed.  Employment rose by 3,000 in Nova Scotia and the
unemployment rate was 9.3% in February. However, compared with
12 months earlier, employment in the province was down 1.4%.  In New Brunswick, the number of workers increased by 2,900,
pushing the unemployment rate down 1.2 percentage points to
10.1%. On a year-over-year basis, employment in the province was
little changed.  Employment in Manitoba declined by 3,200 in February and
the unemployment rate stood at 4.9%, as fewer people
participated in the labour force. Despite the decline in
February, employment in the province grew by 1.9% on a year-
over-year basis.  Employment in Quebec was little changed in February, and
the unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage points to 7.4%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the province
increased by 2.9%.  While employment in Saskatchewan was little changed in
February, robust growth over the past 12 months (+4.3%) pushed
the unemployment rate down 1.1 percentage points over the period
to 3.8% in February, the lowest since November 2008 and the
lowest among all provinces.  Employment up in the services sector  In February, employment in professional, scientific and
technical services rose by 26,000, returning to a level similar
to that of 12 months earlier.  Employment in accommodation and food services increased by
21,000 in February, bringing year-over-year employment growth in
this industry to 3.0%.  Public administration employment rose for the second
consecutive month, up 16,000. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in this industry increased by 2.7%.  In agriculture, employment increased by 7,300 in February
and was up 5.6% compared with February 2012.  The number of workers in manufacturing declined by 26,000
in February. Employment growth in the spring of 2012 was offset
by a slight downward trend since the summer, leaving employment
in this industry little changed compared with 12 months earlier.  Employment continued to rise among people 55 and over  Among people aged 55 and over, employment increased for the
second consecutive month, up 32,000 in February and mostly among
men. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment among people in
this age group rose by 171,000 (+5.4%), partly a result of
population ageing.  While employment among people aged 25 to 54 was little
changed in February, it was up by 116,000 (+1.0%) on a year-
over-year basis.  Among youths aged 15 to 24, employment was little changed
in February and the unemployment rate was 13.6%. Employment
among youths has been on a slight upward trend since August 2012.  Note to readers  The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore
subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates
will show more variability than trends observed over longer time
periods. Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries
also have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates and how to use standard errors to
assess this variability, consult the ‘Estimates quality’ section
of the publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
