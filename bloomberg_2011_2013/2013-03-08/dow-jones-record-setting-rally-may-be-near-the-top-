The record-setting rally in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  may slow as it approaches a technical
barrier, according to two investors citing trading patterns.  The 14-day  relative-strength index  for the Dow Jones rose
to 68.9 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Readings above 70 indicate prices will probably fall. The Dow
climbed to 14,354.69, its highest level ever.  “The RSI suggests it’s near the top of the range,” said
Hideo Shimomura, who helps oversee the equivalent of $63.2
billion in  Tokyo  as chief fund investor at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co., a unit of  Japan ’s largest publicly-traded bank.
“It’s early to say we have reached a peak.”  For Kim Youngsung at Samsung Asset Management Co., the
indicator suggests there will be a “cooling down” in the  stock
market , he said. The Seoul-based company has the equivalent of
$103.7 billion in assets.  The last time the relative-strength index was above 70 was
every day except one from Jan. 22 to Feb. 1. The Dow was
experiencing a five-week rally that ended Feb. 1, followed by a
two-week decline.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in an index,
security, commodity or currency.  The relative-strength index measures the velocity of price
changes to identify overbought or oversold conditions and
turning points. A sell signal is usually triggered when the
indicator rises past 70. An RSI value of 30 or less indicates it
may be time to buy the asset.  To contact the reporter on this story:
