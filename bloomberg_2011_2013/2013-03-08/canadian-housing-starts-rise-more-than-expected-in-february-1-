Canadian housing starts rose more
than expected in February after falling to their lowest since
the end of the 2009 recession.  The annual  pace  of work increased to 180,719 units from a
revised 158,998 in January, Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said
in a statement today from Ottawa. Economists forecast a reading
of 175,000, according to the median of 20 responses to a
Bloomberg News survey.  The country’s housing market is cooling after policy makers
took measures to curb mortgage lending last year amid concern
that a bubble was building in some markets. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened rules on government-insured mortgages in July
for the fourth time in four years, while the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the country’s banking
regulator, introduced tougher standards for mortgage lenders.  The February figures suggest the large drop in January was
“just winter-time noise,” Emanuella Enenajor, an economist at
 CIBC World Markets  in Toronto, said in a note to investors.
“Nonetheless, the broader trend of residential construction is
still tracking well below levels seen just a few months ago.”  Multiple-unit starts in urban areas rose 28 percent to
99,022 in February from 77,520 in January. Single-detached home
starts rose 6.1 percent. Urban housing starts in Ontario
increased 47 percent, and were up 35 percent in  Quebec .  To contact the reporter on this story:
