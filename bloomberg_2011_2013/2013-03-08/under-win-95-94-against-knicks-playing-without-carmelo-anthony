Kevin Durant  hit two free throws
with one minute, 38 seconds left in the game to secure a 95-94
victory for the Oklahoma City Thunder over the New York Knicks.  The Knicks were without  Carmelo Anthony , the second-leading
scorer behind Durant in the National Basketball Association, for
a second straight game since he injured his knee on March 4
against Cleveland.  The Thunder (45-16) top the Western Conference’s five-team
Northwest Division, 5 1/2 games ahead of the Denver Nuggets. The
Knicks (37-22) lead the Eastern Conference’s five-team Atlantic
Division by three games from the Brooklyn Nets.  Durant, who scored 12 of the Thunder’s 20 points in the
final quarter, led the Thunder with 34 points, while  Russell Westbrook  added 21 last night at Madison Square Garden in New
York.  J.R. Smith came off the bench to score 36 points for New
York, while Raymond Felton and Amar’e Stoudemire each added 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
