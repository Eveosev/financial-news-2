Spot gasoline weakened on the U.S.
 Gulf Coast  after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said it completed
maintenance at a refinery in  Corpus Christi , Texas.  Valero’s 210,000-barrel-a-day  Corpus Christi West plant 
finished a turnaround on a heavy oil cracker and is increasing
the unit toward planned rates, according to  Bill Day , a San
Antonio-based spokesman for the company. A fluid catalytic
cracker at Valero’s Texas City plant restarted after maintenance
commenced around March 6.  Conventional gasoline  on the Gulf Coast retreated 0.12 cent
to 25.75 cents a gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 10:36 a.m. on the East Coast. Reformulated gasoline
was unchanged at a discount of 21.5 cents a gallon.  Ultra-low-
sulfur diesel fuel  strengthened 0.25 cent to trade 8.25 cents a
gallon above heating oil futures.  The completion of turnarounds at the two Valero refineries
may add to Gulf Coast  motor fuel supplies . Inventories declined
2.1 million barrels to 73.4 million in the week ended March 1,
the lowest level since Oct. 26, according to Energy Information
Administration data.  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, a measure of  refining
profitability  for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , increased $1.16 to $32.71 a
barrel, the highest level since Feb. 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet
oil rose $2.36 to $12.71 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
