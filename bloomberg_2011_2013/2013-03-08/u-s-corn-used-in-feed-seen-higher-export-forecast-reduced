The amount of corn used for
 animal feed  in the U.S. will be 2.2 percent larger than
forecast a month ago as lower prices make the grain less
costly for feedlots, the government said. Estimated
 stockpiles  are unchanged as exports are forecast to fall.  Feed use for the year ending Aug 31. will be 4.55
billion bushels, compared with 4.45 billion projected in
February, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in
a  report . Exports will total 825 million bushels, down 8.3
percent from the month-ago forecast and the slowest pace
since 1972, the government said. Imports will rise, leaving
inventories at 632 million bushels. Analysts expected
stockpiles of 646 million bushels.  The projected cash price farmers receive dropped 10
cents to $7.10 a bushel from the February forecast, the
USDA said. Lower prices may reduce costs for hog processor
 Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  and ethanol producers such as Poet
LLC and  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  Last year, about 41
percent of the crop was processed into fuel and a byproduct
used as feed, topping the share used in animal feed -- 37
percent -- for a second straight year.  Corn Futures  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$6.9375 a bushel at 9:24 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices reached a record $8.49 on Aug. 10 as the
worst drought in more than 70 years threatened production,
eventually cutting the harvest 13 percent to the lowest
since 2006. Futures have plunged 18 percent since reaching
a record in August as the outlook for global supply
improved and high prices slowed overseas demand.  An estimated 4.5 billion bushels will be used to
produce ethanol, unchanged from the February forecast and
down from 5.011 billion in the previous year, the USDA
said. Feed demand will be little from a year earlier, the
agency said.  World Output  Aggregate world  output  for the marketing years that
began Sept. 1 in the U.S. and March 1 in  Brazil  will be
854.07 million tons, down from 854.38 million forecast a
month ago and 882.71 million last year, the USDA said.  Brazil’s estimated crop was unchanged from 72.5
million forecast in February and down from 73 million last
year.  Argentina ’s harvest was forecast at 26.5 million,
down from 27 million estimated a month ago and 21 million
tons last season.  Global consumption is expected to fall to 867.75
million tons from 879.61 million last year and 867.34
million forecast in February.  Worldwide  inventories  at the end of the marketing year
will be 117.48 million tons, down from 118.04 million
predicted a month ago, and down from 131.16 million a year
earlier, the USDA said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expected 117.46 million, on average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
