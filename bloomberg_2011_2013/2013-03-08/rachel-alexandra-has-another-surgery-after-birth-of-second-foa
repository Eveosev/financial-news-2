Rachel Alexandra , the 2009 Horse of
the Year, had an abscess drained in a second procedure following
the birth of her foal three weeks ago.  The 7-year-old mare had surgery Feb. 13 on her colon, which
was bruised during the birth of the 140-pound (63.5 kilogram)
filly, sired by 2006  Preakness Stakes  winner Bernardini.  Rachel Alexandra has been recovering at Rood and Riddle
Equine Clinic in Lexington,  Kentucky , and was alert with a good
appetite after the latest procedure, veterinarian Brett Woodie
said in a statement from her owner, Stonestreet Farm.  Rachel Alexandra gave birth to a 125-pound colt in 2012
that was sired by Curlin, who in 2008 became the first
thoroughbred since Cigar in 1996 to retain Horse of the Year
honors. Curlin captured the 2007  Breeders’ Cup Classic  and the
Preakness Stakes, the second event in racing’s Triple Crown.  Rachel Alexandra went undefeated in 2009, when she won the
Preakness after the late Jess Jackson, owner of Stonestreet Farm,
bought her.  She was retired in September 2010 without competing against
Zenyatta, the 2010 Horse of the Year, who won 19 of her 20
starts including the male-dominated Breeders’ Cup Classic in
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
