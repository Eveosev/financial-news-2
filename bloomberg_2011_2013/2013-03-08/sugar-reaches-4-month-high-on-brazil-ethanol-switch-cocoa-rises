Sugar climbed to a four-month high
in London on speculation millers in  Brazil , the world’s leading
producer, will make more ethanol at the expense of the sweetener
just as port congestion threatens to delay exports. Cocoa rose.  Sugar output in Brazil’s center south, the main growing
region, may be little changed from last year even as the cane
crop rises because producers are set to make more ethanol,
according to Deutsche Bank AG. As many as 199 ships were waiting
at Brazil’s main ports to load corn and soybeans, up from 190 a
week earlier, data from SA Commodities and Unimar Agenciamentos
Maritimos Ltda. showed. More loading of grains could delay
shipments of the sweetener when the harvest starts in April.  “Based on current economics, producers should favour
ethanol production through June 1,” Christina McGlone-Hahn, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a report e-mailed today,
recommending buying front-month raw sugar futures. “Vessel
line-ups are further delaying soybeans from leaving the
country.”  White sugar for May delivery was 0.7 percent higher at
$536.30 a metric ton by 11:23 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .
Earlier, the price touched $537.70 a ton, the highest since Oct.
23. Raw sugar for May delivery gained 0.1 percent to 18.79 cents
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  The sugar-cane crop in the center south may be 580 million
to 600 million tons this year, Deutsche Bank estimated. That
compares with 532 million tons a year earlier. Sugar output may
be as low as 34 million tons if taxes on ethanol are reduced,
prompting millers to make more of the biofuel, the bank said.
Output will be at most 36 million tons, it said.  Ethanol Tax  A reduction or partial removal of the ethanol tax may
prompt producers to maximize hydrous ethanol production in July
to August instead of shifting toward sugar, McGlone-Hahn said.
Hydrous ethanol is the 100 percent biofuel used in flex-fuel
cars.  The price of hydrous ethanol in sugar equivalent is 19.7
cents a pound, according to Deutsche Bank. That’s 4.8 percent
higher than raw sugar futures in  New York . For anhydrous
ethanol, the variety blended into gasoline, the price is 20
cents a pound, also higher than sugar futures.  Cocoa for May delivery rose 1.4 percent to 1,420 pounds
($2,136) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for May delivery rose 1.6
percent to $2,094 a ton on ICE.  Robusta coffee for delivery in May gained 0.2 percent to
$2,159 a ton in London. Arabica coffee for delivery in May slid
0.1 percent to $1.43 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
