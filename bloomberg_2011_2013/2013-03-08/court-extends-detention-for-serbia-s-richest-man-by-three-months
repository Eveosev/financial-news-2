Miroslav Miskovic, Serbia’s richest
man, will remain in detention for another three months as an
investigation continues into alleged corruption in the sale of
state road companies, a court in Belgrade said.  Miskovic, 67, and his son Marko will be detained until June
9, Mirjana Piljic, media coordinator for the  Court of Appeals  in
Belgrade, said by phone today. The prosecutors will have until
June 9 to raise an indictment “or they must be released,”
Piljic said by phone today.  The decision was made a day after the chief prosecutor for
organized crime, Miljko Radisavljevic, urged the Court of
Appeals yesterday to extend the detention.  Miskovic, the owner of closely-held Delta Holding, with
interests in insurance, agriculture and property development,
and his son were arrested on Dec. 12 on suspicion of illegally
earning more than 30 million euros ($39 million) in the sale of
state road companies. They have been kept in detention since
then to make sure they don’t flee the country nor “disturb the
public.”  Serbia  needs to step up the fight against corruption and
organized crime as part of efforts to convince the European
Union that it’s fit for membership talks. The government is
reviewing the sale of 24 companies after criticism from the
European Parliament and is waiting on a date to begin entry
negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
