Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG)  headed for its
biggest weekly drop in more than a year as five of 11 analysts
who had buy ratings on the stock changed their recommendations
after the oil producer’s production plunged.  Shares declined 23 percent this week to 11,440 pesos as of
1:25 p.m. in Bogota. They dropped 4.2 percent today.  “We are growing less confident in Petrominerales’s ability
to establish meaningful production improvements in 2013,” Jared Dziuba, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets Corp. in Calgary,
wrote in a March 6 research note after the company said output
fell 29 percent to an average 25,140 barrels a day in the fourth
quarter. Dziuba cut the stock to the equivalent of hold from
buy.  Production has further declined 11 percent in the first
quarter, according to a March 6 statement from Calgary-based
Petrominerales. The company said proven and probable reserves at
the end of 2012 declined 20 percent from the prior year to 41.3
million barrels.  Petrominerales started this week with 11 buy ratings, 10
holds and two sells. Today it has six buys, 14 holds and two
sells, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re not going to pretend that we’re happy with the
results we’ve generated on an exploration basis,” Chief
Executive Officer Corey Ruttan said on a March 6 conference
call. “We’re being a bit more balanced with our capital program
between developments, our core exploration and positioning plays
for the future.”  The “most meaningful” exploration and development
catalysts are later in the year or in 2014 and may be delayed by
funding challenges, according to Dzuiba.  The company “has not been able to grow or maintain
reserves despite a hefty  capital budget  in 2011 and 2012,” Ian Macqueen, an analyst at CIBC World Markets Inc. in Calgary who
rates Petrominerales the equivalent of hold, wrote in a March 6
research report. “Unless management truly believes that it can
materially improve its success rate it should not drill any more
exploration wells.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
