The Canadian dollar fluctuated
versus its U.S. counterpart before a report that may show the
jobless rate in the world’s 11th-largest economy increased.  The currency was little changed against the greenback as
Bloomberg surveys forecast Canada’s unemployment rate to rise to
7.1 percent in February as the nation added 8,000 jobs after
losing almost 22,000 in January. U.S. businesses added 165,000
workers in February and the unemployment rate stayed at 7.9
percent, separate surveys forecast.  “The U.S. figures are likely to be the bigger story, and
the Canadian dollar will react more to that,”  Camilla Sutton ,
head of currency strategy at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , said by phone
from Toronto.  Canada’s dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was little changed at C$1.0289 per
U.S. dollar at 8:15 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie buys 97.19 U.S.
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
