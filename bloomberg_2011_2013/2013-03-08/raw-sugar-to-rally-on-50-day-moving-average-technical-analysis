Raw-sugar futures, which climbed to
a one-month high yesterday, are set to extend gains after
climbing above the 50-day moving average, according to technical
analysis by Sucden Financial Ltd.  The attached chart shows sugar for delivery in May settled
at 18.77 cents a pound yesterday on ICE Futures U.S.  New York ,
closing above the 50-day moving average of 18.52 cents for the
first time this year. The pattern signals a rise to 19.8 cents,
said Myrto Sokou, a senior research analyst at Sucden.  “There’s strong upside momentum,” Sokou said yesterday in
a telephone interview from  London . The next target for prices is
19.02 cents, followed by 19.21 cents, she said.  Through yesterday, futures slumped 21 percent in the past
12 months amid expectations for a third consecutive global
surplus. Prices touched 18.81 cents yesterday, the highest since
Feb. 5, as port congestion threatened to delay shipments from
 Brazil , the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
