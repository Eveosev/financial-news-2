Australia ’s dollar fell after a
report today showed a bigger-than-expected decline in Chinese
imports, damping the outlook for the South Pacific nation’s
overseas shipments of commodities.  The  New Zealand dollar  and the so-called Aussie fell versus
most major peers after China’s customs administration said today
imports fell 15.2 percent in February from a year earlier, after
a 28.8 percent increase in January. China is the biggest trading
partner of both Australia and New Zealand. Australia’s bonds
fell, sending yields to a two-week high.  China’s trade report “is not great news for the Aussie
dollar,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in Auckland. “The thing people will be looking into is
why were imports so weak.”  The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0242 as of
4:46 p.m. in Sydney, paring its weekly gain to 0.4 percent. It
added 0.3 percent to 97.69 yen, after reaching 97.77, the most
since August 2008. New Zealand’s currency lost 0.3 percent to
82.56 U.S. cents, little changed since March 1. The so-called
kiwi gained 0.3 percent to 78.74 yen.  The median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  was for an 8.5 percent decline in Chinese imports. Exports
increased 21.8 percent, today’s data showed, compared with
economist estimates for an 8.1 percent advance.  “The 15 percent fall in imports is not great,” said
 Michael Turner , a fixed-income strategist in Sydney at Royal
Bank of  Canada . “There looks to have been a little bit of
weakness for  iron ore  in particular in February,” Turner said,
referring to Australia’s biggest export.  Iron Ore  The price of the key steelmaking ingredient fell to $146.30
a metric ton yesterday from a 16-month high of $158.90 on Feb.
20, according to a  gauge  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  Figures due tomorrow may indicate China’s industrial
production increased 10.3 percent last month from the same
period in 2012, a separate poll of economists showed.  The Aussie rose 1.4 percent in the past month, while its
New Zealand peer gained 0.8 percent, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes tracking 10 developed-nation
currencies.  Employers in the U.S. probably added 165,000 jobs last
month after increasing payrolls by 157,000 in January, according
to the median economist forecast before today’s Labor Department
report. The jobless rate held at 7.9 percent, the poll showed.  “Positive U.S. payrolls is positive for the Aussie
dollar,” said  Andrew Salter , a currency strategist at  Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in Sydney. “The outlook for
the Australian dollar remains that it’s very hard to construct a
case where the currency goes down by a material amount.”  Bonds Fall  Australia’s  10-year yield  rose as much as 11 basis points,
or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.56 percent, the highest since
Feb. 21. New Zealand’s  two-year swap rate , a fixed payment made
to receive floating rates that is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, was little changed at 3 percent.  Demand for the kiwi was supported by data showing New
Zealand’s budget deficit was narrower than forecast and house
prices rose the fastest since 2008.  The country’s operating deficit before gains and
losses was NZ$2.51 billion ($2.1 billion) in the seven months to
Jan. 31, the Treasury Department said in e-mailed statement.
Quotable Value  New Zealand  said annual house price inflation was
6.3 percent last month from 6.2 percent through January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
