Lithuanian  inflation  slowed in
February to the lowest in more than two years as the country
seeks to stabilize prices to qualify for euro adoption.  The inflation rate fell to 2.2 percent from a year earlier,
the lowest since September 2010, the  statistics office  in the
capital, Vilnius, said in an e-mailed statement today. Consumer
prices were unchanged from January.  The government has said the main hurdle to adopting the
European Unionâ€™s common currency at the start of 2015 was
slowing inflation to below an EU limit. Lithuania would probably
be the last of the three Baltic countries to join the euro
region, with Estonia making the switch in 2011 and  Latvia 
planning to follow suit next year.  Lower heating costs and seasonal discounts on clothing and
footwear offset rising fuel prices in February, according to the
statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
