Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) , the largest
U.S. natural-foods grocer, said it will label products to
indicate whether they contain genetically modified organisms.  Whole Foods stores in the U.S. and  Canada  will label all
food in the next five years, the Austin, Texas-based chain said
in a statement today. The company, which sells about 3,300 non-
genetically modified items, last year supported a measure in
California that would have mandated genetically engineered foods
to be labeled as such. Proposition 37 failed.  “We’re responding to our customers who have consistently
asked us for GMO labeling and we are doing so by focusing on
where we have control: in our own stores,” co-Chief Executive
Officer Walter Robb said in the statement.  Whole Foods, which has recently announced plans to begin
opening locations in food deserts, has outperformed the
 competition . Its shares advanced 31 percent last year, compared
with a 7.4 percent gain for  Kroger Co. (KR)  and a 14 percent drop for
 Safeway Inc. (SWY) , the largest and second-largest U.S. grocery-store
chains, respectively.  There are about 345 Whole Foods locations in the U.S.,
Canada and the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
