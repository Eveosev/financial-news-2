(Corrects to remove reference to energy shares in the
second paragraph.)  Investors should favor U.S. equities
over European or emerging-market shares, according to Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.’s private wealth-management unit.  She said she’s bullish on bank shares because they are
cheap even after the industry in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rallied 8.1 percent this year. The group has a price-earnings
ratio of 11, compared with 15.3 for the U.S. equity benchmark,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “U.S. equities, in the long-run, are the place where
clients should have their core assets, relative to Europe or
emerging markets,” Mossavar-Rahmani said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television.  Mossavar-Rahmani recommended investors underweight
 government bonds  and predicted inflation will remain low.
Investors shouldn’t expect stocks to return as much as they have
in the past few years, she said. The  S&P 500  is up 129 percent
since March 9, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
