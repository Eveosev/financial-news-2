exports by  China , the top user of the industrial metal, grew
more than expected, adding to signs of the global economic
recovery. Zinc, tin and lead also rose.  The metal for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.2
percent to $7,783 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,772 at 12:18 p.m. Seoul time. The price is up 1
percent this week. Futures for delivery in June rose 0.5 percent
to 56,800  yuan  ($9,139) a ton on the Shanghai exchange.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold swung between advances and declines before a report
that is forecast to show the U.S. labor market improved, damping
expectations for further stimulus and boosting the dollar.
Silver fell.  Bullion for immediate delivery traded at $1,579.40 an ounce
at 3:20 p.m. in Singapore from $1,578.97 yesterday. The metal is
up 0.2 percent this week following a four-week slump. Silver
slid 0.2 percent to $28.8625 an ounce, also retreating for a
second day. The dollar strengthened against a six-currency
basket before the report that may show U.S. employers added more
jobs in February.  The same economic optimism that depressed gold is boosting
platinum and palladium, which are used in the auto and other
industries, Dooley said. Platinum gained 0.4 percent to
$1,601.50 an ounce, and was set for a 1.8 percent increase this
week, snapping three weeks of declines. Palladium was little
changed at $758.05 an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans climbed after export sales from the U.S. jumped to
the highest level since January before a government report that
may show global supplies will decline.  The contract for delivery in May rose as much as 0.4
percent to $14.79 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was
at $14.7875 by 1:31 p.m. in Singapore, on a trading volume that
was 57 percent less than the 100-day average for that time of
day. Futures are set for a 2.4 percent advance this week.  Corn for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to $6.93 a bushel,
set for a 2.2 percent loss this week. That puts soybeans at 2.13
times the cost of corn, compared with an average of 2.43 times
in the past decade. Both compete for acreage.  Wheat for May delivery was little changed at $6.9575 a
bushel, poised for a weekly loss of 3.4 percent.  Palm oil headed for the biggest weekly gain in more than a
month on speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia , the world’s
second-largest producer, may decline as demand rebounds.  The contract for May delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent
to 2,451 ringgit ($789) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, before trading at 2431 ringgit at 11:37 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures have advanced 2.7 percent this week, the biggest
such increase since the five days ended Feb. 1.  Rubber booked the best weekly gain this year as Japan’s
currency slid to the lowest level in three-and-a-half years
against the dollar, boosting the appeal of yen-denominated
contracts.  The contract for delivery in August jumped 2.3 percent to
298.2 yen a kilogram ($3,127 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, the highest settlement since Feb. 20.
Futures advanced 5 percent this week, the best performance since
the week through Dec. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
