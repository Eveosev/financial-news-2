The weather will continue to be
“calm” and “air dispersion will remain poor,” causing the
air pollution indexes in Hong Kong to be at very high levels in
the next couple of days, the city’s Environmental Protection
Department said in a statement on the government website.  The roadside pollution  index  was 189 for  Causeway Bay , 177
in the Central business district and 132 in  Mong Kok  as of 8
a.m. local time today, according to the statement.  The government recommends people with heart or respiratory
illnesses and the elderly and children to avoid outdoor
activities when the pollution index reading rises above 100.  To contact the reporter on this story:
