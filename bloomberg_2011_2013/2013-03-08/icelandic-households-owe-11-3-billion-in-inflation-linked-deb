Icelandic household owed the
country’s domestic lenders 1.43 trillion kronur ($11.3 billion)
in loans that are indexed to inflation, according to a statement
posted on the island’s parliament’s  website  late yesterday.  Icelandic corporations owed the equivalent of 30.9 percent
of the country’s economic output, or 470 billion kronur.
Households saw their debts rise by a combined 6.7 billion kronur
from Feb. 1, 2010, to Jan. 31, 2013, due to inflationary
pressures from rising taxes. At the same time, corporate debt
rose by 2.5 billion kronur for the same reason, according to the
