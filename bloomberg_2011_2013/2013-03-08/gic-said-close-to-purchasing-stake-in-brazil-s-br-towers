Government of Singapore Investment
Corp. , manager of more than $100 billion of the city’s reserves,
is close to a deal to buy a 20 percent stake in BR Towers SA,
the Brazilian operator of cellular towers, two people with
direct knowledge of the transaction said.  Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund is making the investment
to profit from  Brazil ’s increased spending on infrastructure,
according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the deal is private. GIC’s Twickenham Investment Pte.
unit is handling the acquisition, the person said.  GIC’s press office didn’t return calls left on its
answering machine after office hours and didn’t respond to  text
messages . BR Towers Chief Executive Officer Mauricio Giusti
didn’t respond to e-mails and a telephone call.  Private-equity firm  GP Investments Ltd. (GPIX)  created Sao Paulo-
based  BR Towers  after it agreed in September to buy about 2,000
telecommunications towers in Brazil for 503 million reais ($258
million). Last month, Sitesharing Brasil SA agreed to purchase a
15 percent stake in BR Towers for an undisclosed amount.  Cade, Brazil’s antitrust regulator,  said  today it approved
a transaction involving BR Towers and Twickenham without giving
details of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
