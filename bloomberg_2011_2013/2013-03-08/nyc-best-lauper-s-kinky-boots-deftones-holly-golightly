curators, collectors and critics who’ve come from all over the
world for the action surrounding the Armory Show, named after
the seminal 1913 exhibition.  More than 200 galleries bring their wares to giant spaces
on the Hudson. Pier 92 is devoted to newer works, while Pier 94

smart -- and telekinetic -- schoolgirl.  Directed by the clever  Matthew Warchus , the hit London

parents, teaches herself Russian so she can read Dostoevsky in
the original.  Matilda soon realizes how to fight back against oppressive

from robes, their bodies supported by thin poles.  Nothing will ever change.  The German artist conceived the work in response to
