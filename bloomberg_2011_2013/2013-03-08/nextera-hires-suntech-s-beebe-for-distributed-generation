NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
U.S. wind-power operator, hired solar industry executive Andrew Beebe as vice president of distributed generation.  Beebe was previously chief commercial officer at Suntech
Power Holdings Co., the world’s biggest solar-panel maker by
shipments in 2011. The Wuxi, China-based company said Sept. 7 he
was resigning for personal reasons.  Steven Stengel, a  NextEra spokesman, confirmed in an e-
mail today that Beebe has joined the Juno Beach, Florida-based
company. He wouldn’t say when Beebe was hired or describe his
