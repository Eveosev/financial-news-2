U.S. stocks pared early gains that
sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to within 1 percent of its
record as faster-than-forecast growth in payrolls spurred
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will curtail its stimulus
efforts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.1 percent at
1,545.41 at 10:06 a.m. in New York after rising as much as 0.5
percent to 1,551.65 earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
