OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, gained for a fourth day after saying lending may expand
this year and dividend payments may rise.  The  shares rose  as much as 2.1 percent before paring their
gain to 0.1 percent at 4,841 forint by close in Budapest. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  added 0.2 percent.  OTP may see a “moderate” increase in foreign currency-
adjusted loans and provisioning for bad loans may decrease,
Chief Financial Officer Laszlo Bencsik said today. The bank may
propose a dividend of 120 to 121 forint per share after the 2012
business year, from 101.7 forint per share last year, Bencsik
said according to state news service MTI.  OTP’s results show “promising” trends as the rise in bad
loans seems to have halted and foreign subsidiaries “perform
excellently,” Zsolt Kondrat, chief analyst at Budapest-based
MKB Bank Zrt. said in an e-mail today.  OTP posted net  income  of 26.1 billion forint ($115 million)
in the fourth quarter after a loss of 25.8 billion forint a year
earlier, the bank said today. Analysts expected a profit of 30.4
billion forint in the last quarter, according to a Bloomberg
poll of nine analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
