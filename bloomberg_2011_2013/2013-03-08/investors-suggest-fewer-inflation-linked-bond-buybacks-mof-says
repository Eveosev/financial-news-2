Many investors said buybacks of
inflation-indexed bonds should be reduced amid rising inflation
expectations, according to Ministry of Finance officials.  Some investors and primary dealers obliged to bid at
government debt sales suggested cutting monthly purchases of so-
called linkers to 20 billion yen ($209 million) from 30 billion
yen, ministry officials told reporters in Tokyo today after
consulting with bond auction participants. Others suggested
eliminating buybacks in months when the  Bank of Japan (8301)  is
conducting market operations, the officials said.  Japan ’s  five-year breakeven rate , derived from the
difference between government bond yields and those on
inflation-linked debt, rose to 1.42 percentage points today, the
highest on record going back to 2009.  A majority of the investors and primary dealers said they
expect yields to continue to decline as the central bank begins
additional monetary easing under the next central bank governor.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has nominated Asian Development
Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda as the next Bank of Japan
governor to spearhead a drive to boost growth and achieve 2
percent inflation.  Japan’s benchmark 10-year bond  yield  fell 2 1/2 basis
points, or 0.025 percentage point, to close at 0.65 percent
today, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
