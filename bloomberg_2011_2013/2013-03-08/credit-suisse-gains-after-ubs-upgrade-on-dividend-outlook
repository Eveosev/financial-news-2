Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, rose in Swiss trading after
it was raised to a buy rating from neutral by a UBS AG analyst,
who cited the company’s “solid” capital ratios and dividend
outlook.  Credit Suisse  gained  as much as 3.6 percent, and was 2.3
percent higher at 25.57 francs by 10:16 a.m. The stock has
climbed 27 percent in the past six months.  “Credit Suisse is, in our view, well advanced in its
multi-year transition program,” UBS analyst Daniele Brupbacher
wrote in a note. “It is one of the first large banks to operate
under a Basel 3-compliant business model. Credit Suisse will
soon start to accrue a meaningful cash dividend.”  Credit Suisse Chief Financial Officer David Mathers said
last month the bank plans to make “significant cash
distributions” once its core capital ratio under Swiss rules
surpasses 10 percent, which the company expects to happen around
the middle of this year. The bank proposed to pay 10 centimes in
cash and 65 centimes in shares as its dividend for 2012 after
letting shareholders choose the previous year whether they
wanted 75 centimes a share in cash or in stock to help the
company build up capital ratios.  Brupbacher raised earnings estimates for Zurich-based
Credit Suisse by 2 percent, 8 percent and 7 percent for 2012 and
the following two years and also increased the price target for
the shares to 34 francs from 27.5 francs previously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
