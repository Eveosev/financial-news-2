Brazil  will provide funding for
electricity distributors such as  Light SA (LIGT3)  and  Eletropaulo
Metropolitana Eletricidade de Sao Paulo SA  after an increase in
the use of thermo plants amid low dam levels pushed up costs.  “We are going to help out the distributor companies hurt
by the use of thermo plants,” Energy Minister Edison Lobao told
reporters in Brasilia today. “We are using money from a fund
collected by energy sector fees to pay for the use of thermo
plants.”  The so-called CDE industry development account will provide
funding for distributors, according to a decree published today
in official gazette. The program is designed to avoid passing on
higher generation costs to consumers. Distributors have lost 5
billion reais ($2.55 billion) since October, wiping out gains
anticipated from a government initiative to cut energy expenses,
according to an estimate from the Distributors Association,
known as Abradee.  “We have 11 billion reais from funds from electricity
sector fees and this will be enough for this,” National
Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
