Brazil  will cut federal taxes on
basic foods in a bid to tame inflation, after a report showed
today consumer prices rose more than analysts forecast for an
eighth straight month, according to a government official with
knowledge of the decision.  President  Dilma Rousseff  will announce the measure in a
nationally-televised speech tonight, said the official, who
asked not to be named because the decision isn’t public yet.  A weaker currency, record low  borrowing  costs and $23
billion in tax cuts failed to kick-start the economy last year.
Instead, the measures helped fuel  inflation . By cutting taxes on
food, Rousseff will rein in consumer prices at the same time
that she stimulates the economy, the official said.  Consumer prices  rose  0.6 percent in February, above the
0.49 percent  forecast  from 44 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg,
the national statistics agency said in Rio de Janeiro today.
Annual inflation quickened to 6.31 percent and has exceeded the
central bank’s 4.5 percent target for 30 months. Economists
forecast 2013 inflation at 5.7 percent, according to the median
estimate in the most recent central bank survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
