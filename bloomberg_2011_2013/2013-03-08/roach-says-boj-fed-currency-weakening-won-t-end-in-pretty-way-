Stephen Roach , a senior fellow at
 Yale University  and former non-executive chairman for Morgan
Stanley in Asia, comments on the effect of quantitative easing
policies on currencies.  Roach spoke in an interview with Zeb Eckert on Bloomberg
Television’s “First Up.”  “Whether it’s the  Bank of Japan (8301) , the Federal Reserve or
even the ECB, the idea that they can engineer economic recovery
by quantitative easing that may lead to weaker currencies
ultimately is not a story that will end in a pretty way.
Currency devaluation as a recipe for economic growth always
comes at a cost of taking market share from someone else.”  “China is understandably concerned about that, as has been
Brazil, as has been most major developing economies that rely on
exports as a source of economic growth.”  “The developed economies say, well we’re not trying to
depreciate our currencies, but they know this is going to
happen.”  “This is one of the unintended and potentially dangerous
consequences of the financial engineering of quantitative
easing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
