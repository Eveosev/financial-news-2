Alitalia SpA, whose Chief Executive
Officer  Andrea Ragnetti  resigned last month after the full-year
loss widened, said it plans to break even in 2013.  Italy’s biggest carrier is focused on improving liquidity
after investors backed a plan to raise 150 million euros ($195
million) in debt, it said in a statement, with the financial
performance having met expectations in the first two months.  Alitalia has also begun the process of finding a new chief,
the Rome-based company said, citing a briefing given to managers
by Chairman Roberto Colaninno, who is also acting CEO. Los
Angeles-based  Korn/Ferry International (KFY)  has been hired to aid the
search, it added, without giving a timescale for an appointment.  The airline plans to add flights at its Rome Fiumicino
airport hub after modifying the network. Adjustments include
concentrating flights to the  New York  area at John F. Kennedy
airport and scrapping flights to Newark in New Jersey.  Alitalia’s loss widened to 280 million euros last year from
69 million euros in 2011, though it reached break-even in the
fourth quarter. Colaninno’s investor group CAI, which includes
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Italy’s second-biggest bank, and  Atlantia
SpA (ATL) , its top toll-road company, bought the carrier’s main assets
in 2008 and combined them with smaller competitor Air One SpA.  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group, Europe’s biggest airline, owns 25
percent of Alitalia stock, with the rest in Italian hands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
