Former European Central Bank
Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the ECB may cut
interest rates if the economy doesn’t gain momentum later this
year.  “Growth is not picking up,” Bini Smaghi said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television from Cernobbio,  Italy ,
today. “If we don’t see prospects for a recovery toward the
second half of the year, as is expected currently, some changes
in the monetary policy will come.”  The ECB yesterday cut its economic forecasts and now
expects gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area to
shrink 0.5 percent this year before growing 1 percent in 2014.
Inflation, which the ECB aims to keep just below 2 percent, will
slow to 1.3 percent next year, according to the new projections.
While lowering borrowing costs was discussed, the “prevailing
consensus” to leave the benchmark rate at 0.75 percent, ECB
President Mario Draghi said.  Asked whether the reforms passed by the Italian government
will help the euro area’s third-largest economy find its way
back to economic growth, Bini Smaghi said: “No, I don’t think
so.” The country needs “to continue reforms,” he said.  “We are coming out of a huge overhang of debt, so the
recovery we know will take time,” Bini Smaghi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
