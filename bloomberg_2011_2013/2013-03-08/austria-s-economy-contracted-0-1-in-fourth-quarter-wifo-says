Austria’s economy contracted in the
fourth quarter after lower demand for goods in the euro area
slowed exports, the government-backed Wifo economic research
institute said.  Fourth-quarter gross domestic product shrank 0.1 percent
after stagnating in the third quarter, Wifo said today in an e-
mailed statement. Exports declined 0.3 percent and consumer
demand fell 0.1 percent.  The contraction was less than the 0.2 percent estimate
published by Wifo Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
