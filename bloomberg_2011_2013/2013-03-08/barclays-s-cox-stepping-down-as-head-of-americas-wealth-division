Mitch Cox, head of wealth management
for the Americas at  Barclays Plc (BARC) , is leaving the London-based
bank.  Cox resigned to pursue his own interests, Will Bowen, a
Barclays spokesman, said today in an e-mail. He had led the
business since July 2009. An e-mail sent to Cox’s work address
bounced back.  The wealth division oversees about $277 billion around the
world,  according to its website.  Thomas Kalaris, who’s been with
Barclays since 1996, remains the global head of the wealth unit.  The Wall Street Journal reported Cox’s departure earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
