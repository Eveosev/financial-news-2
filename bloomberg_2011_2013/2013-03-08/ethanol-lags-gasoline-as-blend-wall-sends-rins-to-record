Ethanol weakened against gasoline as
the value of renewable identification numbers for the corn-based
biofuel jumped to a record on concern production and consumption
won’t meet U.S. targets.  The spread expanded 0.42 cent to 69.15 cents a gallon a day
after prices for RINs jumped to a record 90.5 cents from 77
cents on March 6, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Refiners use
RINs, the certificates that help the Environmental Protection
Agency track whether refiners are meeting federal biofuel-use
mandates, in lieu of blending a physical gallon of ethanol.
Stagnant gasoline demand plus higher ethanol consumption targets
is known as the “blend wall.”  “It’s the blend wall that’s holding it back,” said Will
Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,
 Illinois . “You can see that in the RINs rather than it actually
being blended.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 7.6 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $2.512 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest settlement since Sept. 7. The gain was the biggest in
five months. Prices have gained 15 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery advanced 8.02 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $3.2035 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Advanced RINs  The value of Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, jumped to a record 84 cents
yesterday from 79 cents the previous day.  Corn-based conventional RINs traded above the advanced
variety for the first time yesterday.  Ethanol  production  has dropped 16 percent to 805,000
barrels a day in the week ended March 1 from a record 963,000
barrels in December 2011, data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration show.  That’s 12.3 billion gallons on an annualized basis and
short of the 13.8 billion gallons refiners are required to use
this year.  Drought in the Midwest devastated corn crops and raised
production costs for the fuel, forcing at least 20 plants to
idle since June, according to data from the  Renewable Fuels
Association  in  Washington .  Corn for March delivery added 13.75 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $7.2525 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. The May contract gained 12.25 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $7.035 a bushel.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
8 cents a gallon, up from minus 11 cents yesterday. The amount
doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to
livestock.  Stockpiles fell to 19.4 million barrels a day last week,
about 12 percent lower than a year ago, and production was 11
percent lower than last year, the EIA said in the March 6
report.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, the highest level since Oct. 5,
according to data from the EIA, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  In cash market trading, ethanol soared in the major trading
hubs, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol on the West Coast, the most expensive hub, jumped
14 cents to $2.765 a gallon, in  New York  the additive climbed 6
cents to $2.58, in Chicago it added 5 cents to $2.46 and in the
U.S. Gulf the fuel jumped 5.5 cents to $2.52 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf ballooned to 24.5
cents, the highest since July 23, while Chicago’s discount to
New York rose to 12 cents, the most since March 4, from 11 cents
the previous day.  The country last week didn’t make any foreign purchases of
the fuel for the first time since Feb. 1, the EIA report showed.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.42 a gallon last week,
cheaper than today’s futures price, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
