Iron ore imports  by China, the
world’s biggest buyer, dropped 13 percent in February as Chinese
New Year holidays and high prices slowed buying.  Imports totaled 56.42 million metric tons in February,
China’s General Administration of Customs said today on its
 website . Shipments declined from 64.98 million tons a year ago
and were 14 percent lower than the 65.54 million tons recorded
in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Activity slowed as businesses closed for the holidays,
which ended Feb. 15.  Imported ore prices , which reached their
highest in 16 months at $158.9 a dry ton on Feb. 20, have
deterred Chinese steelmakers from purchases, Mysteel.com analyst
Chen Zhenxing said.  Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Tianjin added 0.3
percent to $146.3 a dry ton yesterday, according to data from
the Steel Index Ltd. Prices have surged 69 percent from an
almost three-year low reached in September.  China’s iron ore imports fell 1.5 percent to 122 million
tons in the first two months of this year from a year ago, the
General Administration of Customs said.  Steel-product exports  were 4.24 million tons in February,
customs said. Shipments surged 29 percent to 9.16 million tons
for the first two months.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
