China may sign the first foreign
orders for its CAP1400 nuclear reactor this year, the  China
Daily  reported today, citing Sun Qin, chairman of the nation’s
largest atomic plant builder.  The first orders for the Chinese-developed technology will
probably come from  South America  or Asia and may be finalized if
a CAP1400 reactor begins construction in China by the end of the
year, the newspaper said. Sun, chairman of China National
Nuclear Corp., declined to identify specific countries.  The Chinese technology is attractive because of the
“favorable and unconditional” credit conditions offered to
other nations, according to the  report . CNNC didn’t immediately
respond to faxed questions about the loans or the countries that
are interested in buying reactors.  Gu Jun, general manager of State Nuclear Power Technology
Corp., said on Feb. 1 in Beijing that “exploration of the
global market” for the CAP1400 will start this year. SNPTC is
China’s state-owned nuclear technology company.  The CAP1400 reactor is based on  Toshiba Corp’s (6502)  Westinghouse
AP1000 design. China was the first country to start construction
of the so-called third generation reactor, and later increased
the power it can produce from 1,000 megawatts to 1,400 megawatts
with an eye toward exports.  China may account for more than half of the nuclear
capacity built between 2010 and 2020 worldwide, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. Chinese companies will have a “strong
domestic playing field to raise their profile,” helping them to
become key competitors globally,  Michael Tong , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a May 2012 note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
