Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s
largest lender by assets, is in talks to hire Steve Oplinger,
the former co-head of U.S. high-yield sales for  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) , according to three people familiar with the matter.  Oplinger would start in April running U.S. high-yield sales
and trading, said one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions aren’t public. A contract may
be signed as soon as next week.  Reached on his mobile phone, Oplinger declined to comment,
as did Elisa Barsotti, an RBC spokeswoman in New York.  RBC is expanding its credit brokerage in the U.S., rising
to the 11th most-active underwriter this year of dollar-
denominated  junk bonds  from 17th place in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of high-yield, high-risk, or
junk, bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s , reached a record $358.9
billion in 2012.  A managing director at Credit Suisse, Oplinger departed
Switzerland’s second-biggest bank in January amid a disagreement
over his group’s compensation, two people briefed on the matter
said at the time. He earlier worked at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp., according to  records  with the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That firm was acquired
by Credit Suisse in 2000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
