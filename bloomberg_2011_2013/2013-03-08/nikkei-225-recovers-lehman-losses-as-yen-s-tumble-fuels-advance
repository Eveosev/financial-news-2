Japanese  stocks  rose last week,
erasing losses from the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., as the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average capped a 42
percent rally since mid-November.  The Nikkei 225 rose 2.6 percent yesterday to close at
12,283.62, a level not seen since before Lehman filed for
 bankruptcy protection  Sept. 15, 2008. After weathering a record
earthquake and tsunami, nuclear meltdowns and a surge in the
yen,  Japan  is the last of the five biggest equity markets to
recover to pre-crisis levels.  About  $1.4 trillion  has been restored to the Nikkei 225
from its lowest level in March 2009 after the U.S.’s biggest
bankruptcy plunged the world into financial crisis. The measure
has gained for all but one  week  since November on optimism that
new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his nominee for Bank of Japan
governor,  Haruhiko Kuroda , will succeed in ending deflation.  “Now you have a government very keen on ending deflation
and a BOJ governor who says Japan can and should do anything,”
said Nader Naeimi, the Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset
allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages $126
billion. “As the healing process continues, shares continue to
regain lost ground. It’s been long, but at least we’re finally
there.”  Japan’s recovery from the Lehman shock was hampered by a
surge in the yen that accelerated after the country was struck
in March 2011 by a record earthquake that triggered a tsunami
and the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.  The yen touched a post-war record of 75.35 per dollar in
October 2011, prompting Toyota Motor Corp. President  Akio Toyoda 
to warn that Japan’s automobile industry faced collapse if its
strength continued.  Turning Point  The currency has tumbled 16 percent since Nov. 14, when
elections were announced that swept Abe to power on a platform
of  government spending  and monetary easing to spur growth.
That’s the biggest drop in a measure of 10 developed nations’
currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes. The yen’s decline drove the Nikkei 225 to record its
longest streak of weekly gains since 1959 last month.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a carmaker that gets 77 percent of sales
overseas, has led the Nikkei’s rally, surging 190 percent as the
currency’s drop boosted the value of overseas sales when
repatriated. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the country’s NO. 3
shipping line, surged 130 percent.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the second-biggest brokerage
in Japan, more than doubled during the period on speculation
surging share trading volume will boost commissions. Just  three 
companies in the Nikkei 225 retreated.  Conservative Forecasts  Abe’s new government unveiled a 10.3 trillion yen ($107.5
billion) fiscal stimulus budget that it said Jan. 11 will add 2
percentage points to gross domestic product and create 600,000
jobs. The premier convinced the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to double its
inflation target and Kuroda has pledged to do whatever it takes
to end 15 years of deflation.  “Given the rapid weakening of the yen, we think corporate
profit targets are conservative and think upward revisions are
likely to continue to have the edge over downward ones,”
Citigroup Inc. strategist Kenji Abe wrote in a report dated
March 1.  About 64 percent of Nikkei 225 companies beat analyst
earnings projections for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Bloomberg
data show. Profits for the Nikkei 225 are  expected  to increase
20 percent in the next 12 months, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings projections from some of Japan’s biggest companies
have also increased, with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest automaker and Japan’s biggest company by market value,
leading a revival among the nation’s exporters.  Japan Tobacco  Toyota raised its profit forecast to a five-year high on
Feb. 5. The company joined  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) ,  Asia ’s largest
listed tobacco maker, and  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest maker
of cameras, in boosting their outlook because of the weaker yen.
All three companies’ shares have surged at least 39 percent
since mid-November.  Even while the Nikkei 225 has gained, valuations for the
Nikkei 225 are still below its global peers. The measure trades
for 1.49 times the  book value  of its companies’ assets, compared
with 1.42 on the last trading day before Lehman collapsed. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trades for 2.14 times the value of
net assets, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index is priced at 1.53 times
and the  Hang Seng Index  is at 1.53.  “Japan has the potential to catch up with its earnings if
the yen continues in its weakening trend,” said Hiromichi Tamura, chief Japan equity strategist for Nomura Holdings Inc.
“Japan has faced many adversities, such as the earthquake,
strong yen and floods in  Thailand . If the reasons for Japan
being late are removed, then Japan definitely has the potential
to catch up.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
