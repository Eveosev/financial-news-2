Treasuries fell, poised for their
steepest weekly loss since the start of the year, as U.S. stock
futures rose and economists said a report today will show the
nation added jobs, undermining demand for the safest assets.  Benchmark 10-year yields rose to the  highest level  in two
weeks after data yesterday showed initial claims for  jobless
benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped to a six-week low.
 China ’s  exports  exceeded forecasts in February, a government
report today showed, indicating that improving global demand may
help to sustain the rebound in the world’s second-biggest
economy. U.S. stock futures climbed, indicating the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index will extend a 5 1/2-year high.  “It all hangs on payrolls today,” said  Marc Ostwald , a
rates strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in  London .
“Expectations have been pumped up so much ahead of the report
that we would need to see a really good number to make markets
more optimistic. There’s a slightly optimistic spin on the  U.S.
economy . Treasury yields have drifted higher.”  Benchmark Treasury 10-year  yields  rose two basis points to
2.02 percent at 6:58 a.m.  New York  time, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader data. That’s the highest level since Feb. 21. The
rate has increased 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point,
 this week , the most since the period ended Jan. 4. The 2 percent
note due in February 2023 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 7/8.  Yield Spread  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold U.S. 10-year notes
instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened to 51 basis
points, the most since January 2011, according to closing-price
data compiled by Bloomberg. The so-called spread was as narrow
as four basis points in June.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4
percent. The  S&P 500  has rallied 1.7 percent this week, on
course for the biggest gain in two months.  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss this
year, while bonds in an index of sovereign securities around the
world were little changed, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  The U.S. added 165,000 jobs in February after a 157,000
gain in January, according to the median estimate of 90
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Labor
Department reports the figure at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . The
 jobless rate  held at 7.9 percent, a separate survey showed.  Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yields increased three
basis points on Feb. 1 when payrolls grew and revisions showed
bigger gains in prior months.  Rising Volatility  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index, a gauge of
price swings in U.S. government securities, shows volatility is
rising ahead of the employment report.  The index has climbed for three days, and reached 60.50
basis points yesterday, the highest level since Feb. 13. Its
average over the past year is 66.43 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ten-year yields will decline to 1.86 percent by March 31
and then rise to 2.29 percent by year-end, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists, with the most recent projections
given the heaviest weightings.  “Two percent is a critical level,” said Kim Youngsung,
head of fixed income in  Seoul  at Samsung Asset Management Co.,
 South Korea ’s largest private bond investor with the equivalent
of $103.7 billion in assets. “You may get buyers at that
level.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
