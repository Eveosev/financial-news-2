Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
erased losses from the collapse of  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc.
after the yen slid to a 3 1/2-year low against the dollar and
data showed Japan’s economy returned to growth.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 28 percent of its
sales in  North America , advanced 5.8 percent.  Fast Retailing
Co. (9983) , Asia’s biggest apparel chain and the most heavily weighted
company on the Nikkei 225, jumped 9.8 percent. Sekisui House
Ltd. surged 15 percent after the builder forecast a gain. GS
Yuasa Corp., which makes batteries for Boeing Co., surged 6.4
percent after preproduction tests of batteries on the 787
Dreamliner showed remote risks of fire.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2.6 percent to close at 12,283.62 in
Tokyo, the highest since before Lehman Brothers filed for
bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008. Volume was 43 percent above the
30-day average. The broader Topix Index rose 1.6 percent to
1,020.50, with about three stocks rising for each that fell.  “You have a government very keen on ending deflation,”
said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation 
at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages $126 billion. “As
the healing process continues, shares continue to regain lost
ground. It’s been long, but at least we’re finally there.”  Abe, BOJ  The Nikkei 225 surged 42 percent from Nov. 14 on optimism
the new government will beat deflation, with Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe nominating easing-proponent Haruhiko Kuroda to lead
the  Bank of Japan . The equity benchmark’s gain in the period

a 13 percent rally for China’s Shanghai Composite Index and a 14
percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The Nikkei 225 is  trading  at 1.48 times  book value ,
compared with 2.14 for the S&P 500 and 1.53 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. The Nikkei 225 was at 1.35 times book value on Sept.
12, 2008, the last trading day before the Lehman Brothers crash.  Mazda led the rally, surging 144 percent since Nov. 14 as
the yen’s 16 percent drop against the dollar boosted the
earnings outlook for exporters.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) ,
Japan’s third-biggest shipping line, soared 93 percent in the
period.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) , the nation’s second-largest
brokerage, jumped 71 percent.  Return to Growth  Shares rose today as the nation exited technical recession.

weighted stock on the Nikkei 225, rose 2.4 percent to 14,380
yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  were little changed today. The
U.S. equity gauge yesterday gained 0.2 percent and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed to another record as the number of
Americans who filed for  unemployment benefits  fell to a six-week
low.  Yen Weakens  “The yen seems to be falling on an improvement in the  U.S.
economy  and rising yields rather than on expectations for the
Bank of Japan,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-
based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of
about 6 trillion yen ($63 billion).  Exporters to the U.S. rose after the yen reached 95.44
against the dollar, the weakest since August 2009, boosting
overseas earnings.  Mazda gained 5.8 percent to 310 yen today. Nintendo Co., a
gaming-console maker that depends on the Americas for 39 percent
of its sales, soared 8 percent to 10,370 yen.  Sekisui House  Sekisui House surged 15 percent to 1,245 yen, its biggest
gain in 22 years. The builder expects net income to rise 36

maker’s equity rating was raised to outperform at Credit Suisse
Group AG.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 6.2 percent

on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Nikkei 225 options
