Serbia won’t accept limits to
public-sector wages and pensions in expected talks with the
 International Monetary Fund  on a loan program,  Vecernje Novosti 
newspaper reported, citing Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic .  The talks are expected in May following fresh data on
budget revenue, industrial output and exports and after checking
the preparedness of everyone in the government for changes that
may be required by the IMF, according to the report.  The state cannot expect its people to “make sacrifices to
the rest of their live,” the newspaper quoted Dinkic as saying
on the possible pension and wage cap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
