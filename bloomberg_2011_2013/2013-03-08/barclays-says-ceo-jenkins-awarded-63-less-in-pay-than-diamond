Barclays Plc (BARC)  awarded Chief Executive
Officer Antony Jenkins 2.3 million pounds ($3.5 million) last
year and said fewer staff earned a million pounds than in 2011
as the British bank responds to public pressure and cuts costs.  Jenkins earned 63 percent less in salary and long-term
bonuses than his ousted predecessor  Robert Diamond  did in 2011,
though he was CEO for only the final four months of 2012.
 Britain’s second-largest bank  by assets awarded 428 workers more
than 1 million pounds in 2012, down from 473 in 2011, according
to its  annual report , which was published today.  “I hope that 2012 will be seen as a  turning point  in the
way Barclays approaches remuneration,” John Sunderland,
chairman of the London-based lender’s compensation panel, said
in the report. “We are taking a different approach to the
balance between directors’ and employees’ remuneration, and
returns for shareholders.”  Diamond, who received 6.3 million pounds in salary and
long-term bonuses in 2011, was branded the “unacceptable face of
banking” by then-Business Secretary  Peter Mandelson  in 2010 over
his compensation. Banker pay has remained an issue for investors
and politicians. The European Union announced a cap on bankers’
bonuses this month, a plan resisted by the British government.  Including pension payments and other benefits, Jenkins, a
Briton, got 2.6 million pounds in 2012 compared with the
American-born Diamond’s 13.2 million pounds in 2011.  Tax Payments  Barclays granted Diamond 5.75 million pounds in so-called
equalization payments to the U.S. tax authorities that year,
relating to money he owed after his relocation to Britain from
the U.S.  Jenkins took on the top job in August after receiving a
700,000-pound salary in his previous role as head of the
consumer bank. The 51-year-old is cutting costs and eliminating
jobs to return the lender to  profit , while trying to avoid
regulatory missteps such as the 290 million-pound fine for
rigging the  London  interbank offered rate that prompted Diamond
to resign.  Barclays said five employees were paid a total of more than
5 million pounds, compared with 17 in 2011. It didn’t name them.
Some 71,581 staff, more than half of the 139,200-strong
workforce, were paid 25,000 pounds or less.  Britain’s Trades Union Conference today said Barclays’ pay
remains “obscene.”  No Bonus  “Barclays is acting as if the financial crisis never
happened,” the labor group, which represents about 6.5 million
workers, said in an e-mailed statement. “The EU is absolutely
right to push ahead with its bonus cap.”  At least 55 workers were paid more than Jenkins, receiving
more than 2.5 million pounds in salary and bonuses.  Jenkins said last month he won’t take a bonus for 2012 in
the wake of the Libor and other scandals. He had been in line
for a bonus of at least 1 million pounds, the  Guardian newspaper 
reported on Jan. 29.  He received 215,000 pounds in pension payments and 81,000
pounds of benefits such as private health insurance, a car
allowance and tax advice. He was paid a salary of 833,000 pounds
as CEO, which will rise to 1.1 million pounds for 2013, his
first full year in the role. Jenkins was paid 1.84 million
pounds, including 373,000 pounds salary and 1.47 million pounds
long-term bonus, for his role as CEO for the last four months of
2012, the lender said.  The average bonus awarded to employees fell 13 percent to
13,300 pounds, while awards at the investment bank declined 17
percent from the previous year to 54,100 pounds, Barclays said
in February. Some 45 percent of all investment-bank employees
got no bonus for 2012.  Dividend, Lucas  In all, the lender will pay about 1.85 billion pounds in
bonuses, compared with 733 million pounds in dividends. The firm
raised its fourth-quarter  dividend  to 3.5 pence a share from 3
pence in the year-earlier period.  Finance Director Chris Lucas’s award was almost halved,
falling to 2.1 million pounds for 2012 from 4.16 million pounds
a year earlier after he agreed to forgo a bonus.  Compensation at Barclays’s U.K. rivals has also been
falling.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  CEO  Stuart Gulliver  received a 1.95
million-pound bonus for 2012 even after the lender paid a record
fine for breaking anti-money laundering rules, though the award
fell from 2.2 million pounds in 2011. His total compensation
fell to 7.4 million pounds from 8 million pounds a year earlier.  Rivals’ Pay  Even after posting a third straight yearly loss,  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio will receive a bonus
for 2012. He won’t receive the 1.49 million-pound award until
the shares rise above 73.6 pence, or the government has sold a
third of its stake in the lender for more than the price it paid
during its bailout. Horta-Osorio didn’t take a bonus for 2011.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  CEO  Stephen Hester  turned
down a bonus for 2012 valued at as much as 2.4 million pounds.  Barclays will cut 3,700 jobs to reduce annual costs by 1.7
billion pounds this year. The lender on Feb. 12 posted a net
loss of 1.04 billion pounds for 2012, its first in two decades,
as it set aside an additional 1 billion pounds in the fourth
quarter for compensating clients wrongly sold  interest-rate
swaps  and loan-repayment insurance.  Barclays has reviewed 75 of its units to weed out those
that pose a reputational risk or don’t make profits. The firm
said it will shut about four that consume about 90 billion
pounds of assets and may shut another 17 that generate about 2
billion pounds of income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
