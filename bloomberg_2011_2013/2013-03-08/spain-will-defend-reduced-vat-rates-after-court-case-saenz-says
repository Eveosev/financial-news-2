Spain  will defend its value-added
tax rates after the EU’s highest court ruled it violated
European Union rules by granting reduced levels on too-wide a
range of health-care products.  “Not only the government has no plan to raise taxes, but
it is seeing in coordination with the European Commission how it
can succeed in explaining the Spanish case,” Deputy Prime
Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters in Madrid
today.  The government will explain the rates it applies to some
products are different to those applied in other European Union
countries following a recent European court ruling, she said.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive agency,  sued 
Spain in 2011 for violating the law by granting reduced rates of
VAT to medical equipment for general use and for equipment used
to alleviate animals’ physical disabilities.  “Spain applies a reduced rate to a broader range of goods
than provided for” under VAT rules “in the field of
pharmaceutical products and medical equipment,” the EU Court of
Justice said in a final ruling on Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
