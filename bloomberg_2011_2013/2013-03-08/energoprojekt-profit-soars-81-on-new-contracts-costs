Energoprojekt Holding AD, a Serbian
engineering group, said its profit jumped 81 percent last year
after winning new contracts and cutting costs.  Net income climbed to 504.8 million dinars ($5.9 million)
from 277.6 million dinars a year earlier as sales increased 19
percent to 1.05 billion dinars and costs fell 13 percent to
505.2 million dinars, the Belgrade-based company said in a
regulatory filing today.  “The whole system performed better than in 2011, with
about 20 percent more work” on average in Ghana, Uganda and
Nigeria, as well as in the Middle East, including Qatar and Abu-
Dhabi, Chief Financial Officer Dimitraki Zipovski said in a
phone interview today.  The company, in which the Serbian government holds a 33.6
percent stake, expects further growth in 2013 as the value of
its current contracts exceeds 500 million euros ($654 million),
he said.  The holding group is active in 19 countries and its
businesses include road building, consulting, information
technology and insurance.  Energoprojekt shares rose 0.2 percent to 672 dinars in
Belgrade today, valuing the company at 6.7 billion dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
