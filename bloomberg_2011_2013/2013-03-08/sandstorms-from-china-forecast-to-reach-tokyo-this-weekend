Sandstorms from northern  China  and
Mongolia are forecast to reach  Tokyo  this weekend, according to
the  Japan Meteorological Agency.   Yellow desert dust from China’s northwestern provinces and
Mongolia will reach Tokyo at about 3 a.m. Saturday and remain
until Sunday morning, according to the agency’s website.
Visibility in the Japanese capital will be reduced to 10
kilometers (6.2 miles) from 40 kilometers at normal levels, the
agency said.  The sandstorm, which reached the southern island of Kyushu
around noon today, will coincide with graduation ceremonies of
some Tokyo schools and universities scheduled to be held
Saturday. Tokyo is forecast to be fine and sunny tomorrow, with
temperatures expected to reach a maximum of 17 degrees Celsius.  Measurements of PM2.5, fine airborne particulates that pose
the largest health risks, are not likely to rise significantly
due to the sandstorms, Takahisa Goto, an official at the
 environment ministry  said by phone today.  Japan ’s environment
ministry last week said local authorities should issue warnings
when concentrations rise to an average of 70 micrograms per
cubic meter per hour.  Japan considers PM2.5 readings of 35 micrograms per cubic
meter to be safe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
