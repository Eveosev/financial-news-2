U.K. stocks  rallied to the highest
level in more than five years as reports showed that U.S.
employers added more jobs, Chinese exports surged and Japan’s
economy returned to growth.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  rallied 3.2 percent as Bank of America
Corp. reiterated its buy recommendation on the mobile-phone
company.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  led a rally in banks, climbing 2.6
percent.  Evraz Plc (EVR) , Russia’s largest steelmaker, jumped 5.6
percent for the biggest increase on the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index.  The FTSE 100 rose 44.42 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,483.58
at the close in  London , the highest level since December 2007.
The benchmark gauge has climbed 1.7 percent this week, the
largest gain since January, as investors speculated that central
banks will maintain stimulus measures.  “The U.S. labour market continues to grow at a robust
pace,” Mads Koefoed, head of macro Strategy at Saxo wrote in e-
mailed comments. “The economy continues to expand at a moderate
pace despite the uncertainty.”  The broader FTSE All-Share Index gained 0.7 percent to the
highest since October 2007 today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index (ISEQ) 
fell 0.1 percent. The volume of shares changing hands in
companies on the FTSE 100 was 9.8 percent greater than the 30-
day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The FTSE 100 is trading at 11.9 times estimated earnings,
compared with an average valuation of 11.3 over the past seven
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Most Attractive’  “By default, equities are the most attractive asset
class,”  Bob Parker , who helps oversee $406 billion as senior
adviser at Credit Suisse Asset Management in London, told Manus
Cranny on Bloomberg Television. “Valuations, despite the rally,
are still reasonably cheap. If you look at the recent data out
of Germany, America and Japan, we are seeing quite a significant
acceleration.”  U.S. payrolls rose by 236,000 last month after a revised
119,000 gain in January, Labor Department figures showed. That
beat the median economist forecast for an advance of 165,000 in
a Bloomberg Survey. The jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent, the
lowest since December 2008.  In  Asia ,  China ’s  exports  exceeded economists’ forecasts,
jumping 21.8 percent in February from a year earlier.  Japan ’s
economy expanded at an annualized 0.2 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with a preliminary calculation that had shown
a 0.4 percent contraction.  Vodafone Jumps  Vodafone increased 3.2 percent to 184.35 pence, the highest
price since August. The stock has jumped 9.5 percent this week,
the biggest gain since 2008, as people familiar with the
situation said Verizon Communications Inc. is seeking to resolve
its relationship with the U.K. company this year, weighing
options that include ending its wireless venture with Vodafone
or a full merger.  Bank of America reiterated its buy recommendation for
Vodafone, saying the U.S. situation is now becoming clearer.  HSBC paced a  rally in banks  as government bond yields fell
in  Spain  amid speculation the outlook for the euro area’s
economy is improving. Europe’s largest bank climbed 2.6 percent
to 737 pence, its highest close in more than three years.
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  rose 2.9 percent to 318.6 pence and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc added 1 percent to 306.2 pence.  Evraz jumped 5.6 percent to 267.5 pence as the shares
passed through the 100- and 200-day moving averages.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  lost 3.1 percent to 1,879 pence for the biggest
decline on the FTSE 100. The world’s largest provider of mobile
power supplies surged 10 percent yesterday after raising its
dividend and forecasting an average double-digit revenue growth
over the next five years.  Thomas Cook  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG)  sank 8.2 percent to 75.75 pence, the
biggest drop in four months, with volume more than triple the
three-month average. The U.K. tour operator is due to hold a
capital markets day and give a trading update on March 13.  The “last capital markets day preceded a fall in the share
price from 265 pence despite the group setting out a roadmap to
increase” profit margins, Simon French, an analyst at Panmure
Gordon & Co., wrote in a report today. “We expect the group
will set similar medium-term margin targets, but are yet to be
convinced that the outcome will be any different.”  Sportech Plc (SPO)  surged 19 percent to 108 pence, the biggest
gain on the FTSE All-Share, after the U.K. gambling operator
that has half its business in the U.S. won a tax claim worth
more than 80 million pounds ($120 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
