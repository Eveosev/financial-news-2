Oil and gas rigs in the U.S. fell
for a third straight week to the lowest level since January
after producers moved equipment out of gas plays.  The  gas count  declined by 13 to 407, the fewest since May
1999, data posted on  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s website show.  Oil rigs 
gained for a second week, adding eight to 1,341, a 12-week high,
the field-services company based in Houston said.  The  total energy count  has dropped 11 rigs this year as
producers adopt more efficient drilling technologies and get
more output with fewer rigs. Unconventional plays have helped
drive U.S. crude production to the highest level in more than 20
years. The country met 84 percent of its energy needs in the
first 11 months of 2012, on track to be the highest annual pace
since 1991.  The growth in U.S. tight-oil production has been
“astounding,” and domestic output may continue to rise because
of higher recovery rates and tighter well spacing,  Adam Sieminski , administrator of the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
March 6 at a conference in Houston. “The potential for these
things to go higher is very real.”  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  is pursuing rail projects over the next two
years that will help deliver oil from domestic plays in the
nation’s center to its refineries in California and  Alaska , Dan Romasko, the company’s executive vice president of operations,
said at a conference yesterday in  New York .  Rail Projects  Phillips 66 (PSX)  and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  also said this week
that they’re planning rail projects to move oil into their
refineries on the U.S. West Coast.  U.S. oil output  slipped  3,000 barrels a day to 7.09 million
in the week ended March 1, according to EIA data. Production
rose in February to the highest level since 1992. Stockpiles
rose 1 percent to 381.4 million barrels last week and reached a
22-year high of 387.3 million in June.  Crude for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 39 cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $91.95 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have dropped
14 percent in the past year.  “We’re still seeing fairly strong  oil prices , so oil rigs
are, of course, maintaining,”  James Williams , president of WTRG
Economics in  London ,  Arkansas , said by telephone. “The gas rig
drop is a little surprising. That’s a pretty big hit, but gas
just isn’t economic to drill for until we pass $4” per million
British thermal units.  Natural Gas  Natural gas  for April delivery gained 4.7 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $3.629 per million British thermal units
on the Nymex. Futures are up 60 percent from a year ago.  Gas stockpiles  fell 146 billion cubic feet in the week
ended March 1 to 2.083 trillion, according to data compiled by
the EIA. They reached a record high of 3.929 trillion cubic feet
on Nov. 2.  Oklahoma lost the most rigs this week, falling by seven to
180. California gained the most, adding five to 39.  Rigs on land  declined a third week, losing four to 1,682.
Rigs in  inland waters  were unchanged at 19. The offshore rig
count, primarily in the  Gulf of Mexico , slipped by one to 51.  Vertical rigs  lost four to 427.  Horizontal rigs  tumbled by
11 to 1,130. Directional rigs rose by 10 to 195.  Canadian energy rigs slid a second week, declining by 75 to
580, following a seasonal drilling pattern.  To contact the reporters on this story:
