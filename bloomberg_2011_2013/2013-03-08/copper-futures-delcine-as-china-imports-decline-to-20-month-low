Copper fell for the second time in
three days as imports dropped to a 20-month low in  China , the
world’s largest user, and exchange inventories increased.  Inbound Chinese shipments of refined metal, alloy and
products were 298,102 metric tons last month, down 38 percent
from a year earlier, customs figures showed today. Global
inventories monitored by exchanges in  London ,  New York  and
Shanghai climbed to 803,128 tons today, rising above 800,000 for
the first time since December 2003.  “The copper market is mainly focused on China right now,
and there’s concern that growth there isn’t going to be what it
was,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in
 Port St. Lucie , Florida, said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for delivery in May declined 0.3 percent to
settle at $3.509 a pound at 1:23 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
paring this week’s gain to 0.2 percent.  The metal also fell as an unexpected drop in the U.S.
jobless rate boosted the dollar, reducing the appeal of
commodities as alternative investments. Unemployment declined to
7.7 percent last month, the lowest in more than four years,
according to a government report. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey had expected the rate to hold at 7.9 percent.  “The dollar is sharply higher, and commodities are getting
hit,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Metals will continue
to be under pressure for as long as the dollar stays strong.”  The greenback climbed as much as 1 percent against a basket
of six currencies.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months dropped 0.3
percent to $7,740.50 a ton ($3.51 a pound).  Aluminum and zinc also fell in London, while lead, nickel
and tin advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
