Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
rose above the level on the last trading day before Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, after the yen slid to the
lowest in 3 1/2 years against the dollar and data showed Japan’s
economy returned to growth.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2 percent to 12,203.13 as of 11:12
a.m. in  Tokyo , after climbing as high as 12,223.22. The measure
closed at 12,214.76 on Sept. 12, 2008, before Lehman Brothers
filed for bankruptcy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
