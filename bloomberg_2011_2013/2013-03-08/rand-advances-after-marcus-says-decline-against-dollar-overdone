The rand strengthened, reversing an
earlier drop, after South African Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said the currency’s decline to beyond 9 per dollar was
overdone.  The rand gained as much as 0.7 percent to 9.0760 against
the U.S. currency and was trading at 9.0990 by 4:35 p.m. in
Johannesburg, paring its weekly decline to 0.4 percent. It
earlier weakened as much as 0.3 percent after yesterday falling
as low as 9.1884 per dollar, the worst intraday level since
April 15, 2009. Yields on benchmark government 10.5 percent
bonds due December 2026 rose 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 7.37 percent.  The rand’s drop to a range of 9 per dollar to 9.20 per
dollar “is overdone,” Marcus said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV. “It will, over a period of time, retrace back to
a more reasonable level.”  The currency of  Africa ’s largest economy weakened 6.9
percent this year, the worst performer of 25  emerging markets 
monitored by Bloomberg. Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  has
delayed plans to narrow the budget deficit as sluggish economic
growth curbed tax revenue. A slump in mining production, which
accounts for 53 percent of the nation’s exports, is widening the
current-account deficit, increasing the rand’s vulnerability as
bond  inflows  slow.  Employment in the U.S. rose 236,000 last month, Labor
Department data showed in  Washington  today. The median forecast
of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected an advance of
165,000. The country’s jobless rate dropped to a five-year low
of 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent.  The U.S. data lent further support to the rand, Vivienne Taberer, who helps manage about $11.5 billion in emerging-market
debt and currencies at Investec Asset Management, said by phone
from Cape Town.  The rand’s implied three-month volatility against the
dollar rose to 13.1 percent, from 13 percent a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
