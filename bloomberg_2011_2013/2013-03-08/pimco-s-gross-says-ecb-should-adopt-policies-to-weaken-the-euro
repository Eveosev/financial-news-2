Bill Gross , manager of the world’s
biggest bond fund, said the European Central Bank should adopt
policies to help the euro depreciate.  “Ultimately, what they want to do is weaken their currency
relative to the dollar and other currencies so that they can
become more competitive,” Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
founder Gross said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  today. At the same time, “it is
hard to see the ECB succeeding” in driving the euro down to a
level of $1.15 or below, he said.  The ECB yesterday left its benchmark rate unchanged at a
record low of 0.75 percent and cut its economic forecasts. The
Frankfurt-based central bank now expects gross domestic product
in the 17-nation euro area to shrink 0.5 percent this year
before growing 1 percent in 2014. President Mario Draghi said
that the “exchange rate is not a policy target” for the ECB.  “Nominal and real exchange rates by and large continue to
be near their long term averages,” he said.  The ECB is “the toughest of the central banks these
days,” Gross said. “But I think at this point with European
unemployment at 12 to 13 percent as opposed to U.S. unemployment
at 7.7 percent, they have to do something.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
