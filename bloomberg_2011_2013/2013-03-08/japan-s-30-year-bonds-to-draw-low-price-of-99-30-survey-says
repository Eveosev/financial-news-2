Japan ’s sale of 700 billion yen
($7.34 billion) in 30-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted
price of 99.30, according to the average forecast of 13 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 1.8 percent
bonds ranged from 99.20 to 99.40, according to the survey.  Five traders said 99.30, and two each reported 99.20,
99.25, 99.35, and 99.40.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
