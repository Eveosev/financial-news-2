German stocks  advanced for a fourth
day, extending a five-year high, as U.S. payrolls increased more
than forecast in February, leading to an unexpected drop in the
 unemployment rate  in the world’s largest economy.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  climbed 5.6 percent after Texas
Instruments Inc. raised the lower end of its forecasts for
first-quarter sales and profit.  Merck KGaA (MRK)  jumped to its highest
price ever after Independent Research GmbH upgraded the shares.
ElringKlinger AG fell the most in more than four years.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 0.6 percent to 7,986.47 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge rallied 3.6 percent
this week -- reaching its highest level since December 2007 --
on optimism central banks around the world will continue to
support economic growth. The broader HDAX Index gained 0.5
percent today.  “It seems like almost nothing can frighten investors for
the time being,” Roger Peeters, chief executive officer at
Close Brothers Seydler Research in  Frankfurt , wrote in an e-
mail. “The liquidity pressure is still strong enough to bring
the markets to new spheres this morning.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the DAX was 3
percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Jobs Surprise  U.S. payrolls increased more than forecast in February and
the jobless rate unexpectedly fell to a four-year low of 7.7
percent, data showed today.  Employment rose 236,000 last month after a revised 119,000
gain in January that was smaller than first estimated, Labor
Department figures showed. The median forecast of 90 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected an advance of 165,000. The
jobless rate dropped from 7.9 percent.  In  Japan ,  gross domestic product  rose an annualized 0.2
percent in the fourth quarter, the Cabinet Office said in  Tokyo .
That compares with a preliminary calculation of a 0.4 percent
contraction.  In  China , exports rose 22 percent in February from a year
earlier, the customs administration said. That beat the 8.1
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  German industrial production unexpectedly stagnated in
January, a report showed today. Production was unchanged from
December, when it increased a revised 0.6 percent, the Economy
Ministry in Berlin said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
forecast a 0.4 percent gain for January.  Infineon, Merck  Infineon Technologies, Europe’s second-biggest
semiconductor maker, gained 5.6 percent to 6.85 euros after
Texas Instruments, the world’s largest analog-chip maker, raised
its forecasts.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  said it is the right time to buy Infineon
shares as investors underestimate growth in auto, mobile-devices
and computing segments.  Merck KGaA, the maker of the cancer drug Erbitux, advanced
1.9 percent to 114.35 euros as Independent Research upgraded the
shares to hold from sell. A close at this price would be the
highest for the stock since Merck sold shares to the public in
1995.  Commerzbank and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s two biggest
lenders, added 2.1 percent to 1.45 euros and 1.8 percent to
34.58 euros respectively as a gauge of banking stocks climbed
the most among the 19 industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600
Index (SXXP) , rising 2.6 percent.  ElringKlinger tumbled 14 percent to 24.13 euros after the
auto-parts maker said fourth-quarter net income fell to 13.2
million euros. The company will publish the full results March
28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
