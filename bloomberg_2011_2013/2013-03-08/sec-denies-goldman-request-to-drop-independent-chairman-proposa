Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the sixth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, can’t omit a shareholder proposal
calling for an independent chairman from its annual meeting, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said.  The SEC’s Office of Chief Counsel said it didn’t agree with
Goldman Sachs’s claim that the proposal was “inherently vague
or indefinite,” according to a letter dated March 5 that was
posted today on the agency’s website. The proposal says that the
bank must appoint a chairman that’s independent of management
whenever possible.  Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has also
held the chairman role since he took the firm’s helm in 2006.
That’s similar to the structure at  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and JPMorgan
Chase & Co., while  Bank of America  Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have
separate roles.  Proposals that call for an independent chairman at other
public companies have received more than 30 percent of votes
supporting the measures, CtW Investment Group, which submitted
the proposal, said in a letter to the SEC in January. It cited
data from Institutional Shareholder Services.  Goldman Sachs awarded Blankfein $21 million in compensation
for 2012 performance, the highest amount since 2007. The firm
had a 10.7 percent return on equity last year, and the shares
rose 41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
