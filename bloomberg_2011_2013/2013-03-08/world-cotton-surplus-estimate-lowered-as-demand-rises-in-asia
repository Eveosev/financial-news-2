Global cotton stockpiles will
be lower than forecast a month ago as demand increased in
 China ,  India  and  Bangladesh , the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said.  World inventories will total 81.74 million bales in
the year ending July 31, down from the February estimate of
81.86 million, the USDA said today in a report. Seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 81.61 million, on
average. Global use was projected at 107.11 million bales,
up from 106.24 million last month. Output will be 119.87
million bales, up from 118.95 million forecast in February.  The agency increased its estimate for the crop in
China, the world’s biggest consumer and importer of the
fiber, to 35 million bales, up 2.9 percent from 34 million
last month. The nation’s projected consumption was raised
to 36 million bales from 35.5 million last month, the
department said.  China is importing more yarn, “with India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Vietnam the key recipients of this demand,”
 Sharon Johnson , a senior market specialist at Knight
Futures in Roswell,  Georgia , said in an e-mail before the
USDA report.  Exports from the U.S., the top shipper, will be 12.75
million bales, up from 12.5 million projected in February,
and 11.71 million shipped a year earlier, the agency said.
U.S. output in the harvest that started in August and ended
late last year was estimated at 17.01 million bales,
unchanged from a month earlier.  Domestic inventories on July 31 will be 4.2 million
bales, down from 4.5 million estimated last month, the
agency said. Stockpiles were 3.35 million a year earlier,
according to the USDA said. A bale weighs 480 pounds (218
kilograms).  Strong demand for American cotton “has proven to be a
bit of a pleasant surprise for bulls and irritation for
bears,” Johnson said.  Cotton for May delivery rose 2.1 percent to 88.32
cents a pound at 9:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
The fiber has climbed 18 percent this year as global demand
rebounded from a slump in 2012 and production dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
