Sales of corporate bonds in the U.S.
fell this week and relative yields narrowed as political
wrangling in  Washington  deterred borrowers.  International Lease Finance Corp., the commercial aircraft
unit of insurer  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , and
Burlington Northern  Santa Fe  led issuance of about $25 billion,
down from $35.2 billion last week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales this year total $307 billion, below $344.9
billion sold in the similar period 2012.  Issuance declined as the  House of Representatives  passed a
plan to avoid a shutdown and preserve new spending cuts, while
the Senate will consider a measure next week to fund the
government through September. Borrowers are facing “issuance
fatigue” after selling a record $1.47 trillion last year,
according to Edward Marrinan at RBS Securities.  “Issuers are taking a more measured approach due to
political uncertainty and because they have already met many of
their funding goals,” Marrinan, a  Stamford , Connecticut-based
macro credit strategist, said in a telephone interview. “These
factors give issuers reason to step back and reassess.”  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 216 basis points
yesterday from 221 basis points on March 1, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield index.  Yields increased to 3.61 percent this week from 3.56
percent, and compare with a record low 3.52 percent on Jan. 23,
index data show.  ILFC Sale  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $19.9
billion, compared with  $30.2 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $23.8 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade debt rose to 2.86 percent
yesterday from 2.79 percent on March 1, increasing from a record
low 2.73 percent on Nov. 8, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index. Spreads decreased 3 basis
points to 146 basis points.  ILFC, which leases Airbus and Boeing planes, sold $1.25
billion of debt in its first offering this year, Bloomberg data
show. The Los Angeles-based company’s $750 million of 3.875
percent, five-year securities yield 307 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $500 million of 4.625 percent,
eight-year bonds pay a relative yield of 268.8 basis points.  Buffett’s Railroad  Burlington, the railroad that  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  bought in 2010, sold $1.5 billion of bonds in its
first offering in more than six months, Bloomberg data show. The
 Fort Worth , Texas-based company’s $700 million of 3 percent, 10-
year notes pay a relative yield of 110 basis points and $800
million of 4.45 percent, 30-year bonds pay a spread of 133 basis
points.  Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $5
billion, matching  last week’s total  and compared with a 2013
weekly average of  $7.6 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Junk debt yields fell to 6.49 percent yesterday from 6.56
percent on March 1, and compare with a record low 6.41 percent
on Jan. 25, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
High Yield Index. Spreads narrowed 19 basis points to 481 basis
points.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  Issuers planning sales include McGraw-Hill Education, the
digital learning company being acquired by Apollo Global
Management LLC, with a $1.05 billion offering of eight-year
notes to help fund the purchase, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
