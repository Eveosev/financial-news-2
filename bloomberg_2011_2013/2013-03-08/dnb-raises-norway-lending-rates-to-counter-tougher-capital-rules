DNB ASA (DNB) , Norway’s largest bank, will
increase prices on loans to pass on stricter rules the
government imposed to cool the housing market to clients.  Lending rates will be increased by as much as 30 basis
points on floating rate loans, parts of DNB’s loan portfolio for
small and medium-sized companies, and “a significant part” of
DNB Finans’ loan portfolio, Oslo-based DNB said in a statement
today. The new prices will be effective immediately for new
loans and for existing credit by the end of April, it said.  Norway is introducing stricter rules for its banks to cool
down the housing market and prevent a repeat of the 1990s crisis
that sent the country’s real estate prices plunging 40 percent.
The  Finance Ministry  in December proposed tripling the risk-
weights banks need to hold on mortgage assets to 35 percent
after  house prices  and private debt burdens soared. It also
proposed introducing a curb on covered bond issuance.  “Given its dominance in the Norwegian market, we view DNB
as the the facto price setter,” Vegard Eid Medias and Jon David Gjertsen, analysts at Pareto Securities SA in Oslo, wrote in a
note to clients today. The analysts said they expect other
Norwegian lenders such as savings banks and Sweden’s  Svenska
Handelsbanken AB (SHBA)  as well as  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  to follow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
