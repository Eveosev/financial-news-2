Renault SA (RNO)  gained the backing of a
third union to move forward with eliminating 7,500 jobs and
freezing wages, boosting the carmaker’s chances of smoothly
carrying out its cost-reduction plan.  “We agreed to sign the deal,” Fred Dijoux, the leader of
the CFDT union at the Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based
carmaker, said today by phone. Two other unions, the FO and CFE-
CGC, have already said they would back the deal.  The three unions represent about 64 percent of Renault
employees. Under French law, a company needs the support of
unions representing at least 30 percent of the staff for a
collective bargaining agreement to be valid.  The deal enables Renault to reduce its  French workforce  17
percent by 2016 through attrition. Labor leaders also agreed on
a wage freeze for 2013 and to increase the average number of
working hours. Annual savings from the cuts will reach 500
million euros ($649 million), Gerard Leclercq, head of Renault’s
French operations, said on Jan. 30.  “Renault has the backing of unions representing more than
50 percent of its staff, which eliminates the likelihood that
the deal may not be implemented,” said Xavier Caroen, an
analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, who recommends buying the
shares. “It also indicates that Peugeot may be able to strike a
similar deal with its own workforce later on this year.”  Renault  gained  as much as 2.94 euros, or 5.7 percent, to
54.31 euros and was up 4.2 percent as of 4:34 p.m. in Paris
trading.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , which is seeking to cut 11,200
jobs and close one factory, advanced as much as 38 cents, or 6.1
percent, to 6.70 euros and traded 4 percent higher.  A fourth union, the CGT, hasn’t said yet whether it would
back the agreement, Raluca Barb, a spokeswoman for Renault, said
today by phone. The CGT represents 25 percent of Renault’s
employees.  The next step is a national works council on March 12 to
vote on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
