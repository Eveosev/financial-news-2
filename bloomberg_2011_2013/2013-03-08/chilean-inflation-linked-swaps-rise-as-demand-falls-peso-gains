Chilean inflation-linked swap rates
climbed the most in three months after a report showed consumer
prices rose in February less than forecast, reducing demand.  The one-year rate increased 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point to 2.35 percent, the steepest rise since Dec.
7. The three-month rate was up 86 basis points to 2.96 percent.
The one-year breakeven rate, the average annual pace of future
consumer price increases implied by bond yields, fell 20 basis
points to 2.77 percent, the lowest since January.  “Inflation insurance is falling, and rate rises are being
pushed back by a couple of months from what was priced in
yesterday,” Christian Gomez, a trader at Banco Santander Chile
in Santiago, said in a phone interview.  Consumer prices increased 0.1 percent in February from a
month earlier, the government reported today. The median
forecast of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.3
percent advance. Annual inflation was 1.3 percent, the slowest
pace since June 2010.  Traders in the forwards market for unidades de fomento,
Chile’s inflation-linked accounting unit, had been pricing in a
0.24 percent consumer price increase in February.  Chile’s peso rose 0.1 percent to 471.55 per dollar at the
close in Santiago. The currency appreciated 0.6 percent this
week.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
raised their net bet against the currency to $3.8 billion on
March 6, the biggest in two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
