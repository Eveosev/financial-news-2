Unilever, the world’s second-largest
consumer-products company, said Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman earned 6.03 million pounds ($9 million) in 2012,
including a 1.95 million-pound bonus, as sales growth topped
expectations and outpaced rivals such as  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)   Polman’s base salary will increase 3.6 percent to 1.01
million pounds in 2013, following a 6 percent increase to
975,200 pounds in July last year, Unilever said today in its
 annual report . Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Huet’s salary
won’t change this year, after he got a 5 percent raise to
714,000 pounds last July. The London- and Rotterdam-based maker
of Dove soaps and Axe deodorant said Polman had an “exceptional
year,” and said Huet’s performance was “strong.”  Polman’s bonus was twice his salary, the most allowed under
the terms of his compensation agreement. The CEO, who joined in
2009, got the maximum payout by beating targets for underlying
sales growth, volume growth and operating profit as a percentage
of sales. Underlying sales, which grew 6.9 percent last year,
exclude the impact of acquisitions and currency shifts. Huet’s
bonus was 1.05 million pounds, or 147 percent of his salary.  Unilever (UNA)  changed its compensation policy to decide bonuses
according to the three measures in 2011, to encourage a
“clearer long-term focus,” it said at the time. There will be
no changes to the bonus plan in 2013, the company said today.  Unilever rose 0.9 percent to 31.12 euros at 4:04 p.m. in
Amsterdam trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
