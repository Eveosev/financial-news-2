The pound dropped to the lowest
against dollar in 2 1/2 years after U.S. payrolls increased more
than forecast in February. It fell 0.6 percent to $1.4927 as of
1:44 p.m. in London after falling to $1.4885, the least since
July 1, 2010.   Gilts dropped, pushing 10-year yields up six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
