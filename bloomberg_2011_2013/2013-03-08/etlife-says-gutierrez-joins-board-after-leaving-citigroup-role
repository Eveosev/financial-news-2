MetLife Inc., (MET)  the largest U.S. life
insurer, said former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, has
joined the board of directors as the company faces increased
oversight from federal regulators.  Gutierrez, 59, stepped down last month as vice chairman of
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s institutional client group, New York-based
MetLife said today in a statement.  Gutierrez spent almost 30 years at Kellogg Co., the biggest
U.S. cereal maker, and was the youngest chief executive officer
in the company’s history before joining the cabinet of then-
President George W. Bush. He stepped down from Citigroup to
become chairman of Republicans for Immigration Reform.  “His significant leadership experience in both the public
and private sectors, combined with his strong, global management
background, will make him a valuable resource for MetLife,”
 Steven Kandarian , the insurer’s CEO, said in the statement.  Kandarian has been expanding in Asia and Latin America, and
announced a deal last month to buy pension provider AFP Provida
SA to expand asset management in Chile. Kandarian has exited
banking to limit U.S. oversight and has said the company
shouldn’t be labeled a systemically important financial
institution, a designation that could bring tougher capital
standards.  Today’s appointment is the first to MetLife’s board since
the departure last year of Eduardo Castro-Wright after the New
York Times reported that the  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  unit he ran in
Mexico paid bribes to government officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
