McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13
months fell less than analysts estimated in February as low
prices kept consumers coming to restaurants amid a weak economy.  Global same-store sales fell 1.5 percent, the  Oak Brook ,
Illinois-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected a 1.6 percent drop, the average of 13 estimates
compiled by Consensus Metrix.  Chief Executive Officer  Don Thompson  has been pushing value
items worldwide in McDonald’s 34,400 locations, including in
Asia, where the fast-food chain competes with  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) ’s
KFC and Pizza Hut brands. McDonald’s, which has about 9,400
stores in its Asia region, has lured customers in China with
delivery service, value dinners and bubble tea.  McDonald’s February sales were helped by “everyday
affordable prices,” Thompson said in today’s release.  Sales fell 3.3 percent in the U.S. and 0.5 percent in
Europe. Analysts projected declines of 3.6 percent and 0.5
percent, respectively, according to Consensus Metrix, a
researcher owned by Wayne, New Jersey-based Kaul Advisory Group.  Sales in McDonald’s Asia Pacific, the Middle East and
Africa region fell 1.6 percent. Analysts estimated a 1.7 percent
decline. Last month, sales were positive in  China , McDonald’s
said in the statement. The chain plans to have 2,000 restaurants
there by the end of this year, whereas Yum has more than 5,200.  McDonald’s rose 1.7 percent to $98.71 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have advanced 12 percent this year, compared
with an 8.8 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
