European coal prices for next year
dropped after a majority of workers at  Colombia ’s largest mine
accepted a wage proposal and may return to work this weekend.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp fell as much as 0.5 percent to $95.75 a metric ton
and traded at $95.80 at 11:28 a.m. London time.  Workers at  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Cerrejon venture yesterday
accepted an agreement to end a month-long strike, according to
Luz Maria Tobon, a spokeswoman for the Sintracarbon union.
Colombia exported 79.4 million tons of coal last year, of which
55 percent went to buyers from the European Union, according to
Michael Hsueh, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
