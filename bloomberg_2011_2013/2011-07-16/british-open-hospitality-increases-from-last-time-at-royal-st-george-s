Direct transport from  London  and an
improving economy have helped increase corporate hospitality at
this year’s British Open at Royal St. George’s.  More than 5,500 hospitality packages have been sold for the
tournament in Sandwich, England, a rise of 20 percent over the
last time it was played there in 2003.  Officials added a special direct high-speed train for the
tournament from London’s St. Pancras station to Sandwich, 75
miles (120 kilometers) southeast of the capital, cutting the
total travel time to about 90 minutes. Passengers normally have
to switch trains on their journey.  “It’s now easily accessible from London,” Brett Tonkyn,
the director of sales for Open hospitality, said in an
interview. “And the economic environment seems to be improving.
People still value how they spend their money.”  Individual prices in the tented hospitality village range
from 385 pounds ($621) to 510 pounds per person, depending on
the day. Companies can also buy 30 or 50-guest chalets to
entertain clients and employees.  The success of European golfers has also been a great sales
tool, according to Tonkyn.  “ Luke Donald ,  Lee Westwood ,  Rory McIlroy ,  Martin Kaymer 
are doing so well in the world rankings,” he said. “They’re
getting more column inches in the U.K. market so people tend to
be overnight fans. People want to be there and need to be
there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
