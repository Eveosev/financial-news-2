Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the
world’s biggest petrochemicals maker, said second-quarter profit
surged 61 percent because of higher prices for its products,
beating analysts’ estimates.  Net income jumped to 8.1 billion riyals ($2.16 billion)
from 5.02 billion riyals a year earlier, the Riyadh-based
company known as Sabic said in a statement to the Saudi bourse
today. The median estimate of four analysts was for 7.72 billion
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sabic will pay
a dividend of 2 riyals for the first half.  Saudi petrochemical companies have started to recover from
the global financial crisis as  oil prices  surged and as demand
from fast-growing Asian economies including China and  India 
increased.  Saudi Arabia ’s annual petrochemical exports climbed
39 percent to 4.8 billion riyals in May, according to data
posted on the  Saudi Ports Authority  website.  Second-quarter profit rose because of increased production,
sales volumes and sales prices, Sabic said in  a statement  today.  Sabic unit  Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co. (YANSAB)  reported an
increase in second-quarter earnings. The Yanbu Saudi Arabia-
based company, which is also known as Yansab, said net income
almost doubled to 963.7 million riyals on higher product volumes
and prices.  Sabic’s shares rose 0.2 percent to 104 riyals, before the
results were announced, valuing the company at 312 billion
riyals. The stock has lost 0.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
