Sweden took third place at soccer’s
Women’s World Cup as Marie Hammarstrom scored in the 82nd minute
in the 2-1 victory over  France .  The midfielder got her goal by weaving past several
defenders after Sweden took a short corner kick. Lotta Schelin
opened the scoring in the 29th minute by placing the ball past
French goalkeeper Berangere Sapowicz, who was injured on the
play. France had tied the match in the 56th minute when Elodie
Thomis took a pass from Gaetane Thiney and pushed it past the
goalkeeper.  Sweden had won all its matches in the tournament --
including a victory over the finalist U.S. -- before losing to
Japan in the semifinals. France, which lost to the U.S. in the
last round, had never made it to the semifinals before this
year’s event.  The U.S. and  Japan  will meet in tomorrow’s final. The
Americans are going for a record third title, while Japan is
going for its first.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
