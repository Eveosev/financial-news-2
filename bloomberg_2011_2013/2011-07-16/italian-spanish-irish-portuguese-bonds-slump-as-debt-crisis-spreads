Italian two-year note yields surged
the most in over a year, as the nation’s borrowing costs rose at
a debt sale and contagion from  Greece ’s debt crisis spread
across the 17-nation euro region.  Yields on notes from Ireland,  Portugal  and Greece soared to
euro-era records, while German bunds advanced for the fifth time
in six weeks as  Europe ’s politicians clashed over how to craft a
new rescue plan for Greece involving private bondholders.
Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds slumped, sending yields to the
most since the euro’s inception in 1999, as borrowing costs rose
to a three-year high at a sale of five-year Italian securities.
France, Spain and Germany plan to sell debt next week.  “The market isn’t looking at fundamentals, it is just
worried about contagion,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income
strategist at  Barclays Capital  in London. “There’s been growing
infection across most of the euro-region issuers and it’s hard
to see what the catalyst is going to be to get confidence back
into the markets with all the issuance next week.”  Italy’s two-year yield climbed 75 basis points over the
week to 4.26 percent as of 4:40 p.m. in London yesterday. That’s
the biggest weekly increase since the five trading days ending
May 7, 2010, the week before Europe’s leaders announced a $1
trillion backstop for the euro. Yields on 10-year notes advanced
48 basis points to 5.75 percent. They reached 6.02 percent on
July 12, the most since 1997.  Italian Austerity  A market selloff this week that sent Italian stocks sliding
and bond yields surging led Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  to
push for the speedy passage of 40 billion euros ($57 billion) in
deficit cuts to balance the budget in 2014 in an attempt to
shield his country from the crisis.  Ireland’s two-year bonds plunged after Moody’s Investors
Service cut the nation to Ba1 from Baa3 on June 12, saying it is
likely to need a second bailout. The country’s two-year yields
climbed 6.9 percentage points to a record 23.12 percent, while
its 10-year bond yields advanced 1.13 percentage points.  Greek 10-year yields climbed 71 basis points over the week,
while the nation’s two-year bond yields soared 2.69 percentage
points.  Fitch Ratings  slashed Greece’s credit rating on July 13
to CCC, its lowest grade, and said that a default is a “real
possibility.”  Spain ’s 10-year bonds dropped, pushing the yield up 39
basis points to 6.06 percent. Spanish debt may continue to fall
next week as the nation prepares to auction 5.5 percent
securities maturing in 2021 and 2026 on July 21. It will also
sell 12- and 18-month bills on July 19.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a return of
1.9 percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg, while Italian bonds have lost 2.5 percent. Greece’s
debt has dropped 20.33 percent and Spain’s has returned 0.7
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
