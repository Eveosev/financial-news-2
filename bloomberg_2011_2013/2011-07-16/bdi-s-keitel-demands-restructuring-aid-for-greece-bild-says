Hans-Peter Keitel, head of the BDI
federation of German industry, said  Greece  needs a reduction of
its debt and an aid program comparable with the one Germany got
after the Second World War,  Bild Zeitung  wrote, citing a letter
from Keitel to German industrial managers.  A “haircut” and the participation of private creditors
would be “indispensable” in the process of rebuilding the
 Greek economy , the newspaper cited the letter as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
