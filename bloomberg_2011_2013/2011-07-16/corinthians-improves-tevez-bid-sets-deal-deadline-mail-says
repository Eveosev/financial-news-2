Corinthians has improved its bid for
Manchester Cityâ€™s  Carlos Tevez  to 40 million pounds ($65
million) and have set a deadline of this weekend to complete a
deal, the Daily Mail said.  City has already rejected a 37-million pound offer from the
Brazilian club and will not accept less than 50 million pounds,
the Mail said. The transfer deadline in Brazil ends July 19, the
newspaper said.  Tevez, 27, said he wants to return to South America to be
closer to his family. The Argentine striker signed a five-year
contract with City in July 2009 after leaving rival  Manchester
United .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
