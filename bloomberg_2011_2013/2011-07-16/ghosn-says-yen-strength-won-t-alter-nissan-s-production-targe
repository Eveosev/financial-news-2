Nissan Motor Co.’s Chief Executive
Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said the nation’s second-biggest automaker
will stick to its domestic output target even as the yen’s
strength may damp manufacturing in Japan.  “What I worry about is not just Nissan, but Japanese
manufacturers losing motivation to maintain production in
Japan,” Ghosn said today at the carmaker’s wharf in Yokohama.
“The high yen is definitely a headwind.”  Larger  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  has also said it will rely on
leaner manufacturing methods, rather than moving production
offshore, to cope with the yen’s 9.6 percent climb versus the
dollar in the past 12 months. Ghosn said Nissan, which expects
the yen’s gains to slash 135 billion yen ($1.7 billion) off
operating profit this fiscal year, intends to produce 1 million
cars a year in  Japan , unchanged from its previous target.  “This goal is a choice Nissan has made, and has maintained
through a collaborative effort with our suppliers,” Ghosn said.  Nissan’s May global output rose 19.3 percent to 368,914
vehicles, with a 0.8 percent increase in domestic output and
25.7 percent increase in overseas output. Global output for
Toyota fell 49.3 percent to 287,811 units. Nissan forecasts
production for the year ending March 31 to reach 4.6 million
units, up 11 percent from a year earlier.  Nissan made less than 30 percent of its vehicles in Japan
last year, compared with 43 percent for Toyota.  Ghosn reiterated an earlier forecast for global production
to fully recover by the beginning of October.  Nissan now targets operating income of 460 billion yen
($5.8 billion) in the year ending March 2012, while Toyota
expects 300 billion yen and Honda estimates 200 billion yen.
That would be the first time Nissan beat its two biggest
competitors, according to Bloomberg data dating to 1992.  Nissan  estimates  its global vehicle sales will rise 10
percent to 4.6 million vehicles in the 12 months started April 1,
compared with a 6 percent decline forecast by Honda and 0.9
percent drop at Toyota.  Ghosn also said today that the automaker will introduce a
new pickup truck in  India  this month with its partner  Ashok
Leyland Ltd. (AL)  The company had previously said it would bring on
the new vehicle sometime in the July to September quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
