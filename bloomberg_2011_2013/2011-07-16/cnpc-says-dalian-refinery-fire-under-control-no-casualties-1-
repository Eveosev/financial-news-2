China  National Petroleum Corp. said
a fire that broke out at its refinery in the Chinese coastal
city of Dalian has been contained without casualties.  The blaze, which started at 2:25 p.m. local time, has been
extinguished and is under “complete control,” without causing
any environmental pollution, according to a statement on the
company’s  website . The fire was caused by a leakage from one of
the plant’s installations, according to CNPC.  The facility recently underwent repair and maintenance, the
China News Agency reported, citing an unnamed source from the
petrochemical plant. About 40 fire engines tried to extinguish
the blaze, and the facility was surrounded by heavy smoke,
according to an earlier report from the agency.  A CNPC oil pipe exploded at the Dalian port in China’s
northwestern Liaoning province on the same day a year ago, and
caused fire and oil leakage that contaminated the sea.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Paul Jarvis, Digby Lidstone.  To contact the Bloomberg news staff on this story:
