Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles , expects a continuation
of the “good business development” in 2012,  Boersen-Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Financial Officer
Friedrich Eichiner.  The Munich-based company may exceed its target of an
operating profit margin of between 8 percent and 10 percent in
2012 if the “framework conditions are positive,” Eichiner told
the newspaper, adding that it’s still too early to give a
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
