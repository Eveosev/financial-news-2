U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , visiting Turkey, expressed concern about the country’s
arrest of journalists and moves to restrict Internet freedom.  Turkish authorities have jailed reporters and columnists in
recent months under anti-terror laws. A government proposal set
to go into effect in August would place compulsory filters on
the Internet that could allow monitoring of household Web use.  Clinton described the moves as “an area of concern.” She
made the comment during a two-day visit to Istanbul, in response
to a question on a show on CNN’s Turkish-language channel.  “I do not think it’s necessary or in Turkey’s interests to
be cracking down on journalists and bloggers and the Internet,
because I think  Turkey  is strong enough and dynamic enough” to
handle diverse opinions, Clinton said. The issue “deserves
attention from citizens, from lawyers, because it seems to me
inconsistent with all the other advances that Turkey has made.”  Seven journalists were arrested in Turkey in March, accused
of links to an alleged secularist plot to topple Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government in 2003. Western governments
and international media rights organizations expressed concern
about the arrests.  Clinton, due to meet with Erdogan later today, also praised
Turkey’s economic growth and noted that Turkey and the U.S. have
long enjoyed close ties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
