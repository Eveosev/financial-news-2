A group comprising Delancey Real
Estate Asset Management Ltd. and Qatari Diar Real Estate
Investment Co. is in talks to take control of the London Olympic
village after the 2012 games, the Financial Times reported.  The Olympic Delivery Authority, or ODA, recommended the
government work exclusively with the Delancey-Qatari bid, the FT
said, citing unnamed sources at the authority. The ODA is
deciding on a shortlist of three to buy the 1,439 homes that are
part of the athletesâ€™ accommodation, it said.  The decision will likely halt a 1 billion-pound ($1.6
billion) offer from The Wellcome Trust for the entire Olympic
Park as the ODA will no longer engage with the other bidders,
which also include  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , the FT reported.  A spokeswoman for Wellcome Trust declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
