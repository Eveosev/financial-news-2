Wolfgang Franz , head of German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers, said
it’s “unavoidable” that investors in Greek debt will have to
forfeit some repayments and interest,  Focus  magazine reported,
citing an interview.  Investors could swap Greek debt for discounted bonds issued
and guaranteed by the European Financial Stability Facility,
Focus cited Franz as saying.  Banks and insurers would get AAA-rated securities in
exchange for their Greek holdings, Franz told the magazine. He
added that the European Union would have to discuss making the
same offer to Portugal and Ireland.  The EFSF would take on about 170 billion euros ($241
billion) of debt for  Greece  alone under such a plan, Focus cited
Franz as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
