Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s South
African unit said a vehicle en route to deliver fuel in the
country’s Gauteng Province was shot at several times last night.  The vehicle was forced to return to the Alberton depot and
Shell subsequently stopped all fuel deliveries as it couldn’t
ensure the safety of its drivers, said company spokesman Elton Fortuin in an e-mailed statement today. Shell outsources its
fuel deliveries to third-party contractors, he said.  “The backlog created by the stoppage in deliveries has
further exacerbated an already tight supply situation at Shell
retail sites across Gauteng,” Fortuin said.  About 140 service stations in Northern Gauteng have run out
of one or more fuel grades after an industry strike for better
pay started on July 11, he said.  Additional security arrangements have been put in place and
deliveries were resumed at 11 a.m. at a much lower rate, he
said. Shell will not deliver fuel at night due to the
unpredictable situation, he said. Fuel deliveries in most other
provinces remain normal, Fortuin said.  Oil companies  operating in  South Africa  will hold talks
with labor unions on July 18 to end a strike over pay that has
led to gasoline shortages in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
