Critics of a call by the African
National Congress Youth League to nationalize South African
mines and banks are full of “hot air” and offer no
alternatives to the agenda for “real economic transformation,”
said  Julius Malema , the League’s president.  “All we hear from all these forces is that they are
opposed to nationalization of mines and expropriation without
compensation. They have no alternatives and proposals on how the
country moves forward,” Malema said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Comments by businesses that the nationalization debate
threatens investment and jobs in the country amount to
intimidation, Malema said.  At a national meeting last month, the League called for
“economic freedom fighters to intensify the battle for total
economic, social and political emancipation of the black
majority,” Malema said.  Included in the organization’s “program for economic
freedom” is a call to put in place legislative mechanisms that
“empower the state to expropriate without compensation for
public interest,” Malema said.  The ANC Youth League will talk to businesses and organized
labor in the next few weeks about its plans to nationalize mines
and banks, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
