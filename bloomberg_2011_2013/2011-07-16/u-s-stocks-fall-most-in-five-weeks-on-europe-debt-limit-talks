U.S. stocks fell this week,
including the biggest one-day drop in a month, amid concern the
debt crisis in Europe is spreading and American lawmakers are
putting the nation’s top credit rating in jeopardy.  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index pared its weekly slump
yesterday as energy and technology companies rallied.  Alcoa
Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, lost 5.5 percent this
week after reporting profit that missed analyst estimates.  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC)  dropped 6.5 percent, the most in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , as financial companies tumbled.  Google Inc. (GOOG) 
surged 12 percent, the most since April 2008, after beating
sales projections.  The S&P 500 dropped 2.1 percent to 1,316.14 this week, the
most since the five-day period that ended June 10. The index
retreated after posting the biggest two-week increase since
2009. The Dow fell 177.47 points, or 1.4 percent, to 12,479.73.  “The market reaction is completely appropriate considering
the uncertainty that we have in the world,”  Michael Yoshikami ,
chief executive officer and founder of YCMNet Advisors, said in
a telephone interview. His firm manages $1.1 billion. U.S.
stocks retreated because of the debt crisis in Europe and
“what’s happening with the economic debate in Congress about
the debt ceiling. Investors feel anxious, and when investors
feel anxious they either sell or sit out,” he said.  Possible Cut  U.S. equities dropped as the impasse between President
Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress prompted Moody’s
Investors Service and S&P to say they may cut the federal
government’s credit rating. The  S&P 500  had risen to within
10.39 points of the almost three-year high reached on April 29.
Equities also dropped as European bonds slumped, spurring
concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, also
known as the VIX, which measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the S&P 500, jumped 22 percent,
the biggest gain since the week of May 6, to 19.53.  Energy companies were the only ones to post gains within 10
main groups in the S&P 500, adding 0.1 percent. Financial
companies dropped the most, 3.9 percent. Industrial and
consumer-discretionary companies fell more than 2.5 percent.  U.S. stocks plunged on July 11 as Spanish 10-year bond
yields topped 6 percent for the first time since 1997 amid
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread. European finance
chiefs clashed over how to dig Greece out of its financial hole
just as markets battered the bonds of Spain and Italy, opening a
new front in the debt crisis.  Ireland Downgraded  The S&P 500 also dropped on July 12 as Moody’s downgraded
Ireland, which joined Portugal and Greece in becoming the third
euro-area country to be lowered to junk.  Alcoa, which became the first Dow company to release
second-quarter results, fell 5.5 percent to $15.48. Second-
quarter profit excluding some items was 32 cents a share,
missing the 33-cent average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  While Alcoa missed projections, 11 of 13 S&P 500 companies
that released results this week beat projections.  “People are beginning to focus on earnings,” New York-
based Andrew Goldberg, who helps oversee $544 billion in assets
as market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said in telephone
interview. “Investors need to understand that there’s a
difference between the economy and investing. There’s macro
uncertainty, but corporate fundamentals are strong.”  The KBW Index fell 4.2 percent as all of its 24 stocks
declined. Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by assets,
tumbled 6.5 percent to $10, the lowest since May 2009.  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  plunged 8.7 percent, the biggest weekly drop since April
2010, to $38.38.  Flir, Google  Flir Systems Inc. (FLIR) , the maker of night-vision cameras used
by U.S. combat forces, slumped 15 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $28.92. It said second-quarter profit excluding some
items was 35 cents a share, trailing the average analyst
estimate by 4 cents, according to Bloomberg data.  Google advanced 12 percent to $597.62. Sales, excluding
revenue passed on to partner sites, rose to $6.92 billion. That
topped the $6.57 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 Energy Index rose as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s largest mining company, agreed to buy  Petrohawk Energy
Corp. (HK)  for $12.1 billion in cash, a bet that natural-gas demand
will increase in the U.S. Petrohawk surged 55 percent, the most
since at least 1999, to $38.17.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the most-active U.S. natural-gas
driller, jumped 7.8 percent to $32.96.  Range Resources Corp. (RRC) 
posted the second-biggest rally in the S&P 500, adding 10
percent to $61.78.  Clorox Co. (CLX)  climbed 9.4 percent, the most since October
2008, to $74.55. Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , who offered to
acquire Clorox yesterday in a deal valuing the company at $10.2
billion, said he expects interest from other buyers and that he
hasn’t studied spinning off individual brands.  To contact the reporters on this story:
