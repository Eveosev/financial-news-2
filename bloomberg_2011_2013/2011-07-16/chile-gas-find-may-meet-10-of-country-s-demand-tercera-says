Pan American Energy LLC and Chile’s
Empresa Nacional del Petroleo’s natural gas discovery in the
southern Magallanes region may satisfy as much as 10 percent of
the country’s daily demand,  La Tercera said , without saying how
it obtained the information.  The field may produce as much as 3 million cubic meters
(106 million cubic feet) of gas per day, the Santiago-based
newspaper reported. Daily oil production from the find may be as
much as 10,000 barrels, La Tercera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
