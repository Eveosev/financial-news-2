The Canadian government ordered
Missinippi Airways, a charter-and-cargo carrier that flies to
northern Manitoba and the Arctic, to suspend service due to
safety concerns.  The action comes after an inspection that followed a July 4
accident in Pukatawagan, Manitoba,  Transport Canada  said today
in a statement.  The carrier must “demonstrate that it meets all applicable
safety regulations” before Transport Canada will allow it to
operate again, the government agency said.  A call placed by Bloomberg News to  Missinippi ’s
headquarters after regular business hours wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
