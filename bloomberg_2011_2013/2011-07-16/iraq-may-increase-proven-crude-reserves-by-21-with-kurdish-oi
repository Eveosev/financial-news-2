Iraq  may raise its proven oil
reserves by 21 percent after adding those from the semi-
autonomous Kurdish region, Hussain al-Shahristani, deputy prime
minister for energy affairs, said today.  Iraq’s oil reserves may increase to 173 barrels by adding
30 billion barrels of Kurdish oil, al-Shahristani said in a
speech to ambassadors at the Foreign Ministry in  Baghdad . The
country’s crude production capacity will rise to 12 million
barrels a day by 2017, he said.  Iraq, home to the world’s fifth-biggest oil reserves, is
struggling to boost energy exports, the main source of revenue,
to help rebuild an economy shattered by years of conflict,
economic sanctions and sabotage. The country has signed 15 gas
and oil licenses since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that
ousted the regime of President  Saddam Hussein .  Iraq will sign contracts before the end of the year to add
7,500 megawatts of electricity production capacity, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
