Francois Hollande  leads  Martine Aubry  in the first round of a process to select a presidential
candidate for  France ’s Socialist Party, according to an
OpinionWay poll for Le Figaro and LCI.  Hollande would garner 42 percent of the first-round vote to
Aubry’s 34 percent were it to take place tomorrow,  Le Figaro 
said. The former lost 1 percentage point since the last poll on
June 17, while Aubry gained a point, the newspaper said.  Hollande, who led the party from 1997 to 2008, and Lille
mayor Aubry, best known for the 35-hour working week law passed
while she was labor minister, lead a field of six candidates.
Segolene Royal, the party’s candidate for the 2006 presidential
election, would get 13 percent of the vote, Arnaud Montebourg 7
percent, Manuel Valls 3 percent and Jean-Michel Baylet 1
percent, according to the poll.  Should Hollande and Aubry contest the second round of
voting, about 56 percent of those polled said they would vote
for the former, compared with 44 percent for the latter.  The most important attribute for a candidate is the ability
to beat President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in the presidential election,
according to 42 percent of respondents. About 37 percent focused
on the candidates’ proposals, Le Figaro said.  The Socialist Party will select its candidate for the 2012
presidential election in October. OpinionWay queried 1,113
“left sympathizers” for the poll, which was conducted from
July 13 to July 15, after the nomination period closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
