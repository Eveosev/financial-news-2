German lenders should write down the
value of Greek bonds in their first-half earnings reports,  Euro
am Sonntag  reported, citing Klaus-Peter Feld, a member of the
executive board of the  Institute of Public Auditors in Germany .  “Extraordinary writedowns of Greek bonds in the first half
of 2011 would follow a cautious assessment,” the newspaper
quoted Feld as saying. “Current discussions are showing
increasing signs that a haircut or a participation of private
creditors in another form have to be expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
