A delegation of Chinese agricultural
engineers and entrepreneurs decided to invest at least 1 billion
CFA Francs ($2.15 million) in Benin’s  palm oil  industry after a
visit to the western African nation.  Benin has vast untapped lands that could be used to produce
palm oil and increase the output of agricultural products, the
state-owned Office de Radiodiffusion et Television reported
today, citing Geng Wenbing, Chinese ambassador to the African
country and chief of the delegation.  The Chinese will invest in the industry over the next five
years to increase production and mechanize the industry. Palm
oil is highly sought after in  China  for the manufacture of
various food and cosmetic products.  “The funding plan and the amount will be announced by
Chinese entrepreneurs toward the end of the year,” Benin’s
Minister of Agriculture Sabai Kate was cited as saying by the
Cotonou-based broadcaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
