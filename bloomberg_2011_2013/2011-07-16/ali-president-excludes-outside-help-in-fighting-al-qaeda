Mali  President Amadou Toumani Toure
defended the African country’s strategy against al-Qaeda, saying
foreign assistance isn’t needed to fight the terrorist network.  “The joint operation against terrorism on the Mali-
Mauritania border is led by Mali,” Toure said yesterday in
Bamako, the capital. Mali doesn’t need foreign military help to
battle al-Qaeda, he said, adding that “this would be the worst
solution.”  Mali, Algeria, Mauritania and Niger have set up a joint
force to secure their shared Sahara-Sahel desert zone and
jointly fight terrorism, the countries said in a statement in
May. Mauritania’s military killed 15 al-Qaeda operatives in
northern Mali on June 25, Colonel Brahim Vall Ould Cheibany
said. Two soldiers died and five were wounded in the attack on
the terrorist camp, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
