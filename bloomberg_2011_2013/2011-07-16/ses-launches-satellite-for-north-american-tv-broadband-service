SES SA (SESG) , the world’s largest
publicly-traded satellite operator, said its SES-3 satellite
took off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to help
serve U.S. television networks and broadband services.  SES-3, which has a 15-year design life, will replace
another SES satellite above North America in providing coverage
for the region and the Caribbean, Luxembourg-based SES said
today in an e-mailed statement.  SES’s next launch is scheduled for the end of this month
from the European Space Port in  French Guiana .  To contact the reporter on this story:
