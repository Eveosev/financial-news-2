Three more North Korean soccer
players failed anti-doping tests given to the whole squad after
two teammates failed a test earlier this month at the Women’s
 World Cup .  FIFA didn’t name the players or the substance in a
statement today. All North Korean players were tested after Song
Jong Sun and Jong Pok Sim were provisionally suspended July 7
before a game against Colombia in Bochum. The two had been
tested after the team’s previous matches and the results
received yesterday morning.  North Korea  failed to advance out of the group stage of the
tournament in  Germany .  Colombian goalkeeper Yineth Varon was suspended June 28
after a positive out-of-competition drug test three days
earlier. She requested her second sample be tested, which
confirmed the first, and disciplinary proceedings have now been
opened against her, FIFA said, without identifying the
substance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
