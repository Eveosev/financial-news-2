A  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  plane carrying
 South Africa ’s Springbok rugby team was forced to return to
Johannesburg after an engine started overheating.  One of the Boeing 747’s four engines experienced an
increase in vibration and temperature about an hour into the
flight to  Australia , prompting the pilot to shut it down and
turn the aircraft back, Qantas said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “There was no safety issue with last night’s flight. As
safety is Qantas’s number-one priority, the aircraft returned to
Johannesburg as a precautionary measure,”  Olivia Wirth , a
spokeswoman for the Sydney-based carrier, said in a later e-mail
statement. “The Boeing 747 has four engines and can safely fly
on three engines.”  Springbok Captain John Smit said the plane landed safely
after returning to Johannesburg.  “Just had to do an emergency landing,” Smit said in a
post on his Twitter account. “We lost an engine after takeoff,
but safely landed now.”  Qantas sent a replacement airplane to Johannesburg. The
aircraft is scheduled to depart at 11:15 p.m. local time, Wirth
said. Flight QR64 had 355 passengers on board, Qantas spokesman
Luke Enright said by phone.  “All passengers have been consulted throughout the process
and have been accommodated in hotels close to OR Tambo
International Airport in Johannesburg and provided meals,”
Wirth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
