The city of  Buenos Aires  may publish
its own  consumer price index  starting in 2012 as doubts about
the veracity of the national CPI continue, La Nacion said,
citing officials it didn’t identify in the capital’s economy
ministry.  The Buenos Aires index would measure the costs of 300
goods, the newspaper reported.  Analysts including Vice President Julio Cobos and former
central bank President Javier Gonzalez Fraga have questioned the
federal government’s inflation reports since 2007, when then-
President Nestor Kirchner began making personnel changes at the
national statistics institute in a bid to “improve
operations.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
