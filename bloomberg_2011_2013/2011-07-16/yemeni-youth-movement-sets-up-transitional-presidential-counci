A Yemeni youth movement said it
established a transitional presidential council with 17 members
as it seeks to end the 33-year rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  The group appointed Major General Abdullah Ali Olaiwah, a
former defense minister, as commander of the armed forces, the
Organizing Committee of Popular Youth Revolution said in a
statement at a press conference in the capital, Sana’a, today.
Fahim Mohsen was appointed as the head of the judicial council,
the movement said.  Pro-democracy protesters have called for an end to Saleh’s
rule since January. Hundreds of people have died in clashes
between activists and government forces, while Yemen’s economy
and security deteriorate.  Tens of thousands of people rallied in Taiz today to
condemn the use of force against the southern city, Ammar al-
Kinani, a protest activist, said in a phone interview. Seven
civilians were killed and 30 others wounded in shelling by
Yemeni forces on Taiz, residents and witnesses said yesterday.  In Aden, four people were injured when police fired to
disperse a crowd blocking workers from entering the  Aden
Refinery Co. , Fawaz Sharabi, a witness, said today. The
protesters were demanding more jobs, he said.  -- Editors: Digby Lidstone, Paul Jarvis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
