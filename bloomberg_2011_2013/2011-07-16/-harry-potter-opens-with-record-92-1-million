“ Harry Potter  and the Deathly
Hallows, Part 2” set a single-day record with $92.1 million in
ticket sales yesterday in the film’s opening in the U.S. and
Canada,  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said.  The total includes record-breaking grosses of $43.5 million
from midnight and early morning shows at 3,800 locations and $2
million in revenue at  IMAX Corp. (IMAX)  theaters, Hollywood.com said.
The results for the Warner Bros. film’s opening at 4,375
theaters exceeded the $72.7 million one-day opening record of
“The Twilight Saga: New Moon” in November 2009, Hollywood.com
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Based on the early sales, the last of the “Harry Potter”
pictures may exceed other records, including the $158.4 million
July 2008 weekend record set by “The  Dark Knight ,” also a
Warner release, the box-office tracker said.  “I feel pretty comfortable saying the three-day domestic
record is in jeopardy,” Dan Fellman, Warner’s president of
domestic theatrical distribution, said in an interview
yesterday. “This is bittersweet because we own it ourselves
with ‘The Dark Knight.’”  In the latest  film , students and faculty at Hogwarts engage
in a life-and-death battle with forces of evil as Harry faces a
final showdown with his nemesis,  Lord Voldemort .  To contact the reporter on this story:
