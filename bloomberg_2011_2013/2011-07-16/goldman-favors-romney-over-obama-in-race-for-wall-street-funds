A year after President  Barack Obama 
signed into law the most extensive financial regulations since
the Great Depression, Wall Street so far is putting its
political money elsewhere.  Employees of Goldman Sachs Group gave Republican
presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  $238,250 in the last three
months, more than workers at any other company, according to a
computer-assisted analysis of Federal Election Commission data.
Obama took in $10,113.  Four years ago, employees of New York-based Goldman gave
$994,795 to Obama and $234,275 to Romney, according to the
 Center for Responsive Politics , a Washington-based research
group. For both candidates, it was more than any other company’s
employees.  In addition, Romney took in $2.1 million from donors
reporting a New York state address, where the financial industry
is headquartered, FEC data shows. Obama raised $1.3 million
during the same period. For the 2008 election, Obama raised
$50.5 million in the state; Romney raised $2.8 million,
according to the center.  Romney and Obama were among the candidates offering the
first looks at their presidential fundraising. Their FEC reports
cover donations through June 30.  Dodd-Frank Birthday  A year ago this month, Obama signed into law new rules for
a financial industry, which is blamed for contributing to the
worst economic downturn since the 1930s. The measure was passed
over the objection of most congressional Republicans, and Romney
has criticized the law.  “It’s telling that they would make Governor Romney’s
support for rolling back  Wall Street  oversight -- protections
put in place to ensure that the financial crisis doesn’t reoccur
-- part of their fundraising pitch,” said  Ben LaBolt , an Obama
campaign spokesman.  Former Assistant Treasury Secretary Emil Henry Jr., who co-
hosted a New York City fundraiser for Romney targeting the
financial industry last month, said the former Massachusetts
governor is getting support from the financial community
“because he is the most capable of the Republican candidates to
address the trinity of financial mismanagement by this
administration: soaring debt and deficits, record unemployment,
and an anemic economy.”  Romney led all Republican candidates by raising $18.3
million. He reported a bank account balance of $12.7 million.  Lobbyists’ Cash  Obama and Romney also part ways on the issue of taking
money from lobbyists. Obama won’t accept their cash, saying that
in doing so he is distancing himself from special interests.
Romney is accepting their checks. According to his FEC report,
registered lobbyists brought in $517,450, including Patrick Durkin, a lobbyist for London-based  Barclays PLC. (BARC)   U.S. Representative  Michele Bachmann  of  Minnesota  raised
$1.6 million, including $1.1 million in donations of less than
$200, and transferred $2 million from her congressional campaign
account to her presidential committee. She had $3.4 million cash
on hand.  Bachman entered the primary on June 13, later than her
rivals. She still managed, through her ability to excite
grassroots Republicans and Tea Party activists, to raise almost
as much and has more money in the bank than most of them.  Former Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty  reported raising
$4.3 million and had $2 million in the bank. The campaign said
$610,000 of that total was for the general election.  Representative Joe Wilson, the South Carolina Republican
who gained national attention for yelling, “You lie,” during
Obama’s Sept. 9, 2009, address to Congress, contributed $5,000
from his campaign account. Pawlenty’s leadership PAC gave
$4,749.  Bush Bundlers  Pawlenty also landed two former top fundraisers for
President  George W. Bush  for his national finance team. In the
2004 presidential,  Tom Hicks , chairman of Dallas-based Hicks
Holdings LLC, brought in more than $100,000 for Bush and Ray Washburne, chairman and chief executive officer of Dallas-based
Charter Holdings helped raise more than $200,000 for the former
president’s re-election campaign.  Former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich ’s presidential campaign,
beset by resignations of his top aides, reported owing more than
$1 million, including more than $450,000 to an air charter
company for travel and almost $50,000 to the candidate.  Gingrich told the FEC he had raised $2.1 million through
June 30 and had $322,222 in the bank. He received $5,000 from
his leadership political action committee.  Besides $451,946 for travel, the Gingrich campaign also
reported owing $212,060 for website management and $101,144 in
legal fees. Gingrich is owed $47,005 for travel and a mailing
list.  Gingrich Aides Quit  More than a dozen campaign aides resigned last month,
citing disagreements over strategy, the role of Gingrich’s wife,
Callista, and money. His two top fundraising aides also quit.  Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum raised $582,348
and had $229,115 in the bank.  Businessman  Herman Cain  raised $2 million, with $1.1
million in donations of under $200, and lent his campaign
$500,000. He had a bank account balance of $481,895.  Obama’s campaign committee reported raising $46 million
during the previous three months and entered July with $37.1
million in the bank.  As in the case of Bachmann, the president’s campaign
highlighted more than 500,000 donors who gave less than $200.  Clooney and Iger  The figures included $12.8 million from a joint fundraising
committee with the  Democratic National Committee  in which donors
could donate as much as $35,800 to the party and campaign. Those
giving the maximum included actor  George Clooney  and  Robert Iger , chief executive officer of the Burbank, California-based,
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  Employees of  Mountain View , California-based
Google donated $29,207.  Four years ago, Obama took in $58.6 million though June 30
of the non-election year, though he began raising money months
earlier than this time. During the three months from April to
June 2007, he raised $32.9 million. He announced his intention
to seek a second four-year term in April of this year.  Obama announced his fundraising totals on Wednesday, saying
that the campaign and the party took in more than $86 million
between them. The Democratic National Committee will spend most
of its money to re-elect the president.  The president on Friday released a list of 244 people who
raised at least $50,000 for his re-election campaign by donation
bundling, the practice of soliciting friends and associates to
make donations to the campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
