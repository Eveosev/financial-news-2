The Czech government may increase
the rate at which it plans to unify the value-added  tax rate  to
boost state revenue and reduce the budget deficit, Czech Prime
Minister Petr Necas told  Mlada Fronta Dnes  in an interview.  The rate may be set at 19 percent after the government
approved a plan in May to unify the upper and lower brackets at
17.5 percent from 2013. The lower VAT bracket is scheduled to
rise to 14 percent from 10 percent next year, with the upper
bracket being maintained at 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
