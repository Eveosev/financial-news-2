Russia’s Economy Ministry expects to
earn 1 trillion rubles ($35.6 billion) a year under an expanded
asset-sale program,  RIA Novosti  reported, citing Economy
Minister  Elvira Nabiullina .  The government’s previous plan called for a total of 1
trillion rubles of asset sales over the next three years.
President  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered the government last month to
amend the list by Aug. 1, saying the plan was “too modest.”  “We’re discussing about 1 trillion rubles annually from
state asset sales and keeping a ‘golden share’ in a number of
the companies,” the state news agency reported, citing
Nabiullina. “For infrastructure companies, we’re not proposing
going below less than 50 percent plus one share.”  The economy ministry wants to sell a 10 percent stake in
OAO Rusnano, which invests in nanotechnology, as part of the
program, the minister was cited as saying. The government
continues to discuss changes to the asset-sale plan, RIA Novosti
reported, citing Nabiullina.  The government may propose a “transition period” after
which it might relinquish the golden shares, which allow the
state to block major decisions, Nabiullina was cited as saying.
A list of companies will be ready nearer Medvedev’s Aug. 1
deadline, RIA Novosti cited her as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
