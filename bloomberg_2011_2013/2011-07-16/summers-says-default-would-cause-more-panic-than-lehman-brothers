A U.S. debt default would cause
panic throughout the financial system and long-term uncertainty,
former Treasury Secretary  Larry Summers  told CNN.  “It seems to me an unthinkable financial risk to take,”
Summers said in an interview on today’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS”
program. It would cause “a cascade that makes Lehman Brothers
look like a very small event.”  The bankruptcy of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in
September 2008 was the biggest in U.S history and was followed
by a collapse of credit markets and a 43 percent decline in the
 S&P 500 .  In 16 days, the U.S. will begin to default on its debt
obligations unless Congress and President Barack Obama can agree
on a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Obama has been trying to
break an impasse over whether to include cuts in entitlement
programs and tax increases in the deal.  Summers said a potential default makes him worry about
“runs on banks, runs on  money market funds ,” exchanges facing
“the prospect of collapse, institutions that had been built
over decades” being “swept away.”  “The ability to carry on routine financial business -- to
clear checks, to pay bills, to meet obligations would be lost,”
he said.  “It would be a totally self-inflicted cataclysm,” he
said. “There’s no question the  United States  can meet its
obligations. This idea that somehow that we cannot pay because
we’re having a political fight over how to handle the spending
and taxing” is “democracy functioning in the worst possible
way,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
