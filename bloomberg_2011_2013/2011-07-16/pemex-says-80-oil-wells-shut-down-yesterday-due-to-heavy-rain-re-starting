Petroleos Mexicanos,  Latin America ’s
largest oil producer, said 80 oil wells it shut down yesterday
in the states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas are re-opening today,
according to the company’s press office.  The Mexico City-based state oil company closed the wells
yesterday as a “preventative measure” amid heavy rains and the
risk of flooding.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
