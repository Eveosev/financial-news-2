Saudi International Petrochemical
Co. (SIPCHEM) , known as Sipchem, posted second-quarter profit growth that
beat analysts’ estimates, helped by higher sales and prices.  Net income rose 87 percent to 165.4 million riyals ($44
million) from 87.7 million riyals a year earlier, Al-Khobar-
based company said in a  statement  to the Saudi bourse today. The
average estimate of five analysts was for a profit of 152
million riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit gained because of improved operating and sales
performances and an increase in sales prices, the statement
said. Operating profit rose 67 percent to 288 million riyals.  Sipchem’s shares declined 1.1 percent on July 13, the last
day they were traded, giving the company a market value of 8.1
billion riyals. The stock has declined 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
