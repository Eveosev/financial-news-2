Alberto Alesina, a professor of
economics at  Harvard University , criticized European politicians
including German Chancellor Angela Merkel over their management
of the euro crisis, German newspaper  Welt am Sonntag  reported.  “ Europe ’s politicians talk a lot and do nothing,” the
newspaper cited Alesina as saying in an interview. “I’m really
shocked.”  Policy makers should stop talking and rather retreat from
the public eye until they can come back with a plan that is
“fully developed, credible and acceptable for everybody,” he
told the newspaper, adding that the politicians’ “back and
forth” is adding to the market’s nervousness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
