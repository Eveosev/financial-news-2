Gabon’s main opposition leader,
Pierre Mamboundou, said he’s started talks with president Ali Bongo Ondimba to lead the country in partnership with the ruling
party.  “We are negotiating with the power, but we will not sign
the charter of the Republican majority,” said Mamboundou, the
leader of the Union of Gabonese People, in an interview on Radio
Television Gabonaise today. “We are partners of the majority.”  “The agreement is almost ready,” he said. “We have to be
involved in all state structures, ministries, society,
institutions, etc. If things do not go in the right direction,
we will draw the consequences. We will not do like the others.
We will show the example.”  Mamboundou met the Gabonese prime minister on July 15, a
day after meeting Ondimba at the presidential palace.  Every other Gabonese opposition party has said it will not
take part in parliamentary elections in December if the
government fails to make the contest more transparent.  Mamboundou has led the Union du Peuple Gabonais for the
last 22 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
