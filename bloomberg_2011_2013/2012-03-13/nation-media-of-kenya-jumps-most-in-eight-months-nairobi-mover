Nation Media Group Ltd. (NMG) ,  East
Africa ’s biggest publishing company, gained the most in eight
months on speculation full-year earnings increased.  The stock advanced 1.9 percent to 165 shillings by 3:20
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at that level would be the
strongest since July 12.  “I expect some growth in turnover and profit because there
has been an improvement in advertising,” Renaldo d’Souza, a
research analyst with Genghis Capital Ltd., said by phone from
Nairobi today. “There could also be an improved dividend payout
going by the previous policy.”  The publishing company posted a 25 percent jump in first-
half profit as sales increased, it said in August. Net income
for the six-month period rose to 747 million shillings ($9.1
million) from 597.5 million shillings a year earlier. Sales
climbed 17 percent to 5.2 billion shillings.  Nation Media is scheduled to announce full-year results
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
