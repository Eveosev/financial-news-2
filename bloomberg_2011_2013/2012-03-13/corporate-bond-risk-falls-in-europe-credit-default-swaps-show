The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt fell, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 13.5
basis points to 571.5 at 7:54 a.m. in  London . The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings fell
three basis points to 131.5 basis points. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell five basis points to 210 and the
subordinated index declined eight to 352.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
