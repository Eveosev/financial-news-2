Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW) , the
Polish company that’s the European Union’s largest coking coal
producer, said 2011 net income jumped on higher coal prices and
canceled writedown on real estate tax.  Net income  rose to 2.09 billion zloty ($669.5 million) from
1.45 billion zloty a year earlier, the Katowice, southern
Poland-based company said in regulatory statement today. Sales
increased 29 percent to 9.38 billion zloty. Earnings before
interest and taxes rose 40 percent to 2.73 billion zloty.  The  state-controlled  company, whose 5.37 billion-zloty
share sale was Warsaw’s biggest initial public offering last
year, benefited from more expensive coking coal. The price of
coking coal, used by steelmakers, were an average 39 percent
higher in 2011 than in 2010, JSW said. Prices rose in the first
quarter last year after floods in  Australia  cut global supply.  JSW canceled a provision set aside earlier for a real
estate tax after last year the Constitutional Tribunal said the
levy was illegal. That added 359.7 million zloty to the
company’s pretax profit.  The company, whose biggest customers include the world’s
largest steel producer  ArcelorMittal (MT)  and U.S. Steel Corp.,
produced 8.8 million tons of coking coal last year and 3.8
million tons of thermal coal, used by power plants.  JSW reiterated today it plans to recommend a dividend of at
least 30 percent of 2011 net income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
