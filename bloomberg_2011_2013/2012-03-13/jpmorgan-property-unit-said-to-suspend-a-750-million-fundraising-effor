JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
 U.S. bank  by assets, temporarily halted raising a $750 million
fund to buy distressed real estate assets, said a person
familiar with the effort.  The fund, operated through a division called Junius Real
Estate Partners, made an initial investment, in  Salamander
Resort & Spa , a 168-room hotel in Middleburg,  Virginia , thatâ€™s
scheduled to open in 2013, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the fundraising is private.  Investor appetite for real estate funds has declined amid
slow economic growth, with $48.7 billion raised last year, about
one-third the amount gathered in 2008, according to London-based
Preqin Ltd., which researches private investment funds. At the
same time, more fund managers are competing for capital to
pursue investments following a decline in property values. There
are 406 funds trying to raise more than $169 billion, Preqin
said in a March 2 report.  Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Asset
Management, declined to comment.  The suspension in fundraising was reported earlier today by
the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
