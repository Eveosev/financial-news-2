A committee of the  California
Public Employees’ Retirement System  rejected a proposal by its
actuary to lower its assumed investment rate of return to 7.25
percent, opting instead for a smaller reduction.  The Pension and Health Benefits Committee recommended that
the biggest public U.S. retirement system drop its annual return
estimate to 7.5 percent from 7.75 percent. Actuary Alan Milligan
has  proposed  the board lower the rate to 7.25 percent. The full
board will consider the recommendation tomorrow.  A lower return rate would drive up what the fund, known as
Calpers, requires from taxpayers to provide benefits for more
than 1.6 million employees, retirees and their families. Public
funds have come under fire for using higher investment
assumptions that hide the true size of shortfalls. The $233.9
billion fund last adjusted its rate of return in 2004, to 7.75
percent from 8.25 percent.  “At least this a move in the right direction, but we are
still kicking the can down the road,” said board member Dan Dunmoyer.  Milligan told the committee before the vote that the fund
had a 50 percent chance it would meet the 7.5 percent return
over the next two decades. At 7.25 percent, that chance would
increase to more than 50 percent, he said.  State Costs  California will spend $3.5 billion in the current fiscal
year that ends June 30 to cover the cost of state worker pension
benefits. The 7.5 percent means the state will have to pay about
$167 million more in the coming fiscal year, instead of $425
million had the board lowered the rate to 7.25 percent, Milligan
said.  The board rejected a proposal by Milligan one year ago to
reduce the rate to 7.5 percent. Board members at the time
expressed concern that lowering the rate to 7.5 percent would
burden local governments when they were already facing financial
strains.  “Continuing to assume something that probably is not
realistic is simply kicking the can down the road,” said board
member George Diehr.  The pension fund estimates that it has about 70 percent to
75 percent of the money it needs to cover promised benefits.
That differs from a Stanford University  report  that said Calpers
was only 58 percent funded, based on a 6.2 percent annual return
on assets.  The fund earned 1.1 percent in the calendar year that ended
Dec. 31 as global equities dropped, compared with a gain of 2.1
percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares
including reinvested dividends.  Teachers’ Fund  Calpers earned almost 5.1 percent over a decade and 7.5
percent in the past 20 years, according to  Joe Dear , the
system’s investment chief.  The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the
second-largest U.S. public pension with $148.9 billion of
assets, agreed Feb. 2 to lower its assumed returns to 7.5
percent from 7.75 percent, the second reduction since 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
