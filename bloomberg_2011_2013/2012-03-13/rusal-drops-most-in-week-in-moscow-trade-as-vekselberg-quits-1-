United Co.  Rusal (486)  slid the most in a
week in Moscow after Victor Vekselberg resigned as chairman of
the world’s largest aluminum producer, saying the company
controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska is facing a “deep
crisis.”  The Russian depositary receipts dropped 3.5 percent to
230.88 rubles by the close in Moscow, their steepest decline
since March 6. Trading in the aluminum producer in  Hong Kong  was
suspended after it opened 1.3 percent lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
