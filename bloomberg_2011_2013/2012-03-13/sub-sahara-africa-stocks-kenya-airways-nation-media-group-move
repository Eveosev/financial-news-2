publishing company, gained for a third day, rising 1.9 percent
to 165 shillings, the highest level since July 12, on
speculation earnings will rise tomorrow when the company is
scheduled to announce its full-year results.  “I expect some growth in turnover and profit because there
has been an improvement in advertising,” Renaldo d’Souza, a
research analyst with Genghis Capital Ltd., said by phone from
Nairobi today. “There could also be an improved dividend payout
going by the previous policy.”  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline, plunged 7.2 percent to 16.75 shillings, the
lowest level since March 2009. The company said yesterday it

loans, to fund its 10-year expansion plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
