Iran  said it raised its official
premium for  light  crude sold to  Asia  for April to $3.01 a barrel
over the average of Middle East benchmarks.  The Iranian Light premium for Asia is up $1.25 a barrel
from March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Iranian
 Heavy (AOSPHVAS)  to the region will be priced at 89 cents above Oman and
Dubai, 65 cents higher, said an official at National Iranian Oil
Co. in Tehran who asked not to be identified, citing policy.  Producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran sell most of their
crude under long-term contracts to refiners. As the largest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
 Saudi Arabia  creates the standard for regional price changes.  Iran priced its Light grade for April at a 21-cent premium
to Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Arab Light, unchanged from the price
relationship it maintained during the first quarter.  NIOC lowered price differentials for all its crudes to
Northwest  Europe . Iranian  Light (AOSPLTNW)  to Europe for April will be
$1.75 below the Brent weighted average, 30 cents lower than
March.  The following table gives differentials of Iranian crude
supplied to five regions in relation to benchmark prices and the
month-on-month change. Prices are in U.S. dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
