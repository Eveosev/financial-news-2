Gasoline for prompt delivery
strengthened in New York Harbor, the U.S. Gulf Coast and
Midcontinent regions today.  The discount to April gasoline futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  for Gulf 87-grade gasoline narrowed 1.75
cents to 16.75 cents a gallon at 3:35 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The prompt-delivery price rose 4.91 cents
to $3.1871 a gallon.  In New York Harbor, the discount for conventional gasoline
to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB, narrowed 3 cents to 22.5
cents. The price for immediate delivery increased 6.16 cents to
$3.1296 a gallon.  Midcontinent 87-grade gasoline gained 1.25 cents to trade
at a 17.5-cent futures discount. The prompt price rose 3.47
cents to $3.1796 a gallon. The fuel in Chicago strengthened 0.5
cent to a 9.5-cent discount and the price gained 2.72 cents to
$3.2596 a gallon.  Transactions were lower than usual because many traders
were attending the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers
conference in  San Diego , said Jim Mosby, supply manager at ADMO
Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas City ,  Missouri .  “The last couple of days it’s been a very illiquid
market,” Mosby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
