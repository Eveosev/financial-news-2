Omani  shares  climbed to the highest
in almost eight months, led by  Bank Dhofar SAOG (BKDB) , after a court
ruled in favor of the nation’s third-largest lender.  Bank Dhofar surged the most in more than eleven years after
the Appeals Court ruled the bank didn’t need to transfer 26.1
million rials ($68 million) to the Enforcement Court’s account.
 Dhofar International Development & Investment Holding Co. (DIDI) , which
according to data compiled by Bloomberg owns a 27.5 percent
stake in the bank, surged 8.2 percent. The  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.9
percent to 5,957.32, the highest since July 19, at the 1 p.m.
close in Muscat.  “The announcement lifted sentiment as it will effectively
bring cash back to the bank,” said Kanaga Sundar, head of
research at Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC in Muscat. “If
they get the money, the bank will most likely report improved
profitability this year, and that’s what the market is looking
at.”  Bank Dhofar said in June that the Enforcement Court
directed it to transfer the funds following a lawsuit filed by
 Oman International Bank (OIBB)  against the bank and others. Bank Dhofar
posted a first-half loss after it set aside cash to comply with
the order. The bank’s full-year profit fell  58 percent to 13.98
million rials .  “The Appeals Court has considered the attachment as null
and void,” the lender said today in a statement to the bourse.  Bank Dhofar surged 9.9 percent, the biggest increase since
November 2000, to 0.597 rial. Dhofar International jumped the
most since April 2009 to 0.499 rial.  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  fell 0.1 percent. Bahrain’s
 benchmark  rose 0.2 percent. In the  United Arab Emirates ,  Abu
Dhabi ’s  measure  advanced 0.3 percent and Dubai’s  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  rallied 0.9 percent. Kuwait’s gauge and Qatar’s  index  fell
less than 0.1 percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) 
slipped 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
