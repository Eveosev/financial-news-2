French citizens who live overseas
to avoid paying higher taxes at home will face French taxes,
Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said.  President  Nicolas Sarkozy  announced the measure in a
television interview earlier today.  “The idea is that we replace taxation based on residence
with tax based on nationality,” Baroin said at a press
conference in Brussels when asked about Sarkozy’s proposal.
“Others have done it, the Americans have done it. There should
be no tax advantage for living overseas and if there is a
difference it has to be made up.”  Baroin said “the president realizes that there’s a
difference between someone who lives abroad for tax reasons and
someone who lives abroad to pursue a stage in their career.”  Baroin said the measures would require new tax treaties
with foreign countries which would be re-negotiated should
Sarkozy win re-election in May. Baroin said he couldn’t estimate
how much revenue the measures could raise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
