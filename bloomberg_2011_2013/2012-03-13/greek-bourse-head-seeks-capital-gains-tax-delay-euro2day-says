Greece ’s Capital Markets Commission
Chairman Costas Botopoulos and Athens Stock Exchange Chairman
Socrates Lazaridis asked that a planned capital gains tax on
share sales be further postponed to June,  Euro2day.gr  reported.  Botopoulos and Lazaridis sent a joint letter to Finance
Ministry officials requesting implementation of the tax be
postponed and proposing a tax-free threshold and a flat rate
levy for any amount over the threshold of about 15 percent on
gains from shares sold, the Athens-based website said, without
citing anyone.  Greece’s government has already delayed the tax, which was
set to take effect at the beginning of 2012, by three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
