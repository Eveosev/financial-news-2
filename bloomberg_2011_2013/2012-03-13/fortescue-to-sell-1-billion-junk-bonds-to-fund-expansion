Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s biggest junk bond issuer, plans to sell $1 billion
of senior unsecured notes to help fund an expansion of its iron
ore operations and to buy mining equipment and vehicles.  The high-yield offering will help pay for output growth as
well as a mobile mining fleet, the Perth-based company said
today in a statement to the Australian stock exchange. The five-
and ten-year bonds will be callable after three and five years,
respectively, according to a person familiar with the sale, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  Fortescue, Australia’s third-largest iron ore producer, is
expanding to meet growing demand in  China , the world’s biggest
producer of steel. The company, rated BB- by  Standard & Poor’s ,
three levels below investment grade, has $5.6 billion of bonds
and loans outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The mining company, which is seeking to almost triple iron
ore output to 155 million metric tons, last sold bonds in
October when it issued $1.5 billion of 8.25 percent, 2019 notes
callable after four years, paying 648 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries. The spread on the notes narrowed to
524.8 basis points today, according to prices from Nomura
Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
