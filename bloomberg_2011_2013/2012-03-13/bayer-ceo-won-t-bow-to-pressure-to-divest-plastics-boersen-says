Bayer AG (BAYN)  Chief Executive Officer
Marijn Dekkers won’t yield to pressure from investors to sell
the company’s plastics businesses,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported,
citing an interview with the executive.  While he is approached “almost daily” by some investors
to separate the material science unit from the pharmaceutical
and crop science businesses, investors that prefer strictly
focused companies aren’t loyal shareholders, the newspaper
reported Dekkers as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
