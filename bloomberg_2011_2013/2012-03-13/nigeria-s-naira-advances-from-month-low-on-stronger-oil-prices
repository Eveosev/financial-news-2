The naira appreciated from near a
month low on speculation it will be supported as stronger  oil
prices  outweighed an increase in gasoline import orders.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer strengthened
0.3 percent to 157.85 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of
5:48 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The naira weakened 0.6 percent yesterday
to the lowest closing level since Feb. 15.  Oil in  New York  rebounded from the lowest level in almost a

revenue inflows,” Barclays Plc-owned Absa Capital strategists,
led by Ridle Markus in Johannesburg, wrote in a note to clients

prices are also a boon.”  Nigeria , which imports 70 percent of its fuel due to a lack
of refining capacity, approved a tender for 3.57 million metric
tons of gasoline imports into the country for the second
quarter, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency said
yesterday. Forty-two fuel retailers including the stated-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.,  Conoil Plc (CONOIL)  and  Oando Plc (OANDO)  were
issued permits.  The economy of Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa’s second
largest, expanded 7.68 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011

months and compared with 8.6 percent in the same period in 2010.  Yields Rise  Borrowing costs on the West African nation’s domestic bonds
