Kirin Holdings Co. (2503) , Japan’s biggest
brewer by market value, rose to the highest in about six months
in  Tokyo  trading after an increase in the nation’s domestic
shipments of beer barrels.  The  stock  rose 2.1 percent to close at 1,018 yen, the
highest since Sept. 1. Second-ranked  Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502) 
slid 2.3 percent.  Shipments of beer barrels, typically used in beer halls,
rose 1.1 percent in February, the Brewers Association of Japan
 said  in a statement yesterday. The increase is supporting
optimism that the domestic beer market is recovering, Mikihiko Yamato, an analyst at JI Asia in Tokyo, said by phone today.  “The company that benefits most in terms of share price
from a recovery in the domestic shipment is Kirin, as investors
had already been buying Asahi,” said Yamato, who has a ‘buy’
 rating  on Tokyo-based Kirin.  Asahi, which got 93 percent of its  revenue  in 2010 from
 Japan , has added 10.4 percent in the past six months, while
Kirin gained 3.7 percent in the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
