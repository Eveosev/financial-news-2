Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-largest
oil company, may expand in  East Africa  after it started a
project in Uganda, said Chief Executive Officer Christophe De
Margerie.  Total and Cnooc Ltd. last month completed a $2.9 billion
transaction with Tullow Oil Plc acquiring stakes in the Lake
Albert Basin fields after almost a year of talks. The French
company is among oil producers and utilities interested in
buying a 20 percent stake in  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s gas discovery off
 Mozambique , according to people with knowledge of the matter.  “We are presently focused on Kenya and Tanzania,” de
Margerie told reporters in Kuwait today. “For Mozambique, we
might look at it at some point in the future. There isn’t
anything final there yet.”  Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Tullow are among explorers
expanding in East Africa after Statoil ASA,  BG Group Plc (BG/) , Eni
and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. found about 70 trillion cubic feet
of gas off Mozambique and Tanzania. PTT Exploration & Production
Pcl, Thailand’s only listed oil and gas company, last month
trumped Shell with a $1.7 billion bid for local explorer Cove
Energy Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
