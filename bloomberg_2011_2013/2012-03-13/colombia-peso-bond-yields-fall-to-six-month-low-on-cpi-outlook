Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to a six-month low, as a decline
in economists’ inflation estimates fueled demand for fixed-rate
securities.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 7.19 percent in Bogota, according to the central bank. That’s
the lowest level on a closing basis since Sept. 9. The price
rose 0.273 centavo to 122.437 centavos per peso.  Economists cut their year-end inflation forecast to 3.45
percent, according to the median forecast in a central bank
 survey  published March 9 after markets closed. The median
estimate was 3.5 percent in the February survey. Inflation rose
last month to 3.55 percent, from 3.54 percent in January,
indicating Banco de la Republica’s nine interest rate increases
since February 2011 have helped keep inflation in check as the
economy expands.  “This year started out pretty benign in terms of
inflation,” said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Serfinco SA
brokerage in Bogota. “Those surprises are favorable to the
market, which has continued to adjust its inflation
expectations.”  The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due in 2013 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge
of annual consumer price increase expectations, fell to 3.34
percentage points today from 3.95 percentage points two months
ago.  Colombian policy makers raised the overnight lending rate a
quarter percentage point to 5.25 percent on Feb. 24 from a
record low 3 percent last year, at a time when central banks in
 Brazil ,  Chile  and  Russia  cut borrowing costs to shore up growth
in their economies.  Interest-Rate Outlook  Banco de la Republica will raise the key rate to 5.5
percent in the March 23 meeting and leave it at that level
through the remainder of the year, according to the majority of
economists in the central bank survey. The bank targets
inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent.  Policy makers forecast gross domestic product in Colombia
may be as high as 6 percent in 2011 and 2012. The economy
expanded 7.7 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier,
its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2006 when GDP rose
7.73 percent. The national statistics agency is scheduled to
report 2011 GDP growth on March 22, a day before the central
bank’s next policy meeting.  Whether or not policy makers will continue raising rates
“will depend on the evaluation we make every month of future
inflation, given the midpoint of our target range, and the
evaluations we make about the behavior of economic growth and
financial variables,” bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said March 1
in Punta del Este, Uruguay.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 1,758.15 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,763.90 yesterday. The peso has jumped 10.3 percent this year,
the second-best performance, after the  Mexican peso , among a
basket of emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
