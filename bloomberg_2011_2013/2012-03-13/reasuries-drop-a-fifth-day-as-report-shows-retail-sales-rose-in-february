Treasuries (YCGT0025)  fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest in seven weeks, as a gain in U.S. retail
sales boosted optimism the economy is strengthening and eased
bets the  Federal Reserve  will favor more asset purchases.  Ten-year yields rose for a fifth day, the longest run of
increases since January, before the Treasury sells $21 billion
of the securities.  U.S. two-year  note yields reached a seven-
month high before a Fed policy statement today, and 30-year
yields gained before tomorrow’s $13 billion sale of the debt.  “We’ve come into this week with the fear that seems to be
coming to fruition of firming data, the likelihood of the Fed
really not offering us anything else, and supply,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The simple math suggests we
should be backing up a little bit to accommodate those things,
and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing.”  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes rose four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.07 percent at 12:30 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched
2.09 percent, the highest level since Jan. 23. The price of the
2 percent securities maturing in February 2022 decreased 11/32,
or $3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 11/32.  Ten-year  yields  have traded this year between 1.79 percent
and 2.09 percent. They reached a record low of 1.67 percent on
Sept. 23.  Two-year note yields were up less than one basis point to
0.33 percent, the highest level since Aug. 4.  Thirty-year bond 
yields advanced four basis points to 3.21 percent.  Net Shorts  Treasuries investors in a weekly survey by JPMorgan Chase &
Co. bet for the first time since January that prices of the
securities will drop. Net shorts, or wagers that prices will
fall, outweighed net longs by 2 percentage points in the week
ended yesterday. Fifty-seven percent of the clients surveyed
were neutral.  Volatility in the Treasuries market declined yesterday to
the lowest level in more than four years. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which measures price swings based on
options, dropped to 69.9, the least since July 2007. The gauge
was as high as 117.8 on Aug. 8. The reading means traders expect
a yield range of 69.9 basis points on an annualized basis in the
next month.  Price swings have narrowed as the Fed’s debt-purchase
programs made it the biggest owner of U.S. government
securities, according to Treasury and central bank data. The Fed
had holdings of $1.66 trillion as of Dec. 31, the data show,
compared with  China ’s $1.15 trillion.  Fed Meeting  The  Federal Open Market Committee  is scheduled to issue its
statement at about 2:15 p.m. New York time after a policy
meeting.  “We may see a slight upgrade in economic conditions,” Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia, said of today’s Fed statement. The firm
oversees $12 billion in fixed-income assets.  The best six months of job gains since 2006 have helped
reduce the odds of a third round of asset purchases by the Fed,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. U.S.
payrolls expanded by 227,000 jobs in February, capping the
growth streak, Labor Department data showed last week.  Sixty-one percent of respondents in a March 9-12 Bloomberg
News survey said Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will refrain from
any action to expand the central bank’s $2.89 trillion balance
sheet this year. In January, 50 percent of those surveyed
predicted more bond buying.  Gave No Sign  Bernanke, in Senate testimony before a March 9 jobs report,
gave no sign he’s considering a new program of so-called
quantitative easing. Still, he repeated that the main  interest
rate  is likely to stay near zero through at least late 2014 to
boost a job market that remains “far from normal.”  The Fed chief said on Jan. 25 after the central bank’s
previous meeting that policy makers were considering additional
asset purchases to boost growth. The central bank bought $2.3
trillion of securities in two rounds of quantitative easing from
December 2008 to June 2011.  Treasuries extended losses today after Commerce Department
data showed retail sales increased 1.1 percent in February,
matching the forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
The figure compared with a revised 0.6 percent increase the
previous month.  Inflation Bets  The difference in yield between  Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities (USGGBE10)  and nominal bonds, known as the break-even
rate, indicates investors expect consumer prices to rise 2.32
percent annually over the next 10 years. The average over the
past year is 2.19 percent.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said in a message on Twitter
that if investors want to bet on Treasuries rising, they should
own them in TIPS form.  The 10-year U.S. notes being sold today yielded 2.075
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.02 percent at
the previous auction of the securities on Feb. 8. The January
offering drew a record low yield of 1.90 percent  The February sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.05, below the 3.10 average of the past 10 auctions. Indirect
bidders, a class of investors that includes foreign central
banks, bought 38.9 percent of the notes at the February
offering, versus a 43.9 percent average for the past 10 sales.  At yesterday’s $32 billion sale of three-year notes,
indirect bidders bought 34.6 percent of the securities, compared
with an average of 36.8 percent during the past 10 sales.  U.S. 10-year yields will increase to 2.54 percent by year-
end, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey, with the most recent projections given the heaviest
weighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
