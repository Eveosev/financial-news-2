Bloomberg's Elliott Gotkine 
reports on the village of Rueschlikon,  Switzerland  where a tax 
rate reduction following Gencore International going public 
last year prevented a windfall for the area and allowed 
executives to keep more of their money. He speaks on Bloomberg 
Television's "InBusiness With Margaret Brennan."  (Source:
