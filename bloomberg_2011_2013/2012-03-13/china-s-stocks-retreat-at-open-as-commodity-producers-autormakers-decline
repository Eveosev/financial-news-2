China’s stocks fell for a second
day as metal producers and automakers declined on concern the
government may raise fuel prices at the same time as an economic
slowdown cools demand.  The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.1 percent to
2,433.67 at 9:36 a.m., extending yesterday’s 0.2 percent
decline. About five stocks fell for every three that rose on the
gauge.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
