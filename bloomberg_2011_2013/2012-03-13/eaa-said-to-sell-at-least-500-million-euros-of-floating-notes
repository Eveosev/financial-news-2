Erste Abwicklungsanstalt is selling
at least 500 million euros of two-year unsecured floating-rate
notes, according to a banker with knowledge of the transaction.  The notes may be priced to yield about 20 basis points more
than Euribor, the banker said. Commerzbank AG, DekaBank, UBS AG
and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing the deal, which will be completed
tomorrow at the latest.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
