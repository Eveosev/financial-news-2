Exxon Mobil (XOM)  Corp. said its Cepu oil
and gas block in  Indonesia ’s Central province hasn’t been
disrupted by a demonstration of contract oil workers.  “We can confirm that to date, there has been no impact to
our production from Banyu Urip Field in Cepu Block,” Jeffrey
Haribowo, a Jakarta-based communication adviser at Exxon Mobil
Indonesia, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Banyu Urip
field with a target to eventually produce 165,000 barrels a day,
the company said in its  website.   Protesting workers blocked road access to Exxon Mobil’s
production facility in Cepu since March 9, Gde Pradnyana, a
Jakarta-based spokesman at the Indonesia’s oil and gas regulator
BPMigas said yesterday. The block now produces 22,000 barrels of
oil a day, he said.  Mobil Cepu and Ampolex Cepu Pte Ltd. own 45 percent of the
Cepu oil and gas block, Pertamina EP Cepu holds 45 percent, and
the Cepu Block Cooperation Body holds the rest, the company said
on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
