The yen erased earlier losses
against the dollar after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  kept its key  interest
rate  and asset-purchase program unchanged.  The central bank added a 1 trillion yen ($12 billion)
program for loans denominated in U.S. dollars and is expanding
its venture capital-style domestic fund by 500 billion yen. The
euro remained higher versus the U.S. currency after euro-area
finance ministers approved a second Greek bailout, clearing the
way for the first payment from the 130 billion-euro package
($171 billion) to be made this month.  “The BOJ’s decision may look disappointing to some market
participants,” said  Tohru Sasaki , head of  Japan  rates and
foreign-exchange research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  Tokyo .
“That’s leading to some buying back of the yen as the market
was leaning toward shorting the Japanese currency.” A short is
a bet that an asset will decline in value.  The yen gained 0.1 percent to 82.18 per dollar at 6:40 a.m.
in  London  from the close in  New York  yesterday, after earlier
dropping as much as 0.3 percent. Japan’s currency was little
changed at 108.14 per euro after it declined as much as 0.4
percent. The euro traded at $1.3166 from $1.3155, following a
0.2 percent advance yesterday.  BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his board members kept
the benchmark interest rate between zero and 0.1 percent, the
central bank said in a statement today. Policy makers left the
asset purchase fund at 30 trillion yen and a credit-loan program
at 35 trillion yen. They unexpectedly boosted bond buying by 10
trillion yen at the Feb. 14 meeting, driving the yen lower.  Worst Performer  Japan’s currency slid 5.5 percent in the past month, the
worst performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
appreciated 0.8 percent, and the euro added 0.6 percent.  The 17-nation euro strengthened against 11 of its 16 major
counterparts after the currency bloc’s finance ministers
approved  Greece ’s second bailout.  Greece is now in line to receive more than 100 billion
euros in the next three years from the European Financial
Stability Facility, the euro region’s temporary rescue fund,
starting with payments of 5.9 billion euros in March, 3.3
billion euros in April and 5.3 billion euros in May, EFSF Chief
Executive Officer Klaus Regling said.  “The worst is over for the euro with Greece avoiding a
disorderly default,” said Noriaki Murao, managing director in
New York at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., a unit of
Japan’s biggest financial group by market value. “I expect to
see traders unwinding their short positions.”  Fed Meeting  Losses in the dollar were limited as evidence of a U.S.
economic recovery tempered speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will signal additional easing at a meeting today.  Retail sales in the U.S. increased 1.1 percent in February,
the most in five months, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey before Commerce Department
figures due today. That would follow data on March 9 that showed
nonfarm payrolls increased by 227,000 in February after rising
by a revised 284,000 the prior month. The  unemployment rate  held
at a three-year low of 8.3 percent.  “Recent U.S. data may be strong enough to persuade policy
makers to be less cautious about the pace of the recovery,”
said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow
Ltd., which provides currency margin-trading services. “The
market is reducing bets for another round of quantitative
easing.”  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, reached 80.132 yesterday, the most since Jan.
25 and was 0.1 percent lower at 79.802 today.  The index fell 0.4 percent on Jan. 25, when the Fed said
subdued inflation and slack in the economy are likely to warrant
keeping rates “exceptionally low” at least through late 2014.  The Australian and  New Zealand  dollars rose for the first
time in three days as Asian shares reversed losses from
yesterday, boosting demand for riskier assets.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares climbed 0.9 percent,
rebounding from a 0.6 percent fall yesterday. Standard & Poor’s
500 Index futures rose 0.4 percent from yesterday, when the
stocks gauge fell as much as 0.3 percent.  Australia ’s dollar gained 0.3 percent to $1.0548 and New
Zealand’s currency advanced 0.5 percent to 82.24 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
