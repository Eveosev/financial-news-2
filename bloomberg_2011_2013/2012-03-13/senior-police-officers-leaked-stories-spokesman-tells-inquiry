Senior officers had unauthorized
contact with journalists and leaked a series of stories, the
 Metropolitan Police Service ’s press chief told a U.K. judge
running an inquiry into phone hacking and media ethics.  “I’ve never seen anything like it before or since,” Dick
Fedorcio, the force’s director of public affairs, said today.
His witness statement described a “continuing pattern of
leaks” in the months before February 2008, Judge Brian Leveson
said.  The leaks could only have come from senior officers,
Fedorcio said.  The inquiry was commissioned by Prime Minister  David Cameron  following the phone-hacking scandal at News Corp.’s News
of the World tabloid. U.K. police investigating bribes paid to
officers by journalists in return for information have arrested
23 people.  Metropolitan Police Service Deputy Assistant Commissioner
Sue Akers, who oversaw the probes, told the inquiry on Feb. 27
that  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Sun newspaper had a “culture” of corrupt
payments to public officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
