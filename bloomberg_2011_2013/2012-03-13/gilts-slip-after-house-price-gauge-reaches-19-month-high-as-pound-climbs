U.K gilts fell as a  house-price
index  climbed to a 19-month high in February and stocks rose
across  Europe , sapping demand for the relative safety of fixed-
income assets.  The declines pushed the 10-year yield up by the most since
Feb. 29. The pound rose to a one-week high against the euro and
snapped a two-day drop versus the dollar after the  Royal
Institution  of Chartered Surveyors home-price gauge increased 3
points from January to minus 13, the strongest since July 2010.  “Gilts are moving in sympathy with the other markets,”
said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in London. With stocks rising
in the U.K. and Europe, “it’s no surprise to see gilt yields
slightly higher,” he said.  The yield on the 10-year bond rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 2.17 percent at 4:17 p.m.  London  time,
after slipping six basis points yesterday to the lowest since
Feb. 28. The 4 percent note due March 2022 fell 0.72, or 7.20
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,572) face amount, to 116.37.  Britain’s benchmark stock index, the FTSE 100, rose 1
percent while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.7 percent.  Bunds, Treasuries  Gilts slid with German bunds and Treasuries after reports
showed confidence in Europe’s largest economy improved more than
analysts forecast and retail sales in the U.S. jumped in
February by the most in five months. Demand for safety also
waned as euro-area finance ministers endorsed a second Greek
bailout. The German 10-year bond yield increased six basis
points to 1.82 percent and the rate on similar-maturity U.S.
securities climbed four basis points to 2.08 percent.  U.K. bonds have lost 0.5 percent this year as signs that
Europe is making progress in solving the debt crisis reduced
demand for safety, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bonds made 0.4 percent, while Treasuries handed investors
a 0.6 percent loss, the indexes show.  The FTSE-100 Index has climbed 6.7 percent this year.  Sterling gained 1 percent to 83.30 pence per euro. The
pound rose 0.6 percent to $1.57366. It fell to as little as
$1.5603 yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 25.  The pound may decline toward $1.5530 after falling below
its 55-day moving average and reaching its lowest level this
month, according to  Michael Hewson , a markets analyst at CMC
Markets in London.  “The key barrier on the upside remains at the 200-day
moving average,” which is “a key resistance level for another
crack at the $1.60 area,” he wrote in a client note e-mailed
today. Resistance refers to an area where sell orders may be
clustered.  The pound’s 200-day moving average against its U.S. peer is
at $1.5873, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 55-day
moving average was at $1.5685.  To contact the reporter on this story:
