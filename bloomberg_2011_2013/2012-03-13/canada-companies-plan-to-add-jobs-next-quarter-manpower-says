Canadian employers plan to add
workers in the second quarter with mining firms the most
optimistic, according to a survey by  Manpower Inc. (MAN)   The share of companies planning to hire exceeded those who
forecast cutbacks by 13 percentage points after adjusting for
seasonal variations, the Milwaukee-based employment-services
firm said in a statement. The figure has ranged between 13 and
16 over the past five reports.  Job  creation  has slowed since the middle of last year.
 Statistics Canada  reported March 9 that employment fell by 2,800
in February as the  labor force  shrank by the most since January
2009. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  has said his March 29 budget
will focus on measures to boost employment and growth.  Mining had the best prospects among industries, with an
employment outlook of 21 percent, while public administration
had the lowest reading at 6 percent.  “Strengthened by an active outlook in the Mining industry
sector where efforts are under way in  Alberta  to develop the
largest oil field outside the Middle East, the net employment
outlook for the upcoming quarter indicates a respectable hiring
climate,” Janis Sugar, marketing director for Manpower Canada,
said in a statement.  The survey of 1,900 Canadian employers found 21 percent
intended to hire and 5 percent anticipated reductions, giving a
net outlook of 16 before seasonal adjustment. The results are
accurate within 2.2 percentage points, Manpower said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
