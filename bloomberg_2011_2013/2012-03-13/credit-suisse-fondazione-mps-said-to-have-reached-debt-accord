Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  reached an
accord with Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena to restructure
a loan that uses  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA â€™s shares as
collateral, two people familiar with the matter said.  The agreement, which involves a collateral contract for a
490 million-euro ($642 million) loan, will allow Fondazione
Monte Paschi to proceed with a plan to sell as much as 15.5
percent of Monte Paschi, said one of the people, who declined to
be identified because the accord is confidential.  The foundation, which owns about 46 percent of Monte
Paschi, reached a similar agreement with a pool of banks led by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. on a separate loan of 525 million euros
last week. The two accords give the foundation the green light
to sell the shares as part of a plan to cut debt.  The agreement with Credit Suisse was earlier reported by
news agency Ansa. Officials at Fondazione Monte Paschi and
Credit Suisse declined to comment.  Monte Paschi  fell  1.6 cents, or 0.4 percent, to 37.95 cents
in Milan trading, compared with a 3.2 percent advance in the 43-
company Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.  Investment firms Equinox and Clessidra are in talks with
Fondazione Monte dei Paschi on its stake in the bank, Italian
daily  Corriere della Sera  reported last month, without saying
how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
