Procera Networks Inc., (PKT)  which
develops tools to improve routing information through networks,
rose the most since November in intraday trading after a Sterne
Agee analyst said the company’s market for potential customers
is growing.  Procera  rose  9 percent to $20.99 at 2:49 p.m. in  New York ,
the biggest intraday increase since Nov. 8. Shares of the
Fremont, California-based company gained 24 percent this year
before today.  Procera’s technology for deep packet inspection, which
examines data as it flows through a network, could eventually be
used to customize services for specific content and
applications, said Alex Kurtz, an analyst with Sterne Agee &
Leach, in an e-mail. That could attract cloud storage providers
who want to tailor data services, he said.  The deep packet inspection market “is moving through an
inflection point in our view with regards to use cases and
potential market size,” Kurtz said in a note to investors
today.  Procera helps cable companies and mobile operators report
on network traffic -- a market which is also growing as more
consumers use smartphone data plans and stream high-definition
video. Kurtz also said  Allot Communications Ltd., (ALLT)  based in Hod
Hasharon,  Israel , would benefit from the trend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
