Governments from 96 countries and
international organizations agreed on voluntary guidelines for
land tenure and access rights to land, fisheries and forests,
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  The proposed guidelines will now be considered for final
approval by the Committee on World Food Security, or CFS, at a
meeting tentatively scheduled for May 18, the Rome-based FAO
wrote in a  statement  on its website today.  The text follows three years of talks between governments,
farmers associations, non-profit groups and international
organizations, and cover topics including equal rights for women
in securing land title, record-keeping systems and protection of
informal, traditional rights to land, according to the FAO.  “The guidelines will be voluntary, but because they have
been drawn up in such a comprehensive and inclusive process, and
because there is this shared perception that a framework like
this is sorely needed, we all anticipate that they will set the
bar for policy makers,” Yaya Olaniran, CFS chairman,  was cited
as saying in the statement.  Once officially approved, the guidelines will serve as a
reference for governments for laws and policy related to access
and ownership rights for land, fishing resources and forests,
the FAO said.  “We’re already seeing governments moving to bring their
policies and practices into alignment with the guidelines,”
Olaniran was cited as saying.  Countries that funded the preparation of the voluntary
guidelines were Germany, Switzerland and  Finland , the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
