Citizens Bank of  Pennsylvania  and
plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging overdraft fees asked for a
delay in proceedings while they pursue private mediation,
according to a court filing.  “The parties have agreed to engage in private mediation in
an effort to resolve this case without further litigation,” the
Pittsburgh-based bank and the customers said today in a filing
in federal court in Miami. They agreed to suspend court filings
on whether to certify the case as a class-action, or group,
lawsuit. A mediation session is scheduled for April 17,
according to the filing.  At least 30 banks have cases before U.S. District Judge
James Lawrence King in Miami. The customers say the banks
reorder debit-card transactions in their computers to maximize
overdraft fees.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, has
reached a preliminary agreement to pay $110 million to settle
litigation.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-biggest U.S. bank
by assets, agreed last year to pay $410 million without
admitting liability.  Union Bank NA agreed to a $35 million settlement with
customers in November. An Associated Banc-Corp. unit, Associated
Bank, agreed in November to pay $13 million.  The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
