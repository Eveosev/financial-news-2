The U.S. outsold  Germany  as the
world’s second-biggest exporter behind  China  last year as demand
from Germany’s main trade parters in the euro-zone fell,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing calculations by the
Munich-based Ifo institute.  China accounted for almost 11 percent of global exports in
2011, followed by the U.S. with 8.4 percent and Germany with 8.3
percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
