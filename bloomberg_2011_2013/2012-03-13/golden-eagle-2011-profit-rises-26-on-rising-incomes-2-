Golden Eagle Retail Group Ltd. (3308) ,  a
department store operator based in eastern  China ’s Jiangsu
province, said 2011 profit gained 26 percent as it benefited
from shoppers’ rising incomes. Shares rose.  Net income rose to 1.21 billion yuan ($192 million), or
0.62 yuan a share, from 959.2 million yuan, or 0.49 yuan, a year
earlier, the company said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday. Profit matched the average estimate of 1.2 billion
yuan from 16 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg News.  Sales jumped 31 percent to 3.22 billion yuan in 2011, and
same-store sales gained 25 percent. Consumers in the world’s
most populous nation are getting wealthier as urban disposable
income rose 14 percent to about 21,810 yuan in 2011.  The Nanjing-based department store operator said it plans
to open five to eight stores annually over the coming three
years, expanding its presence in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shaanxi and
Yunnan provinces. New outlets may be in self-owned or leased
real estate or may be acquired, Golden Eagle said.  Golden Eagle rose 5.4 percent to HK$20.15 in  Hong Kong , the
highest close since March 2. The stock has  gained  23 percent
this year, compared with the benchmark  Hang Seng Index ’s 16
percent advance.  The company will pay a final dividend of 0.188 yuan a share
for 2011, compared with 0.15 yuan a share for 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
