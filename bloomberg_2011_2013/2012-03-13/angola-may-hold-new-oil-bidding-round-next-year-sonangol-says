Angola  may hold a new oil-bidding
round next year, a senior official at state-owned oil company
Sonangol EP said today.  “We haven’t decided yet on the areas on offer,” Gaspar
Martins, an executive board member at Sonangol, told reporters
at a conference in Kuwait. Some may be onshore, some deepwater,
he said.  Angola, Africa’s biggest oil producer after Nigeria,
awarded BP Plc and  Statoil ASA (STL) , among others, the right to
explore for oil and natural gas in deepwater pre-salt blocks,
former chairman of Sonangol Manuel Vicente said on Dec. 20.
Angola is “gradually” increasing its 1.6 million barrels-a-day
production, and the country’s oil output may reach 2 million
barrels a day in 2014, Martins said.  Sonangol is also seeking partners for its venture in  Iraq ,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
