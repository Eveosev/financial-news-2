Comico Oil, the Serbian unit of
U.S.-Dutch Comico Overseas, won approval from the city of
 Smederevo , some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Belgrade,
to lease land where it wants to build a $250 million refinery.  The municipal assembly agreed today to lease a 113-hectares
(280 acres) plot for 652 million dinars ($7.7 million) for 99
years, Brance Stojanovic, assembly president, said in a phone
interview from Smederevo today. Comico Oil will pay for the
lease upfront, pledging to employ at least 540 workers and to
meet environmental safety requirements, he said.  “We expect that the lease contract will be signed soon,
after which Comico can proceed with obtaining construction and
other necessary permits,” Stojanovic said. Comico Oil’s Serbian
representative, Radivoje Radivojevic, was not immediately
available for comment.  The new refinery, with planned output capacity of as much
as 100,000 barrels of crude a day, would end the monopoly of
 Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , Serbia’s top oil company,
controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft. (GAZP)  Naftna Industrija owns both
Serbian refineries, in Pancevo and in Novi Sad.  The agreement came after more than three years of
negotiations between Comico and Smederevo. The city lost a big
foreign investor earlier this year when  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  sold an
unprofitable steel mill there back to the government for $1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
