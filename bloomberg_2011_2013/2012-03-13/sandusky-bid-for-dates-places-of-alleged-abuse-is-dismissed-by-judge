A request by Jerry Sandusky, the
accused ex- Pennsylvania  State University coach, for government-
supplied details on the times and places of the alleged acts of
sexual abuse was dismissed by a judge as moot.  Sandusky, a former assistant football coach, is accused of
more than 50 counts stemming from the alleged abuse of boys over
a 15-year period. He had asked state court Judge John M. Cleland
to order prosecutors to provide exact times, dates and locations
of the alleged acts. Prosecutors said yesterday that details
weren’t available because of the alleged victims’ trauma.  “Any order directing the Commonwealth to supply details
would be a futile act since the Commonwealth has explained it
cannot supply the details requested,” Cleland said today in an
order.  Under state law, the failure by prosecutors to fix a date
with reasonable certainty when a defendant is accused of having
sexually assaulted a child would “violate the notions of
fundamental fairness embedded in our legal process,” the judge
wrote.  “A long line of Pennsylvania cases has refined and applied
this standard to various factual situations involving assaults
against children,” he wrote.  Joseph Amendola, a lawyer for Sandusky, said yesterday that
he will file papers asking Cleland to dismiss the case if state
prosecutors can’t be more specific with the allegations.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Sandusky, CP-
14-2422-2011, Court of Common Pleas of Centre County,
Pennsylvania (Bellefonte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
