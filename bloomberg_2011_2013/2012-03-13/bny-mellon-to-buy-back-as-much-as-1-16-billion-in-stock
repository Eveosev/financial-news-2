Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , the
world’s largest custody bank, said its board authorized the
repurchase of as much as $1.16 billion of common stock following
the  Federal Reserve ’s test of how the bank would fare in an
economic decline.  “We are pleased to be able to initiate this new stock
repurchase program,” Gerald L. Hassell, the bank’s chief
executive officer said in a statement. “Our fee-based business
model generates a significant level of excess capital.”  New York-based BNY Mellon also said it will continue its
dividend of 13 cents per share over the next 12 months. The Fed
didn’t object to the bank’s capital plan, BNY Mellon said in its
statement.  BNY Mellon’s shares have gained 17 percent this year.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
