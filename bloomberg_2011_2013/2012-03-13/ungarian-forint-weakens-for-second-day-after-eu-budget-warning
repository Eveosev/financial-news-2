The forint weakened for a second
day after the European Union said Hungary, its most-indebted
eastern member, is not doing enough to curb the  budget deficit .  The Hungarian currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 294.36
per euro by 1:52 p.m. in Budapest, adding to a 0.6 percent drop
yesterday and paring this year’s rally to 7 percent.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s fiscal austerity measures are
“not sufficient,” Amadeu Altafaj, an EU spokesperson, told
journalists today in Brussels. Moody’s Investors Service said
yesterday that delays in bailout talks with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the EU are “credit negative” for Hungary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
