Ethanol futures gained for a third
day in  Chicago  as corn rose, signaling higher production costs
for the biofuel.  Prices increased on speculation that Chinese demand for
corn is increasing.  Argentina , the world’s second-biggest
exporter of the grain behind the U.S., said it will delay
granting export permits because of tight supply after a drought.  “Some of that translates over into ethanol,” said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management Inc. in
Galena,  Illinois . “On the front end it’s a bitter pill to
swallow. They’re forced to stay with the pack” in paying higher
prices for corn.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery climbed 1.7 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.311 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Dec. 5. Prices have gained 4.9 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast advanced
4 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.435 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the biofuel added 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.345, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 1 cent to $2.285 a gallon and in
 New York  the additive increased 1 cent to $2.32.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 2.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $6.62 a bushel in Chicago.  Distillers are losing 8 cents per gallon of ethanol, based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel and assuming a bushel
of corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
