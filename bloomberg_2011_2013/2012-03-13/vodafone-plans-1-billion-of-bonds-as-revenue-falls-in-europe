Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the world’s
largest mobile-phone operator, issued $1 billion of bonds.  The five-year, 1.625 percent notes priced to yield 80 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Vodafone is raising money in the bond market after last
month reporting service revenue growth that missed analysts’
estimates as Europe’s debt crisis roiled the region’s economy.
The company’s quarterly service revenue declined 8.8 percent in
Spain, the country with the highest  unemployment rate  in the
European Union, and 4.9 percent in Italy.  Newbury, England-based Vodafone earns about 66 percent of
its revenue in Europe, Bloomberg data show. The company last
issued debt in August, selling $100 million of one-year, 1.15
percent notes. It has 1.25 billion euros of seven-year, 3.625
percent notes coming due in November.  Standard & Poor’s  rates the company A-, four levels above
junk. Moody’s Investors Service raised Vodafone’s grade to an
equivalent A3 in August from Baa1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
