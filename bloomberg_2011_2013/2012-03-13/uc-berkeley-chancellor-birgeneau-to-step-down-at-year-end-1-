University of California , Berkeley,
Chancellor Robert Birgeneau will step down Dec. 31, after
extending his time in the job to help address a budget squeeze
forced by the state’s economic crisis.  Birgeneau, a physicist, plans to remain at the university
to teach and conduct research, UC Berkeley said in a statement
today. Appointed chancellor in September 2004, he intended to
step down after seven years and is staying in the post for an
eighth year because of “extraordinary challenges,” according
to the statement.  The university has had to cope with drops in state support
and protests from students over tuition increases.  Budget cuts
and the economic crisis in California have created “the most
extreme disinvestment by the state in UC’s history,” Birgeneau
said in the statement.  The chancellor said he will work at the state and national
levels “to ameliorate the deplorable funding situation of our
nation’s great public teaching and research universities.”  University of  California  President Mark Yudof will form a
committee to lead a nationwide search for a new chancellor,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
