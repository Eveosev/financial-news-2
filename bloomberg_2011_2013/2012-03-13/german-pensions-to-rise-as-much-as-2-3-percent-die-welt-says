German pensions will rise as much
as 2.3 percent in July for some 20 million people who draw
benefits from the countryâ€™s pay-as-you-go retirement plan,  Die
Welt  newspaper reported, citing the federal Labor Ministry.  Pensions in western-region states will rise by 2.2 percent
and by 2.3 percent in eastern states, the newspaper said. The
increase in the western states is the second-largest since 1994
albeit slightly lower than the 2.3 percent increase in inflation
last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
