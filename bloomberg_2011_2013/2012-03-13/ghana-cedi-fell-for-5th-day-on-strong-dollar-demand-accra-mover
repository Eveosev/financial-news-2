Ghana ’s cedi weakened for the fifth
straight day to the lowest in more than seven weeks as
telecommunication and manufacturing companies bought dollars to
import equipment and raw material.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.7290 per dollar as of 2:37 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
close at this level would be the weakest since January 20.  The cedi is weaker on account of “stronger demand” from
companies, Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the Ghanaian unit
of Barclays Bank Plc, said by phone today. “Telecommunication
and manufacturing firms were lead buyers to meet equipment and
raw material requirements.”  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s unit in Ghana will invest $134 million
this year to expand infrastructure, Accra-based Joy FM reported
citing Chief Executive Officer Michael Ikpoki.  The central bank’s dollar offering to boost supply could
not meet demand on the market, Chris Nettey, a currency trader
at the Ghanaian Unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd. said by phone.
“General demand is picking up.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
