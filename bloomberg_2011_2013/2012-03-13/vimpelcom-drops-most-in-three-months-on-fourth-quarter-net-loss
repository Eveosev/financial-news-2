VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , Russia’s third-
biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, declined the most in
three months after posting a fourth-quarter net loss and
forecasting “mid-single digit” revenue growth through 2014.  American depositary receipts of VimpelCom fell 4.7 percent
to $11.26 at 11:41 a.m. in  New York , the steepest drop since
Dec. 12 on an intraday basis.  The net loss was $386 million compared with profit of $461
million a year earlier as the company booked a $527 million
impairment on operations in Vietnam and  Cambodia , Amsterdam-
based VimpelCom said today in a  statement .  “What caused the net loss are the Vietnam and Cambodia
operations,” Iouli Matevossov, a senior analyst at  Alfa Bank  in
Moscow, said by phone. “Perhaps the choice of the markets was
not good, maybe they shouldn’t have invested there.”  VimpelCom, the world’s sixth-largest wireless operator by
subscribers, added debt to buy Wind Telecom SpA last year. The
margin for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization in  Russia , the largest unit, narrowed to 39.4
percent from 46.4 percent as the company invested in networks to
draw new customers.  The company forecast “mid-single-digit” Ebitda growth
through 2014.  “In our view, this is a moderate forecast that isn’t
aggressive and isn’t weak at the same time,” Victor Klimovich,
a telecommunications analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. “We think this is an attainable target.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
