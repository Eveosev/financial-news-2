Tigar AD (TIGR) , the company that makes
 Hunter Wellington  boots, is showing how the corporate  bond
market  is making a comeback in Serbia as the euro-area debt
crisis is prompting banks to tighten credit.  The Pirot, Serbia-based company, which in 2008 acquired the
Century Division of Hunter Boot Ltd., specializing in safety
boots, sold 32 million dinars ($379,006) of 90-day notes that
pay 26.82 percent a year, on March 8, as it awaits the first
tranche of a 6.7 million-euro ($8.8 million) European Investment
Bank loan. It was the 10th time in 18 months that it tapped
domestic investors for a capital infusion.  “In crises, companies need to find sources of financing
other than banks,” Jelena Petkovic, Tigar’s executive director
for corporate management, said in a Feb. 28 interview in
Belgrade. Selling notes is “simple and fast and there’s no need
for collateral.”  Companies in the largest former Yugoslav republic including
Tigar, holding company Koncern Farmakom MB, drugmaker Galenika
AD and property developer Graditelj-Beograd AD, are returning to
the local  debt market  after banks have become more restrictive
in their lending as foreign owners shore up capital depleted by
losses on euro-area debt. Serbia’s corporate market in short-
term dinar notes peaked at $1 billion in 2001, fell to $70
million euros in 2004 and died out completely in 2005 as the
government sold banks to foreign investors, who then offered
loans at better terms.  Erste Group Bank AG of  Austria  bought Novosadska Banka AD
from the government in 2005. Other foreign lenders operating in
Serbia include  Italy ’s  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  and UniCredit SpA as
well as Austria’s  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ,  Societe
Generale (GLE)  SA of  France  and  National Bank of Greece  SA.  Renewed Borrowing  Tigar sold 1 million euros worth of dinar-denominated notes
in August 2009 and 1.5 million euros in October 2010. This year,
five companies have borrowed a combined 380 million dinars since
Feb. 29, according to the Belgrade-based Central Securities
Depository and Clearing House, pushing the total outstanding
short-term corporate debt to $61.5 million.  Tigar shares closed unchanged at 490 dinars in Belgrade
today, putting its market value at $9.89 million, or a third of
its book value, according to the Belgrade Stock Exchange.  Farmakom, which has outstanding debt of $8 million, is
active in mining, agriculture, retail and dairy business and
plans to open four mines in 2012, digging zinc, antimony, lead
and gold. The company in October signed a 120-million-euro loan
from a group of private lenders led by the International Finance
Corp., the  World Bank ’s private sector lending arm. Farmakom is
using corporate notes as stopgap financing as it waits for the
full disbursement of a 40 million-euro loan from the IFC.  Bridging Needs  Since Tigar and Farmakom, which owns businesses ranging
from mining and car-battery production to dairy and retail,
pioneered the return to short-term corporate debt, 39 companies
have sold notes to bridge financial needs.  Galenika , a drugmaker once owned by ICN Pharmaceuticals
Inc. that was nationalized in 1999, raised 200 million dinars in
corporate notes this month while waiting for Parliament to
approve sovereign-backed lending worth 70 million euros to
refinance old debt.  “Companies are turning to short-term borrowing because
they have been forced to do so,” said Slavko Caric, the chief
executive officer of the Serbian unit of Vienna-based  Erste
Group Bank AG. (EBS)  “Most of them have already exhausted bank
borrowing limits and this is the way for them to bridge short-
term liabilities.”  Bank Borrowing  Borrowing from domestic banks almost doubled since the end
of 2008, with lenders now sitting on 514 billion dinars of long-
term loans and 406 billion dinars in short-term credit to
corporate clients, according to central bank data for January.
Separately, Serbian companies owed 8.9 billion euros in long-
term and 66.2 million euros in short-term debt to foreign
creditors at the end of 2011.  Loan-loss provisions for long-term lending stood at a third
of all loans, or $2 billion, more than double the 2008 levels.  Selling bonds is expensive. Companies in  Serbia  pay annual
interest of as much as 27 percent on short-term dinar notes and
as much as 10 percent on euro-denominated debt, according to the
Central Securities Depository and Clearing House.  Bond Yields  Yields on Serbian government debt range from 10.48 percent
for six-month Treasury bills to 14.70 percent for five-year
bonds. Serbia’s benchmark 10-year, dollar-denominated Eurobond,
sold with a 7.25 percent coupon last September, currently trades
above par and yields 6.61 percent.  The total value of corporate bonds in  Poland , one of the
most rapidly growing markets in the region, rose 44 percent to
62.1 billion zloty ($19.9 billion) in 2011, according to  Fitch
Ratings .  Corporate notes with maturities of as long as one year
accounted for 36 percent of the debt, up from 34 percent in
2010. PKN Orlen SA, the Polish oil refiner rated BB+ at Fitch,
or two levels higher than Serbia’s sovereign debt, sold seven-
year zloty-denominated bonds last month, priced to yield 6.58
percent.  In  Turkey , Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, the No. 2 lender,
issued 1 billion liras ($600 million) of local bonds last month,
yielding 11 percent. Akbank TAS, the country’s biggest bank,
sold 650 million liras of 178-day and three-year lira debt on
Jan. 19 at an 11.6 percent yield. Both banks have a long-term
rating of Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  ‘Premium Market’  In Pirot, a town of 38,432 with an average monthly wage of
33,678 dinars, or $40 below the nation’s take-home average,
2,000 people depend on Tigar.  Of the 21 million euros of orders last year, it managed to
produce and sell 16 million euros of goods because it lacked
financing, while it needs needs cash to meet client demand for
30 million euros of orders.  “Our products are designed for a premium market and our
growth depends solely on capacity to finance raw material
purchases,” Petkovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
