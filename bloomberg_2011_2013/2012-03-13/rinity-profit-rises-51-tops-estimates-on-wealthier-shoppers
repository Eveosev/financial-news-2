Trinity Ltd. (891) , the high-end menswear
retailer that sells  Gieves & Hawkes (GIEVES)  and Cerruti 1881 in  China ,
is “actively” looking for European brands to buy after 2011
profit increased 51 percent. The stock surged.  Net income jumped to HK$513 million ($66 million) from
HK$341 million a year earlier, beating the average estimate of
HK$498.3 million from 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Sales climbed 30 percent to HK$2.61 billion in 2011.  Trinity, a unit of  Hong Kong ’s Li & Fung Group, benefited
from the rising demand for high-end menswear in China as the
urban disposable income in the world’s second-largest economy
rose 14 percent to about 21,810 yuan in 2011. With the net cash
of HK$410 million it had at the end of 2011, the company is
seeking to buy new brands to expand its product lines.  “We are highly selective,” Managing Director Sunny Wong
said in an interview today. “Hopefully we can do one or two
acquisitions every couple of years.” The Hong Kong-based
company is interested in high-end European menswear brands from
the U.K.,  France  and  Italy , he said.  The stock climbed 7.5 percent to HK$6.92, the most in more
than two months. The shares have climbed 24 percent for the
year, compared with a 16 percent gain for the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index .  Economic Slowdown  Trinity’s first-quarter growth will probably be “softer”
than a year earlier while there are signs of pickup in March,
Wong said. This year will be ‘challenging’’ because of rising
labor and rental costs, as well as slowing economic growth,
particularly in eastern and southern China that are more export
oriented, he said.  The slowdown will be short term and the Greater China
markets remain attractive in the long term, the company said in
a statement yesterday.  Trinity expects to keep its gross profit margin around 80
percent this year, Wong said. “There are still cost increases
we have to pass on to customers,” he said.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  set a 2012 economic growth target of 7.5
percent on March 5, lower than an 8 percent goal in place since
2005. He pledged to adjust taxes as the nation seeks to end the
economy’s reliance on investment and exports in favor of
boosting domestic consumption.  New Stores  Trinity operated 460 stores by the end of last year and
increased new outlets by 12 percent, it said in yesterday’s
statement. It plans to open 40 new shops in mainland China this
year, Wong said at a press conference yesterday.  The retailer that also sells Kent & Curwen and  D’URBAN
brands (SUUB)  said same-store sales, or revenue from outlets open more
than a year, grew 19.5 percent last year and it targets a“low
teen” growth rate this year, Wong said yesterday.  Among the  Li & Fung (494)  Group’s members is Li & Fung Ltd., the
biggest supplier of clothes and toys to retailers including  Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   To contact the reporters on this story:
