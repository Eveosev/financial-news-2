Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities advanced after U.S. retail sales jumped by
the most in five months and the Federal Reserve raised its
assessment of the world’s biggest economy, boosting the earnings
outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s
biggest carmaker by market value that gets 28 percent of its
sales in  North America , rose 1.9 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s largest lender, advanced 2.1 percent after the Fed said
15 of the 19 largest U.S. banks have enough capital to weather
another recession, boosting confidence in the global financial
system.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , an Australian mining company, gained
2.1 percent in Sydney after oil and metal prices rose.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  closed above
10,000 yesterday in Chicago for the first time since July.
Futures expiring in June closed at 10,015 in  Chicago  up from
9,840 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,020
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 1.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 1.2
percent in Wellington.  “The U.S. economy is generating jobs again and that’s
helping boost household income, and I think the Fed’s comments
recognize the improvement in the U.S. economy,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under management.
“To a large degree, Asia takes a short-term lead from the U.S.
We should see gains in Asian markets today.”  Retail Sales  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index advanced 1.8 percent and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average advanced 1.7 percent to the highest level
since 2007 in New York yesterday.  Stock rose as U.S.  retail sales  increased 1.1 percent in
February. The Federal Reserve lifted its assessment of the
economy as the labor market gathers strength. After the close of
trading, the Fed said 15 of the 19 largest U.S. banks could
maintain adequate capital levels even in a recession scenario.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 11.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 11 percent gain by the S&P
500 and a 10.2 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the  S&P 500 
and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. jumped for a fifth day,
led by Sohu.com Inc., on speculation the government will take
further steps to bolster China’s economy once the annual
Congress meeting ends. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the
most-traded Chinese equities in the U.S. gained 2.1 percent to
106.74 yesterday in New York, the highest level since Sept. 1.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
