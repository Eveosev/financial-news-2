The lira strengthened for the first
time in three days as the central bank reduced money available
to lenders after the currency lost ground yesterday, weakening
to a six-week low.  The lira appreciated 0.4 percent to 1.7878 per dollar as of
12:53 p.m. in Istanbul after it weakened 0.4 percent yesterday
to its lowest level since since Jan. 25.  “It is possible that the central bank wants to support the
lira,” Bugra Bilgi, a hedge fund manager at Garanti Asset
Management in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “The lira
versus the currency basket is very high and this is not very
pleasant.” The lira rose 0.5 percent against a basket of euro
and dollars to 2.0668, the most since Feb. 29.  Turkey ’s current-account deficit came in at a record $6
billion, or 10.3 percent of gross domestic product, according to
the Ankara-based central bank, lagging the $5.5-billion median
estimate of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank
offered to lend 4 billion liras ($2.2 billion) today in one-week
repo auctions, down from 6 billion liras last week, cutting
lending for the first time in three days.  Yields (BENCH)  on the two-year benchmark debt retreated three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.29 percent, according to
a  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  index of the securities showed.  Turkey’s deficit is the highest in the world among 60 major
economies tracked by the  International Monetary Fund . The lira
lost 18 percent in the biggest depreciation worldwide as a
widening current-account deficit and inflation at twice the
central bank’s target in 2011 hurt investor confidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
