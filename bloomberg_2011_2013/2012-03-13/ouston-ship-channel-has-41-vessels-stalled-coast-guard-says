Forty-one ships were waiting to
pass through the  Houston Ship Channel , which serves the largest
U.S. petroleum port, after fog halted traffic yesterday, the
Coast Guard said.  As of 6 a.m. local time, 20 vessels bound for Houston were
waiting to enter the channel and 21 were waiting to depart,
Lance Bradley, a Coast Guard watch supervisor, said today in a
telephone interview.  Houston ship pilots halted operations about 7:30 p.m.
yesterday, Bradley said. Transit was limited yesterday by dense
fog that set in about 11 a.m., he said.  The  National Weather Service  posted a dense fog advisory
for Galveston Bay and adjacent coastal waters until 11 a.m.
today, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
