Canadian natural gas fell as U.S.
heating demand was pared by warmer-than-normal weather.  Alberta  gas for April delivery declined 1.2 percent. Demand
for heat across the U.S. will average 61 percent below normal
through March 20, said forecaster Weather Derivatives. Chicago’s
low March 17 may be 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 Celsius), 13

natural gas analyst with Summit Energy Services in Louisville,
 Kentucky . Forecast demand for heat is “drastically below
normal,” he said.  Alberta gas for April delivery fell 2 cents to C$1.74 a
gigajoule ($1.67 per million British thermal units) as of 2:45
