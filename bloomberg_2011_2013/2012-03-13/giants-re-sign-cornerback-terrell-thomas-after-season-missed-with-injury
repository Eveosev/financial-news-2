Terrell Thomas  re-signed with the
 New York Giants  after missing the team’s Super Bowl-winning
season with a torn knee ligament.  The 27-year-old cornerback, who led the Giants in tackles
and interceptions in 2009 and 2010, agreed to stay in New York,
team spokesman DeAndre Phillips said today in an e-mail. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  Thomas missed the 2011 National Football League season
after tearing his right anterior cruciate ligament in a
preseason game against the Chicago Bears in August. The league’s
free-agency period begins at 4 p.m. New York time.  A second-round pick in the 2008 draft, Thomas became a
full-time starter in 2009, when he had a team-high 85 tackles
and five interceptions. He led the team in the same categories
in 2010, recording 101 tackles and five interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
