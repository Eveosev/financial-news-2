Finland ’s economy will shrink less
this year than previously forecast, Sampo Bank, a unit of  Danske
Bank A/S (DANSKE) , said.  Gross domestic product will contract 0.2 percent in 2012,
before growing 2 percent in 2013, Sampo Bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. It had forecast a 1 percent contraction for
this year on Dec. 13.  The outlook is “brighter” as exports and investments will
boost the northernmost euro member’s economy toward the end of
the year, Lauri Uotila, senior adviser at the Helsinki-based
bank, said in the report. Sales abroad account for about 40
percent of Finland’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
