The BP Plc-operated Baku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhan pipeline carried almost 5.23 million metric tons of Azeri
crude oil in the first two months of the year, a decline of 8.8
percent from a year earlier.  The pipeline known as BTC, which ships crude from
 Azerbaijan  across Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan, has handled 181 million tons of oil since opening in
2005,  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan  said on its website.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , also uses two smaller export pipelines, running
from Baku to the Black Sea ports of Supsa and Novorossiysk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
