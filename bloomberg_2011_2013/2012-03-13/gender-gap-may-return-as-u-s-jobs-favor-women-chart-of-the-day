Women are better positioned than
men for work in the  U.S. economy  even though a record-setting
gender gap in joblessness has been closed, according to Neil Dutta, an economist at Bank of America Corp.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the unemployment rates for men
and women at least 16 years old, according to data compiled by
the Labor Department. Last month, the jobless rate for female
workers was lower by 0.1 percentage point at 8.2 percent. In
January, the rates for both sexes were the same, 8.3 percent.  This year’s figures erased a gap that peaked at 2.6 points
in May 2009, when a greater proportion of men were out of work.
The differential was the largest since the government started
tracking the numbers in 1948.  “It’s a function of manufacturing coming back strong and
mining doing really well,” Dutta said yesterday in a telephone
interview. Men have benefited more from the industries’ growth
than women because they traditionally do most of the jobs, the
New York-based economist added.  Even so, women are more likely to stay in school and get
the college education needed for jobs in health care and other
expanding industries, according to Dutta. He highlighted this
trend in a report published on March 6, during International
Women’s Week.  “The problems for men are mounting,” he said. “They just
don’t have the skills for today’s labor force.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
