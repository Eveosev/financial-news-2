Linseed exports from Russia and
 Kazakhstan  are forecast to jump in the year through July after
production in Canada slumped following contamination with
genetically modified crops, researcher Oil World said.  Russian linseed exports are forecast to climb 84 percent to
280,000 metric tons from 152,000 tons in 2010-11 and 71,000 tons
in 2009-10, while Kazakhstan’s shipments will more than triple
to 200,000 tons from 60,000 tons in 2010-11 and 30,000 tons two
years ago, the Hamburg-based researcher said in a weekly report
released today.  Canadian exports of linseed, or flaxseed, to the European
Union, the biggest buyer, slumped after the bloc in 2009 found
shipments with unauthorized genetically modified seed. Canada’s
exports of the oilseed slumped to 359,000 tons last year from
705,000 tons in 2010, according to Oil World.  “Farmers in the Black Sea countries apparently made use of
the tightened world linseed production outlook and expanded the
linseed cultivation,” Oil World wrote. “The latter was also
accompanied by rising demand from the EU, partly due to the
growing risk of importing genetically modified linseed from
 Canada .”  Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine are forecast to jointly
export 510,000 tons of linseed in the year through July, more
than double the 237,000 tons a year earlier and compared with
about 1,000 tons a decade ago, according to Oil World.  Production in the three Black Sea countries is estimated at
618,000 tons in 2011-12, up from 322,000 tons a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
