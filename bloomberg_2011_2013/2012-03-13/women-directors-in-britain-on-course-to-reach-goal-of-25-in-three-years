The number of directorships held by
women at companies in the U.K.’s benchmark  FTSE 100 index  has
risen to 15.6 percent and is on course to reach the target of 25
percent by 2015 recommended in a report a year ago.  There are now 141 women holding 163 board seats out of a
total of 1,086 positions at FTSE 100 companies,  Cranfield
University School of Management  said in a report published
today. The percentage of women directors is up from about 12.5
percent last year, while the number of companies with no women
on their board has fallen to 11.  “I’m delighted by this unprecedented progress,” Home
Secretary Theresa May said in an e-mailed statement. “While
there’s still much to be done, today we should celebrate just
how far we have come.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron  warned last month that
companies may face quotas unless they promote more women to
board level, meeting the 25 percent voluntary target set in a
February 2011  report  by  Mervyn Davies .  A quarter of the new board appointments in the year to
January were women, today’s Cranfield study showed. If that
momentum continues, 26.7 percent of directors could be women by
2015, beating the Davies target, according to the report.  The FTSE 100 company with the biggest female presence on
its board is  Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s biggest distiller, with
four women out of nine directors, according to today’s study. In
second place is  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the U.K.’s largest luxury-
goods maker, with three out of eight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
