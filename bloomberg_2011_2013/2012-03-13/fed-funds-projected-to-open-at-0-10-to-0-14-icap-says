Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending  rate , is projected to open in a range of 0.10
percent to 0.14 percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.18 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.09 percent to 0.13 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.111 percent.  No temporary open market operations, which add or drain
 reserves  to the banking system, are expected, according to
Wrightson ICAP, a research unit of ICAP specializing in U.S.
government finance. The Fed has no Treasury purchases or sales
scheduled for today, which are permanent open-market operations.  In repos, the Fed buys  U.S. Treasury , mortgage-backed and
agency debt from its primary dealers for a set period,
temporarily raising the amount of money available in the banking
system. At maturity, the securities are returned to the dealers,
and the cash to the Fed. In reverse repos, temporary funds are
drained from the system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
