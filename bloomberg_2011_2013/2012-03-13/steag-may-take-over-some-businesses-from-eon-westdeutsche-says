Steag GmbH will try to take over
some businesses from  EON AG (EOAN) ,  Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Steag will try to secure a contract for delivering 160
megawatts of power to  Deutsche Bahn AG (DBHN)  in the event the current
power plants operated by EON lose their licenses by the end of
the year, the newspaper said.  Steag may also deliver district heating from its power
plant in Herne,  Germany , into EONâ€™s grid, after EON shuts down
its Shamrock plant in the city, the newspaper said, citing
people close to EON.  To contact the reporter on this story:
