European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another fell to the lowest in seven months, according to
a money-market indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 53 basis
points at 8:30 a.m. in  London  from 54 yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That’s the lowest since Aug. 5.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell to the lowest level in seven months. The three-
month cross-currency  basis swap  was 63 basis points below
Euribor from minus 63.5 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 53 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the ECB for the fifth day
yesterday to 795 billion euros, down from 798 billion euros on
March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
