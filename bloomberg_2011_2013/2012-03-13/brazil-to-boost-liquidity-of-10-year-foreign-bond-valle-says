Brazil â€™s priority in the foreign
debt market is to increase the liquidity of its 10-year real-
denominated bond, Deputy Treasury Secretary  Paulo Valle  said.  Demand for Brazilian international debt in reais and
dollars has increased substantially, Valle said in an interview
from Brasilia. The Treasury may sell bonds denominated in
dollars or real in its next overseas issue, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
