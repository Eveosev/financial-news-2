European Central Bank council
member Jens Weidmann said policy makers will react if inflation
pressures increase.  “We have a clear mandate and a clear hierarchy of our
goals, and the first is to maintain  price stability ,” Weidmann,
who heads  Germany ’s Bundesbank, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television in  Frankfurt  today. “We’re determined to
do so. You can be assured we will react if inflation pressures
arise.”  The ECB has cut its  benchmark interest rate  to a record low
of 1 percent and flooded the banking system with cheap cash to
fight the sovereign debt crisis and stimulate growth. At the
same time, rising oil prices are stoking inflation, prompting
ECB President  Mario Draghi  to say last week that short-term
risks to price stability have moved to the upside.  Weidmann said price expectations “are still solidly
anchored” and there are no signs at the moment that rising
energy costs are driving up other prices.  So-called second-round effects “would be a major risk we’d
have to watch for,” he told reporters after presenting the
Bundesbank’s annual report. “We don’t see it now.”  Weidmann also said  house prices  in Germany have risen about
5.5 percent in the past year. “This is something we need to
watch, not as policy makers but as an institution that is
responsible for financial stability,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
