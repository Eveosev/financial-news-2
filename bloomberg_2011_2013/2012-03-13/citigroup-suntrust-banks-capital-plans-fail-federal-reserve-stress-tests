Citigroup Inc. (C) , the lender that
took the most government aid during the financial crisis, will
seek approval for a “meaningful” payout to shareholders after
failing to meet minimum standards in U.S. stress tests.  “We still believe that our company has the capacity to
return more capital to shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer
 Vikram Pandit  said in an internal memorandum obtained by
Bloomberg News. “We will work with the Federal Reserve to
formulate a plan that returns meaningful capital while
satisfying our regulators.”  The Fed objected yesterday to Citigroup’s capital plan,
which may have included a request for a higher dividend.
 SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , Ally Financial Inc. and  MetLife Inc. (MET)  also
fell short in the Fed’s test of how 19 of the nation’s biggest
lenders would fare in a severe economic slump.  The results are a blow to Pandit, who has told investors
the New York-based bank is ready to return capital to
shareholders after slashing the dividend during the financial
crisis. Capital plans submitted for the tests typically involve
requests for higher dividends and share buybacks, which the Fed
allowed for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   “Investors are going to be disappointed,” said Michael Shemi, a director at Christofferson, Robb & Co., a New York-
based investment firm with about $1.5 billion under management,
referring to Citigroup. “Citi appears to have been too
aggressive with their capital plans.”  Shares Decline  Citigroup  fell  3.2 percent to $35.27 at 11:50 a.m. in  New
York , the biggest drop on the 24-company KBW Bank Index.
JPMorgan, which jumped 7 percent yesterday, was up 0.4 percent,
and Wells Fargo declined 1 percent.  Pandit scrapped Citigroup’s dividend in 2009 as part of the
company’s $45 billion bailout, which was later repaid. He
reinstated a 1-cent payout last year and has been selling
riskier assets to rebuild the bank’s strength. The Fed didn’t
object to keeping the current quarterly payout, Citigroup said.  The Fed’s decision “is disappointing, but we remain very
optimistic about the long term,” Pandit wrote in his memo.  The tests may also set back Ally, the Detroit-based auto
and home lender rescued by taxpayers, which had planned an
initial public offering to repay its bailout. Ally, run by CEO
 Michael Carpenter , and SunTrust, led by CEO William H. Rogers,
said they will submit revised plans.  Deep Recession  The Fed is testing to see how the capital of U.S. banks
might hold up through a deep recession and a second housing
crisis. The scrutiny focused on variables such as trading and
counterparty losses and write-offs on credit cards and first-
lien mortgages. Most of the 19 banks passed.  Disclosure of stress-test results in May 2009 boosted
confidence in the financial system by giving investors more
certainty on the maximum losses firms might sustain, and bank
stocks beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the next 12
months. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  jumped 4.6 percent yesterday after
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender, announced it had passed the
test and was raising its dividend 20 percent.  The average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for Citigroup to increase its payout to 28 cents this year
from 3 cents. They projected the bank would buy back about $2.18
billion in shares, or 2.2 percent of the total, after making no
repurchases last year.  Overstated Risks  Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for Citigroup, declined to
comment on what was in the capital plan. Ally said in an e-
mailed statement that the Fed’s analysis overstated some risks
and didn’t account for some of the auto and home lender’s
financial and management resources.  Citigroup’s projected Tier 1 common capital ratio fell to
4.9 percent, below the central bank’s minimum requirement of 5
percent, in a test estimating the effects of a severe economic
slump, according to data released by the Fed. Citigroup would
surpass the threshold if the bank didn’t pursue a dividend
increase or share buyback, according to the Fed’s data.  Citigroup still has more than $200 billion of unwanted
assets in the Citi Holdings unit, including more than $100
billion of mortgages, according to a filing.  “We continue to have the same goals that I mentioned
before, which is that this will be the year that we’ll start
returning capital,” Pandit told analysts on Jan. 17.  Federal Aid  Ally has benefited from $17.2 billion of federal aid, which
it needed after losses swelled on subprime home mortgages made
by its Residential Capital mortgage subsidiary. A statement e-
mailed by  Gina Proia , a spokeswoman for Ally, said the Fed’s
analysis “dramatically overstates potential contingent mortgage
risk, especially with respect to newer vintages of loans.”  The tests also didn’t give enough credit for “management’s
track record” and commitment to addressing the mortgage risks,
and doesn’t “adequately contemplate contingent capital that
already exists,” according to the statement.  The  U.S. Treasury  holds $5.9 billion of preferred shares
that must be converted into common equity no later than Dec. 30,
2016, according to the lender’s annual securities filing.  Ally has considered putting the ResCap unit into
bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter have said. Once
known as GMAC when it was part of General Motors Co., Ally
remains one of the biggest auto lenders and has profited from a
recovery in car sales. The U.S. gained a 74 percent stake in the
company in return for rescuing Ally in 2008.  Raising Capital  “They’ve done a lot less capital-raising than others,”
said  Kirk Ludtke , an analyst at Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT
Capital Group LLC. Ally’s capital plan may include additional
contributions to ResCap, he said.  SunTrust’s Tier 1 common capital ratio would fall to 4.8
percent if the Atlanta-based lender carried out capital plans
submitted to the Fed, according to the test results. Capital
plans can include dividend payouts, stock repurchases and share
sales. Ally’s ratio was estimated at 2.5 percent, regardless of
any capital actions it proposed, according to Fed data.  SunTrust, ranked eighth in the U.S. by deposits, said it
would have met  Federal Reserve  standards without the plan for
capital actions that the lender submitted to the regulator.
Distributing dividends and share buybacks tend to weaken
performance on the tests by draining capital.  Shares in SunTrust  rose  66 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $23.23
at 11:50 a.m. in New York trading after the company said first-
quarter earnings will probably beat the average estimate
compiled by First Call.  Housing Loans  The lender amassed losses amid a housing slump in the
nation’s Southeast. After posting profits of more than $1
billion annually before 2008, the company booked a $1.56 billion
loss in 2009 as write-offs surged.  About 27 percent of SunTrust’s residential construction
loans and 29 percent of its residential mortgages were
concentrated in  Florida , which suffered some of the worst
mortgage defaults during the financial crisis.  “I don’t think these stress tests are about who needs more
capital,” said  Michael Rose , an analyst with Raymond James &
Associates Inc. “Clearly it’s about who can return capital. So
maybe what they asked for might have been a little aggressive.”  Rose, who rates the shares “outperform,” said he’d been
expecting SunTrust to double its 5-cent quarterly dividend.
“It’s not like they failed by a wide margin,” he said, calling
the test’s scenario “onerous” and “probably unrealistic.”  MetLife’s Results  MetLife’s total risk-based capital ratio would be 6
percent, compared with the minimum acceptable level of 8
percent, the Fed said as part of its review of how companies
would withstand a “stress scenario.”  The insurer had requested approval for $2 billion in share
repurchases and an increase of its annual dividend to $1.10 a
share from 74 cents, according to a statement from the  New York- 
based company. MetLife, which is overseen by the Fed because of
its banking operations, was prevented by the regulator last year
from increasing its dividend.  CEO  Steven Kandarian  is winding down the banking business
and said he expects the firm to have as much as $7 billion of
excess capital by the end of this year. Kandarian said he
remains “fully committed” to returning funds to shareholders,
and that MetLife is on track to stop being a  bank holding
company  by the middle of this year.  “At the end of the day this is an insurance company,”
said Edward Shields, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners
LP. MetLife’s inclusion in the Fed test is “like putting a
square peg into a round hole.”  Shares in MetLife fell 4.5 percent in New York. The stock
gained 27 percent this year through yesterday.  Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , the Cincinnati-based lender, said the
Fed objected to increases in its 8-cent quarterly dividend and
some common share buybacks. The government didn’t object to its
redemption of as much as $1.4 billion in certain trust-preferred
securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
