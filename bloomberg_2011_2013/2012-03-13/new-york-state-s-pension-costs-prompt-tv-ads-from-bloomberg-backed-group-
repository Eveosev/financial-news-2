New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg ,
calling pension costs a “ticking time bomb,” said a coalition
of local officials will begin a statewide television ad campaign
urging lawmakers to cut retirement benefits for future workers.  “Too often in Albany, it is only the special interests
who are heard; we want to make sure that the people are heard,”
Bloomberg said today at a breakfast sponsored by the  Long Island
Association , an 85-year-old organization of business groups,
unions, nonprofits and government agencies representing Nassau
and Suffolk counties, which have each declared fiscal
emergencies.  Bloomberg, a 70-year-old independent, spoke in support of
a pension overhaul proposed by Democratic Governor  Andrew Cuomo ,
54, that has run into resistance in the Legislature. Yesterday,
the Democratic-led Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate
each approved budget proposals omitting it. Cuomo’s plan, which
would affect only future employees, would create a voluntary
“defined contribution” retirement benefit similar to a 401(k)
plan.  Bloomberg, who heads New York Leaders for Pension Reform, a
bipartisan group of 26 mayors and county executives seeking
pension-law changes, intends to pay almost all of the
“substantial” cost of the ads, said  Marc LaVorgna , a
spokesman. He declined to say how much money would be spent on
the spots, which will begin airing this week.  Labor Resistance  Vincent Alvarez, president of the  New York City Central
Labor Council , said traditional pension funds give workers more
security than individually managed retirement plans, providing
expert money managers and spreading out risk over large numbers
of workers during a long period of time.  “An individual account, where a person has to fund his own
retirement, that worker has to save at a much higher level,”
Alvarez said in an interview. His group represents 1.3 million
public and private-industry workers.  The Bloomberg-financed ad campaign follows a similar spate
of commercials produced by the  Committee to Save New York , a
business-backed group formed to support Cuomo’s initiatives. The
commercials warned of “massive” layoffs if pension changes
aren’t enacted.  In  New York City , pension costs have soared almost 600
percent to $8 billion this year from $1.2 billion in 2002,
Bloomberg said.  “You’ve seen that same level of growth in pension costs
here on  Long Island  -- only worse,” he said, citing statistics
showing pensions increasing 865 percent in Nassau County and 904
percent in Suffolk in the past 10 years.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
