(Corrects currency conversion to dollars in first
paragraph.)  Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal
SA ’s Brisal unit may seek about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
in compensation from the Portuguese state through an arbitration
tribunal,  Diario Economico reported , without saying how it got
the information.  The unit of  Portugal ’s biggest highway operator may seek
the payment because it registered lower traffic levels than
those projected in its Litoral Centro highway concession
contract with the state, the Portuguese newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
