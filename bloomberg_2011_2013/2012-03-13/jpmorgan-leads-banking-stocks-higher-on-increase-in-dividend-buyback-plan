JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  led bank
stocks to their best gain since November after the company, the
largest U.S. lender by assets, raised its dividend and said it
would buy back more shares.  JPMorgan advanced 6.9 percent to $43.34 as of 3:33 p.m. in
New York.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  added 6.7 percent, while  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , KeyCorp and Zions Bancorporation
each rose more than 5 percent. The 24-company  KBW Bank Index (BKX) 
surged as much as 4.7 percent for its best gain since November.  Investors were awaiting public release of Federal Reserve
stress tests later this week when New York-based JPMorgan
boosted its quarterly dividend 20 percent and authorized a $15
billion share repurchase plan -- enough to buy back about 9.7
percent of the stock outstanding at yesterday’s closing price.  JPMorgan said the Fed told the company it completed its
review and “did not object” to the bank’s capital plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
