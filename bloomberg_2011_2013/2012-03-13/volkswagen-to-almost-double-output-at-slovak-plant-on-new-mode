Volkswagen AG (VOW)  is keeping to its
target of almost doubling production at its Slovak factory to
more than 400,000 vehicles as new models will outweigh the euro-
area slowdown, the unit’s Chief Executive Albrecht Reimold said.  The factory in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, assembled
210,441 cars last year, compared with 144,510 in 2010, Reimold
told reporters today. Sport-utility vehicles such as Volkswagen
Touareg accounted for 93 percent of shipments.  Europe ’s largest carmaker is boosting output in Slovakia,
seeking to benefit from the country’s euro adoption combined
with lower labor costs than in western Europe. The planned
increase in volume is due mainly to new sub-compact models,
whose serial production started in Bratislava in the second half
of 2011.  “We will stick to our goal,” Reimold said today. “I am
absolutely sure that we achieve it.”  European car sales dropped an annual 6.1 percent in January
to 1 million vehicles, led by  Renault SA (RNO) ,  Fiat SpA (F)  and PSA
Peugeot Citroen, because consumers bought less as the euro-
region’s economy shrank, according to the European Automobile
Manufacturers’ Association. Volkswagen’s European sales declined
1 percent.  Volkswagen in Bratislava also makes Audi-brand Q7 SUVs and
bodies for Porsche Cayenne. Last year it started to produce
exclusively in Bratislava the so-called New Small Family line of
cars, made for Volkswagen, Seat and Skoda brands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
