Kansai Electric  Power Co. said
costs to run thermal plants and purchase electricity from other
companies will rise by about 400 billion yen ($4.85 billion)
next fiscal year without the restart of a nuclear reactor.  The Osaka-based company estimated the total costs to fill
the void left by nuclear reactors shut for safety checks would
total more than 1.7 trillion yen for the year ending March 2013,
up from 1.3 trillion yen this fiscal year, according to a
 presentation  on its website.  Only two of  Japan ’s 54 nuclear reactors remain online after
the March 11, 2011, quake and tsunami crippled Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station. The government
has said it won’t approve the restart of reactors, even if they
pass so-called stress tests, unless local authorities agree.  Kansai Electric’s crude oil consumption in the year ending
March is estimated to be nearly 5 million kiloliters (31.4
million barrels) while use of liquefied natural gas is expected
to reach about 7.3 million tons, which is the capacity of its
facilities.  The company’s maximum supply capacity this summer without
nuclear power is estimated at 23.98 million kilowatts, the
presentation said. That’s 13.9 percent less than the 27.84
million kilowatts of peak electricity demand last summer in the
Kansai region that includes the cities of Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe.  Based on that forecast, the utility expects 41 days of
power shortages between July and September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
