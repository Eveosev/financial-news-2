Volkswagen AG (VOW) , which faces
arbitration brought by  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  to end their
partnership, said the  London  court handling the proceedings
won’t make a decision before 2013.  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker said in its annual
report published yesterday that it “considers the claims to be
unfounded and has itself filed counterclaims.” Hideki Taguchi,
Tokyo-based spokesman for Suzuki, said he hasn’t seen the report
when contacted for comment.  Suzuki said Nov. 24 it started arbitration at an
international court in London aimed at ending its partnership
with VW and forcing  Europe ’s largest automaker to sell back its
19.9 percent stake in the Hamamatsu, Japan-based company. Each
company has accused the other of breaching their cooperation
agreement, which was meant to supply Suzuki with technology and
provide VW with greater access to the Indian car market.  The carmakers have been at odds since VW described the
Japanese automaker as an “associate” in its 2010 annual report.
Suzuki is prepared for the arbitration process to take as long
as two years to complete, Executive Vice President Yasuhito Harayama said last November.  Suzuki  shares  rose 1 percent to 1,981 yen in Tokyo trading
as of 10:31 a.m., while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
