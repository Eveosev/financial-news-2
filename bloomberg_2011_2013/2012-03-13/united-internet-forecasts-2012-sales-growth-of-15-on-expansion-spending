United Internet AG (UTDI)  may more than
double its dividend to as much as 44 cents a share from 2013
earnings as investment in rolling out new products will no
longer hold back profit, Chief Executive Officer Ralph Dommermuth said.  “If things work out as planned, our dividend should be
between 25 cents and 44 cents next year,” Dommermuth said in an
interview in  Frankfurt  today. “Of course we still need to look
at what our investments are and how much cash we have.”  The proposed dividend for 2011 will be maintained at 20
cents, the CEO said. The company generally aims to pay 25
percent to 40 percent of earnings per share, he said, adding
that EPS will probably be in a range of 1 euro to 1.10 euros
next year after 80 cents to 90 cents in 2012.  United Internet, a German provider of phone and Internet
services, will probably boost revenue by at least 15 percent
next year after targeting about 15 percent in 2012, the CEO said
in a press conference today. The loss from starting new business
areas such as do-it-yourself homepages and the expansion into
new countries will be lower in 2013 after marketing costs again
limit earnings growth this year, he said.  At 15 percent growth a year, revenue in 2013 would be 2.77
billion euros, according to Bloomberg calculations. That exceeds
an average analyst  estimate  of 2.37 billion euros in a Bloomberg
survey.  Expanded Offerings  Revenue rose 9.8 percent last year to 2.09 billion euros,
the Montabaur-based company said in a statement late yesterday.
The 2012 sales target, which would amount to about 2.4 billion
euros, compares with an average analyst estimate of 2.24 billion
euros in a Bloomberg survey.  The company is expanding its offering of applications such
as homepages, e-shops and to-do lists to more markets, including
 Italy . The company also offers access services such as mobile
and broadband connections.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 2 percent to 364.8 million euros as profit was
held back by smartphone subsidies to win customers, product
development expenses and spending to add business abroad, United
Internet said.  United Internet fell  0.4 percent to 13.99 euros as of
3:55 p.m. in Frankfurt trading.  Investments in new markets last year totaled 61.1 million
euros, and United Internet said it expects to spend an
additional 86 million euros to 124 million euros this year on
expansion.  The CEO, who owns about 42 percent of United Internet’s
shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, said the
company may buy back additional shares this year. A delisting is
not on the table, he said.  “From what I know, here and now, that’s not my goal and I
feel at ease having the company listed,” he said. “If we were
to delist, I wouldn’t have the variety of options” including
issuing new shares and buying them back at opportune moments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
