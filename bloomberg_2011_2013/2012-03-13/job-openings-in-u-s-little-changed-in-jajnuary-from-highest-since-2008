Job openings  in the U.S. were
little changed in January, capping the strongest two months in
more than three years, a signal businesses remain confident
about the economic expansion.  The number of positions waiting to be filled totaled 3.46
million, down from a revised 3.54 million in December that was
higher than previously estimated, the Labor Department said
today in a statement posted on its website. The back-to-back
reading was the highest since mid-2008.  Better job prospects may lure more people into the labor
market, helping restore some of the 5.3 million jobs yet to be
recovered after the recession. February marked the third
consecutive month with payroll growth above 200,000, Labor
Department data showed last week.  “Employment begets income, income begets spending and
spending begets more employment,”  Carl Riccadonna , a senior
U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in  New York ,
said before the report. “We’re at the point now where a
virtuous cycle has begun, and any additional employment gains
serve to strengthen that feedback loop.”  The number of people hired fell by 30,000 and the number of
workers fired decreased by 39,000, today’s job openings report
also showed. Separate figures today said the unemployment rate
declined in 45 states in January, while rising only in New York.  Job Vacancies  Job openings at professional and business services
decreased by 56,000 in January, while they increased 33,000 in
manufacturing industries.  Construction showed a 4,000 increase in openings. Retail
trade posted a 6,000 decrease, while transportation and
utilities had a 20,000 drop. Government vacancies were unchanged
in January.  Payrolls rose in February by 227,000 after a 284,000 gain
the prior month, Labor Department figures showed on March 9.  Employers took on 4.16 million workers in January,
according to today’s  job openings  report.  Total firings , which
exclude retirements and those who left their jobs voluntarily,
decreased to 1.65 million from 1.69 million a month before.  About 1.97 million people quit their jobs in January,
representing about 50 percent of all separations, down from 2
million in December.  Jobless Rate  Last week’s employment report showed the jobless rate held
at 8.3 percent in February, a three-year low, even as 476,000
more workers sought employment.  In the 12 months ended January, the economy created a net 2
million jobs, representing about 50.2 million hires, compared
with about 48.3 million separations.  Considering the 12.8 million Americans who were  unemployed 
in January, today’s figures indicate there were 3.7 people vying
for every opening, compared with about 1.8 when the recession
began in December 2007.  The other Labor Department report today showed payrolls
increased in 37 states as joblessness decreased in a majority of
states.  Joblessness decreased most in Mississippi and  Missouri ,
while workers in  Nevada  faced the highest rate in the country at
12.7 percent.  Texas added 67,200 jobs followed by New York 44,600 to lead
the country in  job creation .  Florida  led job reductions with
38,600.  California  and  Rhode Island  both had 10.9 unemployment
rates, tied for second after Nevada, the Labor Department said
today.  The jobless rate in  North Dakota  was 3.2 percent, the
lowest in the nation, down 0.1 percentage point from December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
