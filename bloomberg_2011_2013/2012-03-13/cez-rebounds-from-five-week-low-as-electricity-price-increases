CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility
in the  Czech Republic , rose from its lowest in more than five
weeks as the price of electricity increased.  The stock gained 0.6 percent to 802 koruna by 12:09 p.m. in
Prague. Next-year power in  Germany , where CEZ exports part of
its output, advanced 0.2 percent to 52.15 euros per megawatt-
hour, snapping a two-day decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
