Mitie Group Plc (MTO)  rose the most in
almost three years after saying it’s the preferred bidder for a
contract to deliver integrated facilities and energy management
for  Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)   Mitie gained as much as 8.5 percent to 291.1 pence, the
biggest increase since April 2009. The stock was up 6.1 percent
at 284.7 pence at 1:53 p.m., extending the gain this year to
17 percent.  The winning bidder will provide Lloyds with management
services “across the bank’s entire U.K. branch and office
estate,” Mitie said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
