OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, advanced for a fourth day in the longest rising streak
since January, as German investor confidence surged, indicating
abating concern over  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  The  shares  climbed 1.6 percent to 3,940 forint by the 11:24
a.m. in Budapest, lifting this week’s gain to 3 percent. The
benchmark BUX  stock index  advanced 0.9 percent to 19,063.79,
rising for a fourth day.  “The major European indexes are gaining, which is a sign
that market concerns over  Greece  and the European crisis in
general are easing and sentiment is on the rise,” Akos Horvath,
an analyst at Budapest-based brokerage Equilor Zrt., said on the
phone.  Emerging-market stocks rose, erasing yesterday’s drop,
after euro-area finance ministers signed off on a second Greek
bailout and companies from  Golden Eagle Retail Group Ltd. (3308)  to
Longfor Properties Co. reported profit gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
