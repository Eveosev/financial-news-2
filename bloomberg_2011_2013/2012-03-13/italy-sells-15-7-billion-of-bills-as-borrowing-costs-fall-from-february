Italy  auctioned 12 billion euros
($15.7 billion) of one-year treasury  bills  at the lowest rate
since August 2010 as  European Central Bank (EURR002W)  liquidity measures
helped boost demand.  The Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros of 364-day bills at a
rate of 1.405 percent, down from 2.23 percent at the previous
sale on Feb. 13. Demand for the securities was 1.38 times the
amount sold, compared with 1.09 times last month. The Rome-based
Treasury also sold 3.5 billion euros of three-month bills at a
rate of 0.492 percent.  Italian bonds fell yesterday for a second day after a
report showed the economy entered a recession after contracting
for a second quarter, complicating Prime Minister Mario Monti’s
goal of erasing the  budget deficit  in 2013. The yield on Italy’s
10-year bond yield was down five basis points at 4.86 percent at
12:42 p.m. in Rome, down from a euro-era high of 7.26 percent on
Nov. 25.  “These are probably closer to fair value levels than 7 or
8 percent,”  Laurent Fransolet , head of European fixed-income
strategy at  Barclays Capital , said on Bloomberg Television’s
“The Pulse” with Maryam Nemazee. Yields probably won’t move in
that direction again “except if we have a big, big new external
shock that is a little bit less likely to happen,” he said.  ECB Loans  Fitch Ratings  and Standard & Poor’s lowered Italy’s credit
rating in January, saying Monti’s 20 billion-euro austerity plan
approved may weigh on household spending and growth. Still,
Italian bond yields have fallen since the Frankfurt-based ECB
first offered the region’s banks unlimited three-year loans in
December, boosting demand for  government securities .  Italy, which needs to sell about 450 billion euros of debt
this year to cover redemptions and finance its deficit, hasn’t
abandoned its strategy of trying to lengthen the maturity of its
outstanding debt by selling bonds with maturities of more than
10 years, Deputy Finance Minister  Vittorio Grilli  said in a
March 9 interview with Bloomberg Television in Rome.  The Treasury has been concentrating its debt sales on bonds
with maturities of 10 years or less, though it “hasn’t
abandoned” auctioning longer-maturity bonds, Maria Cannata,
director of Italy’s public-debt agency, said at a March 6 press
conference in Rome. Cannata also said it was “amazing” to see
the return of foreign investors to Italy’s debt market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
