Spain ’s underlying inflation slowed
in February as the economy suffered its second recession in as
many years and the government tried to rein in the euro area’s
fourth-largest budget deficit.  Core consumer prices , which exclude energy and fresh food,
rose 1.2 percent from a year earlier, compared with an increase
of 1.3 percent in January, the National Statistics Institute in
Madrid said today. Headline inflation, based on European Union
calculations, was 1.9 percent, matching an initial estimate on
Feb. 29.  Spain’s People’s Party government is set to announce more
budget cuts on March 30 after a 15-billion euro ($19.8 billion)
package in December, even as it forecasts the economy will
shrink this year.  Retail sales  fell 6 percent in January from a
year ago, the statistics institute said on March 9.  Consumers may remain reluctant to buy non-essential durable
goods throughout 2012 and most of 2013,  Raj Badiani , an
economist at Global  Insight Inc. (2172)  in  London , wrote in a note on
March 9. He predicted  consumer spending  will drop by 2.2 percent
this year and 0.6 percent next.  The government forecast household spending will decline 1.4
percent in 2012, with export growth weakening, it said on March
2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
