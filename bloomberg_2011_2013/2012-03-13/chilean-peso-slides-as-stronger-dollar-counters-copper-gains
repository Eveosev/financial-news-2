Chile ’s peso fell for a second day
as the  U.S. dollar  strengthened against most of its major
counterparts, offsetting gains in the price of the nation’s
biggest export, copper.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 485.92 per dollar as of
10:25 a.m. in Santiago from 485.45 yesterday. The currency
earlier gained as much as 0.3 percent.  The euro slid against the dollar as retail sales in the
U.S. rose the most in five months. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin
American Currency Index  fell  0.4 percent. Copper, which accounts
for more than half of Chile’s exports, rose as much as 1.5
percent in  New York  after stockpiles monitored by the London
Metal Exchange fell to the lowest in two years.  “The euro has gone back and emerging-market currencies are
lower,” said Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency trading at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “The only thing
rising is copper.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
