Russia’s budget  deficit  was 3
percent of gross domestic product through the end of February
after revenue declined last month, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The two-month gap was 245.3 billion rubles ($8.3 billion),
the Moscow-based ministry said on its  website  today. A
previously reported shortfall for January was revised to a 27.2
billion ruble surplus, according to the statement.  Rising oil revenue helped Russia achieve a surplus of 0.8
percent of GDP last year. Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s
government boosted spending pledges in the run-up to the March 4
presidential election, which may cost $160 billion, or 8 percent
of projected economic output, over his six-year term,  Fitch
Ratings  said in a March 5 report.  “Lower non-oil and gas revenue partly reflects a usual
seasonal pattern, but could be also related to weak industrial
sector performance,’’ Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist for  Russia 
and  Kazakhstan  at ING Groep NV in Moscow, said in an e-mail to
clients today. Falling energy revenue “reflects the ‘scissors’
effect of higher ruble flexibility, which despite rising oil
prices negatively affects the ruble-denominated flow of
revenues.”  The ruble weakened against the dollar, reversing earlier
gains, to trade little changed at 29.6350 as of 5:15 p.m. in
Moscow.  Spending was 2.1 trillion rubles in the first two months of
2012, or 16.7 percent of the full-year plan, the ministry said.
Revenue was 1.9 trillion rubles, or 15.8 percent of the
projected total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
