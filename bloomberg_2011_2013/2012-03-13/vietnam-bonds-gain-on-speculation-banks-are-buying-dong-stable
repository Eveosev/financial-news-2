Vietnam ’s two-year government bonds
rose the most in a week on speculation banks have more cash to
invest in debt securities. The dong was stable.  Lenders’ cash ava.ilability has “significantly improved”
as the  State Bank  of Vietnam’s purchases of foreign currencies
since the start of 2012 injected dong into the financial system,
Governor Nguyen Van Binh told reporters yesterday.  “Banks have extra cash but couldn’t lend much” as the
central bank is limiting lenders’ credit growth at 17% this year
to slow inflation, according Nguyen Duc Hai, Ho Chi Minh City-
based portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. “They buy
more bonds then.”  The  yield  on the government’s two-year notes dropped seven
basis points, the most since March 7, to 11.47 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The yield on three-year bonds fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 11.46 percent.  The dong traded at 20,830 per dollar as of 3:40 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank set the daily  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, James Regan  To contact the reporter on this story:
