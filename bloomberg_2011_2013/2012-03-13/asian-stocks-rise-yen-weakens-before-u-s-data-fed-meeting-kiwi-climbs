U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to the highest level since 2007, and
Treasuries fell after the  Federal Reserve  raised its assessment
of the economy and JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased its dividend.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 1.8 percent to
1,395.95 at 4 p.m. New York time and the Dow climbed 217.97
points to 13,177.68. The Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index dropped to 13.99, the lowest intraday level
since 2007. Yields on 10-year Treasuries advanced a fifth day,
reaching 2.13 percent. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1 percent at 4:53
p.m. while Citigroup retreated 3 percent after the Fed said it
failed a stress test.  The U.S. central bank said the economic outlook has
improved as the labor market gathers strength. Policy makers
refrained from new action to lower borrowing costs. Gains in
equities were also spurred by U.S. Commerce Department data
showing retail sales jumped 1.1 percent in February. JPMorgan’s
shares rallied 7 percent after the bank boosted its dividend and
announced a $15 billion buyback.  “People are realizing that the world is not ending,” John Canally, who helps oversee about $330 billion as an economist
and investment strategist at LPL Financial Corp. in  Boston , said
in a telephone interview. “There’s a lot of good positive
momentum in the market. The retail sales data is helping.”  The dollar strengthened against the euro and yen. Copper
futures rallied 1.8 percent, crude oil rose 0.4 percent and gold
declined 1.6 percent in electronic trading.  VIX Declines  Today’s rally pushed the  S&P 500  above its March 1 peak,
completing its recovery from the subsequent three-day loss.
Before the Fed’s comments, the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, or VIX, fell to an almost  five-year  intraday
low of 13.99. It’s a gauge of how much investors are paying to
protect against losses in the S&P 500, which has rallied five
straight days. The VIX ended the day at 14.80, down 5.4 percent.  JPMorgan led financial shares higher. The biggest U.S. bank
raised its quarterly dividend to 30 cents from 25 cents and
authorized a share-repurchase plan as lenders respond to the
Fed’s tests of how they would fare in an economic decline. Bank
of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advanced more than
6.2 percent.  Citigroup declined after the New York Stock Exchange closed
at 4 p.m. The third-largest U.S. bank failed to meet the Fed’s
minimum requirements in a  stress test  when examiners considered
the effects of the firm’s plan for managing capital.  The Fed said at 4:30 p.m. New York time that 15 of the 19
largest U.S. banks could maintain adequate capital levels even
in a recession scenario in which they continue paying dividends
and buy back stock.  Apple, Transports  Apple Inc. rose 2.9 percent, rallying for a fifth straight
day, as Jefferies Group Inc. raised its share-price estimate to
$699. That helped send the Nasdaq Composite Index above 3,000
for the first time since 2000. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average, considered a proxy for economic growth, climbed 2.1
percent.  German bunds fell, pushing 10-year yields up by the most in
a month, after a report showed investor confidence in  Europe ’s
largest economy improved, sapping demand for the region’s safest
securities. The yield on the 10-year bund rose six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.82 percent.  Greek bonds issued to investors as part of the nation’s
debt swap declined on their first full day of trading. The yield
on the 2 percent bonds due in February 2023 rose 57 basis
points, to 19.02 percent.  Spanish securities slipped after European finance chiefs
meeting yesterday called on the nation to make deeper budget
cuts. The  yield  on the nation’s 10-year bond yield climbed eight
basis points to 5.13 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
