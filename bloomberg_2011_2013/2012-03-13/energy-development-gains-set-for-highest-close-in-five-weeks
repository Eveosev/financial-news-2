Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  advanced
for a sixth day in Manila trading, set for the longest winning
streak in five months, after CitisecOnline.com reiterated a buy
rating on the stock.  Shares of the geothermal energy producer climbed 2.5
percent to 5.73 pesos as of 11:05 a.m. local time, heading for
the highest close since Feb. 6.  “Energy Development’s valuation is still very
compelling,” said George Ching, analyst at Manila-based
Citisec. He forecast the stock will rise to 8.36 pesos in 12
months. Thirteen of 16 analysts recommend investors own the
shares, while three have sell ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
