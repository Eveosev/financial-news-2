Swedish  inflation  held below target
in February as the central bank cut rates to prevent the largest
Nordic economy from entering a recession.  The inflation rate was  an annual  1.9 percent, unchanged
from the previous month,  Statistics Sweden  said today. That beat
the 1.8 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey of 14
economists .  Prices (SWCPMOM)  rose 0.7 percent in the month.  Adjusted for
mortgage costs , inflation was annual 1.1 percent last month as
prices rose  a monthly  0.7 percent.  “The economic downturn has been considerably deeper than
we predicted after fourth-quarter  GDP (SWGDPWYY)  came in so incredibly
weak,” said Anna Raman, a senior analyst at Nykredit Bank A/S
in Copenhagen, said before the report. “The Riksbank will cut
rates one more time this year at its next meeting in April”
before raising it in the second quarter of 2013, she said.  Sweden ’s central bank lowered its  main rate  last month for
a second meeting to 1.5 percent and predicted it will keep it
unchanged over the next year to keep inflation close to its 2
percent target as exports, which account for about half its
output, are under pressure from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
