China ’s money-market rate advanced
the most in more than two weeks as the central bank boosted
sales of repurchase contracts to soak up funds as debt
redemptions increase.  The People’s Bank of China issued 66 billion yuan ($10.4
billion) of  28-day (PBOC28V)  repos today, up from 30 billion yuan a week
ago, according to a statement on its website. Some 254 billion
yuan of central bank bills and  repurchase agreements  will mature
this month, compared with 12 billion yuan in February, said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s
sixth-biggest lender.  “The increase in the repo amount shows the central bank is
stepping up efforts to drain liquidity,” said Shenzhen-based
Liu. “Since demand for repo contracts is enough to help mop up
redemptions this week, the central bank is unlikely to resume
three-month bill sales on Thursday.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 20 basis points to 3 percent as of
4:48 p.m. in Shanghai, the biggest jump since Feb. 23, according
to a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.15 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the 3.99 percent
government bond due June 2021 was steady at 3.48 percent,
according to the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
