France ’s competition regulator
fined French and German flour millers about 242 million euros
($317 million) for anticompetitive practices in the retail
market.  A 14-member Franco-German cartel was fined 95.5 million
euros for conspiring between 2002 and 2008 to limit flour
exports between the two countries. A German miller contacted the
Paris-based regulator about the cartel and the agency opened the
investigation in 2008. The informing company,  Wilh. Werhahn KG ,
avoided a 16.7 million-euro fine.  The  Autorite de la Concurrence  also fined seven French
flour companies, including three that were involved in the
Franco-German cartel, a total of 147 million euros for price
fixing. The millers were members of France Farine and Bach
Muehle, two cooperatives that handled the retail sales for their
members to supermarkets and discount markets in France, and
conspired to set the prices artificially high.  While such alliances are allowed to strengthen the market,
“the real goal of France Farine and Bach Muehle was to fix the
price of flour and divide clients between the different
millers,” the regulator said in a statement on the decision.  Bach Muehle’s listing wasn’t available in French telephone
directories and France Farine didn’t immediately respond to
messages requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
