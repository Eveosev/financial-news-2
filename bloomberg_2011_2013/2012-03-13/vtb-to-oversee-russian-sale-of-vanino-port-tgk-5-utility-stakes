VTB Capital, the investment banking
arm of Russia’s second-largest lender, will run the state’s sale
of stakes in the Vanino seaport and power generator OAO  TGK-5 (TGKEG) ,
which is controlled by billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg .  The government’s 55 percent in the terminal on the
country’s Pacific coast and 25 percent in TGK-5 are among state
assets marked for divestment by the end of next year, Moscow-
based VTB Capital said today in an e-mailed statement after
signing an agreement with the Federal Agency for State Property
Management.  The state’s previous attempt to sell the holding in Vanino
was blocked in May, when a little-known company bid up the
starting price 11 times and then failed to complete the payment,
the Kommersant newspaper reported last month.  Vekselberg said in October that his IES Holding would bid
for the state’s stake in TGK-5. Russia plans to offer it at a
starting price of 6.4 billion rubles ($218 million), according
to a Dec. 18 government order signed by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  To contact the reporter on this story:
