Syracuse University  center Fab Melo
won’t play in the men’s national college basketball tournament
because of eligibility issues, according to the school.  Melo, a 7-footer from Juiz de Forz,  Brazil , averaged 7.8
points and a team-leading 5.8 rebounds per contest for Syracuse,
which went 31-2 and 17-1 in the Big East Conference. With 88
blocked shots, the sophomore was named the league’s Defensive
Player of the Year.  Melo, who missed three games this season because of
academic issues, didn’t travel with the second-ranked Orange to
Pittsburgh for the team’s tournament-opening game against the
University of North Carolina Asheville, the Syracuse, New York,
school said on its website. No further information was released
because of university and student privacy laws.  Syracuse is one of four No. 1 regional seeds in the field
of 68 teams for the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament, joining  Kentucky , Michigan State and  North Carolina .
The Orange begin play on March 15.  Odds on Syracuse to win the national title moved to 20-1
from 12-1 at the Las Vegas Hotel and Casino following the
announcement of Melo’s ineligibility. A winning $10 bet on the
Orange to win their second national championship would net $200.
Syracuse last won the title in 2003, beating the University of
 Kansas  in the NCAA final.  The Orange suffered their only regular-season loss, 67-58
to  Notre Dame , during Melo’s January absence. He was in the
lineup when Syracuse fell 71-68 to Cincinnati during the Big
East tournament on March 9.  Syracuse has averaged 1.3 fewer rebounds than its opponents
this season, tied for 235th of the 338 schools in the NCAA’s top
division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
