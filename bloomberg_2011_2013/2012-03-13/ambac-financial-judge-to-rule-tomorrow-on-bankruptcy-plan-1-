Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) ’s
bankruptcy judge said she will rule tomorrow on the company’s
plan to reorganize its $1.7 billion in debt after hearing hours
of objections from shareholders in court today.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in Manhattan court
today heard evidence on the company’s Chapter 11 plan, which
calls for it to cancel all of its pre-bankruptcy shares and
restructure more than $1.25 billion in senior notes. The plan
relies on a proposed settlement with the  Internal Revenue
Service , which has yet to be consummated.  “I think there’s value to there being certainty and
closure in this case,” Chapman said, after hearing hours of
arguments yesterday from individual shareholders over why they
believed there should be money left for shareholders, and
testimony from a financial adviser that there was not.  Ambac Assurance was the second-largest bond insurer before
the 2008 financial crisis, when mounting defaults on mortgages
swamped the company with claims. It guaranteed about $256
billion of $1.4 trillion in insured municipal debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The holding company case is In re  Ambac Financial Group
Inc. (ABK) , 10-15973,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
