The dollar strengthened to an 11-
month high against the yen after the  Federal Reserve  raised its
outlook for U.S. growth, reducing expectations the central bank
will begin a third round of bond purchases.  The yen fell for a second day versus the dollar as the
extra yield received for holding Treasury two-year notes
compared with Japanese debt increased to the most since July.
Norway’s krone dropped to a one-month low as policy makers
unexpectedly lowered  interest rates . Britain’s pound rallied
against most of its major peers as gilt yields rose to the
highest in four months.  “In the light of things looking better in the U.S., the
market wants to hold dollars and short Treasuries,” said Shahab Jalinoos, a senior currency strategist for UBS AG in Stamford
Connecticut. “These kind of yield moves would have made the
market buy dollar-yen, but on top of that you have clearly
divergent central bank policy with aggressive easing in Japan.”
A short position is a bet that an asset will decline in value.  The dollar climbed 1 percent to 83.73 yen at 5 p.m. in New
York after reaching 83.83, the highest level since April 14. The
greenback appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3032 per euro after
climbing to $1.3011, the strongest since Feb. 16. The yen
dropped 0.5 percent to 109.12 per euro.  Dollar Measure  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, rose 0.4 percent to 80.520. The gauge, which
is 57.6 percent weighted to movements in the euro, touched
80.629, the strongest since Jan. 18.  The krone weakened 2.2 percent to 5.8240 per dollar,
touching 5.8320, the lowest since Feb. 6. It declined as much as
1.9 percent to 7.5976 versus the euro, lowest since Feb. 10.  The central bank reduced interest rates 0.25 percentage
point to 1.5 percent and said the stronger krone was damping
growth in Norway, thus inciting the cut. Norges Bank was
forecast leave its  benchmark rate  at 1.75 percent, according to
14 of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Norway ’s currency fell 1.5 percent today, the worst
performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rallied 0.9
percent and was the best performer.  Pound Strength  Sterling rose against most its major peers. The yield on
the two-year bond rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
points, to 0.51 percent, touching as high as 0.54 percent, the
most since November.  The  premium  in yield investors get for buying the U.K. two-
year security versus its U.S. equivalent rose to 12 basis
points, from 10 basis points on March 12.  “Euro-sterling is a similar theme to dollar-yen because
you had a fairly large move in U.K. yields as people may also be
pricing out easing more,” said David Grad, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Bank of America Corp. in  New York .  South Africa ’s rand tumbled as gold, which makes up 12
percent of the nation’s exports, fell to an eight-week low. Gold
has surged more than 85 percent since the Fed began monetary
stimulus in December 2008. The rand has rallied 24 percent in
that time.  The currency fell 2.3 percent to 7.7008 per dollar.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday it expects
“moderate economic growth” and predicted the U.S. unemployment
rate “will decline gradually.”  Yield Difference  The  extra yield  investors receive from holding two-year
Treasuries instead of Japanese debt widened to 28 basis points,
the most since July 28, increasing the attractiveness of dollar
assets. There is a “relatively high” correlation between the
two-year spread and the dollar-yen  exchange rate ,  Bank of Japan (8301) 
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa has said.  “At its core lies the strengthening U.S. economy, all of
which looks likely to continue,” said  Neil Mellor , a currency
strategist at  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  in  London . “It now
seems that risk-on sentiment means dollar strength.”  Yasushi Kinoshita, director-general of the International
Bureau at Japan’s Ministry of Finance said today at a conference
in  Tokyo  that the large amount of the nation’s debt held by
domestic financial institutions actually makes the Japanese
financial system more vulnerable to fiscal shocks than  Europe .
The nation’s debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio has risen to
230 percent.  Canada Rises  Canada ’s dollar strengthened to an eight-month high versus
the yen as Japanese investors look offshore for higher returns.
Canada’s currency advanced to as much as 84.68 yen, before
trading 0.5 percent stronger at 84.35. The so-called loonie was
0.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 99.26 U.S. cents.  Barclays Capital  raised its forecast for the dollar against
the yen to 90 yen in six months, up from 82, citing  Japan ’s
current-account decline and differences in monetary policy.  The euro may strengthen to 112.80 yen by May, its highest
level in more than seven months, based on the Elliott Wave
Theory, which says market swings follow a predictable five-stage
structure, according to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  Implied volatility of three-month options, the expected
price swings for the dollar-yen currency pair, climbed to 11.03
percent from 10.85 percent yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
