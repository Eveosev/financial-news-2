Con-way Inc. (CNW)  jumped the most in
seven weeks after a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst suggested that
the largest U.S. trucking company by sales should be broken up.  The trucker’s directors should “consider all options to
unlock shareholder value,” Stifel’s  David Ross  in Baltimore
told clients in a note today. The shares rose 5.6 percent to
$33.23 at the close in New York, the most since Jan. 19 and the
highest price since Aug. 3.  Con-way is trading based on the value of its so-called
 less-than-truckload business , which hauls freight from more than
one shipper in each trailer, Ross said. That’s the lowest
multiple among the three units at the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based
company.  “We don’t think the companies need to be together,” Ross
said in a telephone interview. “You don’t need to be a one-stop
shop.”  The truckload division and logistics unit could be sold to
shareholders or “financial or strategic buyers” to boost
returns, said Ross, who rates Con-way as buy.  Menlo Worldwide Logistics, Con-way’s logistics subsidiary,
“would have a lot of interest to a lot of people,” including
 United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ,  FedEx Corp. (FDX) , Ryder System Inc., UTI
Worldwide Inc. or  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , Ross said.  The unit could also be “interesting to a private-equity
firm in terms of buying a non-asset based business and then
growing off that Menlo platform and taking it public at some
point.”  Gary Frantz, a spokesman for Con-way, said he didn’t have
an immediate comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
