The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 0.7 percent to 992.9 at the end of trading in Prague, after
falling 1.2 percent yesterday.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , a unit of Societe Generale SA,
added 1.3 percent to 3,832 koruna, its highest close in five
weeks. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   rose 1.4 percent
to 452 koruna.  Financial stocks were among the biggest gainers in  Europe 
as American retail sales grew at the fastest pace in five months
and German investor confidence increased more than forecast.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, declined for a third day after Jastrzebska Spolka
Weglowa SA, its Polish rival, said it has no plans to merge with
NWR after carrying out an initial analysis of the Czech company.
The stock fell 1.8 percent to 143 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
