The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment dropped in the Asia-Pacific
region outside of  Japan , according to credit-default swap
traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 155.5 basis points
as of 9:21 a.m. in  Singapore , BNP Paribas SA prices show. The
gauge is poised to close at its lowest level since Sept. 2,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 1 basis point to
144 as of 12:22 p.m. in Sydney, BNP prices show. The measure is
set for its lowest close since March 9, according to CMA, which
is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose half a basis point to
141 basis points as of 10:06 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
