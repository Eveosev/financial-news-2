Snam SpA (SRG) ,  Italy ’s natural-gas
pipeline operator, cut its growth forecast for regulated assets.  The value of Snam’s Regulated Asset Base, or RAB, will
probably rise by an average 4 percent a year through 2015, it
said today in a statement. That’s down from an average annual
gain of 4.3 percent projected in its 2011-2014 plan last year.  The company, which operates Italy’s high-pressure gas
network and is paid in part through a regulated return on
investments, plans to spend 6.7 billion euros ($8.8 billion)
from 2012 to 2015, with 1.4 billion euros for this year. That
compares with the 6.4 billion euros forecast in the prior plan.  It expects to spend about 5 billion euros beyond 2015 for
“key projects today under feasibility,” according to a slide
presentation. “As these projects come on stream, we can
leverage a significant amount of investment delivering sustained
profitable growth in the long term,” Chief Executive Officer
Carlo Malacarne said today on a conference call with analysts.  Snam forecast annual expansion in consolidated earnings
before interest and taxes from 2012 through 2015 of at least 4
percent on a “high correlation” between Ebit growth and RAB,
Chief Financial Officer Antonio Paccioretti said on the call. He
confirmed the company’s forecast of 4 percent growth this year.  The pipe operator confirmed its preliminary 2011  results 
released Feb. 14, with net income falling 29 percent from a year
earlier to 790 million euros. The San Donato Milanese-based
company had been “heavily penalized” by a government decision
to increase a windfall-profit tax, it said at the time.  It has begun a process aimed at “gaining direct access”
to  capital markets  by the year-end to refinance debt after rules
were relaxed.  Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s biggest energy producer and Snam
shareholder, plans to sell its 5.9 billion-euro 50 percent stake
this year. The government, which ordered the sale in January,
must decree the spinoff by May 31, Ansa reported Feb. 24.  Snam rose 0.9 percent to 3.724 euros by 4:43 p.m. in Milan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
