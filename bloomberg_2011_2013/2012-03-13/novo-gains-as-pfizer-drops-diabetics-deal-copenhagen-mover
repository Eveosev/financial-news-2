Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) , the world’s
biggest insulin manufacturer, rose to a record-high in
Copenhagen trading after  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  pulled out of a deal to
sell diabetics products.  Novo rose as much as 1.1 percent to 812 kroner, an all-time
high. The stock advanced 4.5 kroner, or 0.6 percent, to 807.50
kroner at 11:08 a.m. in the Danish capital.  Pfizer, the world’s biggest drugmaker, yesterday returned
products rights to  Biocon Ltd. (BIOS)  Pfizer agreed in October 2010 to
pay $200 million to the Bangalore-based company for four types
of insulin, including a generic version of Novo’s NovoLog.
Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novo generates about  three-quarters  of
its annual revenue from sales from its diabetes care unit.  “We see this news as a clear positive for Novo,” Michael Novod, a Copenhagen-based analyst with Nordea Markets, said in a
note today, repeating a strong buy recommendation on Novo
shares. “We believe this highlights how difficult and
challenging it is -- and will be -- to bring competitive
biosimilar insulins to the U.S. and EU markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
