AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  sued the U.S.  Food
and Drug Administration , seeking to overturn the regulator’s
denial of a request that generic copies of its Seroquel
antipsychotic come with warnings about high blood sugar and
suicidal tendencies.  AstraZeneca is seeking an injunction barring the FDA from
approving copies of Seroquel until Dec. 2, when exclusivity
expires on clinical trial data that show a link between Seroquel
and hyperglycemia, or until a federal court has a “meaningful
opportunity to review imminent FDA action,” the London-based
company said in a statement today.  The FDA on March 7 denied two so-called Citizen Petitions
filed by the U.K. drugmaker on Sept. 9 that asked the regulator
to withhold final marketing approval for generic versions of
Seroquel, also known as quetiapine fumarate, that omit
mentioning the risks, AstraZeneca said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
