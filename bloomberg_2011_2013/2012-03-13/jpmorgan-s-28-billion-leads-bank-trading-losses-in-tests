JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which
produced the most trading revenue among Wall Street firms last
year, had the highest trading and counterparty losses of the
biggest U.S. banks under the  Federal Reserve ’s stress scenario.  JPMorgan had an estimated $27.7 billion in projected losses
from mark-to-market changes, credit valuation adjustments and
counterparty default losses, according to the Fed results
released yesterday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  had an estimated
$27.1 billion of such losses in the testing.  The Fed is requiring the nation’s largest lenders to show
they have credible plans for maintaining capital and continuing
lending in an economic downturn. The six largest U.S. banks had
a projected $116 billion in trading and counterparty losses,
larger than the 19 banks subjected to Fed’s stress tests had in
any lending area.  “The relative size of losses across firms depends not on
nominal portfolio size, but rather on the specific risk
characteristics of each BHC’s trading positions, inclusive of
hedges,” the Fed said in the report. BHC stands for  bank
holding company .  The Fed’s global financial market shock tested losses from
declines in positions held, counterparty defaults and charges
related to the deterioration of creditworthiness of trading
partners through the end of 2013.  Bank of America Corp . had a projected $21.1 billion of
trading and counterparty losses,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  had $20.9
billion,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  had $12.8 billion and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) 
had $6.9 billion.  Fed’s Assumptions  JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley
and Wells Fargo all maintained Tier 1 common ratios above the 5
percent required minimum under the Fed’s stress scenario.
Citigroup fell below the 5 percent threshold and said it will
resubmit its capital plan to regulators.  The losses were projected based on trading positions held
by the firms on a single day, generally Nov. 17, 2011, the Fed
said. Losses could have differed “perhaps significantly” from
choosing a different date.  The shock assumed increases in credit spreads on European
nations and financial institutions, with prices below any
observed levels, the Fed said. Losses tied to the widening of
those spreads largely related to counterparty risk, while direct
mark-to-market charges were “relatively small,” according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
