German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ’s draft legislation for the European Stability
Mechanism doesn’t specify the role of parliament in the fund’s
operations,  Die Welt  newspaper reported, citing the draft.  In a letter attached to the paper, Schaeuble states that
this function of parliament in the ESM remains open and that a
Feb. 28 constitutional court decision on participation will bear
on the role, the newspaper said. The draft also makes no
reference to the size of the fund, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
