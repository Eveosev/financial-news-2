Qatar’s call for military
intervention in Syria violates a five-point plan drawn up by
 Russia  and the Arab League, Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  said.  “I was amazed when I arrived in  New York  that while I was
in the air my colleague, with whom we agreed on these
principles, the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar,
Sheikh Hamad Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, called publicly for
dispatching Arab or international forces to Syria,” Lavrov said
in comments broadcast on state television today. “It absolutely
contradicts what we agreed on and announced publicly.”  Lavrov, who clashed with his U.S. counterpart Hillary Clinton at the United Nations yesterday over the international
response to the conflict in Syria, met Arab League foreign
ministers in Cairo on March 10 before flying to New York.  Russia and the  Arab League ’s five-point plan for Syria
stated the need for a complete cease-fire, monitoring
procedures, no foreign interference, humanitarian aid supplies
and “firm support” of international envoy Kofi Annan’s mission
to promote a dialogue between the government and opposition in
the Middle Eastern country, according to the Foreign Ministry in
Moscow.  The Qatari prime minister later called on the 22-member
Arab League to send international and Arab peacekeepers to
Syria, the official Qatari News Agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
