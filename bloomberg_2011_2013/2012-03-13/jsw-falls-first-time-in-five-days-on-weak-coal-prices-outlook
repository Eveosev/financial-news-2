Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW) , the
Polish company that’s the European Union’s largest coking coal
producer, dropped for the first time in five days as the outlook
for coal prices deteriorated.  The stock plunged 2.3 percent to 103.5 zloty, the most in a
weak at 12:05 p.m. in Warsaw.  JSW, as the company is known, sees the benchmark price of
the coal falling to a range of $210 to $215 a ton in the second
quarter from a $235 a ton for the first quarter, Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Grzegorz Czornik said at a conference in
Warsaw today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
