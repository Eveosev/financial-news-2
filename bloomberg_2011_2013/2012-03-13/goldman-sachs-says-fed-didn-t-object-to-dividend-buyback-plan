Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said the  Federal Reserve 
didn’t object to its plan to repurchase common stock and
potentially raise the dividend.  Goldman Sachs released a statement today after the Fed
published a report showing that the New York-based company would
maintain minimum capital ratios even in a severe economic
downturn. The Fed’s stress tests measured how the capital
position, revenue and profit of the 19 biggest banks would be
affected by a recession.   JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
earlier today that it was raising its dividend and planning to
buy back more shares, leading the 24-company KBW Bank Index to
its biggest gain since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
