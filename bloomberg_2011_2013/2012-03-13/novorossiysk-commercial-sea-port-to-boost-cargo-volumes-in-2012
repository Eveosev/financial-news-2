OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea
Port (NCSP) , Russia’s largest port operator by volume, expects cargo
turnover to rise about 8 percent this year, while revenue may
reach $1.3 billion.  The group’s cargo volumes will probably climb to 170
million metric tons from 157 million tons last year, Deputy
Chief Executive Officer for finance Andrey Bubnov told reporters
today in Moscow.  Revenue is forecast to reach $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion,
Bubnov said, without giving a comparison for 2011. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the
year will probably be $620 million to $640 million, he said.  Novorossiysk, which operates the port of the same name on
the  Black Sea  and the Primorsk port on the  Baltic Sea , plans
$200 million in investments this year, part of a more than $1.1
billion spending plan to 2020, Bubnov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
