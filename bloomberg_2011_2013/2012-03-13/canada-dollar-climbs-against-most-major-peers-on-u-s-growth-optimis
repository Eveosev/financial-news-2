Canada’s dollar strengthened to
almost parity with its U.S. counterpart as stocks advanced
before the  Federal Reserve  concludes its meeting today with a
policy statement.  The currency rose to the highest since May yesterday,
capping its second monthly advance on speculation the Fed and
the  European Central Bank  will extend measures to stimulate
economic growth amid evidence the global recovery is stalling.
The so-called loonie rose to the highest since March against the
U.K. pound.  “We’re just sitting here waiting for the outcome of two
pretty important meetings over the next 24 hours,”  Shaun Osborne , chief foreign-exchange strategist at  Toronto-Dominion
Bank (TD) ’s TD Securities unit, said by phone from Toronto. “The Fed
later on today and the ECB tomorrow. They’re the two elephants
in the trading room.”  Canada’s currency strengthened as much as 0.3 percent to
C$1.0004 per  U.S. dollar , approaching the C$1.0003 it reached
yesterday, the strongest level since May 15. It traded at
C$1.0018 at 1:07 p.m. in Toronto, up 0.2 percent. One Canadian
dollar buys 99.87 cents. It climbed for a fourth day to C$1.5627
against the pound.  Bonds Fall  Government  bonds  fell for the first time in three days,
sending the benchmark 10-year yield up five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.73 percent. The price of the 2.75
percent securities due in June 2022 dropped 47 cents to
C$109.25.  Concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is widening, hampering
economic growth in China and the U.S., the world’s two largest
economies, has led a flight to the safest of assets. Government
bond yields reached 1.34 percent on June 1, the lowest since at
least 1989, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Canadian Governments Index, which tracks 36 bonds with an
average maturity of 8.74 years and about C$361 billion
outstanding. Yields ended yesterday at 1.49 percent.  Canada sold C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) of two-year bonds
today in Ottawa. The 1 percent bonds maturing in November 2014
fetched an average yield of 1.147 percent.  The coverage ratio, the amount bid relative to the amount
on offer, was 2.55 times. That compares with an average yield of
1.114 percent and a coverage ratio of 2.41 times at the previous
two-year auction on June 20.  European Influence  The Canadian dollar and the euro pared gains after
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said the ECB shouldn’t exceed
its mandate. Tomorrow’s  interest-rate  decision is the first
since President  Mario Draghi  pledged to do whatever it takes to
defend the single currency.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
asset purchases from 2008 to 2011 in a bid to spur growth, and
it has said its benchmark interest rate will stay at
“exceptionally low levels” at least through late 2014.  While the Fed refrained from introducing a third round of
asset purchases known as quantitative easing at its June
meeting, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated it’s an option.  Rather than increase asset purchases this week, the Fed is
more likely to extend its pledge to hold its main interest rate
near zero beyond the current horizon of late 2014. Twenty-six
percent of economists expect the central bank to announce a
later date, while 88 percent said the bank will refrain from
starting new purchases at today’s meeting.  “The risk is that expectations have got a bit inflated,”
 Adam Cole , global head of foreign-exchange strategy at Royal
Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, said by phone from
London. “Selling rallies in risk is the right way to be
positioned.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent. Crude oil
futures rose 1.5 percent to $89.25 a barrel in  New York . Crude
is Canada’s largest export.  “Stocks are still by far the best indicator for dollar-
Canada,” said RBC’s Cole. “The Canadian dollar is almost 90
percent correlated to changes in the  S&P 500 .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
