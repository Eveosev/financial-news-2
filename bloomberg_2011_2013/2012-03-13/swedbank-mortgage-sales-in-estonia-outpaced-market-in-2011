Swedbank AB (SWEDA) ’s sales of  mortgage
loans  in  Estonia  exceeded overall market growth last year and
the trend will probably continue this year, the biggest Baltic
lender said.  Estonian mortgage sales increased 25 percent in 2011,
compared with market growth of 15 percent, Swedbank AS, the
local unit of the Stockholm-based bank, said in an e-mailed
statement today. Growth was mainly underpinned by faster-than-
expected improvement of the  labor market  and positive
developments in the economy as a whole, it added.  A third of Swedbank’s Estonian clients who had difficulties
with mortgage payments in past years have solved their problems,
according to the bank. The stock of outstanding loans to
households has declined by eight percent in the last three years
and the deposits have increased 20 percent. Housing prices and
transaction volumes probably won’t change significantly this
year, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
