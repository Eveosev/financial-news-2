The  Federal Reserve , exercising
sweeping new authority to ensure financial stability, will show
how the capital of the 19 largest U.S. banks might fare through
a deep recession and a second housing crisis and use the results
to dictate which of them can increase their dividends.  The U.S. central bank has conducted increasingly detailed
tests of bank capital planning with the goal of assuring banks
can survive an economic storm without the taxpayer-funded
bailouts that sparked a political backlash following the 2008
financial crisis.  The Fed will release the results of the so-called stress
tests at 4:30 p.m. on March 15, it said in a statement yesterday
in Washington. The tests will show results for revenues,  capital
ratios  and profits or losses at each firm over a nine-quarter
period.  “The industry has a record amount of capital and much
cleaner balance sheets than two years ago,” said  Jason Goldberg , senior analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in  New York .
The results “are going to show the banking industry is on solid
ground.”  In past stress tests, the 19 bank holding companies have
boosted their tier one common capital levels to $759 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2011 from $420 billion in the first
quarter of 2009, the Fed said yesterday.  Bank shares have  soared  this year as investors bet a
strengthening economy will help firms boost earnings, with the
 KBW Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 U.S. lenders advancing 15 percent. Concern
that the nation’s banks may be damaged by  Europe ’s debt crisis
helped drive down the index 25 percent in 2011, its worst annual
performance since 2008.  More Common Equity  The Fed yesterday said the increase in capital partly
reflects the central bank’s “move to ensure the firms reduced
or eliminated dividends to maintain safety and soundness.” The
banks paid out 15 percent of net income in common dividends in
2011, compared with 38 percent in 2006, the Fed said. They also
raised more in common equity than they repurchased in 2011.  For the current test, the Fed provided the banks with 25
variables, including estimates on gross domestic product,
Treasury bill rates and indexes of consumer prices and  home
prices . The recession scenario assumes an 8 percent drop in U.S.
gross domestic product, an  unemployment  rate as high as 13
percent and a 21 percent plunge in home prices.  “Strong capital levels are critical to ensuring that
banking organizations have the ability to lend and to continue
to meet their financial obligations, even in times of economic
difficulty,” the Fed said in its statement. It said the stress
test scenario isn’t a forecast for the economy.  ‘Global Market Shock’  Six banking-holding companies with large trading, private
equity and derivatives activities were also subjected to tests
of these positions from a “global market shock,” the Fed said.
The six are  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , Wells Fargo &
Co., Morgan Stanley,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and JPMorgan Chase
& Co.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke began to formulate the stress
tests in late 2008 when he asked supervisors to determine the
extent of losses facing the nation’s largest lenders following
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Disclosure of stress-test results in May 2009 boosted
confidence in the financial system by giving investors more
certainty on the maximum losses banks might sustain. Stock
indexes started to recover in March 2009, and the 18-month
recession end in June.  Annual Requirement  Stress tests are now an annual requirement for the largest
banks under the Dodd-Frank Act overhauling financial regulation.
The Fed has in recent years focused more on forward capital
planning with an eye toward how much banks intended to pay out
to shareholders. To make up for capital shortfalls, taxpayers
provided $245 billion in bailouts through the Troubled Asset
Relief Program during the financial crisis.  Bankers have bristled at regulators’ grip on decisions once
made by boards with lighter oversight.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Jamie Dimon  was asked by an analyst in July if he would seek Fed
approval to pay out additional capital.  “I think it is important to point out that the board is
responsible for this company, not just the regulators,” Dimon
responded, according to a transcript of the July 14 conference
call. “It is still America. Capitalism is still alive.”  To conduct the latest analysis, the Fed drew on some of its
275 Ph.D. economists at the Fed Board, who hold expertise in
macroeconomic forecasting, international economies and computer
modeling of economic scenarios.  “The assumptions were pretty extreme,” said Gilbert Schwartz, a former Fed attorney and a partner at Schwartz &
Ballen, a  Washington  law firm. He questioned why such a dire
scenario was necessary “when we are being told this isn’t going
to happen again because of all the institutional safeguards.”  Other banks participating in the tests include Ally
Financial Inc., American Express Co., Bank of New York Mellon
Corp., BB&T Corp., Capital One Financial Corp., Fifth Third
Bancorp, Keycorp, MetLife Inc., PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc., Regions Financial Corp., State Street Corp., SunTrust
Banks Inc., and U.S. Bancorp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
