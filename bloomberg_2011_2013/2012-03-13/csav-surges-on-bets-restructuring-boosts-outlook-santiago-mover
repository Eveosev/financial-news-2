Cia. Sud Americana de Vapores SA 
rose the most in two weeks in Santiago on speculation that the
restructuring of its operations will help the shipping company
return to profitability amid signs of global economic recovery.  CSAV climbed 6.6 percent to 45.38 pesos at the close in
Santiago, the steepest gain since March 1 when it spun off
logistics unit Soc. Matriz SAAM SA.  The stock has surged 31 percent since the SAAM spinoff,
which followed a $1.2 billion capital increase that saw  Chile ’s
Luksic family secure a controlling 37 percent stake. CSAV had a
record $1.25 billion loss last year when slowing demand, rising
fuel prices and a glut of vessels pulled down rates, triggering
efforts to cut unprofitable routes and reduce costs. Oscar Hasbun was named yesterday as the company’s new chief executive.  “Hasbun has led the restructuring of the company since he
joined in March 2011 and he’s the one who proposed cutting less
profitable routes,” said Jorge Sepulveda, an analyst at
Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA. “He has the full support of
the Luksics. It’s a positive sign.”  Hasbun will take over as CEO from Arturo Ricke, the company
said yesterday in a regulatory filing.  Global stocks rallied today after the U.S. Federal Reserve
raised its assessment of the economy. The weekly Shanghai
Containerized Freight Index has gained for three straight weeks
and posted a record 19 percent increase on March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
