India ’s Karnataka state will
announce the results of its first auction to award contracts to
build solar  power plants  by next week, a government official
said.  The Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd., the state-
run agency overseeing the auction, is awaiting clarifications
from three of the bidders before it announces the winner,
Managing Director N.S. Prasanna Kumar said in an interview in
Chennai. They have until this weekend to respond, he said.  Companies including Tata Power, Welspun Group, Kiran Energy
Solar Power Pvt. and Jindal Aluminium Ltd. bid for 50 megawatts
of photovoltaic capacity, according to KREDL. Bidders for 30
megawatts of solar-thermal projects were Sunborne Energy LLC,
backed by billionaire  Vinod Khosla , and Atria Power Corp.  The bids were submitted in December. KREDL delayed opening
them due to a legal snag after the agency broke a rule requiring
government bodies to award contracts through an online
procurement system.  Solar-thermal projects use sunlight to heat liquids that
produce steam for generators; photovoltaic plants use panels to
turn sunlight directly into power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
