A liquefied natural gas tanker
owned by  Teekay (TGP)  LNG Partners LP that typically shuttles between
Qatar and  Europe  is sailing for the first time in almost two
years to  South Korea , where the cargo costs 80 percent more.  The Al Shamal left Ras Laffan, on the north-eastern coast
of Qatar, on March 8 and is sailing for Incheon, South Korea,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. In the
past year the vessel delivered Qatari LNG four times to the U.K.
and three times to Belgium. It last went to South Korea in March
2010, the data show.  One million British thermal units of Qatari LNG costs $17
in South Korea, compared with $9.45 in the U.K., according to
February data from New York-based shipbroker Poten & Partners.
Accounting for costs to transport the fuel and convert it back
into gas, the return from shipping Qatari LNG to South Korea is
118 percent higher, the figures show.  Priscilla Sharun, a spokeswoman for Vancouver-based  Teekay
Corp. (TK) , declined to comment. Qatar is the worldâ€™s biggest
exporter of LNG, which is natural gas that has been chilled to a
liquid state for transportation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
