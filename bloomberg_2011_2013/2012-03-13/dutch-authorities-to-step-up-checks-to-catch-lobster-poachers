Dutch officials will increase
checks this month in an effort to catch lobster poachers in the
Scheldt River estuary in the country’s southwest.  The Netherlands’ Food and Consumer Product Safety
Authority will step up surveillance of the Eastern Scheldt
estuary and the saltwater lakes Grevelingen and Veerse Meer, it
said in a  statement  on its website today. The Economy Ministry
and national police also will help, the authority said.  Lobster catching is banned from mid-July until March 31 to
maintain population levels, and any of the crustaceans caught in
that period must be freed right away, according to the food
authority. A check on the Eastern Scheldt last year found 157
illegally caught lobsters, some of which carried eggs, and the
poachers were booked, it said.  “For egg-carrying lobsters, the rule is that throughout
the year they must be released immediately,” the authority
said. “This is due to lobsters’ lengthy reproductive cycle.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
