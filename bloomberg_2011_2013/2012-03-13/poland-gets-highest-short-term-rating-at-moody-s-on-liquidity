Poland was assigned the highest
short-term rating at Moody’s Investors Service because of the
country’s improved liquidity and rising cash reserve.  The rating company assessed the government of the European
Union’s largest eastern economy Prime-1, it said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. Poland has an A2 long-term debt
rating, the sixth-highest investment grade, with a stable
outlook at Moody’s, according to the report.  “The stock of short-term outstanding debt has declined
markedly to under 1 percent of gross domestic product by the end
of 2011 from around 4 percent in 2008,” Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
