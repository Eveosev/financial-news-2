OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY) , the Russian phone
company that set up video surveillance systems for the nation’s
presidential election, will use the infrastructure as a way of
boosting revenue growth, President Alexander Provotorov said.  The systems installed at polling booths, many of them in
schools, will be used to provide similar services for regional
and municipal elections and may be used as school security
systems, the Moscow-based company said in a statement today.
They could also be utilized to facilitate distance learning,
Rostelecom said.  The 13-billion ruble ($440 million) contract to install the
surveillance systems in more than 90,000 polling stations was
the “largest yet in our industry,” Provotorov said, according
to the statement. “The platform we developed to distribute
video signals across  Russia  will provide Rostelecom with further
revenue growth opportunities over the coming years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
