Waertsilae Oyj (WRT1V) , the world’s largest
maker of ship motors, advanced the most in more than three
months after the company’s expansion in natural-gas gear yielded
a power-plant order in  Alaska .  Meeting  Alaska (STOAK1) ’s air-quality standards helped Waertsilae
win the Matanuska Electric Association contract, the Helsinki-
based company said in a statement. Waertsilae gained 5.3
percent, the most since Nov. 28.  “Environmental issues are something Waertsilae has heavily
invested in and I believe this will come to play a bigger part
in who gets future orders,” said Pekka Spolander, a  Pohjola
Bank (POH1S)  Oyj analyst. “Perhaps this order also dispelled some
doubts about the activity of the power plant side.”  Gas is “undoubtedly” gaining market share in  power plants 
and becoming the first option “wherever possible,” Spolander
said. This may benefit Waertsilae, as it has been successful
with its technology in the field, he said. The Matanuska order
is valued at $106 million and set to be delivered in 2013. The
supplied power plant will be able to switch between natural gas
and light fuel oil, the company said.  Shares of Waertsilae advanced 1.37 euros, or 5.3 percent,
to 27.07 euros at the close, making it today’s top gainer in the
 OMX Helsinki 25 Index. (HEX25)  The stock has increased 21 percent this
year, valuing the company at 5.34 billion euros ($7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
