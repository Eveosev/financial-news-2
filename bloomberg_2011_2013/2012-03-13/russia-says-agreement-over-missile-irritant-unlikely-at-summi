Russia ’s talks over the planned
U.S. and NATO missile shield in Europe aren’t past the “point
of no return” even as the issue remains an “irritant” between
the countries, Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov said.  Russia and the U.S. are unlikely to sign an agreement on
the missile-defense system in May during the summits of the
Group of Eight and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the
U.S., Antonov reporters in Moscow today. The shield’s
capabilities allow it to intercept Russia’s ballistic missiles,
hurting its strategic deterrent, he said.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who won a six-year term in
the Kremlin in the March 4 presidential election, last month
accused the U.S. of “shying away” from negotiations over its
missile plan and warned that his country will have to develop an
asymmetric response to counter the U.S. system in  Europe  to
maintain the balance of power.  The shield system is intended to counter threats from  Iran 
and doesn’t target Russia, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said in December, reiterating that the plan will go ahead even
though Moscow objects.  The U.S will probably proceed with the program even if
Iran’s nuclear targets are attacked, Antonov said. Russia is
still complying with United Nations-imposed international
sanctions against Iran that precluded a delivery Russian S-300
air defense systems, Antonov said, adding that Iran doesn’t
present a threat to Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
