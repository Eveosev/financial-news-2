Griffin’s Foods Ltd. ,  New Zealand ’s
biggest maker of biscuits, is expected to respond to banks as
early as this week as it seeks to refinance a loan due June,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  The company, which is owned by private equity firm Pacific
Equity Partners Pty, signed a NZ$270 million facility in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some NZ$250 million of
that facility is due in June, the data show.  Banks including  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
Westpac Banking Corp., Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.,  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia , Bank of New Zealand, Rabobank International
and General Electric Capital Corp. submitted refinance proposals
to Griffin’s Foods, two of the people said.  As Pacific Equity Partners last year tried unsuccessfully
to sell Griffin’s and may still seek a buyer, banks are offering
a tenor for the new loan of three years or less, the people
said.  Pacific Equity bought Griffin’s in June 2006 from Paris-
based Danone for 194 million euros ($256 million). Its brands
include Huntley & Palmers crackers as well as Eta and Nice &
Natural snacks, according to its website.  A telephone call to Griffin’s head office in Auckland
seeking comment on the refinancing went unanswered outside of
normal business hours in New Zealand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
