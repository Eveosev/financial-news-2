Ukraine aims to almost double grain
shipments to  Saudi Arabia  in two to three years, said Mykola Prysyazhnyuk, the Ukrainian agriculture minister.  Ukraine wants to boost shipments to around 7 million tons a
year to Saudi Arabia compared with 3.5 million tons to 4 million
tons now, Prysyazhnyuk told reporters today in the capital Kiev.  “We have government level agreement with Saudi Arabia on
barley production and shipments,” the minister said, adding
that there is concern a late spring may cut planned barley
planting for the 2012 harvest.  “If temperatures rise rapidly, we will not be able to
plant the amount of barley which we forecasted,” Prysyazhnyuk
said. “We see on foreign markets that there is going to be
demand for this crop.”  Farmers will probably plant spring barley on 800,000
hectares to 1 million hectares (1.98 million acres to 2.47
million acres), Leonid Sukhomlyn, head of the  Agriculture
Ministry ’s grain department, said on Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
