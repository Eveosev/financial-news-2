EON AG (EOAN) , the utility planning to
convert its Ironbridge coal plant in the U.K. to run on biomass,
said the work will reduce the plant’s capacity.  Ironbridge’s first unit, which currently runs at 485
megawatts, will drop to a maximum 450 megawatts after the work
is completed, Scott Somerville, a spokesman, said today in a
telephone interview from Coventry, England.  The facility will continue to run for a limited number of
hours after conversion under a European directive aimed at
curbing acid rain, he said. The law requires some power stations
to close by the end of 2015 or when they have used their alloted
hours, whichever comes first.  “Our first priority is to convert one unit,” Somerville
said. “The local planning application is in.”  Both units will be offline from April until the beginning
of October, according to  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
