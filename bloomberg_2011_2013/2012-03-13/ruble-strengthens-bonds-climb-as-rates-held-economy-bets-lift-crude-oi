The ruble erased yesterday’s
declines against the dollar and bonds gained as rising U.S.
retail sales bolstered appetite for riskier assets.  The Russian currency extended its advance to 0.6 percent
after the central bank kept rates on hold today, before trading
up 0.5 percent at 29.4824 by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow.
 Russia ’s ruble bonds due April 2021 rose for a third day,
lowering the yield seven basis points to 7.79 percent.  Bank Rossii refrained from cutting rates at its meeting
after signaling that record-low inflation won’t last once pre-
election price curbs are unwound. Better-than-expected German
investor confidence data and U.S. retail sales rising by the
most in five months bolstered the global economic outlook. Urals
crude, Russia’s main export blend, added 0.5 percent to $124.20
a barrel.  The ruble weakened temporarily earlier in the day, erasing
gains after the  Finance Ministry  said the  budget deficit  was
245.3 billion rubles ($8.3 billion) through the end of February
after revising a January shortfall to a 27.2 billion ruble
surplus.  Government dollar bonds due 2020 climbed for a third day,
cutting the yield two basis points to 3.88 percent, the lowest
since they were sold in April 2010. The currency jumped 0.9
percent versus the euro to 38.57 and added 0.7 percent to
33.5718 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Bank Rossii left the refinancing rate at 8 percent, the
Moscow-based central bank said in a statement on its website
today. The decision was forecast by 19 of 20 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The overnight auction-based repurchase rate
used to provide cash for banks was held at 5.25 percent and the
overnight deposit rate will remain at 4 percent.  Rates ‘Acceptable’  “The decision was made based on an estimate of inflation
risks and prospects for economic growth given the continued
external economic uncertainty,” the central bank said in a
statement. Money-market  interest rates  are “acceptable for the
coming months,” it said.  Inflation slowed to a post-Soviet low of 3.7 percent in
February from a year earlier as fuel-cost caps and delayed
utility-tariff increases curbed price growth amid Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin ’s presidential campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
