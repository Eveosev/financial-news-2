Russia can catch up with the pace
of expansion in other developing nations over the next three
years as their economic growth slows to 6 percent to 7 percent,
Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said.  Russia must improve the quality of its institutions to
unlock the countryâ€™s potential or the economy will be confined
to expansion of 3 percent or 4 percent a year, Ulyukayev said in
an interview with the official Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
