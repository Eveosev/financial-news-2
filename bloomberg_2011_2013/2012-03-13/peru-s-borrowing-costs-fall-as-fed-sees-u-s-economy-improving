Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars fell to a seven-month low after Federal Reserve policy
makers raised their assessment of the  U.S. economy , spurring
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 171 at 3:57 p.m. in Lima, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the narrowest gap since Aug. 3.  Labor market conditions have improved while strains in
global financial markets have eased, the policy-setting  Federal
Open Market Committee  said in a statement at the conclusion of a
meeting today in Washington.  “There’s a more supportive environment for risk-taking,”
said  Roberto Melzi , a strategist at Barclays Plc in  New York .  Peru’s sol was little changed at 2.67 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, compared with 2.6695 yesterday, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The Andean country’s central bank bought $141 million in
the spot currency market today to stem gains in the sol. It paid
an average 2.6698 soles per  U.S. dollar , the bank said on its
website.  Corporate bond and share issuance rose 19 percent to $295
million in the first two months of the year from the same period
of 2011, the country’s securities regulator said.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point to 5.39
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
security’s price rose 0.03 centimo to 116.34 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
