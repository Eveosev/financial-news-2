Crude oil options volatility fell
for a fifth consecutive session as underlying futures rose after
U.S. retail sales in February increased the most in five months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, sank to 26.7 percent as of 2:30 p.m. in  New
York , down from 27 percent yesterday.  “We’re getting a little more range bound,” said Fred
Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.
“With no breakout here, people are reluctant to buy options.”  Crude for April delivery rose 37 cents to settle at $106.71
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The May contract
increased 40 cents to $107.24. Since Feb. 21, the front-month
contract has traded in a range of $104.26 to $110.55.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $105 puts, with 2,395 lots changing hands as of 2:40 p.m.
They fell 27 cents to 36 cents a barrel. June $73 puts, the
second-most active options, declined 3 cents to 6 cents with
2,026 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish options accounted for 54 percent of the 92,592
trades from the previous session. April $100 puts were the most
actively traded, with 5,240 lots changing hands as they rose 1
cent to 9 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, April
$102 puts, gained 2 cents to 18 cents on volume of 4,102.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 46,401
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,632 lots and
