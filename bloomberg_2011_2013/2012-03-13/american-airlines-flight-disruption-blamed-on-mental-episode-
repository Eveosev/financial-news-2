The  American Airlines  flight
attendant whose rants about a possible crash and the Sept. 11
attacks prompted her plane’s crew to cancel takeoff had stopped
taking medication for bipolar disorder, according to a police
report.  Initially restrained by passengers, the 43-year-old
attendant was handcuffed and put in leg restraints by officers
when she resisted being taken from the plane during the March 9
incident, according to a Dallas-Fort Worth Airport police
report. American Airlines declined to comment today on the
incident.  The woman was taken to a Dallas hospital for evaluation of
a “mental episode” and another flight attendant was taken to a
second hospital after being kicked in the abdomen, according to
the report.  Flight 2332 to  Chicago  was preparing to take off with 144
passengers and five crew, when the attendant’s behavior prompted
a return to the airport gate. Airport police said have said they
wouldn’t seek state criminal charges.  The  Association of Professional Flight Attendants , which
represents 17,000 American employees, said today it makes mental
health professionals available to help members deal with an
“increasingly demanding and stressful” profession and that
such instances are rare.  American and its flight attendants’ union are negotiating
concessions that include 2,300 job cuts under a bankruptcy
restructuring plan. The third-largest U.S. carrier wants to
freeze pensions and change work rules and benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
