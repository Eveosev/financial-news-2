U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  toward the highest level since
2007, as retail sales increased by the most in five months and
the  Federal Reserve  said the jobs market has improved.  Financial,  technology  and industrial shares had the biggest
gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index among 10 groups.
Caterpillar Inc. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  increased more than
2.2 percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  jumped 2.1 percent, rallying for a fifth
straight day, as Jefferies Group Inc. raised its share-price
estimate to $699. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, which is
considered a proxy for economic growth, climbed 1.3 percent.  The S&P 500 added 0.9 percent to 1,383.07 at 2:28 p.m. New
York time. The Dow advanced 110.35 points, or 0.9 percent, to
13,070.06, the highest on a closing basis since December 2007.
Both gauges rose for a fifth day. The Nasdaq Composite Index
gained 1 percent to 3,014, the highest level since  2000. (CCMP)  About
4.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.  “We’ve seen an improving economic picture,” said  Ryan Larson , Chicago-based head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global
Asset Management (U.S.) Inc. His firm oversees $250 billion in
assets. “That’s been supported by accommodative monetary
policy. Any kind of pullback in stocks should be kept in the
context of a larger move higher for equities.”  Benchmark gauges rose as data showed  retail sales  rose 1.1
percent in February, matching the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Stocks extended gains as Fed policy
makers raised their assessment of the economy as the labor
market gathers strength and refrained from new actions to lower
borrowing costs.  Global Rally  Stocks also followed  global stocks  higher as concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis eased. German investor confidence jumped to
a 21-month high. European Central Bank council member Jens Weidmann said policy makers are already discussing ways to
withdraw some of the emergency cash they injected into the
banking system to fight the sovereign debt crisis.  Today’s gain extended this year’s advance in the S&P 500 to
10 percent. Technology and financial shares surged at least 15
percent as investors bought stocks of companies most-tied to the
economy amid signs of rebound at the world’s largest economy.  Nine out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 gained. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index jumped 1.9 percent as 29 of its 30 stocks
advanced.  Caterpillar (CAT) , the biggest construction and mining-
equipment maker, advanced 2.8 percent to $112.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the
largest U.S. aluminum producer, increased 3.7 percent to $10.23.
A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes rose 1.7 percent to the
highest level since 2010.  Apple Climbs  Apple, the world’s biggest technology company, jumped 2.1
percent to a record $563.73. Jefferies raised its share-price
estimate by $100. Apple has surged 39 percent this year and its
market capitalization last month topped $500 billion for the
first time.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  climbed 1.7 percent as all of its 24
stocks gained. The index yesterday snapped a three-day advance
on concern about how banks would perform in Fed stress tests.
JPMorgan increased 2.2 percent to $41.43.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
rallied 1.8 percent to $8.13 today.  FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS)  advanced 9.2 percent to
$99.20. The Norwalk, Connecticut-based financial-data supplier
reported second-quarter  profit  and sales that exceeded analysts’
estimates. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes
with FactSet.  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  fell 5.5 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $27.88. The operator of its namesake, Anthropologie and
Free People brands reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed
the average analyst estimate.  ‘Apparent Error’  BioCryst (BCRX)  Pharmaceuticals Inc. slid 5.4 percent to $5.25.
The drugmaker will initiate a process at the U.S. Patent &
Trademark Office to correct an “apparent error,” according to
a regulatory filing. BioCryst said that a patent for a hepatitis
C inhibitor it discovered was issued to Biota Holdings Ltd.  A bad year for American equity trading is getting worse.
Shares changing hands on  all U.S. exchanges  fell 16 percent to
5.23 billion yesterday from March 9, while  S&P 500   composite
volume  slipped 17 percent to 2.17 billion shares, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Those are the lowest daily levels of 2012 and
the smallest totals excluding holiday weeks since Bloomberg
began tracking the data in 2008.  A rally that has restored more than  $3.2 trillion  into U.S.
equities has failed to lure investors. While the S&P 500 has had
its best annual start since 1998, individuals are shunning
equities after they were burned in 2011 by Europe’s crisis, said
 Mark Turner , head of U.S. sales trading at Instinet Inc.  ‘Take Your Pick’  “I don’t think investors are completely convinced,”
Turner said in a telephone interview. Volume “was extremely
light volume because it was quiet in Europe over the weekend and
there was no major headlines coming out of Europe,” he said.
“Money has been shifting to bonds out of equities for some time
now. There’s a host of different reasons. Take your pick.”  Nasdaq (MVOLQE)  composite trading volume slipped 15 percent to 1.34
billion shares, the lowest excluding holidays since Aug. 27,
2007, when it was 1.34 billion shares, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Volume of shares for securities traded on the
New York Stock Exchange declined 10 percent to about 644 million
shares, the lowest since Feb. 24, Bloomberg data show.  U.S. companies and their executives are selling stocks at
2.2 times the pace of buying, the most since December 2009.
About $15.3 billion of shares have been sold by companies and
insiders this month, compared with $7.1 billion of purchases,
according to TrimTabs Investment Research.  Stock Offerings  Stock offerings reached $2.7 billion a day last week, the
highest level since May, the data show.  Simon Property Group
Inc. (SPG) , the largest U.S. mall owner, announced its first stock
offering in almost three years while Internet company Yelp Inc.
went public.  “Our supply indicators have turned markedly less favorable
in March,”  Charles Biderman , chief executive officer at the
Sausalito, California-based firm, wrote in a report dated
yesterday. “We are not greatly concerned that corporate buying
has been unspectacular,” he said. “What worries us more is
that new offerings and insiders’ selling have soared.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
