Bahrain awarded a contract to
 Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  to explore for natural gas deposits
in the country, the nation’s oil minister said.  Bahrain, the smallest oil and gas producer in the  Persian
Gulf , wants to develop the resources at depths between 15,000
and 20,000 feet as the country’s plan to increase its gas
production capacity to meet growth in local demand, Abdul
Hussain Mirza said yesterday in an interview in  Kuwait  at a
meeting of the  International Energy Forum . Oxy, as the company
is known, has already started exploration works, Mirza said.  Oxy will drill three exploration wells during the first
four years of the seven-year contract at their own expense, the
minister said. If gas is found then the two parties will devise
a “formula for sharing the project,” he said.  Bahrain will award a tender to build a liquefied natural
gas import terminal by the end of this year as it plans to
import 400 million cubic feet of natural gas, Mirza said
yesterday. He didn’t specify a timeframe for the imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
