Robert Fico , whose Smer party won
Slovakia’s elections last week, expects the budget deficit to
reach 5.2 percent of gross domestic product this year, higher
than the target of 4.6 percent of GDP,  Sme  reported.  The future government headed by Fico will need to “adjust
some parameters” of the 2012 budget unless the economy grows
faster than projected, Fico said in an interview with Sme. The
new administration will meet the commitment to squeeze the
deficit below 3 percent of GDP next year, he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
