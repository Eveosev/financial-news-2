France  will publish new rules in
coming days to spur development of water storage by farms after
a spring drought last year that hurt crop and livestock
production, Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire said.  The governmental decree will also seek to prevent water-
storage projects for agriculture from being held up by court
challenges, Le Maire said at a press conference today at the
World Water Forum in Marseille, southern France.  Last year’s drought caused an estimated 242 million euros
($317 million) in losses for grassland and pasture, France’s
committee for agricultural risk management said in December. The
agriculture ministry in November announced plans to create 40
million cubic meters (1.4 billion cubic feet) of additional
water storage for farm use.  “We want to simplify the rules,” Le Maire said.
“Farmers’ anger is legitimate when they can’t develop” these
projects, he said.  At the conference, Le Maire called for farmers, the biggest
users of water worldwide, to use the resource more efficiently
amid growing scarcity. French farmers shouldn’t be charged more
for water, and should be encouraged to refrain from growing
crops that require a lot of water in areas where drought occurs
regularly, the minister said.  “Making farmers pay more for water is not the solution,”
he said. “They need to be encouraged to use water more
efficiently, to store it during the winter and not to grow crops
in dry regions that require a lot of water.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
