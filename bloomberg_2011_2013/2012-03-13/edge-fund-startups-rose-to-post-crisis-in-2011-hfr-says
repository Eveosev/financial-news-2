Hedge fund startups totaled the
most last year since 2007 as clients sought alternatives to
traditional stock investments, according to a report today by
Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.  The number of new funds climbed to 1,113 last year from 935
in 2010, the most since 1,197 were counted in 2007, HFR said.
Most startups last year were equity funds or followed a  macro
strategy , meaning they bet on global economic trends.  “Investors maintained a strong commitment to hedge funds,
and fund managers expanded the scope and breadth of strategies
offered, making 2011 the strongest year for new launches since
the global financial crisis,” Kenneth Heinz, president of HFR,
said in the report.  After posting a record loss of 19 percent in 2008 when the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. hurt financial
markets, hedge funds rebounded with two straight years of
aggregate gains. Funds declined 5.3 percent in 2011 as the
European debt crisis spurred declines in  global stocks ,
according to HFR.  The number of funds that closed last year rose to 775 from
743 in 2010. That compares with a record 1,471 closures in 2008.
Funds of funds had 215 closings in 2011, the fewest since 2007,
the research firm said.  Investors allocated $70.6 billion to  hedge funds  in 2011,
contributing to total industry assets of $2.01 trillion. Funds
rose 5 percent this year through February, according to HFR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
