Ukrainian Finance Minister Yuriy Kolobov will visit the U.S. this month for talks with the
 International Monetary Fund , Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  Kolobov will meet the Washington-based lender’s new mission
chief for Ukraine,  Chris Jarvis , to discuss cooperation, Azarov
said today in a statement on the Cabinet’s  website .  Ukraine is seeking to resume a $15.6 billion bailout loan
from the IMF, which was frozen last year after the government
failed to raise household utility tariffs to balance the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
