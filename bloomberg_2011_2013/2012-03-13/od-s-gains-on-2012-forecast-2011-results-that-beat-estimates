Tod’s SpA (TOD) , the Italian maker of
pink alligator loafers, surged in Milan trading after reporting
2011 profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates and forecasting
“significant” revenue and earnings growth this year.  Net income climbed 24 percent to 135 million euros ($177
million) in 2011, the Sant’Elpidio a Mare, Italy-based company
said today in a statement. The average of 12 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 130.8 million euros.  The shares climbed as much as 7.7 percent to 84.90 euros
and traded at 83.15 euros as of 3:34 p.m. in Milan. The maker of
Hogan and Roger Vivier footwear has advanced 32 percent this
year, giving it a market value of 2.5 billion euros. Today’s
intraday gain is the biggest since Aug. 26, 2009.  Sales at stores open at least a year climbed 7.1 percent on
average in the first 11 weeks of 2012, Tod’s said. The company
also proposed a dividend of 2.5 euros a share, up 25 percent on
the previous year.  “Despite the challenging environment, I’m confident that
the strength of our brands and the excellent appeal of our
products will enable our group to post a significant growth in
sales and profits also this year,” Tod’s Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Diego Della Valle said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
