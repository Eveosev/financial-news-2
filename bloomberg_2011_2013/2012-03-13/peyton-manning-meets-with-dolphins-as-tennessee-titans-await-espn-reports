Peyton Manning  met with Miami
Dolphins coach Joe Philbin and other team personnel for almost
six hours last night,  ESPN reported , citing unidentified
National Football League officials.  ESPN said the meeting took place in Indianapolis, where
quarterback Manning played 14 seasons before being released by
the Colts last week.  A four-time NFL Most Valuable Player, Manning is the top
player available as the league’s free-agent signing period
begins today at 4 p.m. New York time. Manning’s meeting with the
Dolphins followed weekend visits with the Denver Broncos and
Arizona Cardinals.  Manning, 35, plans to visit the Tennessee Titans today or
tomorrow, ESPN said. Titans coach Mike Munchak, a Hall of Fame
guard and former teammate of Manning’s father, Archie, will be
among the team officials at the meeting, ESPN said.  Manning, who is recovering from neck-fusion surgery that
sidelined him for the 2011 season, doesn’t appear to have a
deadline to pick his next team, ESPN said.  Quarterback Matt Flynn, who spent the past four NFL seasons
with the  Green Bay  Packers, is among the other top free agents
and may be an option for the Dolphins if they fail to land
Manning. Flynn worked in Green Bay under Philbin, who was the
Packers’ offensive coordinator before joining Miami.  Unrestricted free agents can sign with teams beginning
today through July 22 or the first scheduled day of the first
NFL training camp, whichever is later. Teams have until 4 p.m.
today to get under the league’s salary cap of $120.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
