Gold fell to the lowest price since
January after Federal Reserve policy makers raised their
assessment of the economy, signaling that monetary stimulus
won’t be expanded.  Gold for immediate delivery fell 1.8 percent to $1,670.15
an ounce at 3:53 p.m. New York time, after slipping as much as
2.2 percent to $1,666.13, the lowest since Jan. 25.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement that
the labor market was improving. The dollar climbed against a
basket of major currencies, eroding the investment appeal of
gold. On Feb. 29, the spot price of the metal plunged 4.9
percent, the most since December 2008, after Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  damped speculation that the central bank would take new
steps to bolster liquidity.  “This is a big disappointment for gold investors who are
anticipating additional stimulus,” Phil Streible, a commodity
broker at RJO Futures in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview
after the Fed statement at 2:15 p.m. “People are still favoring
the dollar.”  Gold futures for April delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
settle at $1,694.20 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . In electronic trading after the close, the most-active
contract fell as much as 2.2 percent to $1,662.10, also the
lowest since Jan. 25.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to close
at $33.581 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery gained 0.4 percent to settle at $1,701.80 an
ounce. Palladium futures for June delivery climbed 0.7 percent
at $708.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
