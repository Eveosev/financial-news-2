Asia ’s gasoil crack spread shrank,
signaling reduced profit for refiners making the distillate fuel.
Hin Leong Trading Pte sold  fuel oil  for a second day in
 Singapore , the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 37 cents to $15.35 a barrel at 2:41 p.m. Singapore
time, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack
spread , a measure of processing profit, is the narrowest in
three days.  Morgan Stanley sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil  with 10
parts-per-million of sulfur to BP Plc for loading from March 28
to April 1, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders who
monitored transactions on the Platts window. The cargo changed
hands at $3.10 a barrel over prices for 0.5 percent sulfur grade.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil dropped 5 cents to 10 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This  regrade  is the lowest since Feb. 20,
indicating it is less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong sold 20,000 metric tons of  380-centistoke (N6SHS380)  fuel
oil to Gunvor Group Ltd. at $738 a ton, according to the
Bloomberg survey. Mercuria Energy Ltd. purchased 25,000 tons of
the same grade from Koch Industries Inc. at $739 a ton. Both
shipments are for March 28 to April 1 loading.  Fuel oil declined 15 cents to $7.81 a barrel below Dubai
crude at 2:41 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. The
 discount  widened for the fifth time in six days, signaling
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 50 cents to $9.75 a ton, PVM said. This
 viscosity spread  is the narrowest since Feb. 20, meaning bunker,
or marine fuel, increased more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
increased $1.03 to $119.47 a ton at 5:16 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The difference, also
known as the crack spread, is the widest in five days.  Glencore International Plc sold 25,000 tons of open-
specification  naphtha  to Vitol Group for first-half May delivery
at $1,085.50 a ton, according to the Bloomberg survey. Glencore
sold the petrochemical feedstock to Vitol at least four times
previously this month.  Refinery News  Idemitsu Kosan Co. plans to start a 140,000 barrel-a-day
crude distillation unit at its Hokkaido refinery in northern
 Japan  by the end of this week, said company spokesman Kei
Uchikawa. The no. 1 unit was halted March 9 due to a malfunction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
