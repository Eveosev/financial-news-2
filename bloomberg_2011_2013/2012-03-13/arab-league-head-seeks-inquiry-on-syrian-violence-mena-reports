Violence against Syrian civilians
“could be described as crimes against humanity” and should be
the subject of an international investigation, said the
secretary-general of the  Arab League .  Those responsible for crimes including “horrific acts of
killing and liquidation of entire families” shouldn’t be
allowed to escape accountability, the state-run Middle East News
Agency cited Nabil el-Arabi as saying. “There must be an
impartial international investigation to uncover the truth about
the events and to present to justice those responsible for such
crimes.”  He called on the Syrian government to cooperate with any
independent international investigation, according to the
report.  El-Arabi’s remarks came a day after the Syrian opposition
reported the death of 20 women and 25 children in the Karam Al-
Zaitoun neighborhood of Homs, killings the Syrian National
Council denounced as a “grisly crime.”  -- Editors: Francis Harris, Louis Meixler, Digby Lidstone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
