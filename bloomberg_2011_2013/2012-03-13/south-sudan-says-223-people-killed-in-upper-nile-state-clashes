Nile state, said Kuol Manyang, governor of the neighboring
Jonglei state.  Another 100 people were wounded and more than 150 women and
children abducted in raids in Nasir country from March 9 to
March 11, Manyang said in a phone interview yesterday from Bor,
Jonglei’s capital. The victims were ethnic Lou Nuer from Akobo

on the border areas of South Sudan and  Ethiopia .  “The mission has sent teams to the area to investigate the
circumstances of the clashes,” Kouider Zerrouk, spokesman for
the UN Mission in South Sudan, said in a phone interview
