Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  advancing for a second day, amid optimism euro-
area finance chiefs will complete a second Greek bailout, and
before a policy decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve today.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s largest lender by market value,
gained 1.3 percent. Agile Property Holdings Ltd. led mainland
developers higher after  China  Securities Journal said government
agencies called for stable lending policies for first time home-
buyers. Tencent Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest Internet company,
gained 2.1 percent after Youku Inc., the U.S.-listed operator of
the mainland’s most popular online video site, said it plans to
buy a rival for $1 billion.  “Investors still believe that economic growth in China is
intact,” said Patrick Yiu, associate director at Cash Asset
Management Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “That means earnings aren’t going
to retreat from here and valuations are attractive.”  The  Hang Seng  Index advanced 1.1 percent to 21,376.44 as of
10:54 a.m. in Hong Kong. Volume on the measure was 10 percent
less than the 30-day intraday average before the Fed’s
announcement on interest-rate policy. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland companies, also known as the H-
share index, gained 1.4 percent to 11,381.62.  Even after rising 16 percent this year, stocks on the Hang
Seng are still less expensive than those on the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  or the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares on Hong
Kong’s benchmark trade at an average of 10.8 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13.1 on the  S&P 500  and 11.1 on Europe’s
broadest gauge.  S&P 500 Futures  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent today. The gauge
was little changed in  New York  yesterday amid trading volume
that fell to its lowest level this year on U.S. equity exchanges.  The Fed is wrapping up a policy meeting today. The Wall
Street Journal last week reported the U.S. central bank is
considering a strategy that would allow another round of bond
buying, so-called quantitative easing, while lowering the risk
of inflation.  In Europe, finance ministers are gathering in Brussels
today to sign off on a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) rescue
package for Greece. Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude
Juncker  said he had “no doubt” that the Greek bailout would be
approved and he expected a final decision on March 14.  Futures on the Hang Seng expiring this month gained 1.1
percent to 21,360. The HSI Volatility Index eased 3.2 percent
