HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, said it has no plans to leave any countries in Asia,
following a report it may sell or close some consumer units in
the region.  “We’re not planning to exit any markets in Asia at the
moment,” Brendan McNamara, a spokesman, said by telephone
today. The bank may leave seven markets where it has fewer than
20 branches; Bangladesh, Brunei, Macau,  New Zealand , Pakistan,
the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the Financial Times reported
today, citing an interview with Peter Wong, the bank’s head of
Asia.  HSBC Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  said in August
he will eliminate 30,000 positions by the end of 2013 to save as
much as $3.5 billion, withdrawing from some markets, while
hiring people in Asia. The U.K. lender is scaling back in parts
of Asia, including Japan and Thailand, as it prepares for
tighter capital rules.  HSBC agreed in January to sell operations in Costa Rica, El
Salvador and Honduras to Colombia’s  Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVND)  for $801
million to focus on bigger markets in Latin America.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
