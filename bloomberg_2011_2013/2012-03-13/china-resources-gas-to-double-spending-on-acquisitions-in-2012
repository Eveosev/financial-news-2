China Resources Gas Group Ltd. (1193) , the
Hong Kong-listed fuel distributor expanding on the mainland,
plans to more than double spending on acquisitions after
reporting a 64 percent increase in full-year profit.  The operator of 73 city gas projects in 16 provinces plans
to spend HK$6 billion ($773 million) to HK$8 billion on
purchases this year, Managing Director Wang Chuandong said at a
press conference today in  Hong Kong . The company spent about
HK$3 billion to buy 25 city gas projects in 2011, Wang said.  China  Resources Gas is expanding its mainland distribution
business as demand for the cleaner-burning fuel surges. China,
the world’s fastest-growing major economy, wants gas to account
for 10 percent of its energy consumption by 2020 to cut the use
of more polluting oil and coal.  “Mergers and acquisition have been normal in the city gas
sector in the past few years and I think the trend will
continue,” said Wang. China Resources Gas will continue to
expand through both organic growth and acquisitions, he said.  The company posted net income of HK$1.2 billion in the year
ended Dec. 31, while sales rose 62 percent to HK13.5 billion.  Shares of China Resources Gas fell 2.5 percent, the most
since Dec. 1, to HK$13.48 before the results were announced. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 1 percent.  ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. (2688)  and  China Petroleum and Chemical
Corp.  proposed to take over  China Gas Holdings Ltd. (384)  with a joint
bid of HK$15.3 billion in December. China Gas, which distributes
gas in 20 provinces, rejected the offer on Dec. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
