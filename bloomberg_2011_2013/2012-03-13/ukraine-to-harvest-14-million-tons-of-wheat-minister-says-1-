Ukraine’s wheat harvest may total
14 million metric tons this year, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  The country will export about 2 million tons of grains a
month from April through June, Prysyazhnyuk told reporters today
in the capital, Kiev, adding that corn will be “actively”
exported in the July through September period. Grain exports
this month will also be about 2 million tons, he said.  “It is going to be good if we export between 20 million
tons and 21 million tons of grain” in the marketing year before
July 1, the minister said.  Prysyazhnyuk reiterated the ministry’s forecast of a grain
harvest of between 42 million tons and 50 million tons in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
