Green Infra Ltd., which acquired  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s  India  wind farms in 2009, has “looked at” projects that
real-estate developer  DLF Ltd. (DLFU)  is trying to sell, Green Infra’s
chief operating officer said.  “DLF’s wind assets have been in the market,” Sunil Jain
said today in an interview in Chennai. “We have looked at
them.” He declined to say whether Green Infra, which is backed
by IDFC Private Equity, planned to make an offer.  Gurgaon-based DLF didn’t respond to an e-mail and phone
call requesting comment on whether it plans to sell its  229
megawatts  of wind capacity.  DLF, India’s largest property developer, wants to sell off
the wind farms, which aren’t strategic to its main business, to
reduce debt, Mint reported last month, citing people it didn’t
identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
