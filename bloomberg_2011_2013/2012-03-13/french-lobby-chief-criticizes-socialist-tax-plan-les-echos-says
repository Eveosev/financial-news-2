Policies advocated by  Francois Hollande , the Socialist candidate in  France ’s presidential
election campaign, would raise taxes on business by 17 billion
euros ($22 billion), a “crushing burden,” according to Medef,
the country’s biggest business lobby group,  Les Echos  reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Medef chief Laurence Parisot also criticized Hollande’s plan to raise the top tax
rate on households with incomes of more than 1 million euros to
75 percent, saying it would discourage entrepreneurship. She
praised the record of President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is
campaigning for a second term, for tax reforms and investments
that would increase France’s competitiveness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
