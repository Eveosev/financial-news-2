France ’s inflation rate fell for a
second month in February as a slowing economy outweighed the impact 
of higher energy prices.  Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier based
on European Union methodology, compared with a 2.6 percent
increase in January and a 2.7 percent gain in November, Paris-
based national statistics office Insee said today. Economists
had forecast a rate of 2.6 percent, the median of 18 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey showed. Prices rose 0.5 percent in
the month after declining 0.4 percent in January.  With London crude- oil prices  up 16 percent this year and
the French government seeking more revenue through sales-tax
increases, prices may keep rising in euro area’s second-largest
economy. The  European Central Bank  raised its average 2012
inflation forecast for the region last week to 2.4 percent from
2 percent in December even as it reduced its growth outlook.  “We see upward risks coming from higher-than-expected oil
prices,” ECB President  Mario Draghi  said last week. “Owing to
rises in energy prices and indirect taxes, inflation rates are
now likely to stay above 2 percent in 2012, with upside risks
prevailing,” he added.  French consumer price increases of 2.7 percent in both
November and December were the highest since Oct. 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
