Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  led gains in Hong
Kong-listed gambling stocks after Deutsche Bank raised its
estimate for casino revenue growth in Macau to 25 percent this
year on spending by wealthy Chinese tourists.  Wynn Macau rose 8.6 percent to close at HK$23.35 after
Karen Tang, a Hong Kong-based analyst for Deutsche Bank, raised
her rating on the stock to buy from hold. That’s the biggest
jump since Oct. 27.  Revenue  at the world’s largest gambling hub may rise as
spending by VIP or high-stakes gamblers who can bet as much as
$250,000 a hand picks up, Tang said. Chinese visitors have
fueled growth in the former Portuguese colony, the only place in
the world’s most populous nation where casinos are legal.  “We turn from mild to very bullish,” after a trip to
Macau, Tang, who previously forecast a 20 percent jump in Macau
casino gambling revenue this year, wrote in a note dated March
12. “We think the market will be surprised by the recovery of
VIP demand in the next few months.”  Billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , the world’s
biggest casino operator by revenue, climbed 6.3 percent to close
at HK$16.22. SJM’s 2011 revenue of $9.7 billion topped  Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS) ’s $9.4 billion and Caesars Entertainment Corp.’s
$8.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.[bn:WBTKR=1928:HK]   Casino gambling  [] revenue  in Macau last year climbed 42
percent to 268 billion patacas ($34 billion), and grew 28
percent to 49 billion patacas in the first two months of 2012,
according to the city’s Gaming Inspection & Coordination Bureau.  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  climbed 5.9 percent,  MGM China Holdings
Ltd. (2282)  jumped 4.6 percent,  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  rose
6.2 percent and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  rose 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
