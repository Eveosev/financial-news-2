Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. (OPY)  said it
has received an inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice
seeking information on the valuation of a “single portfolio
holding” in one of the company’s private equity funds.  Oppenheimer received a notice Feb. 24 from the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for Massachusetts in Boston saying it was
looking into the matter, according to a March 6 regulatory
filing.  The firm has been responding to requests on the same
subject from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Attorney General of Massachusetts since October, New York-based
Oppenheimer said in the filing. At issue is an allegation that
the value of one of the holdings in the Oppenheimer Global
Resource Private Equity Fund L.P was overstated. The probe also
targeted the marketing practices associated with the fund, the
company said.  Oppenheimer said in the filing that it was cooperating with
investigating entities.  Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Attorney’s office in  Boston , didn’t immediately respond to an e-
mail and phone message seeking comment. Brad Puffer, a spokesman
for the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, declined to
comment.  A spokesman for Oppenheimer Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of
Oppenheimer & Co., a New York-based investment boutique, didn’t
immediately respond to a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
