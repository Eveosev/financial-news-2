The nominee to represent the U.S on
the  World Bank  board of directors told a Senate Committee today
that she would “diligently work to advance U.S. objectives” at
the institution.  “The World Bank has played a central role in promoting
open economies that become growing export markets for American
companies,” Sara Aviel, the nominee for alternate executive
director, said in prepared testimony before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. ”During the global financial crisis, the
World Bank acted quickly, dramatically increasing lending to
help protect the poorest from the worst impacts of the crisis
and to restore liquidity for world trade flows.”  Aviel’s nomination comes as the U.S. is set to announce a
candidate for the World Bank presidency to replace  Robert Zoellick , who plans to step down at the end of his term in June.  Aviel is currently director of international economic
affairs at the National Security Council and the National
Economic Council. She previously served as senior adviser to
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner .  To contact the reporters on this story:
