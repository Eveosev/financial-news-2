Julius Berger Nigeria Plc (JBERGER) , the
country’s largest construction company by market value, advanced
for a fourth day on speculation this year’s slump was overdone.  The stock rose 5 percent to 27.47 naira by the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos, the commercial capital. The four-day advance is
the longest run of gains since June 4, 2010. The shares have
dropped 13 percent this year, compared with a 1.9 percent gain
in the benchmark Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  “Investors are seeing some potential in the stock, so they
are taking a position,” David Adonri, chief executive officer
of Lambeth Trust and Investment Co., a Lagos-based brokerage,
said by phone today.  Julius Berger, whose largest single shareholder is
 Germany ’s  Bilfinger Berger AG (GBF) , forecast a 46 percent increase in
first-quarter profit on Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
