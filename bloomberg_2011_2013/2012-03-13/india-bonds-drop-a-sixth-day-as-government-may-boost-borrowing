India ’s benchmark  bonds  fell for a
sixth day on concern investors will refrain from adding to their
holdings as the government may increase borrowing in the next
fiscal year beginning April 1.  Yields reached a six-week high before Finance Minister
 Pranab Mukherjee  unveils the budget on March 16. The central
bank will keep the  repurchase  rate unchanged at 8.5 percent at a
policy review on March 15, according to 12 of 14 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Two expect a 25-basis point cut. The
government may raise its debt sale target by 6 percent to a
record 5.4 trillion rupees ($108 billion), said N.S. Venkatesh,
head of treasury at state-run IDBI Bank Ltd.  “Prospects of a huge borrowing are probably deterring
investors,” Mumbai-based Venkatesh said. “The central bank
would also like to see some more fiscal consolidation before
kicking off rate cuts.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.31 percent as of
10:12 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate is the highest since Jan. 27.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, were little
changed at 8.11 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
