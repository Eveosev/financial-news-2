Mexico ’s industrial production  rose 
at the fastest annual pace in eight months in January, beating
all 16 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Output climbed 4.2 percent from the year earlier and 0.8
percent from December, the national statistics agency said on
its website today. Production was expected to decline 0.1
percent in the month, according to the median estimate of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s gross domestic product is expected to expand 3.5
percent this year, down from 3.9 percent in 2011 as Europe’s
debt crisis weighs on global demand, according to the  Finance
Ministry . Still, recent data show that the nation’s economy is
in a better situation than six months ago and may see “positive
surprises,” Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said March 8.  “The output figure could give us a better first quarter
and a better base for 2012,” said  Rafael Camarena , an economist
at  Banco Santander. (SAN)  If data keeps improving “it will give us a
chance to lift our growth forecast for this year” from its
current 3.2 percent.  The economy created about 130,000 jobs last month, the
Mexican Social Security Institute reported yesterday.  Manufacturing industry led the growth in industrial output,
expanding 5.6 percent from a year earlier, followed by
construction, with 4.8 percent growth, the statistics institute
said. Mining fell 1.3 percent, the institute said.  Today’s report isn’t enough to change the growth outlook
for the year, said Fernando Losada, an economist at Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc in  New York .  Mexico’s central bank board, led by  Agustin Carstens , next
meet on March 16 and will keep the benchmark rate at 4.5 percent
for a 25th straight meeting, according to all 19 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 12.6404 per dollar at 10:57
a.m. local time. The currency has strengthened 10.3 percent
against the dollar this year, the best performance among the 16-
most traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
