President Kazuhiko Asakawa declined a request to appear before a
parliamentary committee seeking answers over how the suspended
 fund manager  lost as much as $2 billion of pension money.  “Unfortunately I am unable to take up the offer,” Asakawa
said, according to a faxed statement read by  Banri Kaieda ,
chairman of the lower house financial committee, to reporters in
Tokyo today. Asakawa wrote that he is busy compiling information
requested by the government’s financial watchdog, Kaieda said.  Asakawa’s reply is his first statement to be made public
since the Financial Services Agency suspended AIJ on Feb. 24 for
a month to find out what happened to the 185.3 billion yen
($2.3 billion) of pension assets managed by his firm. The case
has prompted the regulator to embark on its widest investigation
of asset managers in the country and spurred politicians to
consider increased oversight of the industry.  The FSA’s investigative arm, the Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission, “is still continuing its inspection,”
Asakawa wrote, according to Kaieda. “I am busy as we are
preparing documents to detail the assets under management by the
March 23 deadline,” Kaieda quoted Asakawa as saying.  Tokyo-based AIJ told regulators that its assets under
management have dwindled to about 24 billion yen, including 4
billion yen in cash and deposits, a government official said
last week on condition of anonymity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
