Pittsburgh Penguins captain  Sidney Crosby  will return to National Hockey League action against the
 New York Rangers  on March 15.  Crosby, who has missed 59 games during the last two seasons
because of concussions and their aftermath, is due to play in
the contest at Madison Square Garden in  New York .  “I got a good practice in and I’m looking forward to
getting back out there,” Crosby said today, according to the
Penguins’ website.  Crosby, 24, sustained head injuries in last year’s Jan. 1
Winter Classic against the Washington Capitals and again four
days later against the Tampa Bay Lightning. He missed the rest
of the 2010-11 NHL season.  Crosby returned to the ice this season for eight games until
he was sidelined when concussion-like symptoms returned during a
game against  Boston  on Dec. 5. After that collision, he was
diagnosed with a soft-tissue injury in his neck.  The Rangers lead the NHL’s Eastern Conference by 10 points
over the Boston Bruins in standings that determine the top
playoff seed. They also are four points ahead of the Penguins in
the Atlantic Division. The division winners take the top three
postseason seeds in each conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
