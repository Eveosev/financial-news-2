The zloty weakened for a second day
after the Polish  current-account deficit  rose in January to the
widest in six months.  The zloty depreciated 0.5 percent to 4.1318 per euro as of
3:49 p.m. in Warsaw, the steepest decline among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The current-account gap expanded to 1.83 billion euros
($2.39 billion) in January from 1.34 billion euros in December,
the central bank said in an e-mailed statement today. The
deficit was wider than the median forecast of 1.03 billion euros
in a Bloomberg survey of 20 economists.  The zloty is “under pressure at the moment, as these are
pretty disappointing headline current-account deficit numbers,”
Timothy Ash, London-based head of emerging-markets at Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed comment. “The
deficit had been on an improving trend in recent months, so this
marks an about turn.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
