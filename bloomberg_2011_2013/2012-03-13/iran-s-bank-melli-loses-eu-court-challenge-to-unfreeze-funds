Iran ’s Bank Melli, the state-run
lender that is subject to European Union sanctions, lost an EU
court bid to unfreeze its funds.  The EU’s highest court rejected the Tehran-based bank’s
challenge to a 2008 decision by EU governments that froze assets
belonging to Bank Melli and its units because the lender helped
Iran buy “sensitive materials” for its nuclear and missile
programs.  The freezing of the funds of a bank owned or controlled by
a company “engaged in nuclear proliferation is necessary and
appropriate,” the EU court said in an e-mailed statement.  U.S. and EU leaders are trying to tighten restrictions on
Iran, which they suspect of developing nuclear weapons. The EU
will ban oil imports from Iran starting July 1 as part of
measures to ratchet up the pressure on the Persian Gulf nation.  Today’s ruling from the EU’s Court of Justice is binding.
Iran’s largest government-owned lender lost earlier bids to
overturn the sanctions and to suspend them during the court
action.  Bank Melli didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking
comment.  The case is  C-380/09  P Melli Bank v Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
