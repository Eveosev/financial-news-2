Greek firefighters extinguished a
fire aboard the U.S.-flagged car and truck transport ship
“Alliance Norfolk” early today while it was anchored in the
Port of Piraeus, the  Greek Coast Guard  said.  The operation involved two fire-fighting boats, 30
firefighters, a unit of the Greek Emergency Rescue Squad and a
coast guard rescue boat, the coastguard said in a  statement  on
its website.  The crew of 23, all foreign nationals, and five passengers
are all safe and unhurt; one injured fireman was treated in
hospital, according to the statement. No indication of damage
was given.  The ship belongs to  Hoegh Autoliners AS , a unit of Oslo-
based  Leif Hoegh & Co. (LHO) , according to the company’s website. The
ship was destined for  Saudi Arabia  and had docked at Piraeus for
an insurance inspection. It can’t sail until it has had a safety
inspection, the state-run Athens News Agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
