  In accordance with annual practices, historical data have been
revised in tables 1 through 6 of this news release.  Regional Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  The West continued to record the highest regional unemployment
rate in January, 9.6 percent, while the Midwest again reported
the lowest rate, 7.7 percent. The Midwest, South, and West
experienced statistically significant over-the-month
unemployment rate changes (-0.2 percentage point each). The same
three regions also registered measurable over-the-year rate
decreases--the West (-1.1 percentage points), Midwest (-0.9
point), and South (-0.8 point).  Among the nine geographic divisions, the Pacific continued to
report the highest jobless rate, 10.2 percent in January. The
West North Central again registered the lowest rate, 5.9 percent.
Six divisions experienced statistically significant unemployment
rate declines over the month. The largest of these occurred in
the East South Central and South Atlantic (-0.3 percentage point
each). All of the divisions experienced unemployment rate
declines from a year earlier, eight of which were statistically

South Central and Pacific (-1.2 percentage points each).  State Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Nevada continued to record the highest unemployment rate among
the states, 12.7 percent in January.  California  and Rhode Island

states and the District of Columbia had measurably higher rates,
and 18 states had rates that were not appreciably different from
that of the nation.  Fourteen states experienced statistically significant over-the-
month unemployment rate declines in January. The largest of
these were in Mississippi and Missouri (-0.5 percentage point
each). The remaining 36 states and the District of Columbia
recorded jobless rates that were not measurably different from
those of a month earlier, though some had changes that were at
least as large numerically as the significant changes.  Michigan  registered the largest jobless rate decrease from
January 2011 (-1.9 percentage points), followed by Utah (-1.8
points). Twenty additional states reported smaller but also
statistically significant decreases over the year. The remaining
28 states and the District of Columbia recorded unemployment
rates in January 2012 that were not appreciably different from
those of a year earlier.  Nonfarm Payroll Employment (Seasonally Adjusted)  In January, 24 states and the District of Columbia recorded
