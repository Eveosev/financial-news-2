Japanese  shares  pared gains after
the  Bank of Japan  decided against expanding its asset-purchase
program, and the yen rose against the dollar. Stocks climbed
earlier as euro-area finance chiefs gathered to sign off on a
Greek bailout.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that generates 31 percent of its
revenue in  Europe , slid 0.7 percent after gaining as much as 1.1
percent earlier.  Tokyu Land Corp. (8815)  paced gains among real estate
companies after Credit Suisse Group AG raised the stock’s target
price. Chemical maker  Asahi Kasei Corp. (3407)  fell 5.4 percent after
agreeing to buy U.S.-based Zoll Medical Corp. for $2.2 billion.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.1 percent to 9,899.08
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo after earlier advancing
as much as 1.2 percent. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index was little
changed at 845.33. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index (MXAPJ) 
gained 1.4 percent.  “Details don’t matter, what matters is whether they
boosted the asset-purchase fund” in terms of the BOJ decision,
said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee the equivalent of $23
billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “Investors are shrugging off the announcement.”  Stocks pared gains after the Bank of  Japan  left its asset-
purchase fund at 30 trillion yen ($365 billion) and a credit-
loan program at 35 trillion yen. The central bank on Feb. 14
surprised the market by increasing the asset-purchase fund with
more government bond purchases and setting an inflation goal of
1 percent, weakening the yen and boosting stocks.  BOJ Programs  Separately, the BOJ today introduced a 1 trillion yen
program for loans denominated in U.S. dollars and is adding 500
billion yen to its 3 trillion yen venture-capital style
investment fund. The  Federal Reserve  is also wrapping up its
policy meeting later today.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.4 percent
today. The gauge was little changed in  New York  yesterday amid
low-volume trading as investors weighed the Chinese slowdown.
Euro-area finance ministers are gathering in Brussels to sign
off on a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) bailout package for
Greece.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said he had
“no doubt” that the Greek package would be approved and he
expected a final decision on March 14.  Yen Climbs  The yen rose 0.1 percent to 82.18 against the dollar after
reaching a 10-month low last week. Japan’s currency was little
changed at 108.21 against the euro after falling as much as 0.4
percent earlier. A stronger yen damps the value of earnings
abroad when repatriated.  Canon lost 0.7 percent to 3,680 yen.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a
manufacturer of game consoles that gets a third of its sales in
Europe, dropped 0.6 percent to 11,470 yen, reversing a 1.8
percent advance earlier.  Real estate companies gained  the most  among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after Credit Suisse raised Tokyo Land’s target
price to 480 yen from 420 yen and maintained its “outperform”
rating, citing improved profitability. Stocks also rose after
Nomura Holdings Inc. noted a recovery in investor sentiment for
real estate funds.  Tokyu Land  gained 2.2 percent to 413 yen, while  Tosei Corp. (8923) 
advanced 5 percent to 32,800 yen.  The  Topix (TPX)  gained 10 percent since bottoming in March last
year, when a record earthquake and tsunami struck Japan’s
northeast and caused a nuclear disaster. Global monetary easing
and reconstruction demand helped boost the value of shares on
the index to 1.24 times book value, up from 1.12 in March 2011.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 0.1 percent to 22.96,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
Nikkei was 25 percent above its 30-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Auto-parts makers: Koito Manufacturing Co. was among four
suppliers of headlights that said they’re being investigated for
price fixing by Japan’s Fair Trade Commission. The probe was
first reported by  Kyodo News  and the Nikkei newspaper.  Koito slumped 6.9 percent to 1,341 yen.  Mitsuba Corp. (7280)  slid
6.3 percent to 770 yen. Stanley Electric Co. dropped 8.9 percent
to 1,271 yen, while Ichikoh Industries Ltd. fell 4.2 percent to
158 yen.  Asahi Kasei Corp. (3407 JT), a Japanese maker of synthetic
fibers and industrial chemicals, slid 5.4 percent to 490 yen.
The stock fell after the company said it will buy U.S.-based
Zoll Medical Corp. for $2.2 billion to expand in critical-care
products for hospitals and grow sales in  Asia .  Asahi Kasei will pay a 24 percent premium from the March 9
closing price to buy out the maker of devices used to revive
patients whose hearts have stopped, according to a statement.  Sanwa Holdings Corp. (5929)  (5929 JT), a maker of doors and
windows, rose 2 percent to 306 yen. The company’s investment
rating was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” by SMBC
Nikko Securities Inc. The 12-month price target is 350 yen per
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
