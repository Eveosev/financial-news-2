Indian stocks gained for the third
day after finance ministers in the Euro area, the country’s
biggest trading partner, signed off on a $171 billion Greek
bailout, and on speculation the government will deliver a budget
aimed at spurring growth.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the nation’s largest company,
climbed to a two-week high.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) ,
the biggest copper and zinc producer, soared 4.8 percent, pacing
gains among its peers.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second-biggest software
maker that gets more than 95 percent of their sales from abroad,
climbed for the first time in three days.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 1.3 percent
to 17,813.62 at close. The gauge has increased 15 percent this
year as foreign funds poured $8 billion into shares on optimism
the central bank will ease monetary policy as inflation eased.
Emerging-market stock funds took in $907 million in the week
ended March 7, the 10th week of flows, according to EPFR Global.  “Liquidity is king and we have seen liquidity injections
all over the world,” Jyoti Vaswani, chief investment officer at
Aviva Life Insurance Co., told Bloomberg UTV today. “If
liquidity injections continue in the developed world, you could
see that drive Indian markets.”  Greece ’s rescue package caps months of talks between the
nation, the IMF and euro-area authorities over a follow-up to
the first bailout that failed to halt the region’s debt crisis.
India’s government presents its annual budget on March 16, a day
after the  Reserve Bank  of India reviews  interest rates . The RBI
unexpectedly cut the reserve ratio for banks on March 9 to ease
a cash shortage.  ‘Spur Growth’  Foreign flows “have driven the markets to the level we
have seen,” Aviva’s Vaswani said. “From here on fundamentals
take over. The intent of the government on focusing on economic
growth is going to the key driver. We will wait to see what
steps the government takes to spur growth in the economy.”  Factory production in January jumped 6.8 percent, after a
revised 2.5 percent increase in December, the government said
yesterday, beating all 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
A faster-than-estimated gain signals production is withstanding
the impact of higher borrowing costs on domestic demand and the
fallout for exports from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Still,  inflation  accelerated to 6.7 percent in February,
from 6.55 percent the previous month, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of 24 analysts. That will be the first gain since
September and may prompt the central bank to hold rates after
raising them a record 13 times between March 2010 and October
last year to cool price increases.  Rate Outlook  Twelve of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the
RBI may leave its benchmark rate unchanged at 8.5 percent. Two
forecast a 25 basis-point cut to 8.25 percent.  Reliance, owner of the world’s largest refining complex,
rose 2.7 percent to 819.95 rupees, its highest close since Feb.
29.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker, added 2.3
percent to 1,368.25 rupees. Infosys rose 1.5 percent to 2,859.8
rupees, ending a two-day 2.2 percent slide.  Sterlite surged 4.8 percent to 120.3 rupees.  Hindalco
Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum maker that controls U.S.-based
Novelis Inc., increased 2.9 percent to 141.45 rupees.  Steel Authority of India Ltd. , the second-largest producer
of the alloy, jumped 4.8 percent to 101 rupees after raising
prices of some products this month and on speculation coking
coal costs will fall starting April.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the
biggest producer, gained 2.6 percent to 468.1 rupees.  Jindal
Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  soared 3.7 percent to 611 rupees, extending
its three-day gain to 14 percent.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India added 1.3 percent to 5,429.50. India  VIX (INVIXN) , which measures
the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty, lost 5.8
percent to 24.75, its lowest level since Feb. 23. The  BSE 200
Index (BSE200)  increased 1.3 percent to 2,211.70.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  13.9 billion rupees  ($278
million) of Indian stocks yesterday, raising their investment
this year to 395.7 billion rupees, according to the regulator.  The Sensex trades at 15.6 times future  earnings , compared
with 19.4 times at the end of 2010. The  MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) 
Index trades at 10.8 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
