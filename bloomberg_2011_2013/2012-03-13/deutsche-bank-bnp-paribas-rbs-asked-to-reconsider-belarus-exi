Belarus wants to lure back  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ,  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland  after the
lenders halted work in the former Soviet republic as western
governments tightened economic sanctions.  “We hope their decision will be revised,” Deputy Foreign
Minister Aleksandr Guryanov told reporters today in the capital,
Minsk. Belarus wasn’t hurt because it retained access to other
financial institutions, he said.  Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and RBS suspended activities in
Belarus last year. Together with  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , they managed the
country’s Eurobond sales in 2010 and early last year. Sberbank,
 Russia ’s biggest lender, continues to operate in Belarus.  The EU last month added 21 officials to a list of more than
200 people it holds responsible for political repression in
 Belarus , freezing their assets and banning them from entering
the trading bloc. The eastern European nation responded by
pulling back diplomats from Brussels and Warsaw in its worst
diplomatic crisis since 2008, when the U.S. envoy was expelled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
