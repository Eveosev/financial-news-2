A spokesman for the North Korean
Foreign Ministry condemned  South Korea ’s move to prevent
defectors from the country in China from being repatriated to
 North Korea , the country’s state-run Korean Central News Agency
said today.  The ministry denied the people in question are
“defectors” and accused South Korea of abducting its citizens
who were either traveling or on business in China, the KCNA
reported, citing the spokesman. The North Korean ministry was
responding to challenges made by a South Korean delegation at a
United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva about human rights
in North Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
