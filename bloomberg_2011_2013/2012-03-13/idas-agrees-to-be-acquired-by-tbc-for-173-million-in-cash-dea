Midas Inc. (MDS) , the operator of its
namesake and SpeeDee automotive service centers, agreed to be
acquired by tire supplier TBC Corp. for about $173 million,
joining a group that includes the Tire Kingdom chain.  The cash offer of $11.50 a share is 28 percent higher than
Midas’s closing price yesterday and 75 percent higher than its
closing price on Aug. 11, when Midas announced it was exploring
options such as a possible sale. The transaction includes the
assumption of $137 million in debt and pension liabilities, the
companies said today in a statement.  The purchase gives closely held TBC a chain with more than
2,250 franchised, licensed and company-owned Midas shops in 14
countries. The deal has been approved by both boards, the
companies said.  In January, Midas rival Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe & Jack,
agreed to go private in an acquisition by the Gores Group LLC
valued at about $791 million. That deal was the largest in the
auto-parts retailing sector since 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  TBC, based in  Palm Beach Gardens , Florida, is owned by
Japan’s  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  TBC’s retail group operates more than
1,200 franchised and company-owned tire and automotive service
centers under brands such as Tire Kingdom and Merchant’s Tire &
Auto Centers.  Midas, based in Itasca,  Illinois ,  jumped  27 percent to
$11.44 at 7:50 a.m. in  New York . The shares had gained 4.7
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
