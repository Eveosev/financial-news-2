Hugo Boss AG (BOS) , the German luxury
clothing maker, said it will convert its preferred  shares  into
ordinary ones and raise its dividend by 43 percent.  Hugo Boss , controlled by buyout firm Permira Advisers, will
propose the mandatory conversion of all preferred shares into
ordinary ones at its shareholders meeting May 3, the Metzingen,
Germany-based company said in a  statement  today, with holders of
one preferred share receiving one ordinary share. The company
also plans to convert all existing bearer shares into registered
shares.  The move is aimed at increasing liquidity in the shares and
raising the weight in the  MDAX (MDAX)  benchmark index for medium-sized
companies, Boss said.  “Liquidity will increase with the conversion, which makes
it easier for the majority shareholder to do a placement,” said
Thomas Effler, an analyst at WestLB AG in  Frankfurt .  Boss will pay holders of ordinary shares a dividend of 2.88
euros for 2011, and holders of preferred shares will receive
2.89 euros per share, meaning the company pays out 70 percent of
net income attributable to shareholders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
