DIC Asset AG (DAZ)  climbed the most in
three weeks in Frankfurt trading after the German property
company forecast higher funds from operations for 2012 as
acquisitions add to rental income.  DIC  gained  as much as 6.5 percent to 7.02 euros, the
biggest intraday jump since Feb. 20, and was trading up
4 percent at 11:04 a.m. FFO, a measure of a company’s ability to
generate cash, will be within a range of 43 million euros ($57
million) to 45 million euros, Frankfurt-based DIC said in a
 statement  today. That’s up from 40.6 million euros in 2011.  The company, which manages real-estate assets of about 3.3
billion euros, plans to invest at least 200 million in
properties this year, DIC said. That will help gross rental
income to rise to as much as 126 million euros from 116.7
million euros, it said.  Net income dropped to 10.6 million euros last year from
16.5 million euros in 2010, DIC said. The company plans to pay
an unchanged  dividend  of 35 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
