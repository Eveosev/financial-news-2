The  Hong Kong  Monetary Authority
will start a pilot platform with Bank Negara  Malaysia  and
Euroclear Bank SA to spur trading of sukuk and Dim Sum bonds as
the city aims to become  China ’s hub for Islamic finance and
offshore yuan transactions.  The platform, which will start on March 30, will allow
investors in Malaysia to buy yuan-denominated bonds in Hong
Kong, Esmond Lee,  executive director  for financial
infrastructure of the city’s de-facto central bank, told
reporters today. Hong Kong investors would gain access to
sukuks, or bonds that comply with Islam’s ban on paying
interest, Lee said.  The pilot platform will also allow financial institutions
to get secured borrowing in Hong Kong dollars or yuan by
pledging securities they hold with Euroclear Bank, Peter Pang,
deputy chief executive of the HKMA, said at the same press
conference.  “The global financial crisis has reminded us of the
destructive powers of a liquidity crunch and the need for quick
access to local currency liquidity in times of stress,” Pang
said. “The cross-border and cross-currency collateral
management service provided by the pilot platform is a timely
solution to meet this market need.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
