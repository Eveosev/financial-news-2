NFI Empik Media & Fashion SA (EMF) ,
Poland’s largest books and music retailer, jumped the most in
almost a month after Penta Investments Ltd. and Eastbridge Group
attempted to buy the company.  The stock rose 4.8 percent to 9.8 zloty, the most since
Feb. 17, as of 9:29 a.m. in Warsaw.  Eastbridge, which owns 60 percent of Empik, and Penta have
offered to pay 9.85 zloty a share for the remaining 40 percent
stake. The companies plan to withdraw Empik from trading on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange , they said in joint a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
