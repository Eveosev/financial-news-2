The euro should be dropped and
European countries should go back to their former currencies, 45
percent of Germans, who use the euro, and 71 percent of British,
who donâ€™t, said in a BVA survey.  Of the Italians questioned, 42 percent favored returning to
the lira, while 39 percent of Spaniards polled want to give up
the common currency. The French were most in favor of keeping
it, with 75 percent opposed to a return to the franc and 18
percent in favor, according to the survey for 20 Minutes, a free
French newspaper, by the Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based
polling firm.  On average, 32 percent of those surveyed in the five
countries said the euro would go when asked what they really
think will happen in coming years. British were most likely to
see it happening, with 63 percent saying it certainly or
probably will occur, according to the poll.  Thirty-three percent of Italians queried said they expected
it, as well as 27 percent of Germans and 21 percent of Spanish.
The French were the least likely to see the currency being
dropped, with 3 percent saying certainly and 13 percent
probably.  The survey was conducted among 4,217 people in the five
countries between Feb. 20 and Feb. 29 by Internet. No margin of
error was reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
