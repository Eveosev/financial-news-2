Customs workers in  Kuwait  are
striking for the second time since October, disrupting
operations at ports, border crossings and the airport, a customs
union official said.  About 3,600 employees stopped work earlier today and
“won’t step down until the prime minister himself intervenes to
meet our demands,” Fahaad Al-Ajmi, a union board member, said
by phone from the northwestern Salmi border point. The action is
over pay and benefits.  Kuwait is the fourth-largest producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and pumped 2.67 million barrels
a day in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Customs officials went on strike for two days in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
