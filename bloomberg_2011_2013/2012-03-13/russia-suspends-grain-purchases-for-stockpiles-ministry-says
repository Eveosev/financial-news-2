Russia suspended grain purchases
for state stockpiles, Dmitry Bobkov, director of the agriculture
ministry’s department on state policy and information, said.  “The purchases are suspended because demand for grain is
very small and prices stabilized on domestic market,” Bobkov
said by phone from Moscow. Russia may sell grain from stockpiles
at the end of March or early April, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
