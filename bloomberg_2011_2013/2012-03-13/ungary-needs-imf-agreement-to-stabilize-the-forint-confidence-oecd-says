Hungary  needs to reach an agreement
with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union on
financial aid as such a deal is “a necessary first step” to
stabilize the forint and restore market confidence, an executive
at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
said.  Hungary, which faces an economic contraction of 0.6 percent
this year, needs “credible and predictable short-term domestic
policies,” Andrew Dean, director at the OECD said at a press
conference in Budapest today.  The government relies “too much on one-off fiscal
measures, Dean said, adding that teh Cabinet should focus on
cutting expenditures and consider property and environmental
taxes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
