The U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  said unfair mortgage contracts and funds traded on
exchanges are among the products posing the biggest risk for
retail financial consumers.  The FSA said it found “some evidence of poor practice in
U.K.-authorized firms” that sell exchange-traded products, the
regulator said in a report on the retail finance industry
published today. The supervisor also said that some lenders sold
mortgages that “resulted in detriment for consumers.”  “It is clear that the financial services industry -- firms
and regulator -- have a lot of work to do,” Martin Wheatley,
the agency’s managing director for conduct, said in an e-mailed
statement. “Our analysis means we can focus our work on the
most significant risks facing consumers.”  The FSA will be disbanded next year as part of the
government’s plans to hand responsibility for banking
supervision to the  Bank of England . Oversight of trading and
consumer rules will be taken over by the Financial Conduct
Authority.  Consumer confidence  in retail financial products “remains
low,” because of declining real income and low  interest rates ,
the FSA said.  The regulator also said that “early signals suggest that
greater repayment difficulties in the mortgage markets could
materialize again in 2012.”  The total value of outstanding  mortgage loans  in the U.K.
at the end of 2011 was 1.218 trillion pounds ($1.9 trillion), an
increase of less than 0.1 percent from the prior quarter, the
FSA said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
