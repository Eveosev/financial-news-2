Porsche SE (PAH3) ’s carmaking unit, which
is 49.9 percent-owned by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said profit jumped 22
percent last year as deliveries of the Cayenne sport-utility
vehicle surged.  Earnings before interest and taxes rose to 2.05 billion
euros ($2.69 billion) from 1.67 billion euros a year earlier,
the Stuttgart, Germany-based  manufacturer  said today in a
statement. Sales rose 18 percent to 10.9 billion euros.  “The Cayenne is driving the healthy profit,”  Frank Schwope , a Hanover, Germany-based analyst at Norddeutsche
Landesbank who recommends buying Porsche shares, said by
telephone. “The bigger and more expensive the car, the higher
the margins.”  Backed by  Volkswagen (VOW3) , Porsche aims to deliver 200,000
vehicles by 2018, almost double 2010 sales, as it adds models
and expands in  emerging markets . The carmaker plans to increase
sales to a record 140,000 autos in 2012, a person with knowledge
of the matter said Oct. 13, from the 116,978 sold last year.
Demand for overhauled versions of the Boxster, which Porsche
showed at the Geneva car show, and the 911 sports car may
insulate the company from economic slowdowns.  Delivery Growth  Sales of the Cayenne, which starts at 57,930 euros, rose 49
percent to 59,873 vehicles last year, while deliveries of the
Panamera four-door coupe increased 20 percent to 28,218 cars.
The two models helped Porsche post a profit margin of 19 percent
of revenue.  Porsche SE  rose  as much as 0.7 percent to 48.63 euros and
was trading up 0.5 percent at 1:29 p.m. in Frankfurt. The stock
has gained 17 percent this year, valuing the company at 14.9
billion euros.  The company sold part of the carmaking business to
Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen (VOW3)  as part of a 2009 deal to
merge the two manufacturers after Porsche’s attempt to take over
the larger carmaker failed. The combination has been delayed by
lawsuits in the U.S. and  Germany . The Porsche holding company,
which owns a majority of VW’s common shares, will report annual
results March 15.  Volkswagen,  Europe ’s largest automaker, said Feb. 24 that
operating profit surged 58 percent in 2011 to 11.3 billion euros
on demand for VW and Audi sport-utility vehicles. The carmaker’s
net income, which more than doubled to 15.4 billion euros, was
lifted by gains from revaluing options it holds to buy the
remainder of Porsche’s carmaking business.  Model Plans  Porsche’s model lineup will be expanded to include the
Macan compact SUV in 2014. The company plans that year to add a
limited series of the 918 Spyder hybrid, a 500-horsepower
vehicle with a V8 engine and electric motors that has a top
speed of 320 kilometers per hour (200 miles per hour).  The reinvigoration of the model palette means that  Porsche (PAH3) ,
whose founder Ferdinand Porsche also helped design the original
Volkswagen Beetle, will probably exceed its 2018 delivery
target, according to analyst Schwope.  “I expect them to sell more than 200,000 units in 2018,”
Schwope said. “The smaller cars that are coming aren’t as
profitable, but they will increase sales numbers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
