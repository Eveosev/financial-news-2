Ballymore Group Ltd. won approval
for a plan to turn a factory site and adjoining land in  London ’s
former docklands into 3,385 homes.  Newham Council gave the development preliminary permission,
Ballymore director Paul Keogh said in an e-mail today. London
Mayor  Boris Johnson  hasn’t approved the project yet.  The site, which used to be occupied by a unit of Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, will be also be turned into shops, restaurants,
bars and as much as 5,000 square meters (53,820 square feet) of
office space. The 41-acre (17-hectare) site is known as Minoco
Wharf and is about a mile from London City Airport.  The development presents a “one-off opportunity to
transform this underused Thames side site into a new mixed-use
community,” according to a  filing  submitted on behalf of
Ballymore at the time of the planning application. “This, in
turn, can act as a catalyst for the development of adjoining
sites.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
