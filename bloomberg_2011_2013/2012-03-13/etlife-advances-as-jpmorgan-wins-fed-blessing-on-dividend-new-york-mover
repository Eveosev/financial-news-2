MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, would fall short of a U.S. capital standard in a severe
economic downturn, the  Federal Reserve  said. The stock declined
in extended trading.  The total risk-based capital ratio at the New York-based
insurer would be 6 percent, compared with the minimum acceptable
level of 8 percent, the Fed said today as part of a review of
how companies would withstand a “stress scenario.”  MetLife is one of four companies to fail the Fed’s
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which was applied to
19 of the largest U.S. financial firms. The insurer, which is
overseen by the Fed because of its banking operations, was
prevented by the regulator last year from increasing its annual
dividend.  “We are deeply disappointed,” Chief Executive Officer
 Steven Kandarian  said in a statement today. “We do not believe
that the bank-centric methodologies used under the CCAR are
appropriate for insurance companies, which operate under a
different business model than banks.”  The insurer had requested approval for $2 billion in share
repurchases and an increase of its dividend to $1.10 a share
from 74 cents, according to the statement. Kandarian is winding
down banking operations and said he expects the company to have
as much as $7 billion of excess capital by the end of this year.
He said he remains “fully committed” to returning funds to
shareholders.  The insurer slipped 3 percent to $38.28 at 4:57 p.m. in
extended trading in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
