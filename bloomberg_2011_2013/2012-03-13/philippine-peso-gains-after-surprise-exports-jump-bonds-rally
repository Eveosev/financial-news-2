The Philippine peso rose, snapping
a two-day loss, as data showed exports unexpectedly climbed in
January. Bonds advanced.  Overseas sales increased 3 percent from a year earlier, the
first gain since April, the  National Statistics Office  said in
 Manila  today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for an 18.5 percent drop. The data supports the
central bank’s view that shipments abroad will recover, Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said.  “The export data is a positive sign and augurs well for a
stronger peso,” said Lito Mercado, head of trading at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila. “From here, exports will
probably stabilize.”  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 42.56 per dollar as of
11:30 a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency will probably advance “closer” to 42 by the end of
the first half as overseas remittances usually increase in April
and May, Mercado said.  The yield on the 8 percent peso bond due July 2031 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.66 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The Bureau of the
Treasury will auction 9 billion pesos ($211 million) of 10-year
securities at 1 p.m.  “Liquidity remains supportive of bonds,” Mercado said.  Exports and remittances account for more than 40 percent of
the  Philippines ’ gross domestic product. Economic growth this
year may exceed 7 percent, Trade Secretary Gregory Domingo said
on March 6. GDP increased 3.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
