Russia ’s Economy Ministry proposed
requiring cinemas to show Russian movies to support the domestic
 film industry ,  Kommersant  said, citing a letter from Deputy
Minister Stanislav Voskresensky.  The government may rule that as much as 24 percent of
screen time at cinemas be devoted to Russian movies, Kommersant
said, citing Voskresensky’s letter to the Culture Ministry.
Russia will also discuss limiting annual imports of foreign
films, similar to India or China, the newspaper said.  Box office sales in Russia and the other members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, except Ukraine, amounted to
$1.2 billion last year, of which Russian movies accounted for 16
percent, or about $193 million, the newspaper said.  Quotas would hurt profit without improving the quality of
Russian movies, Kommersant said, citing Sergei Kitin, general
director of movie theater chain Cinema Park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
