Portugal said it will meet pledges
to overhaul the countryâ€™s energy business after Henrique Gomes

program, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.
Artur da Trindade has been proposed by the government to replace
Gomes, the office of the presidency said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
