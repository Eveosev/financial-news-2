Germany ’s Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau, also known as KfW, will contribute 60 percent, or
around 700 million euros ($921 million), of the financing to
construct  Public Power Corp. SA’s (PPC)  new Ptolemaida V power unit,
 Kathimerini  reported, without citing anyone.  The financing for the 660 megawatt project, budgeted at 1.3
billion euros, will be provided to the venture responsible for
building the plant that is led by Terna SA with Hitachi Power
Europe GmbH,  Hitachi Ltd (6501)  and Hamon Environmental Gmbh as
subcontractors, the Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
