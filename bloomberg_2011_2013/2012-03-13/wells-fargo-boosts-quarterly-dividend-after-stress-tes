Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, increased its quarterly dividend by 83 percent
following the  Federal Reserve ’s test of how the bank would fare
in an economic decline.  The dividend will rise to 22 cents a share from 12 cents,
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said today in a statement. The
Fed didn’t object to the bank’s capital plan, Wells Fargo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
