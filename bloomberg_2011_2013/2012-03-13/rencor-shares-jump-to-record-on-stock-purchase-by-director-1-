Trencor Ltd. (TRE)  advanced to a record
after a director bought almost 1 million rand ($133,800) of the
company’s stock.  Shares in the  investment company  gained as much as 8
percent, the biggest jump since August, and closed 4.4 percent
higher at 42.30 rand in Johannesburg, the highest since at least
1990 when Bloomberg started compiling data.  Non-executive director Herman Wessels bought 25,000 shares
on Mar. 9, the company said in a statement to Johannesburg’s
stock exchange yesterday.  Recent “good results and some of the directors buying into
their own company is supporting the share price,” Hennie
Fourie, a portfolio manager at PSG Konsult, said by telephone
from  Pretoria . “Buyers are lining up and that is boosting the
shares.”  Earnings per share for the year through December rose 67
percent to 554.3 cents, the company said Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
