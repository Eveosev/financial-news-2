The Serbian central bank sold 10
million euros ($13.09 million) today to boost the weakening
dinar.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it was  acting
against the dinar volatility, not its trend, according to a
statement posted on its  website .  The central bank began selling the common currency after
the dinar dropped to as low as 111.4140 to the euro. The central
bank said it set the dinar rate for tomorrow at 111.0286 to the
euro.  The National Bank of  Serbia  has spent 248.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, which some
analysts see declining by 10 percent in 2012 as capital inflows
dry. The dinar has lost 5.2 percent since early February and 7.4
percent on year, the seventh-worst performer of 176 currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
