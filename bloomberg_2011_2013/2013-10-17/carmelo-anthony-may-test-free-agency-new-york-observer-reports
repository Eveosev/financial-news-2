Carmelo Anthony  may opt out of the
final year of his contract to test free agency after the
2013-2014 National Basketball Association season, the  New York
Knicks  forward told the New York Observer.  “I want to be a free agent,” Anthony told the Observer
this week in an interview. “Everybody in the NBA dreams to be a
free agent at least one time in their career.”  Anthony, 29, has two years remaining on a $67.2 million
contract extension he signed when he joined the Knicks in
February 2011, according to Baseball Reference.com. He can opt
out of the final year of the deal, worth $23.3 million, ESPN
reported. Anthony will make his decision at the end of the
season, the Observer said.  Anthony, a six-time All-Star, led the Knicks with 28.7
points per game as they won the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic
Division title last season. He also was the team’s leading
scorer in the postseason, when New York eliminated the  Boston
Celtics  for its first playoff series win since 2000.  The Knicks begin the regular season Oct. 30 at home against
the  Milwaukee Bucks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
