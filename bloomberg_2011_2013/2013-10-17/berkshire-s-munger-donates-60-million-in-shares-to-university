Charles Munger, vice chairman at
 Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , donated shares worth
more than $60 million to the University of Michigan, 
fulfilling a previously announced pledge.  Munger, 89, gave 350 Berkshire Class A shares to the

fellowships and a graduate-student residence.  “These gifts were made pursuant to a previously announced
