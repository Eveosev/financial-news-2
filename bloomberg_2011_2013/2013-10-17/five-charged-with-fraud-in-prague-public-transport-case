Czech police charged five people for
alleged fraud in the procurement of tickets for  Prague ’s public
transportation company, prosecutors said.  The charges against the five unnamed people include
collusion and mismanagement in finding a ticket supplier for the
Czech capital’s metro, tram, and bus systems, prosecutor Adam
Borgula said in a statement published on the website of Prague’s
High Prosecutors’ Office.  The case comes amid rising voter anger over corruption that
may reshape the Czech political landscape in Oct. 25-26 snap
elections. The ballot was called after the government of ex-Prime Minister Petr Necas, which had been credited for trying to
clean up public spending, collapsed in June in an alleged
bribery and illegal spying scandal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
