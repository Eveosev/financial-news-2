Stocks in Switzerland  advanced as
Nestle SA reported higher sales and the  U.S. Congress  voted to
end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, gained 2.3
percent after reporting an increase in nine-month revenue.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  climbed 0.4 percent to 8,014.68 at
9:46 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge has fallen 0.1 percent so far
this month, paring its 2013 gain to 17 percent. The broader
Swiss Performance Index gained 0.4 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 39 percent higher than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., President  Barack Obama  signed into law a
measure to extend the nation’s borrowing authority into early
2014. The measure puts government workers back on the job as
soon as today and permits the U.S. to continue paying its debts,
benefits and salaries.  The passage last night by wide margins -- an 81-18 vote in
the Democratic-led Senate, followed by a 285-144 vote in the
Republican-controlled House -- allows the U.S. to avoid default
and ends the shutdown that began Oct. 1 and has taken $24
billion out of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
