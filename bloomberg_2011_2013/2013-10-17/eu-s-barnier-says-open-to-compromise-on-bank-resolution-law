Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial-services chief, said he’s open to compromise on plans
for winding down stricken euro-area banks, in a bid to overcome
German-led attacks on the proposal.  “What matters is that the system chosen functions
effectively and will be workable,” Barnier told reporters today
in  London .  Areas open for discussion include the role the European
Commission should play in the system, safeguards for non-euro
nations that choose to participate and guarantees that
governments won’t be railroaded into decisions that affect their
public finances, Barnier said.  The Single Resolution Mechanism proposal is part of a euro-area effort to break the financial links between sovereigns and
banks by centralizing oversight and crisis management of failing
lenders. The blueprint, presented in July, has met with a
barrage of complaints from governments, though most agree that a
deal should be reached on a version of the blueprint by the end
of this year.  An accord between governments by year-end is “difficult
and possible,” Barnier said.  While changes can be made to the proposals, the scope of
the system shouldn’t be limited to only the biggest lenders,
Barnier said.  “The cases in which resolution may be necessary are not
necessarily the biggest banks. If, for example, you were just to
deal with big cross-border banks, you wouldn’t have necessarily
included in your scope Dexia or Bankia,” he said, in reference
to two  bank failures  in the bloc since the eruption of the
financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
