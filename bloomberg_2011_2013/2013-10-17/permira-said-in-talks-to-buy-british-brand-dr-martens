Permira Advisers LLP, the London-based private-equity firm that owns clothing brand  Hugo Boss , is
in advanced talks to buy iconic British punk-boot maker Dr.
Martens, said a person with knowledge of the negotiations.  The buyout firm may pay about 300 million pounds ($485
million) to family-owned R. Griggs Group, which holds 91.5
percent, in a deal that would include the license to use the Dr.
Martens brand, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private. An agreement could be reached as
early as next month, the person said.  The acquisition would fit Permira’s strategy of buying
well-known retail brands, including Hugo Boss and New Look. Dr.
Martens boots, known for their thick, air-cushioned sole, gained
popularity in the 1960s and ultimately spread to punk-music fans
and rock stars including The Who’s  Pete Townshend .  The talks were reported earlier by  Sky News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
