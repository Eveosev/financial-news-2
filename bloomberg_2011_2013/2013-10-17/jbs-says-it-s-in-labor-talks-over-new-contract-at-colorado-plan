JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said it’s in talks with a union to establish a new
labor contract at its Greeley plant in  Colorado .  JBS agreed to a one-month extension to the previous
contract earlier in October, the Sao Paulo-based company said
today in an e-mail. That contract can be extended again on a
day-by-day basis while the negotiations with the United Food &
Commercial Workers Union continue, JBS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
