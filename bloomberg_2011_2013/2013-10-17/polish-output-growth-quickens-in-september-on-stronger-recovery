Polish  industrial output  grew faster
last month in a sign that the recovery in the European Union’s
largest economy is gathering pace.  Production rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier in
September, accelerated from 2.2 percent the previous month and
the second-fastest increase since January 2012, the  Central
Statistical Office  in Warsaw said today. The output gain was
below than the 7 percent median estimate in a  Bloomberg survey 
of 33 economists. Output jumped 9.6 percent from August.  Growth in the $490 billion economy accelerated to 0.8
percent from a year earlier in the second quarter as the euro
area, the destination for 51 percent of Polish exports, emerged
from its longest recession on record. Manufacturing expanded the
most in more than two years last month, HSBC Holdings Plc. said
Oct. 1, citing a survey of  purchasing managers .  “Higher output was supported by an extra working day”
last month,  Rafal Benecki , chief economist for  Poland  at ING
Groep NV, said by e-mail before the data were released. “Still,
even without this, there are clear signs of improvement.”  The zloty traded at 4.1744 per euro at 2:14 p.m. in Warsaw,
little changed from before the release and 0.2 percent weaker
than yesterday. The yield on two-year government zloty debt rose
one basis point to 2.95 percent.  In a separate report, the office said producer prices
dropped 1.4 percent from a year earlier in September, matching
the median estimate of 27 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.
Prices rose 0.2 percent from August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
