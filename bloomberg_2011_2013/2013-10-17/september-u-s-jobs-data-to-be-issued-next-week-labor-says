The September U.S. jobs report,
originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 4, will be issued on
Oct. 22, the Labor Department said today.  The report was delayed by the 16-day partial federal
shutdown that ended today.  The October employment data will come out on Nov. 8, rather
than Nov. 1, the Labor Department also said. The report on
consumer prices for September will be issued on Oct. 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
