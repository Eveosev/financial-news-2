Ibovespa  futures  fell, after the
equity benchmark rose for a sixth straight session yesterday, as
lower commodities prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian raw-material exporters.  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA and  Usinas Siderurgicas de
Minas Gerais SA  may move after both steelmakers were rated sell
in new coverage at UBS AG. Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo
Pao de Acucar,  Brazil ’s biggest food retailer, may be active
after posting earnings that beating analysts’ estimates.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December fell 0.7
percent to 54,480 at 9:19 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real
strengthened 0.6 percent to 2.1680 per dollar. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials declined 0.3 percent as
metals and crude dropped.  Brazil’s main equity index rose yesterday to the highest
since May after better-than-forecast earnings from car-rental
company  Localiza Rent a Car SA  spurred optimism on the outlook
for corporate profits.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 13 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 2.1 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday was 14.7
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.57 billion
reais this year through Oct. 15, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
