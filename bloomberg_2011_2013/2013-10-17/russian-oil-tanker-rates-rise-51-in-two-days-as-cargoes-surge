The cost of shipping Russian oil to
northwest Europe had the biggest two-day jump since April as
traders accelerated bookings of tankers to load at the end of
this month, curbing the number available for charter.  Rates for Aframaxes shipping 100,000 metric tons to
Wilhelmshaven in  Germany  from Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  climbed
51 percent to 113 Worldscale points, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , a London-based publisher of freight prices on more
than 50 trade routes. That equals daily earnings of $47,168,
almost three times what the ships made on Oct. 15.  Traders provisionally booked nine of the vessels to load in
the month’s last five days, Timothy Clark, a shipbroker at
Riverlake Group in Geneva, said by phone today. The rate of
charters was higher than normal, he said. Shipments from the
Russian port, the nation’s largest export facility for crude,
jumped 25 percent last month and another 9.7 percent in October,
according to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg.  “This week, everybody decided to climb in and fix,” Clark
said, adding that some tankers may have been booked to take fuel
out of  Europe  on long-distance deliveries, thereby limiting
vessel supply.  Shipments of oil on Aframaxes from the Baltic will rise 5
percent to about 1.7 million barrels a day this year, estimates
Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker. The trade route is
the second-biggest for the vessels, each able to hold about
650,000 barrels of cargo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
