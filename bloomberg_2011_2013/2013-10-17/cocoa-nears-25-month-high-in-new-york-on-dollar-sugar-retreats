Cocoa reached the highest price in
almost 25 months on signs of rising demand from bean processors
in  Asia  and  North America .  Orange juice , coffee and sugar slid,
while cotton advanced.  The Cocoa Association of Asia said today that grindings
rose 12 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Figures scheduled for release today from the Washington-based
 National Confectioners Association  may show North American
processing gained 5.1 percent in the period, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  “The exceptionally strong Asian grind numbers in concert
with the expectation of seeing strong North American grind
numbers are highly supportive” for prices, Sterling Smith, a
futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in Chicago, said in an e-mail.  Cocoa for delivery in December rose 0.7 percent to settle
at $2,767 a metric ton at 12:02 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , after reaching $2,776, the highest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 19, 2011. Prices have increased 28 percent
since the end of June.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery tumbled 3.9
percent to $1.1935 a pound in New York, after touching $1.189,
the lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 31.  In the four weeks ended Sept. 28, U.S. retail sales of
orange juice fell 3.9 percent from a year earlier, the Florida
Department of Citrus said Oct. 14, citing data from Nielsen Co.  “The Nielsen data released at the beginning of the week
highlighted the poor demand,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president
for Price Futures Group in Chicago, wrote in a report.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery declined 1
percent to $1.147 a pound. Raw-sugar futures for March delivery
fell less than 0.1 percent to 19 cents a pound in New York.  Cotton futures for December delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
83.82 cents a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
