BB&T Corp. (BBT) ,  North Carolina ’s second-biggest bank, said third-quarter net income declined 43 percent
as the company incurred a tax charge.  Profit fell to $268 million, or 37 cents a share, from $469
million, or 66 cents, a year earlier, the Winston-Salem, North
Carolina-based bank said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding one-time items were 70 cents, the company said,
matching the  average estimate  of 28 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  BB&T, led by Chief Executive Officer Kelly King, had a $235
million tax adjustment in the quarter after losing a court case
last month that sought to recover at least $688 million in taxes
and penalties. The company said in September it expected the
charge to be $250 million.  “Credit quality improvement accelerated in the last two
quarters,” King, 65, said in today’s statement. “We maintained
a stable net interest margin and reduced expenses.”  King said last month he expected costs to be “somewhat
elevated over the next couple of quarters” and that the
mortgage business would be “challenging.”  BB&T fell 1.4 percent to $33.73 at 11:39 a.m. in  New York .
The shares have gained 16 percent this year, compared with the
27 percent advance of the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
