President  Narayana Kocherlakota , who has backed record monetary
stimulus, said policy makers should maintain low  interest rates 
to reduce unemployment, even at the risk of temporarily pushing
inflation above the Fed’s 2 percent goal.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  should be “willing to
use any of its congressionally authorized tools to achieve the
goal of higher employment, no matter how unconventional those
tools might be,” Kocherlakota said in the text of prepared
remarks given in Butte,  Montana  today.  He said the Fed should signal it is prepared to do
“whatever it takes,” including providing more stimulus, to
rapidly bring down the jobless rate from August’s 7.3 percent.  The Fed shouldn’t be deterred by unusually high asset
prices or economic growth that accelerates “above historical
averages,” the Minneapolis Fed chief said.  Kocherlakota, who votes on the policy-setting FOMC next
year, gave a similar speech on Sept. 26 in Houghton, Michigan.  U.S.  central bankers  are next scheduled to meet Oct. 29-30
after they unexpectedly refrained last month from dialing back
their  $85 billion in monthly bond purchases .  In response to a question from the audience, Kocherlakota
said he is concerned that investors and consumers may
misinterpret signals from the Fed about its plans to scale back
the asset purchases.  If such talk makes it appear “we are satisfied with where
we are” on the outlook for the labor market, then policy makers
are “sending the wrong message relative to what I’m
describing,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
