President  Barack Obama  signed into
law a measure ending the 16-day U.S. government shutdown and
extending the nationâ€™s borrowing authority until early next
year, the White House said today in a statement.  The measure was passed by wide margins in the House and
Senate last night, ending a weeks-long fiscal stalemate between
the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress. The bill
passed on an 81-18 vote in the Democratic-led Senate, followed
by a 285-144 vote in the Republican-controlled House.  U.S. government workers are to return to their jobs today,
the White House Office of Management and Budget said last night
in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
