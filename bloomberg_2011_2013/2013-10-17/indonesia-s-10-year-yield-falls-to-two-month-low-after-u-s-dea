Indonesia ’s bonds gained, pushing
the 10-year yield to the lowest level in two months, after U.S.
lawmakers agreed to raise the country’s debt limit and avert a
default. Rupiah forwards advanced.  Congress voted in favor of a bill to end the 16-day
government shutdown, one day before the nation’s borrowing
authority was set to lapse. Overseas investors bought 4.16
trillion rupiah ($379 million) more rupiah  sovereign debt  than
they sold last week, the latest finance ministry data show.
Inflation, which slowed to 8.4 percent last month, will probably
remain below 9 percent through the end of the year, Deputy
Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said Oct. 10.  “Some investors were waiting for more clarity on the U.S.
front, so with this deal we expect inflows to continue,” said I
Made Adi Saputra, a fixed-income analyst at PT Nusantara Capital
Securities in Jakarta. “With the more stable rupiah and
manageable inflation, we see the yield curve flattening.”  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.78
percent as of 10:55 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since Aug.
12, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.
The rate will probably drop to 7.25 percent by year-end, while
the two-year yield will rise to 7 percent from 6.85 percent,
Saputra predicted.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.4 percent to
11,040 per dollar, 2.9 percent stronger than the spot rate, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. In the onshore market, the rupiah
advanced 0.1 percent to 11,358 per dollar, according to prices
from local banks.  A fixing used to settle the offshore forwards was set at
10,961 per dollar today, the strongest level since Sept. 19,
compared with 10,995 yesterday, according to the Association of
Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped eight basis points to 14.99 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
