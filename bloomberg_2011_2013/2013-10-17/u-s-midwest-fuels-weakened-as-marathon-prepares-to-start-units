U.S. Midwest fuels weakened relative
to futures as  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  prepared to start two
units at its  Kentucky  refinery.  Conventional,  85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago
slumped 2 cents to 8.5 cents a gallon below New York Mercantile
Exchange futures at 2:35 p.m., the biggest discount since Aug.
20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional, 87-grade gasoline in the  U.S. midcontinent  dropped 2.12 cents to a
discount of 15.75 cents, the lowest level since April 8.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago was unchanged at 10.5
cents a gallon below futures, while  midcontinent diesel  slipped
2.5 cents to a discount of 6 cents, the weakest since January.  The discounts widened as Marathon’s 240,000-barrel-a-day
Catlettsburg, Kentucky, plant planned to restart an ADS unit and
a distillate desulfurization unit over the next two days,
filings with regulators showed. The refinery processes both
sweet and sour crudes, according to the company’s website.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in  Chicago , a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped $1.13 to $11.49 a
barrel. The same spread in the midcontinent, known as Group 3,
slipped $1.52 to $10.09 a barrel. Group 3 includes the area
north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to North Dakota and Minnesota.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
 Los Angeles  widened 1 cent to 17 cents a gallon, a second
consecutive advance. The fuel in  San Francisco  added 0.5 cent to
a premium of 14 cents a gallon.  Conventional gasoline in  Portland , Oregon, a benchmark for
the U.S. Pacific Northwest, was unchanged at a discount of 10
cents a gallon, its lowest level since August. Low-sulfur diesel
was unchanged in all West Coast markets.  The 3-2-1  crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and state-grade diesel in Los Angeles narrowed by
83 cents to $15.30 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
