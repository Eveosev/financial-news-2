Sojaprotein AD, the biggest soy bean
processor in the Balkans, will borrow 110 million euros ($150
million) from units of  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  for
refinancing, as it shifts to higher-value products.  UniCredit Bank AD is to lend 60 million euros over six
years, including a 12-month grace period, at three-month Euribor
plus 4 percent annual interest, while contracts with Societe
Generale Bank AD include a 40 million-euro, two-year loan and a
10 million-euro loan over 12 months, at 4.25 percent over three-month Euribor and at one-month Euribor plus 3.9 percent
respectively, the Novi Becej, Serbia-based company said in a
 statement  after a shareholder’s meeting yesterday.  “The financing will support their transition from soybean
meal for animal feeds to higher-margin, soy-protein
concentrate,” Milos Bijanic, an analyst at Sinteza Invest Group
brokerage in Belgrade, said by phone. “They are also looking at
replenishing stock of soy beans because this year’s prices are
lower” than last year when a drought hurt the harvest.  Sojaprotein opened a soy-protein concentrates plant last
year and sees it reaching full annual capacity of 70,000 tons in
2014, the company said earlier this year. It turned to a 271
million-dinar ($3.2 million) consolidated net loss in the first
half from a 269 million dinar net income a year earlier.  As much as 42 million euros of the total may be used by
Victoria Logistic DOO and Victoriaoil AD, fellow members of
Victoria Group AD, which controls Sojaprotein, the company said.
Sojaprotein’s  shares  gained 2.24 percent to 684 dinars in
 Belgrade  today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
