Ethanol’s strengthened versus
gasoline as futures for the motor fuel declined after an
 American Petroleum Institute  showed oil inventories increased
last week.  Ethanol’s discount against gasoline shrank 3.72 cents at
settlement to 85.69 cents a gallon, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “The move was more or less associated with the technicals
in the crude oil itself,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
Intl FCStone in  Des Moines , Iowa.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery dropped 1.7 cents
to settle at $1.791 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  November-delivery gasoline declined 5.42 cents, or 2
percent, to settle at $2.6479 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn for December settlement gained 0.25 cent to $4.43 a
bushel in Chicago. Prices have slumped this year as the U.S. is
harvesting a record crop estimated at 13.8 billion bushels.  In cash market trading, ethanol declined 7 cents to $2.26 a
gallon in New York and fell 4 cents to $2.285 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It rose 2 cents to $2.10 a
gallon in Chicago and 1 cent to $2.185 on the  Gulf Coast .  To contact the reporter on this story:
