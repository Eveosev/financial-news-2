Intelligent Energy Ltd., a maker of
fuel cells for cars, businesses and homes that’s working with
 Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) , raised $51 million to expand.  The money, the most raised since the company started
operating, will be used to expand research and development and
enable the commercial start-up of its consumer electronics and
stationary back-up power systems, the Loughborough, England-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. The
stationary-power unit will be located in  India , it said.  The company’s fuel-cell technology uses hydrogen to
generate clean electricity. It can be integrated into portable
electronic devices such as laptops or used to generate heat and
power for domestic and distributed generation, small-scale power
production near the point of use. It can also be used in
vehicles such as cars and motorbikes.  “We have raised this finance at a time when we are making
significant strides in our principal market sectors,” Henri Winand, chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Intelligent Energy and Suzuki in February last year started
a joint venture to develop and make fuel-cell systems for a
range of industries including car manufacturing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
