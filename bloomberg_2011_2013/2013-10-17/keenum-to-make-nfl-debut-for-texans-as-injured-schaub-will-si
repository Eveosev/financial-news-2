Second-year quarterback Case Keenum
will make his National Football League debut for the Houston
Texans on Sunday with starter  Matt Schaub  ruled out due to
injury, coach  Gary Kubiak  said.  “He continues to grow and we’re struggling and looking for
a spark,” Kubiak told reporters regarding his decision to start
Keenum Oct. 20 at the  Kansas City Chiefs , according to the
team’s website.  Schaub, who had an interception returned for a touchdown in
each of the four games leading into last weekend’s 38-13 loss to
the St. Louis Rams, won’t play after injuring his leg and ankle
during the second half of the defeat.  He was replaced by T.J. Yates, who went 12 of 17 passing
for 186 yards, also throwing two interceptions, including one
that was returned for a score.  Keenum, 25, joined the Texans in 2012 as an undrafted free
agent out of the University of Houston.  The Texans are 2-4 this season, two games behind the
Indianapolis Colts in the AFC South Division. The Chiefs and
Denver Broncos, both 6-0, are the NFL’s only remaining
undefeated teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
