Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA  sank the most in two months after  UBS AG (UBSN)  recommended selling
the stock, citing a decline in  iron-ore  prices that could erode
the most profitable part of the company’s business.  Preferred shares of Usiminas, as the company is also known,
 declined  6.3 percent to 11.34 reais at 4:44 p.m. in  Sao Paulo ,
the biggest intraday drop since Aug 20. The Ibovespa equity
benchmark,  retreated  1.1 percent.  While the  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based company is the
country’s second-biggest steelmaker by output, 95 percent of its
earnings before interest and taxes this year were derived from
iron-ore mining, according to UBS. Analysts including Andreas Bokkenheuser and Rafael Cintra started coverage of the company
with a sell recommendation, citing a projected decline in prices
for the raw material.  “We are cautious on Usiminas in view of our bearish iron-ore outlook, as mining currently accounts for the majority of
the company earnings,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients
dated yesterday.  The UBS analysts project earnings before interest and taxes
of 1.02 billion reais ($472 million) for Usiminas next year.
That compares with an average estimate of 1.1 billion reais
among 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. UBS also estimates that
the average price for iron ore will fall 14 percent to $106 per
ton in 2014 from 2013, according to a note to clients dated Oct.
15.  Usiminas fell 11 percent this year, while competitors
Gerdau SA declined 4.6 percent and  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) 
lost 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
