The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
dropped, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 5 basis points to 132 basis points
as of 8:18 a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is set for its biggest
one-day decline since Oct. 11 and its lowest close since Sept.
23, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 5 basis points to
105 as of 11:10 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The measure is headed for its lowest level since
Sept. 19, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 3.5 basis points to
83 as of 9:13 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The gauge, which is poised to fall for a seventh straight
trading day, is on track for its lowest close since Sept. 19,
CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
