Lawson Inc. (2651) , Japan’s second-largest
convenience chain, intends to double average profit growth by
opening stores that offer drugs and more healthful foods as
demand for cigarettes, its biggest-selling item, dwindles.  Operating profit  will probably jump to as much as 130
billion yen ($1.3 billion) by fiscal year 2018, said Lawson
Chief Executive Officer Takeshi Niinami. The target reflects
average annual growth of more than 14 percent, compared with the
7 percent mean increase in the past five years.  Niinami’s biggest rivals,  Seven & I Holding Co. (3382) ’s 7-Eleven
chain and  FamilyMart Co. (8028)  are adding 1,500 stores a year each in
Japan targeting older shoppers and single-person households.
Lawson has set a five-year target to raise Natural Lawson
stores, which sell more healthful food, to 3,000 from the
current 109 and to raise stores that sell prescription or over-the-counter drugs to 3,000 from 82.  “The percentage of sales from tobacco will fall, so we
have to find replacements for that,” Niinami said. “Otherwise,
the  convenience store business will fall apart.”  Demand growth for cigarettes, accounting for about 26
percent of net sales at Lawson stores last fiscal year, is
slumping as tax increases push up prices, more consumers shun
cancer risks and some local governments ban smoking in public
areas. Competition for tobacco sales is also rising, Niinami
said.  Smokers made up about 21 percent of  Japan ’s population last
year, down from 26 percent in 2007, according to  Japan Tobacco
Inc. (2914) , the country’s former cigarette monopoly. Demand in Japan
fell 32 percent to 195 billion cigarettes in 2013 from 285
billion in 2006, according to Japan Tobacco.  Cigarette Sales  Niinami declined to give a target for cigarette sales,
which jumped 45 percent to 497 billion yen in the year ended in
February from 342 billion yen four years earlier, according to
the company’s  annual report . The sales figures represent totals
from all stores in the chain, while Lawson’s revenue comes
primarily from fees paid by franchise owners.  Lawson’s shift toward more healthful foods will also help
stores attract more women, which have traditionally shopped at
 convenience stores  less than men. He said more boxed meals known
as “bentos” are being prepared to suit the diets of women and
older people who will pay more, Niinami said.  “Our goal is to reduce fat and salt in the bentos we sell
without sacrificing taste,” he said. “These are priced a
little higher than regular bentos and are more profitable and as
we sell more, we can lower unit costs to gain even more
margin.”  Share Performance  Niinami’s growth strategy so far has lured investors and
produced a more than 90 percent  total return  on the shares over
the past five years, compared with about 61 percent for 7-Eleven’s parent.  Net income will probably climb to 36.8 billion yen this
fiscal year, according to the average of 16 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit in the three months ended in August rose 2.2 percent
to 11.9 billion yen. Operating margin, or operating profit
divided by sales, surged to about 17 percent last quarter, from
12 percent in the previous three months and 16 percent a year
earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Niinami also said Lawson is “interested” in buying
smaller convenience store chains in Japan. He didn’t name
specific targets or give a timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
