CME Group Inc. (CME) , which planned to
increase margin levels by 12 percent for the  interest-rate swaps 
that its clearinghouse guarantees,  reversed  the decision after
lawmakers reached an agreement avoiding a U.S. default.  The owner of the world’s largest futures market had
announced the higher collateral requirement this week, citing
the risk that negotiations over avoiding a U.S. government
default would spur volatility. CME Group, based in Chicago,
planned to implement the change over four days, beginning with a
3 percent increase yesterday. The figure will revert to the
normal level as of today, CME Group  said  on its website.  Congress agreed yesterday to raise the U.S. borrowing limit
and end a partial government shutdown. The 12 percent margin
increase could have amounted to $1.5 billion to $2 billion in
additional margin before the effect of netted positions is
accounted for,  Niamh Alexander , an analyst with KBW Inc. in New
York, wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  CME Group’s clearinghouse guarantees futures and swaps
contracts based on  interest rates , Treasuries, gold, oil, the
creditworthiness of companies, and currencies. Clearinghouses
require margin as protection against losses should traders
default on their obligations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
