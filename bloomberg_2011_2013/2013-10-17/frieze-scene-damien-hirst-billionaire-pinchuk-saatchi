Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk launched his third $100,000  Future Generation Art Prize  (for young talent) at the  Serpentine Sackler Gallery , the new scene-shaper by  Zaha Hadid .  Pinchuk’s guests included Marc Quinn and  Damien Hirst .  When a guest noted 52-year-old Pinchuk’s relative youth (by billionaire standards), the Ukrainian shared a hug with Hirst and cried, “Young British artist -- young Ukrainian collector!”  Hirst, 48, in a suit jacket and jeans, recalled how, in his younger days, artists just wanted to be in five galleries.  “Now artists question everything, so they’re not just taking the gallery system as it exists,” he said. “They’re inventing their own futures.”  Also attending was  Olafur Eliasson , the Danish-Icelandic artist whose artificial sun at Tate Modern was one of the most-loved lobby installations.  Slideshow:  The Frieze  London  Art Fair Eliasson said he’s working on “Little Sun” -- an environmental project that markets little solar-powered, sun-shaped lamps for 20 euros ($27) via www.littlesun.com and uses the cash to bring electricity to communities without it.  He handed over a unit powered by the sunlight in Berlin.  “It’s a small power plant that you can hold in your hand,” he explained. “It also gives you personal energy, meaning that it makes you stronger.”  Rubell’s Womb  Jennifer Rubell presented her new interactive work at the Frieze London fair this week.  It’s a large white reclining sculpture of her recently pregnant self with a belly-area cavity viewers can crawl into. During the preview, more than one grown man curled up inside.  After posing for photographers inside the womb, Rubell took time out to talk at the Stephen Friedman Gallery booth. She said her body was scanned when she was eight months pregnant, and the belly digitally carved out, “creating the void.”  Friedman announced he’d sold one of the sculptures (from an edition of three) for $200,000.  Video:  The Art of Selling Art at London's Frieze Art Fair The night before collector  Charles Saatchi  sold artworks in a Christie’s sale, the auction house threw a huge party in a factory-sized former postal depot in London.  There to be inspected were Kader Attia’s “Ghost” (2007) -- 264 foil sculptures of Muslim women kneeling for prayer -- and Jake and Dinos Chapman’s “Tragic Anatomies” (1996), a forest of mutant, mating nudes.  Tracey Emin’s “To Meet My Past” bed looked so cozy, a guard had to stand by and stop any couples from lying down. It sold last night for 481,875 pounds ($778,854).  Tracey Emin's Bed Sells for Record $778,900 in London (Farah Nayeri writes for Muse, the arts & leisure section of  Bloomberg News . The opinions expressed are her own.)
