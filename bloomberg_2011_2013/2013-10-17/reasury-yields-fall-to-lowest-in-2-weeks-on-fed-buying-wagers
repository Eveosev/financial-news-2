Treasury 10-year  note yields  fell to
the lowest level in two weeks on speculation the Federal Reserve
will maintain its bond-buying program into next year after the
government shutdown weighed on economic growth.  U.S. debt advanced the most in a month as  consumer
confidence  dropped to a two-year low and a regional factory
measure fell in October. Treasury bill rates dropped for a
second day after lawmakers agreed on a plan to end the federal
closure that started Oct. 1 and to raise the borrowing limit.
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said the
central bank should postpone tapering after the shutdown stopped
the flow of economic data used to gauge growth.  “The market is turning back to looking at the Fed,” said
Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10 billion as co-head of
government and mortgage-backed securities at Federated Investors
in Pittsburgh. “The uncertainty in the market and the economy
may keep the Fed on hold longer than anticipated, which is
supportive of Treasury prices.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 2.60 percent at 1:36 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.5 percent
note due in August 2023 rose 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 5/32. The yield touched 2.59 percent, lowest since
Oct. 3, and dropped as much as seven basis points, the biggest
decline since Sept. 18.  Treasuries have lost investors 2.5 percent this year,
according to  Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)  The Bloomberg
Global Developed  Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV)  has lost investors 3.71
percent in 2013.  Record Low  The overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate closed
at 0.19 percent, down from a close of 0.35 percent yesterday,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 34 today, down from 47 yesterday and 67
on Oct. 15, according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30
or above 70 suggests the security may be poised for a change in
direction.  While the yield has advanced from a record low of 1.379
percent in July 2012, it’s below the average of about 6.40
percent since September 1981, the start of the three-decade  bull
market  in bonds.  President  Barack Obama  just after midnight signed into law
a measure to extend the nation’s borrowing authority into early
2014 and end the shutdown.  Slowing Purchases  The deal, which avoided a default of the world’s biggest
economy and means that federal workers return to their jobs
today, funds the government at Republican-backed spending levels
through Jan. 15, 2014, and suspends the debt limit through Feb.
7.  “There’s one theme out there -- it’s overwhelmingly
negative for the economy and positive for the Fed not tapering,
which people are equating to higher Treasury prices,” said
Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc.  In September, most Fed policy makers said the central bank
will probably reduce bond purchases -- used to support the
economy by putting downward pressure on borrowing costs -- this
year from the current rate of $85 billion a month.  Evans’s View  The Fed’s Evans, an advocate of pressing on with stimulus,
said today in a speech prepared for delivery in Madison,
 Wisconsin , “only the data can tell us how much progress we’ve
made, and they aren’t saying much right now.” Fed Bank of
Kansas City President Esther George and Fed Bank of Minneapolis
President Narayana Kocherlakota are also due to speak today.  Treasuries remained higher as the monthly Bloomberg
Consumer Confidence Index expectations gauge plunged to minus
31, the lowest level since November 2011, from minus 9 in
September, a report showed today. The share of people projecting
the economy will worsen jumped by the most since the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. five years ago.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general  economic
index  fell to 19.8 this month from 22.3 in September. Readings
greater than zero signal growth in the area, which covers
eastern  Pennsylvania , southern New Jersey and  Delaware . The
median forecast of 56 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a reading of 15.  Rates on $120 billion of bills maturing today, when U.S.
borrowing authority was scheduled to lapse, dropped to 0.038
percent yesterday. They were as high as 0.51 percent Oct. 10.  The next securities due are $93 billion of debt maturing on
Oct. 24. Rates on those bills touched 0.68 percent yesterday
before dropping to 0.01 percent today. The rate was negative as
recently as Sept. 27.  ‘Buying Opportunities’  “There were buying opportunities in the bills market,”
said Paul Montaquila, fixed-income investment officer with BNP
Paribas SA’s Bank of the West. “It was a crazy ride. The bills
market has returned to normalcy. The dust has settled.”  One-month rates were 12 basis points lower at 0.02 percent
after touching 0.45 percent yesterday, the highest level since
October 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
on bills due on Feb. 13 dropped four basis points to 0.05
percent, compared with an average of 0.035 percent since the
securities were issued in August.  Even at the height of concern about a default, yields
remained lower than historical levels, with one-month  rates 
averaging 1.5 percent in the past 10 years. During that time
they climbed to a high of 5.26 percent in November 2006 and fell
to as low as negative 0.09 percent in December 2008.  Selling, Buying  The U.S. announced today it will sell $7 billion in 30-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on Oct. 24. The Treasury
previously sold an equal amount of the securities on June 20.  The Fed today purchased $3.15 billion in Treasuries
maturing between August 2021 and August 2023 as part of its
program to lower borrowing costs.  The shutdown has shaved at least 0.6 percent from
annualized fourth-quarter growth, Standard & Poor’s said
yesterday. The ratings agency downgraded the U.S. on Aug. 5,
2011, by one step to AA+ from AAA. Fitch Ratings put the U.S. on
watch for a possible downgrade on Oct. 15.  China ’s Dagong Global Credit Rating, one of the country’s
four biggest credit-rating companies, downgraded the local- and
foreign-currency credit ratings of the U.S. to A- from A today,
maintaining a negative outlook, it said in an e-mailed statement
today.  China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries and
increased its holdings to $1.28 trillion as of July, according
to U.S. government figures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
