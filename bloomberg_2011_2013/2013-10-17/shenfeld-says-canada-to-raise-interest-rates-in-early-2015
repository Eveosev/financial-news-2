The Bank of  Canada  probably won’t
raise interest rates until early 2015 as the economy benefits
from stronger global demand, according to  Avery Shenfeld , chief
economist at CIBC World Markets.  The conditions for a rate increase “may finally fall into
place” in 2014 and the central bank will tighten “in early
2015,” Shenfeld told investors at the Bloomberg Focus Day
Symposium in Toronto.  The economy will expand by 2.3 percent next year, Shenfeld
said, adding Canada isn’t suffering from a housing debt crisis.  “When it comes time to tap on the brakes,” he said “it’s
not going to take as much” to influence indebted consumers and
slow the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
