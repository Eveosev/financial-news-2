T. Boone Pickens  plans to give $20
million to the Wilmer Eye Institute at  Johns Hopkins University 
to support research.  The gift from the founder and chairman of Dallas-based BP
Capital LLC will help the university recruit new scholars,
according to a statement from Peter McDonnell, director of the
institute and a professor of ophthalmology.  “What this gift will do is allow us to scour the globe to
find the best and brightest young minds, bring them here as
Boone Pickens scholars and invest in them the resources that
will allow them to explore that brilliant idea,” McDonnell said
in  a statement  on the institute’s website.  With this donation, Pickens, who has been treated at the
institute for cataracts and macular degeneration, will have
committed more than $28 million to Wilmer. He established a
professorship in ophthalmology in 2005 and contributed $6
million for the construction of the Robert H. and Clarice Smith
Building that opened in 2009, according to the statement.  “Wilmer has done a good job for me and I wanted to respond
to that,” Pickens said in a video released by the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
