Mexico’s peso bonds rallied, pushing
yields down the most in four weeks, and the currency rose as a
U.S. agreement pushed a budget battle that damped demand for the
Latin American nation’s debt into early next year.  “This uncertainty ended, at least temporarily,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB,
said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.  Yields on the benchmark securities due in December 2024
fell 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.73 percent
at 9:59 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 12.7810 per
U.S. dollar, the strongest on a closing basis since Sept. 19.  The bonds also gained after a committee of Mexico’s lower
house approved a bill that avoided sales taxes on private
education tuition, mortgage interest and home sales and rentals,
some of the levies that the Finance Ministry proposed last
month. The lawmakers signaled that  Mexico ’s tax overhaul won’t
be as inflationary as some analysts had thought, allowing the
central bank to cut borrowing costs and fuel further gains in
fixed-rate bonds, Camarena said.  In the U.S., lawmakers agreed late yesterday after weeks of
wrangling to fund the federal government and increase the debt
limit, allowing Mexico’s biggest trading partner to avoid
default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
