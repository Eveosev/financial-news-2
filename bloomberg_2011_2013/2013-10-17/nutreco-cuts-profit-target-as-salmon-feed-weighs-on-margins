Nutreco NV (NUO) , the world’s largest
supplier of fish feed, cut its forecast for profit this year
amid a “challenging market” for products for salmon that
eroded margins in  Norway .  The supplier of Skretting shrimp and fish feed predicts
that earnings before interest, taxes and amortization will total
about 255 million euros ($345 million), down from an earlier
target of at least matching last year’s 262.1 million euros, the
Amersfoort, Netherlands-based company said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Knut Nesse is introducing products
to expand in faster-growing markets such as shrimp and diversify
away from salmon. Nutreco is looking at the sale of a compound-feed division in Spain, while pursuing more business in  Latin
America , Russia, Asia and Africa.  Third-quarter sales rose 0.7 percent to 1.49 billion euros,
Nutreco said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
