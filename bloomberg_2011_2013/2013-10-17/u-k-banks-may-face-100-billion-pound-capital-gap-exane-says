U.K. lenders may face a 100 billion-pound ($161 billion) capital shortage under a proposal by the
country’s Prudential Regulation Authority, which could force
banks to postpone dividends and depress their returns, according
to Exane BNP Paribas analysts.  Lenders would need to hold a fully loaded equity Tier 1
ratio of 13 percent over time should the regulator adopt its
proposal in full, the analysts, led by  Jonathan Pierce , wrote in
a note to clients today. Banks are likely to be given time to
build up the buffer, prompting a review of their liabilities,
the analysts said.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s biggest mortgage
lender, is the only U.K. bank likely to reach the target by
2015, said Exane. While the PRA is unlikely to force other banks
to scale back their assets quickly or sell more stock to
investors, dividend payments are at risk, the analysts wrote.  To maintain a return on tangible equity target of 12
percent, U.K. banks would also have earn 20 billion pounds on a
net basis, twice the level indicated by first-half earnings,
they said.  Similar requirements are unlikely to be adopted by
regulators in other European nations, according to Exane.  To contact the reporters on this story:
