Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, said first-quarter
shipments rose 60 percent, missing analyst estimates after
delays to production.  Shipments were 24.7 million metric tons in the three months
ended Sept. 30, from 15.4 million tons a year earlier, the
Perth-based company said today in a statement. That compares
with the median estimate of 28 million tons from three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ore processing output was “impacted by the significant
time taken to thoroughly investigate and respond” to the death
of a worker in an incident at its Christmas Creek operation in
August, Fortescue said in the statement. Some other production
delays occurred as a result of conveyor belt tears at the
Firetail and Cloudbreak operations, the producer said.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the second-biggest iron-ore shipper, this
week reported record ore production at its mines in Australia’s
Pilbara region, where Fortescue also operates. Australia, the
largest iron ore exporter, this month raised its price estimates
as demand surges from steel mills in  China .  Fortescue fell 0.9 percent to A$5.35 at 12:35 p.m. in
Sydney trading. Its shares have advanced 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
