Palm oil  advanced to the highest
level in more than five weeks after the U.S. Congress voted to
end a 16-day government shutdown, and as rising Malaysian
exports signaled growing demand.  The contract for delivery in January rose as much as 1
percent to 2,432 ringgit ($769) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest level for most-active futures
since Sept. 9, and was at 2,421 ringgit at 11:47 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Palm for physical delivery in November was at 2,400
ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. Congress yesterday voted to halt the government
shutdown and raise the debt limit, ending the nation’s fiscal
impasse. Exports from  Malaysia , the largest producer after
Indonesia, gained 12 percent to 799,853 tons in the first 15
days of October from a month earlier, SGS (Malaysia) Sdn. said
yesterday.  “The resolving of the whole U.S. issue will be positive
for commodities because it removes the negative sentiment from
world economies,” said Tan Chee Tat, an analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte. in Singapore. “The strong export demand as shown
by the cargo surveyors helped to alleviate some of the earlier
concerns over strong production in the upcoming months.”  Exports climbed for a fourth month in September, while
 output  gained 10 percent to 1.91 million tons, according to data
from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Production is typically
highest from July to October each year.  Soybeans for delivery in November gained 0.2 percent to
$12.7925 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  soybean
oil  for December climbed 0.8 percent to 41.71 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for May delivery surged 2.2 percent to
6,014  yuan  ($986) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 1.3 percent to
7,176 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
