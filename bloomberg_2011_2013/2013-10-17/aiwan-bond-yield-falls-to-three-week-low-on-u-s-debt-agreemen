Taiwan’s bonds advanced, pushing the
five-year yield to the lowest in three weeks, after U.S.
lawmakers voted to end a 16-day government shutdown and raise
the nation’s debt limit.  President  Barack Obama  signed the agreement into law a day
before the U.S. was set for its first-ever default. The deal
will fund the government at Republican-backed spending levels
through Jan. 15 and suspend the debt limit through Feb. 7.  “Taiwan’s government bonds were rising slowly in the last
few days because the market was still uncertain; trading volumes
were rather low,” said Sam Chang, a Taipei-based fixed-income
trader at Hua Nan Securities Co. “Once bullish news arrived,
people started to buy again.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent government notes due October
2018, the most actively traded bonds this week, dropped three
basis points to 1.128 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. That’s the lowest level since Sept. 26.  Taiwan ’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.452 against the
greenback, prices from Taipei Forex Inc. show. The currency
weakened 0.2 percent in the last 19 minutes of trading amid
suspected intervention by the central bank. The monetary
authority has sold the local dollar in the run-up to the close
on most days since March 2012, according to traders who asked
not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$29.3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 3.37 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.385
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
