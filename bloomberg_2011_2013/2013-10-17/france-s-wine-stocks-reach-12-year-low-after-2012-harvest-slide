France ’s stocks of wine fell to the
lowest in at least 12 years after the country’s production
plunged 19 percent last year, crop office FranceAgriMer said.  French estates, cooperatives and other producers held 29.9
million hectoliters of wine at the Aug. 1 start of the season,
equivalent to 4 billion bottles, from 34.7 million hectoliters
at the start of 2012-13, Philippe Janvier, in charge of wine
statistics at the crop office, told reporters today. That’s the
lowest since at least 2001-02, the crop office said.  Last year’s wine-grape harvest was the smallest in at least
40 years after weather damage and disease, according to the
Agriculture Ministry. Rising bulk wine prices more than made up
for a drop in volumes sold in 2012-13, with the cost of bulk
whites without a regional indication jumping 32 percent,
FranceAgriMer data show.  Stocks “are at historically low levels, very much below
the five-year average,” Janvier said in Montreuil-sous-Bois,
France. “Due to the weakness of supply, prices rose to a rather
high level.”  This year’s wine production will probably rise less than
the 6.6 percent increase to 44.1 million hectoliters forecast by
the Agriculture Ministry, based on the outlook provided by
various regions, according to Eric Rosaz, in charge of wine
industry at FranceAgriMer.  The ministry forecasts “are a bit optimistic,” Rosaz
said. “We won’t be very far from 43.5 million hectoliters.”  2001-02 Low  Wine producers start the season with the lowest stocks
since at least 2001-02, FranceAgriMer said, citing customs data.
Inventories of wine with a protected designation of origin fell
to 23.2 million hectoliters as of Aug. 1 from 25.8 million
hectoliters a year earlier.  The biggest slide in wine inventories was noted in the
combined regions of  Burgundy , Beaujolais, Savoy and Jura, where
stocks slumped 30 percent to 1.72 million hectoliters, according
to the crop office.  The volume of wine held by producers in  Bordeaux  dropped 9
percent to 8.96 million hectoliters, while Champagne’s
inventories fell 6 percent to 4.22 million hectoliters,
according to FranceAgriMer. In the region of Languedoc-Roussillon, France’s biggest wine region by production, stocks
at the start of August fell 16 percent to 7.34 million
hectoliters. The wine year in France runs from Aug. 1 to July
31.  Still Wine  The volume of still wine held by merchants dropped about 3
percent to 13.2 million hectoliters, while inventories of
sparkling varieties rose 13 percent to 7.9 million hectoliters,
crop office data showed.  France’s sales of bulk wine with a regional indication rose
7 percent in 2012-13 to 606 million euros ($828 million), with
higher prices for all varieties making up for smaller volumes of
red and rose, FranceAgriMer said. Sales of wine with no regional
indication rose 11 percent to 236.7 million euros.  The price of whites without a regional indication jumped 32
percent to an average 70.07 euros per hectoliter, while for bulk
white wines with that indication average prices advanced 6
percent to 85.89 euros a hectoliter, according to FranceAgriMer.  Bulk reds rose 11 percent to an average 62.97 euros a
hectoliter for those without a regional indication, while
2012-13 prices climbed 7 percent to 74.69 euros a hectoliter for
red wine with the region indicated.  Of bulk wines with a protected designation of origin, Loire
Valley whites posted the biggest price gain in 2012-13, on
average jumping more than 60 percent, followed by red Beaujolais
and red Burgundy wines with price gains of around 40 percent,
the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
