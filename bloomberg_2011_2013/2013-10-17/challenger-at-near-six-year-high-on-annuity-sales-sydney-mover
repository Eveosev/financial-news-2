Challenger Ltd. (CGF)  rose the most in two
months to its highest since December 2007 after reporting a 31
percent rise in life annuity sales in the third quarter from a
year earlier.  The stock was up 4.2 percent at A$5.91 at 2:33 p.m. in
Sydney and touched an intraday high of A$6.005 after it
announced the jump in annuity sales to A$732 million in the
three months ending Sept. 30. The Sydney-based company’s assets
and funds under management also rose 31 percent to A$46.1
billion, it said in a statement to the stock exchange today.  “The annuity sales are nothing short of impressive and it
is their core business area,” Evan Lucas, a Melbourne-based
market strategist at IG Ltd., said in a phone interview. “It
has done really well since the global financial crisis and a lot
of people are seeing it as an option they otherwise probably
didn’t look at before.”  Challenger has soared 67 percent this year, the second-biggest rise among financial services stocks in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index, which has risen 14 percent over the same
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of life
annuities, which are retirement products that offer regular
payments in return for a lump-sum investment, made up about 80
percent of Challenger’s  revenue  in the fiscal year ending June
30, according to the company’s results released Aug. 19.  “We are very pleased with the unseasonably strong retail
annuity sales and remain committed to our 2014 guidance,” Chief
Executive Officer Brian Benari said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
