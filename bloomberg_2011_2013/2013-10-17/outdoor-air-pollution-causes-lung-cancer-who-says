Outdoor air pollution can cause lung
cancer, a World Health Organization agency said, ranking it as a
carcinogen for the first time.  Pollution was also linked to an increased risk of bladder
cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, based
in Lyon,  France , said in a statement on its Web site today,
citing a review of studies.  Air pollution, which has also been linked to heart disease,
caused about 223,000  deaths from lung cancer  globally in 2010,
according to the IARC. Particulate matter, which comes from
vehicles, power plants, other industrial sites and biomass
burning and is a major component of the pollution, was evaluated
separately and also found to cause cancer.  “This report should send a strong signal to the
international community to take action,” said IARC Director
Christopher Wild. “We can’t treat our way out of this cancer
problem. The first step is identifying the causes.”  While the group has evaluated individual chemicals and
substances such as diesel engine exhaust, it’s the first time
that air pollution as a whole is deemed  carcinogenic , the agency
said.  By classifying cancer risks, the IARC provides scientific
advice to governments. The agency ranks substances in five
groups: carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, possibly
carcinogenic, not classifiable and probably not carcinogenic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
