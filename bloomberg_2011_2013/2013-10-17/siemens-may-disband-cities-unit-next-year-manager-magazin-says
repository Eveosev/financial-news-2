Siemens AG (SIE)  Chief Executive Officer
Joe Kaeser may disband the Infrastructure and Cities division
created by his predecessor, to streamline the company and narrow
the profitability gap with competitor  General Electric Co. (GE) ,
Manager Magazin reported.  The change could happen as soon as October 2014, with
Munich-based Siemens dividing its existing four sectors into
between five and eight divisions, the German magazine said,
citing an unidentified company manager. A Siemens spokesman
declined to comment on the report to  Bloomberg News .  The infrastructure and cities division, set up by Loescher
in 2011, is the least profitable at Siemens, with profit
representing 6.3 percent of sales last year. Headed by former
strategy chief Roland Busch, the sector pools units including
building automation, rail and power distribution.  Former finance chief Kaeser took over as CEO of Germany’s
biggest engineering company in August after a six-year stint
under Austrian  Peter Loescher , when the stock declined 22
percent amid five missed profit targets and margins that lagged
behind competitors  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  and GE.  Kaeser is set to present a new sales structure to 600 top
managers in Berlin this evening. The company will probably give
more control to country managers, undoing the regional
“clusters” set up under Loescher. Siemens merged the power
plant building division with the oil and gas unit earlier this
month, spokesman Alfons Benzinger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
