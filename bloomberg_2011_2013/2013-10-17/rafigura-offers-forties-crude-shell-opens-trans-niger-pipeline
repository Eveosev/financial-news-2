Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell
 North Sea  Forties crude at a lower price than the previous
trade.  Eni SpA (ENI)  sought to sell Russian Urals in northwest  Europe 
at a smaller discount than yesterday without success.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nigerian unit reopened the 28-inch
Trans Niger Pipeline after repairs, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  North Sea  Trafigura didn’t manage to sell Forties for Oct. 29 to Oct.
31 at 5 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. The grade was last sold at a premium of 25 cents
on Oct. 14.  The company was also unable to buy Ekofisk for Oct. 29 to
Oct. 31 at 55 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, or a premium
of 80 cents for Nov. 7 to Nov. 9, the survey showed. It also
failed to find a seller for Oseberg for Nov. 9 to Nov. 11 at 95
cents a barrel more than the benchmark.  BP Plc (BP/)  sought without success to buy Oseberg for Nov. 9 to
Nov. 11 at $1.00 a barrel more than Dated Brent, or Ekofisk for
Nov. 7 to Nov. 9 at a premium of 90 cents, according to the
survey.  Brent for December settlement traded at $109.25 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $110.52 from the previous session. The January
contract was at $108.66, a discount of 59 cents to December.  Two Forties cargoes for loading in November will be delayed
by one day, the first deferrals for the November program, said
three traders with knowledge of the loading plan. Cargo F1107
will load on Nov. 10 to Nov. 12 while shipment F1108 will be
exported on Nov. 11 to Nov. 13, they said.  The delay was partly because of extended maintenance at the
Kinneil oil and gas plant, one person said.  Oseberg cargo 20131102 will be delayed by 14 days to be
exported on Nov. 19 to Nov.21, according to three people
involved in the region’s oil market.  Ekofisk cargo C11457 will be exported on Nov. 11, one day
later than planned, said two people who participate in the
market.  BP Plc booked a very large crude carrier, Pluto Glory, to
load crude from Hound Point in  Scotland  on Nov. 10 to  South
Korea  at a cost of $4.8 million, according to Athens-based
Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. and Poten & Partners in  New York .  Urals/Mediterranean  Eni failed to sell 100,000 metric tons of Urals for Nov. 1
to Nov. 5 loading at a discount of $1.55 a barrel to Dated Brent
delivered to Rotterdam, 10 cents more expensive than its offer
yesterday, according to the survey.  Glencore Xstrata Plc was unable to sell 80,000 tons of
Urals for Oct. 29 to Nov. 2 at 75 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent, the survey showed.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell 100,000 tons of
Urals for Nov. 3 to Nov. 4 loading from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic
Sea , said two traders who received the document. The tender
closes tomorrow.  West Africa  BP failed to sell 950,000 barrels of Angolan Pazflor crude
for Nov. 4 to Nov. 5 for a third day even after it lowered the
offer by 20 cents to a discount of $2.60 a barrel to Dated
Brent, the survey showed.  The 24-inch section of TNP remains shut since Oct. 9
following leaks, Shell said.  Shell Petroleum Development Company of  Nigeria  will
“continue to monitor the situation and the force majeure that
was declared on Bonny Light exports on October 9 will be lifted
as soon as it is operationally possible to do so,” it said.  Angola ’s Saturno crude exports will reach a record of six
cargoes of 950,000 barrels each, two more than November,
according to a revised shipping schedule. One consignment was
added to the original plan released yesterday.  Chad will increase exports of Doba crude to three cargoes
of 950,000 barrels each in December, one more than November,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, is

December delivery to its Cilacap and Balikpapan refineries,
according to a tender document obtained by Bloomberg. The result
