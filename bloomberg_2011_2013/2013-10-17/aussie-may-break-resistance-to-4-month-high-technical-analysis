The Australian dollar may rise to
its strongest level in more than four months if a key level of
resistance fails to hold, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  The South Pacific currency is “well supported” and will
test resistance in the area from 96.66 to 96.74 U.S. cents,
 David Sneddon , global head of technical analysis in  London  at
Credit Suisse, wrote today in a client note. From there, the
Aussie may appreciate to the 97-to-97.30 zone, the Fibonacci 50
percent retracement of the currency’s 2013 decline, and 97.66,
the 200-day moving average and its highest level since June 3.  The Aussie “has again broken higher, and we remain
bullish,” Sneddon wrote. “We would look for the market to try
and top” at the 97.66 level, he said.  Australia ’s currency appreciated 0.9 percent to 96.36 U.S.
cents at 5 p.m. in  New York  after rising as much as 1 percent to
96.47, the strongest level since June 14.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
