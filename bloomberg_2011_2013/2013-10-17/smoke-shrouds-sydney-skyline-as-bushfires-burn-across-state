A smoky haze shrouded Sydney’s
skyline as bushfires burned across  Australia ’s most populous
state, fuelled by high temperatures and strong winds.  The New South Wales Rural Fire Service issued seven
emergency warnings across the state where 80 fires are burning
and declared a total fire ban in the greater Sydney region. The
Bureau of Meteorology warned of a  severe fire danger  in the
area, forecasting high winds and temperatures peaking at 34
degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit).  Newcastle Airport , about 175 kilometers (110 miles) north
of Sydney, was closed due to a nearby bushfire, according to a
statement on its website.  “If we get through with less than 100 homes destroyed
today, we have been lucky,” the state’s Rural Fire Service
Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said in a posting on Twitter.  The nation’s bushfire season has started early after the
country’s warmest September on record, according to the Bureau
of Meteorology. In February 2009, wild fires across Victoria
state killed 173 people and destroyed 150 homes in the worst
blazes in Australian history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
