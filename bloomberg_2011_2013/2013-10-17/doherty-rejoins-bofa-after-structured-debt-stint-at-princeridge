Bank of America Corp . hired Ray Doherty, who left the company five months ago to sell structured
notes at PrinceRidge LLC.  Doherty confirmed he joined the bank in a phone call from
his office in New York. He declined to elaborate. Zia Ahmed, a
spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment.  PrinceRidgeâ€™s parent company,  Institutional Financial
Markets Inc. (IFMI) , said Oct. 2 it would cut 20 percent of its
workforce to consolidate the brokerage with JVB Financial Group.
Doherty focused on structured notes tied to stocks, currencies
and commodities there, he said in a June interview.  Doherty joined Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd., which
was later acquired by Bank of America, in 1993, he said in the
interview.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
