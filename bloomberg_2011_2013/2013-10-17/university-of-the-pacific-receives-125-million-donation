University of the Pacific  has
received an estimated $125 million from the estate of Robert and
Jeannette Powell, the largest gift in the university’s 162-year
history.  The gift will endow scholarships and academic programs, the
private Stockton, California-based college said in a  statement .
The contribution will increase the school’s endowment by more
than 50 percent, to $337 million.  Robert Powell , who died in 2007 at age 76, was a real
estate developer in Sacramento, California, about 50 miles north
of Stockton. Jeannette Powell, who died in December at 80, was
an interior designer. In 2007, the university announced that the
Powells would make the bequest, then valued at $100 million. The
couple, who had no children, didn’t graduate from college
themselves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
