The Brazilian government is
considering holding an oilfield auction next year as part of its
quest to double crude production by 2020, the head of the
government energy planning company said.  Brazil  will hold an auction Oct. 21 for the Libra field, a
so-called pre-salt deposit expected to hold as much as 12
billion barrels.  “We may have a new regular oil bidding round next year,”
Mauricio Tolmasquim said in an interview in Brasilia. “For pre-salt, we must first wait the result of the Libra before taking
steps in that direction.”  This year Brazil invited domestic and foreign oil companies
to compete for oil acreage for the first time in five years. In
May, the oil regulator awarded more than 100 licenses in
Brazil’s northeastern region and it will hold two more bidding
rounds before the end of the year.  “The government wants to speed up the process of oil
exploring in the country because the wealth can only be useful
for the country when the oil is taken out of the ground,”
Edison Lobao, the country’s energy minister, said at a press
conference today. “We need to boost output, since we still
import oil and gasoline and we want to be in a situation where
we will be mostly an exporter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
