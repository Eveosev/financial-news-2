Lawsuits filed against  Monsanto Co. (MON) ,
the world’s largest seed company, over claims it failed to
contain genetically altered wheat found on an Oregon farm, will
be consolidated in  Kansas , a judicial panel ruled.  At least 16 lawsuits will be sent to U.S. District Judge
Kathryn Vratil in  Kansas City  for pretrial evidence gathering,
the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ruled
yesterday.  Kansas is close to Monsanto’s St. Louis headquarters where
“the majority of the common evidence is likely to be located,”
the panel said in its decision.  Lawsuits were filed beginning in June after wheat modified
to withstand Monsanto’s Roundup Ready weed killer was discovered
growing on an Oregon farm eight years after nationwide field
tests ended. Monsanto said in June that the wheat, found growing
on less than 1 percent of the farmer’s 125-acre (51-hectare)
field, could have been intentionally planted.  Discovery of the wheat prompted some Asian countries to
halt imports of western-white and feed wheat. Plaintiffs, who
include an environmental group and a  Washington  farm, accused
Monsanto of failing to take necessary steps to prevent the
altered wheat from contaminating regular wheat.  The case is In re Monsanto Co. Genetically Engineered Wheat
Litigation, MDL 2473, U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
