Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s biggest
distiller, reported slower first-quarter revenue growth than
analysts anticipated amid declining sales in Europe and a
slowdown in some  emerging markets .  Organic revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 3
percent, the London-based company  said today  in a statement,
trailing the 4 percent median estimate of 13 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “While there are headwinds in some emerging markets,
including the impact of the government policies in  China , there
are also markets in which we continue to deliver robust
growth,” Diageo Chief Executive Officer Ivan Menezes said in
the statement.  Diageo is seeking expansion in emerging markets to tap
demand for products including Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky,
Guinness stout and Smirnoff vodka in faster-growth areas. Sales
fell 1.1 percent at its western Europe  unit , while revenue in
Latin America and in the  Africa , Eastern Europe and Turkey
division gained 11 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. Sales
in Diageo’s largest region, North America, rose 5.1 percent.  Sales in Asia edged up 0.6 percent. Diageo consolidated
control over a maker of Chinese baijiu liquor last year. Chinese
government cutbacks on extravagant spending and gifting are
weighing on sales of premium drinks, Diageo’s Chief Financial
Officer Deirdre Mahlan said in July, adding that the company was
seeing “soft spots” in some emerging markets including Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
