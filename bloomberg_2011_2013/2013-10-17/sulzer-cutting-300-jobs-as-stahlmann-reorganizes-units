Sulzer AG (SUN)  said it’s eliminating 300
jobs as the Swiss manufacturer reorganizes to make up for
declining European demand at its waste-water pump business. The
stock dropped to a 13 1/2-month low.  About half the cuts have already been implemented, and
about 100 positions are scheduled to go at Sulzer’s headquarters
in Winterthur, the company said in a  statement  today.
“Recurring benefits” of about 25 million francs ($28 million)
are forecast starting in 2014, following charges of about that
amount this year because of the reorganization, including the
 workforce  reduction.  Profitability in 2013 is forecast at 9 percent of sales,
excluding one-time items, compared to 10.2 percent in 2012,
Chief Executive Officer Klaus Stahlmann said on a conference
call. Sulzer had forecast a “slightly lower” full-year margin.  The economy of the euro area nations that neighbor
 Switzerland  returned to growth in the second quarter following
an 18-month recession. Sulzer said today that demand at its pump
business was “very strong” in the Asia-Pacific region, versus
a “comparably weak” market in  Europe .  “All the measures we are taking should take us back to the
profitability of previous years,” Stahlmann said. “In the
first three months, we had under-utilization of capacities,
which are very difficult to undo over the next nine months.”  Sulzer  dropped  as much as 6.3 percent to 129.60 francs, the
lowest intraday price since Sept. 3, 2012, and was trading down
5.4 percent at 11:11 a.m. in Zurich. The stock has dropped 9.2
percent this year, valuing the company at 4.5 billion francs.  Cardo Woes  The company’s global workforce totaled more than 17,900
employees at the end of 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The main reason for the job cuts is the performance
of the Cardo Flow Solutions waste-water pump business, which was
acquired in 2011, Stahlmann said today. Sulzer paid $935 million
to  Assa Abloy AB (ASSAB)  for the business in a deal brokered by former
CEO Ton Buechner.  Nine-month new orders rose 1.8 percent to 3 billion francs,
Sulzer said. The manufacturer reiterated a forecast for slight
growth in full-year order intake. Sales will be at about the
same level as last year, Sulzer said, scaling back from an
earlier forecast of a slight increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
