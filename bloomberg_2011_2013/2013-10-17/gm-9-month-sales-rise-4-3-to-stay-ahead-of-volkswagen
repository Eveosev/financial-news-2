General Motors Co. (GM) ’s nine-month
worldwide sales rose 4.6 percent to 7.25 million as the largest
U.S. automaker vies with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Volkswagen AG
for the top spot globally.  Third-quarter deliveries rose 5.5 percent to almost 2.4
million cars and trucks with the largest gains in  North America 
and the International Operations unit, which includes China, the
Detroit-based automaker said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  GM, Toyota and VW are locked in a three-way race for global
sales supremacy. Toyota recaptured the annual global lead from
GM in 2012 as the Japanese automaker recovered from Asian
natural disasters the previous year. Then GM edged out Toyota
for the top spot in this year’s second quarter, narrowing the
Asian automaker’s lead.  Toyota hasn’t yet announced its third-quarter global sales
results.  VW (VOW)  deliveries rose 4.8 percent to 7.03 million cars and
trucks during the three quarter period, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker said Oct. 11 in a statement.  The toughest battle between GM and VW is playing out in
China where both automakers have forecast sales climbing to 3
million this year. GM’s lead over VW in China narrowed to less
than 1 percent in 2012.  VW finished the third quarter ahead of GM in China. The
German automaker’s nine-months sales in China rose 18 percent to
2.35 million cars and sport-utility vehicles, boosted by locally
produced vehicles such as Audi’s Q3 and Q5 sport-utility
vehicles. European deliveries contracted 2.4 percent to 2.73
million vehicles.  Volkswagen’s Targets  The maker of VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles is relying on
growth in  China  to help meet ambitious targets. VW has a goal of
passing GM and Toyota by 2018 to become the world’s biggest auto
manufacturer.  Sales of GM and its partners in China rose 11 percent to
2.31 million during the first three quarters compared with the
same period a year earlier. Deliveries of GM’s Cadillac
increased 51 percent during that time as the automaker works to
expand the luxury brand in China.  Cadillac also helped increase GM sales in the U.S. where
deliveries rose 7.6 percent during the first three quarters
compared with a year earlier, according to researcher Autodata
Corp.  GM gained 1.5 percent to $35.66 at the close yesterday in
 New York . The shares have climbed 24 percent this year, compared
with 22 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
