The pound strengthened the most in
four weeks against the dollar after a government report showed
U.K. retail sales rose more in September than analysts forecast.  Sterling advanced versus all of its 16 major peers as the
data added to signs Britain’s economy is gathering momentum. The
pound also gained versus the euro. U.K. 10-year government bonds
rose, with yields falling the most in more than three weeks, as
investors bet disruption from the U.S. debt-ceiling debate will
prompt the  Federal Reserve  to maintain asset purchases. The U.K.
sold 4.75 billion pounds ($7.68 billion) of five-year gilts.  “There’s a lot of bullish sentiment towards the pound,”
said Kathleen Brooks, European research director at Forex.com in
 London . “It’s being driven by a weak tone in the dollar
combined with the U.K. data. We could retest the high from early
October at $1.6260.”  The pound advanced 1.4 percent to $1.6168 at 4:30 p.m.
London time, the biggest gain since Sept. 18. Sterling
strengthened 0.4 percent to 84.55 pence per euro. It depreciated
to 85.10 pence on Oct. 11, the weakest since Sept. 2.  The  Bank of England  may raise  interest rates  as soon as
next year, Chief Economist Spencer Dale said in an interview
with the  Guardian newspaper .  “Conceivably it could be 2014,” he was reported as
saying. “But it would have to be in a world where you had quite
strong growth, perhaps stronger than you have got now, and a
recovery in productivity weaker than I would expect.”  Sales Increase  Retail sales including fuel rose 0.6 percent from August,
when they declined 0.8 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said. The median forecast of 21 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 0.4 percent.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  just after midnight signed into
law a measure ending the 16-day government shutdown and
extending the nation’s borrowing authority until early next
year.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and Pacific Investment Management Co. said
the Fed will postpone tapering bond purchases as a result of the
debt-ceiling debate.  “With the dollar element now more negative, we could get
another move higher” for the pound, said  Derek Halpenny ,
European head of global-markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd in London. “We’re in a very short-term
window without U.S. fiscal uncertainty. March is perhaps the
earliest the Fed will feel comfortable about going,” he said,
referring to a withdrawal of asset purchases.  Pound’s Gain  Three-month option prices show traders are becoming less
bearish on the pound versus the dollar.  The premium for options granting the right to sell sterling
versus those granting the right to buy narrowed to the least
since January. The three-month 25-delta risk reversal was at
minus 0.54 percentage point, a level not seen since Jan. 8.  Sterling appreciated 5.5 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro strengthened
4.1 percent, while the dollar weakened 1.3 percent.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield dropped nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.74 percent. That’s the biggest
drop since Sept. 24. The 2.25 percent bond maturing in September
2023 climbed 0.745, or 7.45 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount,
to 95.745.  The Debt Management Office sold the five-year securities at
an average yield of 1.583 percent, compared with 1.652 percent
at the previous auction on Sept. 19. Investors bid for 1.64
times the amount on offer, versus 1.59 last month.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 3.7
percent this year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg
World Bond Indexes. Treasuries dropped 2.5 percent and German
securities declined 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
