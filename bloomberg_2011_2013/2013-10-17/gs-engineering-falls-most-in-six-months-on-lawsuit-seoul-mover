GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360) 
fell the most in six months in Seoul trading after the South
Korean builder said it was sued by a group of investors over
losses caused by unexpected cost increases on overseas projects.  GS Engineering dropped as much as 4.8 percent, headed for
the biggest decline since April 15, to 35,400 won and traded at
36,050 won as of 12:35 p.m. South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index
rose 0.3 percent.  Fifteen investors filed the lawsuit against GS Engineering
on Oct. 8 at the  Seoul Central District Court , the Seoul-based
company said in a regulatory filing today. The investors claim
GS Engineering failed to make proper estimates in financial
statements for costs that may arise from the projects, according
to today’s statement. The builder said in April it expects an
operating loss this year because of the cost increases.  The company said it will appoint a lawyer to handle the
case.  GS Engineering in April reported an unexpected  operating
loss  in the first quarter because costs increased for some of
its overseas environment-related projects. That caused shares of
builders to slump on concerns that other construction companies
may face similar problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
