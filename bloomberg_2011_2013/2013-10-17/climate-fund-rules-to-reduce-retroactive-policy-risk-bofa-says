A Green Climate Fund board decision
on its relationship with climate talks will limit retroactive
policy decisions and cut private-sector investor risk, according
to Bank of America Corp.’s head of carbon.  Arrangements between the GCF board and the United Nations
climate talks “minimize the risk of retroactive policy
reversal, one of the most significant concerns for investors and
the private sector,” Abyd Karmali, also an adviser to the
Climate Markets & Investment Association, said Oct. 15 by e-mail, without giving details of the decision. “The Green
Climate Fund is developing in a really mature way.”  GCF is being set up alongside  UN climate talks  to transfer
a portion of $100 billion a year in annual aid that developed
countries pledged to emerging nations by 2020 to help adapt to
global warming and cut greenhouse-gas emissions. The GCF is
seeking to raise its first funds after May, said Karmali, who
observes board meetings, including one held last week in Paris.  Last week’s meeting decided that attracting private finance
would be a core performance indicator for the fund, Karmali
said.  A donor-country meeting will probably take place from next
May to September, he said.  “That fits well” with a planned meeting of heads of state
on climate protection by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in
September, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
