Germany’s government bonds rose,
with 10-year securities snapping a two-day decline, after U.S.
lawmakers agreed on a plan to end a federal shutdown and raise
the nation’s borrowing limit, averting a default.  German 10-year yields dropped from near the highest level
in more than three weeks before  Spain  sells as much as 2.5
billion euros ($3.39 billion) of three- and five-year notes
today.  France  plans to auction debt due between 2016 and 2040.
President  Barack Obama  signed into law a measure ending the 16-day U.S. government shutdown and extending the nation’s
borrowing authority until early next year, the White House said.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.89 percent at 7:25 a.m. London after
rising to 1.94 percent yesterday, the highest since Sept. 23.
The 2 percent security due in August 2023 rose 0.33, or 3.30
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.96.  Spain last sold five-year debt on Oct. 3 at an average
yield of 3.128 percent, compared with a rate of 3.477 percent at
a previous auction on Sept. 5.  German bonds lost 2.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish securities
returned 9.3 percent and Italy’s gained 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
