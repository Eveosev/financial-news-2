South African corn futures rose to
the highest level in a week on concern that insufficient
rainfall in the country’s main growing regions will curb output.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 0.4 percent 2,184 rand ($222) a metric ton, the
highest since Oct. 10, by the midday close on the South African
Futures Exchange. The contract increased for a fourth day, the
longest streak of advances since the six days through Aug. 22.
The white variety for delivery in the same month climbed 0.3
percent to 2,369 rand a ton.  The South African Weather Service has forecast no rain for
Welkom in the Free State province, the region that is the
country’s biggest producer of the grain. There is a 30 percent
chance of showers tomorrow and 60 percent on Oct. 19 and 20, the
service said on its website.  “We are still waiting for proper rain to come through,”
Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader from Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd.,
said by phone in Johannesburg. “What we have experienced so far
is not enough at all.”  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed , while a meal made
from the white variety is a staple food in the country.  Wheat for delivery in December was unchanged at 3,468 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
