Rubber rallied to a three-week high
as U.S. lawmakers reached a deal to raise the debt ceiling,
easing concern of a default in the world’s biggest economy.  The contract for March delivery gained as much as 2.3
percent to 276 yen a kilogram ($2,795 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, the highest level since Sept. 27, before
trading at 273.2 yen at 11:24 a.m. local time.  The yen weakened versus its major peers. The U.S. Congress
voted to halt the 16-day government shutdown and raise the U.S.
debt limit, ending the nation’s fiscal impasse. A weaker
Japanese currency increases the attractiveness of yen-denominated contracts.  The U.S. resolution is bringing relief to the market while
higher oil prices and the weaker yen are also supportive, said
Naohiro Niimura, a partner at Market Risk Advisory, a research
company in Tokyo.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 20,855  yuan  ($3,420) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 0.3 percent to 81.05 baht ($2.59) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
