Cattle futures fell from a nine-month high on speculation that workers at a JBS SA-owned plant
in  Colorado  will strike, slowing production of U.S. beef. Hogs
declined.  JBS, the world’s largest beef producer, said it is in talks
with 3,000 workers to form a new labor contract. The plant in
Greeley, Colorado, slaughters 5,200 head of cattle a day,
according to the company. The  workers  are prepared to strike if
negotiations break down, according to a statement on the United
Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 7 website.  The possible strike is “short-term bearish” because the
plant will buy fewer animals,  Steve Georgy , a vice president at
Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “If you’re going to have this whole big glut of
cattle that can’t go anywhere, that’s why it’s negative.”  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 1.1 percent to
close at $1.31775 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching $1.34, the highest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 16.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement slid 0.6
percent to $1.666 a pound, heading for the first weekly drop in
six.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.4 percent to
88.45 cents a pound on the CME. The contract has rallied 10
percent since the end of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
