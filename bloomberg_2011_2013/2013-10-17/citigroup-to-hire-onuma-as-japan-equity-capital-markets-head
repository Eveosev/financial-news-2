Citigroup Inc. (C)  will hire Kenichi Onuma as head of  Japan  equity capital markets from  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
to bolster investment banking in the country as companies
increasingly tap stock investors for funding.  Onuma will start on Nov. 25, Mika Nemoto, a Tokyo-based
spokeswoman for the third-biggest U.S. bank, said by phone
today. Onuma joined Barclays in July 2011 and previously worked
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Kyota Narimatsu, a Tokyo-based spokesman
for Barclays, declined to comment.  Companies from  Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. (2587)  to Dentsu Inc.
have tapped equity markets this year as Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s economic stimulus fuels a stock rally. Japan’s benchmark
 Topix Index (TPX)  has climbed 41 percent in 2013, the best performance
among major developed markets.  Equity offerings by Japanese companies have raised 3.8
trillion yen ($39 billion) this year, already exceeding 2.1
trillion yen for all of 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Citigroup is ranked 11th among arrangers of Japanese
share sales, the same as last year, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
