Cattle futures extended a rally to
an nine-month high on signs that tight animal supplies will
shrink U.S. beef output. Hog prices rose.  At a cattle auction yesterday in Elkhart, Texas,  steers 
weighing 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 600 pounds fetched as
much as $1.77 a pound, up 1.1 percent from a week earlier,
according to Anderson County Livestock Auction. U.S. beef
production is estimated to decline 5.6 percent in 2014 after a
1.2 percent drop this year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said Sept. 12.  “There are less cattle available than what we thought
going into this time frame,”  Ryan Turner , a risk-management
consultant with FCStone Group Inc. in  Kansas City ,  Missouri ,
said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.337 a pound at 11:20 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching $1.34, the highest for a most-active contract
since Jan. 16.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement increased 0.5
percent to $1.685 a pound on the CME. The price reached a record
$1.6995 on Oct. 14.  Hog futures for December settlement climbed 0.2 percent to
88.975 cents a pound. Earlier, the price touched 89.9 cents, the
highest for the most-active contract since Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
