Carla Bruni , the Frieze Art Fair, Ibsen and a chocolate festival are our choices for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  You have a week left to see Carrie Cracknell’s well-reviewed staging of Ibsen’s “A Doll’s  House ,” a Young Vic production that moved to the  West End  and is now New York-bound.  Hattie Morahan plays Nora, a perfect wife and mom with a big secret: Years earlier, she faked a signature to get a loan. Now the man who arranged the loan is calling in the favor -- and Nora’s in a bind.  Ends Oct. 26 at the Duke of York’s Theatre. Information:  http://www.youngvic.org  or +44-20-7922-2922.  DINING  Merchants Tavern, the new casual restaurant of chef  Angela Hartnett , is open seven days a week serving seasonal British food. There’s a three-course  set lunch  for 22 pounds on Saturdays, and sharing dishes are available at the bar:  http://www.merchantstavern.co.uk/  or +44-20-7060-5335.  Marianne Lumb is another woman chef with a new restaurant, Marianne, in Notting Hill. She’s worked at the River Cafe and Le Gavroche and made the finals of the TV series “Masterchef: the Professionals.” The dining room is tiny, so book well ahead:  http://www.mariannerestaurant.com/  or +44-203-675-7750.  VISUAL ARTS  The Frieze Art Fair is back with a tighter selection of contemporary art than last year. Unexpected displays: Damien Hirst’s kaleidoscopic “Scatter Gun” (2012), made with scalpel blades and priced 425,000 pounds ($687,000); and the real-life people reenacting James Lee Byars’s 1967 “Four in a Dress” by appearing on a plinth wearing a single large garment. (The performative work is for sale at an undisclosed price.)  The more traditional Frieze Masters has striking photographs -- of naked Carla Bruni, of Gianni Agnelli on his private plane, of  Julian Schnabel  in paint-splattered pajamas -- and an exquisite room of Egon Schiele drawings (worthy of the National Gallery’s current Vienna show) at Vienna-based W&K.  Frieze ends Sunday:  http://www.friezelondon.com  and  http://www.friezemasters.com .  MUSIC  Mini music festivals are taking place all over London over the next fortnight under the name Oxjam to raise money for the  Oxfam  charity. Ticket prices start from as little as 4 pounds, a potential bargain given that you may see future stars at all-day events. Scores of unknown young musicians are joined by a sprinkling of stars such as  Iron Maiden  singer Bruce Dickinson, who opens the Chiswick event. Other venues are in Brixton, Islington, Notting Hill and Shoreditch.

Expect demonstrations, tastings, and many tempting boxes on sale. Information:  http://www.salonduchocolat.co.uk .  The Birmingham Royal Ballet -- one of the U.K.’s top companies -- performs “Sleeping Beauty” at Sadler’s Wells, with baroque sets and some 150 hand-sewn costumes:  http://www.sadlerswells.com  or +44-20-7863-8198.
