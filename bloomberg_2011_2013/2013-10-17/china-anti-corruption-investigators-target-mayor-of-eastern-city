China  anti-corruption investigators
announced a probe into the mayor of Nanjing in the country’s
east, the latest official to come into question under a
Communist Party campaign to root out graft.  Ji Jianye, mayor since 2009 of the city of more than 3
million people, faces allegations of serious disciplinary and
legal violations, according to a statement posted today to the
Ministry of Supervision website. Such claims have in the past
paved the way for formal charges such as bribery or
embezzlement.  The probe reflects the party’s efforts to press ahead with
graft charges against what it calls both “tigers” and
“flies,” or officials up and down the government hierarchy.
Leaders including President Xi Jinping have warned that
corruption threatens the party’s grip on power.  Other officials under investigation include Liu Tienan,
former vice chairman of the country’s planning agency, and the
deputy party secretary of Sichuan province, Li Chuncheng.  Zhang
Shuguang , former deputy chief engineer at China’s Railways
Ministry, is being prosecuted on charges he took about 47
million  yuan  ($7.7 million) in bribes in 2000-2011.  Ji is under investigation for “economic issues,” the
party’s flagship People’s Daily newspaper said on its website
today. Before coming to Nanjing, Ji served as an official in
Yangzhou. During his time in that eastern city, Ji steered
construction contracts to one engineering company, the People’s
Daily said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
