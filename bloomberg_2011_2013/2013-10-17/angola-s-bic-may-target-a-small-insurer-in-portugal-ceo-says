Banco BIC SA,  Angola ’s biggest
private bank by number of branches, could make a bid for an
insurer in Portugal after buying a local lender in the southern
European country last year.  “In Portugal, it is possible that we’ll make an offer for
a small insurance company,” Chief Executive Officer Fernando Teles said in a phone interview today. “BIC’s shareholders have
yet to make a decision.” The CEO’s comments were previously
reported by Portuguese news agency Lusa.  Banco BIC, which in the last two years paid the Portuguese
state a combined 82.5 million euros ($113 million) for Lisbon-based  Banco Portugues de Negocios SA ’s operations in its home
country as well as Cape Verde and  Brazil , isn’t looking to buy
more Portuguese banking assets at this time, Teles said.  “We’re focused on consolidating BPN’s operations,” Teles
said.  BIC plans to open a new insurance company in Angola at the
beginning of next year, the executive said, without providing
details. Teles reiterated that the company plans to expand into
 Namibia  and open a representative office in Johannesburg. The
bank is also studying Botswana, Republic of Congo, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Gabon as possible
markets, Teles said in an earlier interview in March.  Teles, along with Portuguese billionaire Americo Amorim and
Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola’s president, are BIC’s
three biggest shareholders, according to Teles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
