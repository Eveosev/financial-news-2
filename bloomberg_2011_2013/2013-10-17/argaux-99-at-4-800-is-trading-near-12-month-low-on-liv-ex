A case of 1999 Chateau Margaux, a
Bordeaux first-growth wine estate, sold for 3,000 pounds
($4,800) on Liv-ex yesterday, near its lowest level for a year,
as investors look beyond first-growth estates to boost returns.  The price on yesterday’s sale, while 1.7 percent up from
the 2,950 pounds which 12 bottles fetched on Sept. 27, still
left the vintage below its previous trading band for this year,
according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading Bordeaux
vintages, has declined since March 15, paring an 8 percent gain
made in the previous 11 weeks to leave it 1 percent up since the
start of this year. The ratio of bids to offers on the London-based online exchange has fallen to its lowest since August last
year, according to the exchange.  “Bids are dropping away,” Liv-ex said in a market
commentary blog this week. “It would seem that fine wine prices
may struggle to rise with the current ratio.”  The Margaux ’99 is trading 25 percent below the 4,000 pound
level it reached in April 2011, when Chinese demand for top
Bordeaux wines was peaking, although is more than triple the 850
pounds at which it traded back in March 2004, Liv-ex data shows.  The 1999 Margaux ranks as the estate’s seventh highest-priced wine of the past 15 years, trailing those from 2011,
2010, 2009, 2005, 2003 and 2000, according to merchant prices
collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  First Growth  The vintage was awarded a 94 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , putting it below at least six
subsequent years, according to the eRobertParker.com  website .
Vintages since then with higher ratings include the 2000 wine,
which was given 100 points, the 2005, which was assigned 98+
points, and the 2003, 2009 and 2010 vintages, which each scored
99 points.  Chateau Margaux, whose wines have been sold in London since
the early 18th century, was acquired in 1977 by Greek retail
magnate Andre Mentzelopoulos and has been run since his death in
1980 by his daughter Corinne.  The estate has 80 hectares (198 acres) planted with red-grape vines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and
Cabernet Franc and 12 hectares with white Sauvignon Blanc.  It produces an annual average 130,000 bottles of its main
wine, a similar quantity of second wine Pavillon Rouge du
Chateau Margaux and 15,000 bottles of white Pavillon Blanc,
according to its  website .  The vineyard is on the left bank of the Gironde estuary and
ranked among the top Medoc first-growth estates in the
classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition, which remains in force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
