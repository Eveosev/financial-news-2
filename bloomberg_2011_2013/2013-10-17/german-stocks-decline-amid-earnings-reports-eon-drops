German stocks  declined, paring a
two-day advance that saw the  DAX Index (DAX)  reach a record, as U.S.
lawmakers reached agreement on ending the debt-limit impasse and
brokers downgraded companies.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , Germany’s biggest telephone-service
provider, fell 1.6 percent after Bank of America Corp. cut its
rating. EON AG, Germany’s largest utility, fell 2.3 percent
after UBS AG reduced its recommendation on the stock.  The DAX Index slipped 0.3 percent to 8,816.6 at 9:31 a.m.
in  Frankfurt . The gauge has still rallied 2.6 percent so far
this month, extending its 2013 increase to 16 percent, amid
optimism that U.S. Congress would end the fiscal impasse and
Janet Yellen, nominated to head the Federal Reserve, won’t rush
to withdraw stimulus. The HDAX Index lost 0.3 percent today.  “The index can’t make new highs every day,” Ion-Marc
Valahu, a co-founder and fund manager at Clairinvest in Geneva,
wrote in an e-mail. “Even though we got a deal in the U.S., the
shutdown has damaged sentiment.”  In the U.S., President  Barack Obama  signed into law a
measure to extend the nation’s borrowing authority into early
2014 and end the government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The
deal avoided a default of the world’s biggest economy and means
that federal workers will return to their jobs from today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
