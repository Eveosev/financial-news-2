Car Charging Group Inc. (CCGI) , the Miami
Beach-based operator of electric-vehicle charging stations,
acquired the assets of bankrupt competitor  Ecotality Inc. (ECTYQ)  for
$3.34 million, gaining a $230 million network partially funded
by the U.S. Energy Department.  Car Charging paid cash for Ecotality’s Blink Network and
related assets, including more than 12,500 charging stations,
according to a statement today.  Car Charging also assumed the assets of The EV Project, an
initiative that received a $114.8 million Energy Department
grant and was managed by Ecotality. Outside investors matched
the grant, according to the statement.  The acquisition is Car Charging’s fourth this year as it
expands its network. The company now owns and operates more than
13,400 charging stations in 35 states and three countries,
according to the statement.  The deal will help the company “continue our efforts to
further accelerate the adoption of EVs nationwide,” Chief
Executive Officer Michael Farkas said in the statement.  Ecotality filed for bankruptcy last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
