Plans by the director of the U.S.
National Security Agency to step down early next year preceded
the backlash over revelations about the NSA’s surveillance
programs, President  Barack Obama ’s spokesman said.  Army General Keith Alexander indicated in March, when his
term was extended for a third time since 2005, that he was
interested in retiring in early 2014,  Jay Carney , Obama’s press
secretary, said at a White House news briefing today.  Asked whether Alexander’s departure was prompted by
revelations from former contractor Edward Snowden about NSA
eavesdropping on Americans and U.S. allies, Carney said, “The
answer is no.”  Alexander, 61, who also leads the U.S. Cyber Command,
affirmed “several weeks ago” to Obama that he still intended
to step aside, Carney said. “General Alexander has served an
extraordinary tenure and capably led these agencies through
critical periods of growth and transition,” Carney said.  Snowden, 30, faces espionage charges in the U.S. for
disclosing to news organizations secret surveillance programs in
which the government collects bulk data on phone and Internet
use to monitor online activity of foreigners suspected of
plotting terrorist attacks. Russia granted Snowden a one-year
asylum on Aug. 1.  The spying revelations have created tensions with other
countries, including NATO ally  Germany . Brazilian President
 Dilma Rousseff  called off a state visit to the U.S. last month
over the disclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
