Gold rebounded in  London  on
speculation some buyers will take advantage of lower prices.  Prices slid 23 percent this year. Global sales of bullion
bars and coins gained 78 percent in the second quarter,
according to the London-based World Gold Council.  “China is back and checking for availability,” said
Bernard Sin, head of currency and metal trading at
bullion refiner MKS (Switzerland) SA in Geneva.  Gold for immediate delivery jumped 0.8 percent to $1,292.44
an ounce by 8:53 a.m. in London. Prices earlier today dropped
0.6 percent as the  U.S. Congress  reached an agreement to raise
the debt celling.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
