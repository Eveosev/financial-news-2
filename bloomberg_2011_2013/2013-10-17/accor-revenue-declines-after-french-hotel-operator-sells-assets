Accor SA (AC) , Europe’s largest hotel
operator, said third-quarter revenue fell 3.1 percent because of
the euro’s strength and divestments.  Sales declined to 1.44 billion euros ($2 billion) from 1.49
billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based owner of the
Sofitel and Ibis brands said in a statement today.  Accor is in the first year of a three-year reorganization
that includes increasing its focus on  emerging markets , reducing
debt, selling some properties and cutting costs. It plans to
reduce its share of leased or owned properties to 20 percent by
2016, from about 58 percent, with the rest operated under
franchise or management contracts.  Accor said it opened 14,100 rooms during the first nine
months. Its three-year plan foresees opening 30,000 rooms a year
through 2016.  In August, the company announced the appointment of
Sebastien Bazin, the former head of European investing at Accor
shareholder Colony Capital LLC, as chairman and chief executive
officer.  Accor sold its chain of more than 1,100 Motel 6 budget
hotels in North America to Blackstone Group LP for $1.9 billion
last year. The company used some of the proceeds to expand in
regions including Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
