Eleven Nobel Peace Prize laureates
have appealed to Russian President  Vladimir Putin  to get piracy
charges dropped against Greenpeace activists who boarded an oil
platform to protest Arctic drilling.  “We are confident that you share our desire to respect the
right to non-violent protest,” the signatories said, according
to a text of a letter e-mailed by Greenpeace today. “As you
know, the Greenpeace activists were unarmed and used only
peaceful means to demonstrate their opposition to the oil
drilling operations threatening the Arctic.”  While the Russian leader had “great respect” for the
Nobel laureates, he’s unable to influence the judicial process,
the RIA Novosti state news service cited Putin’s spokesman,
 Dmitry Peskov , as saying.  The 28 activists and two journalists from 18 countries face
as long as 15 years in jail for alleged piracy during their
Arctic protest. Two  Greenpeace  protesters scaled  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ’s
Prirazlomnoye rig in the Pechora Sea on Sept. 18. A day later
 Russia ’s Coast Guard boarded the group’s Arctic Sunrise ship in
international waters and towed the vessel to Murmansk.  The 11 Nobel Peace Prize winners include South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu and others from countries including Iran,
Yemen and Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
