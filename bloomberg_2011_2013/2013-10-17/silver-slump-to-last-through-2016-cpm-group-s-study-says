Silver will extend a slump in the
next three years, based on annual averages, as investor demand
ebbs, CPM Group said in a long-term outlook.  The metal will average $24 an ounce this year, Erica Rannestad, a commodity analyst at New York-based CPM, said in a
telephone interview before the release today of the research
company’s 208-page  study  on industry trends from 2013 to 2022.
That estimate was down 23 percent from the Comex futures average
of $31.187 in 2012. Last year, the metal dropped 12 percent from
2011.  ‘Declining investment demand is expected to weigh heavily
on prices in the medium term” with the average annual price
dropping through 2016, CPM said in a statement. “Investors will
command lower prices in order to absorb the surpluses in the
market.”  Through yesterday, silver tumbled 29 percent this year.
Among the 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index, only corn posted a bigger slump. The metal entered a  bear
market  on April 1, partly on concern that the  Federal Reserve 
would reduce the pace of U.S. monetary stimulus.  This year, investment demand for silver probably will fall
by almost half from 170.3 million ounces in 2012, CPM said.  Jewelry and silverware demand is expected to benefit in the
medium term because of lower prices, CPM said.  Silver will rise to a nominal record in the period from
2017 to 2022 as investor demand rebounds and industrial use
increases, CPM said.  On the Comex, silver futures reach a record $50.35 in
January 1980 as the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market. On
April 25, 2011, the metal climbed to $49.845, the second-highest
ever.  To contact the reporter on this story:
