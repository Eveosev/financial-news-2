Gasoline fell from a two-week high,
following crude lower after a report that oil inventories
increased last week while refineries were shut for seasonal
maintenance.  Futures slid after the industry-funded  American Petroleum
Institute  reported yesterday that U.S. crude supplies climbed by
5.94 million barrels last week. The API said gasoline stocks
dropped 2.2 million barrels. The Energy Information
Administration said its weekly inventory report won’t be
released today.  “Products are being dragged down by crude which is
reacting to another significant inventory build,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  “When
refiners return from maintenance, we will see utilization rise
and gasoline inventories build once again.”  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.85 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.6736 a gallon at 10:05 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 31 percent below the
100-day average.  The EIA’s release schedule was disrupted by the 16-day
partial government shutdown, which ended last night with
approval by the House and the Senate of a bill that also raised
the debt ceiling just as the U.S. was reaching its borrowing
limit. Jon Cogan, a spokesman for the agency in  Washington , said
in an e-mail that “schedules for the resumption of the reports
will be announced as they become available.”  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 36 cents
to $11.56 a barrel. The  premium  to Brent fell 73 cents to $1.90
a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to $3.36 a
gallon, the third consecutive increase, Heathrow, Florida-based
AAA said today on its website. Prices are 39.6 cents below a
year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery fell 3.2
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $3.0073 a gallon on volume that was 47
percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI gained 16 cents to $25.55 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent slipped 31 cents to $16.48.  To contact the reporter on this story:
