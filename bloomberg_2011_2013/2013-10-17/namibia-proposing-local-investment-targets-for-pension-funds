Namibia  is proposing legal
amendments to compel insurers and pension-fund managers to
invest at least 35 percent of their assets in the domestic
economy.  Insurers and pension funds must also invest at least 1.75
percent of their assets in local, unlisted investments,
according to the draft amendment, which has been approved by the
cabinet. Institutional investors will have 12 months to comply
with the new rules after they are published.  The government is proposing the rule change in a bid to
curb capital flight and boost domestic growth, after Namibiaâ€™s
central bank said earlier this month that investments in South
Africa come largely through savings and institutional investors.
Namibian portfolio investments in  South Africa  totaled 4.5
billion Namibian dollars ($457 million) last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
