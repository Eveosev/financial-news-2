President  Barack Obama  urged Congress to move forward with work on a new immigration law, a farm bill and a “sensible budget” with the deadlock over funding the government and raising the debt ceiling broken for now.  Before the end of the year, Obama said, Democrats and Republicans can pass legislation supported by voters.  “There’s a lot of work ahead of us, including the need to earn back the trust of the American people,” he said at the White House.  Obama spoke tonight after the Senate voted 81-18 to approve a deal that would end the partial shutdown of the federal government and raise the U.S. debt limit, ending a weeks-long stalemate between the White House and Republicans in the U.S. House. The measure now goes to the House, where Speaker  John Boehner  said Republicans won’t block the compromise.  “I will sign it immediately,” he said.
