Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina named Maria Concepcion Castro interim Finance Minister
for Central America’s biggest economy after former minister
Pavel Centeno resigned, citing health concerns.  Castro, who has a masters degree in finance from the
University of  Chile , had served as deputy minister for financial
administration since Perez Molina’s government took office in
January 2012.  Centeno, who oversaw a $700 million bond sale in February,
had offered his resignation in March last year, just weeks after
taking office, when he accused the opposition of subjecting him
to “political manipulation.” Perez Molina rejected his request
and Centeno stayed on.  The yield on Guatemala’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2022 was little changed at 5.31 percent at 11:44 a.m. New York
time.  Guatemala is rated BB by  Standard & Poor’s , two levels
below investment grade, putting the country of 15 million in the
same category as Hungary and  Costa Rica .  To contact the reporter on this story:
