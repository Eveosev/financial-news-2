European  stocks  erased their decline
in the final half an hour of trading, leaving the Stoxx Europe
600 Index at a five-year high, as U.S. equities rebounded after
Congress agreed to extend the American government’s debt limit.  SABMiller Plc rose 4.2 percent after posting an unexpected
increase in lager volumes. Sulzer dropped 4.4 percent as the
Swiss pump maker cut its full-year sales forecast for a second
time. Outotec slid the most in almost five years after the
supplier of smelters to mining companies reduced its guidance
for 2013. Royal  KPN (KPN)  NV plunged 7.9 percent after America Movil
SAB withdrew its $9.7 billion takeover offer for the company.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.1 percent to 315.98 at the close,
rebounding from a decline of as much as 0.6 percent. The equity
benchmark rose to its highest level since June 2008 yesterday on
optimism U.S. lawmakers would reach a deal to reopen the
government and increase the debt ceiling.  “There’s a risk of a mismatch between investor optimism
and company earnings,” said Claire Chaves D’Oliveira, head of
equity management at Groupama Asset Management SA in Paris.
“Companies have surprised today on the downside on very well-known macro situations, like an emerging-market slowdown, but
analysts haven’t been able to keep up. There’s long-term
optimism, but short-term disappointment.”  Debt Limit  In the U.S., President  Barack Obama  signed into law a
measure to extend the nation’s borrowing authority into early
2014 and end the government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The
deal avoided a default and means that federal workers will
return to their jobs from today.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose as high as 1,726.15,
above its record close on Sept. 18.  Dagong Global Credit Rating downgraded the U.S. to A- from
A and reiterated its negative outlook on the government of the
world’s largest economy. The rating company said the U.S. will
struggle to avoid repeating this week’s political impasse over
the limit on sovereign debt, according to a statement.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 10 of the 18 western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.1 percent and
 France (CA) ’s CAC 40 dropped 0.1 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX
declined 0.4 percent.  SABMiller gained 4.2 percent to 3,167 pence after the
brewer of Peroni said lager volumes climbed 1 percent in the six
months through September. Analysts had predicted no growth,
according to the median estimate.  Carrefour SA added 3.1 percent to 27.64 euros, its highest
price since May 2011.  France ’s biggest retailer said sales at
its domestic hypermarkets open at least a year climbed 1.9
percent in the third quarter, the first growth since the second
quarter of 2011. Carrefour generated 46 percent of its total
sales in France last year.  BSkyB Soars  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  jumped 7.1 percent to
940 pence, its biggest rally since June 2010, after saying it
added 111,000 new broadband customers in the three months
through September. Sales jumped 7.5 percent to 1.84 billion
pounds ($2.97 billion) in the period, according to a statement.
That beat the 1.82 billion-pound  average analyst projection .  Sulzer (SUN)  fell 4.4 percent to 132.20 Swiss francs after
predicting that  2013 sales  will probably not exceed the 4.02
billion francs ($4.5 billion) generated in 2012. The pump
manufacturer predicted slight growth for revenue this year when
it reported  half-year results  on July 23. That was a downgrade
from an earlier forecast for moderate growth.  Outotec slumped 15 percent to 8.23 euros. The Finnish
company forecast that it will generate no more than 2.1 billion
euros ($2.9 billion) in sales in 2013 because its order intake
has declined in the first nine months of this year. Outotec had
predicted revenue of as much as 2.3 billion euros.  KPN Plunges  KPN tumbled 7.9 percent to 2.24 euros as America Movil
failed to persuade the Dutch phone carrier to accept a price of
2.40 euros a share. The Mexican telecommunications operator
owned by billionaire  Carlos Slim  still retains a stake of about
30 percent after dropping the bid, and has yet to decide what to
do with its holding, according to a company spokesman.  Nutreco NV slid 4 percent to 36.26 euros after the world’s
largest supplier of fish feed forecast earnings before interest,
taxes and amortization of about 255 million euros in 2013. The
company had predicted it would at least match last year’s 262.1
million euros.  Metso Oyj sank 6.3 percent to 27.18 euros after projecting
that full-year sales and earnings will probably drop more than
the engineering-services company had predicted because of lower
profitability at its Valmet Automotive Oy business.  Abengoa SA slumped 8.9 percent to 1.84 euros. The Seville,
Spain-based bioethanol producer sold 450 million euros of B-shares at 1.80 euros each, an 11 percent discount to yesterday’s
closing price.  The number of shares trading hands today in Stoxx 600-listed companies was 10 percent greater than the average of the
past 30 trading days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
