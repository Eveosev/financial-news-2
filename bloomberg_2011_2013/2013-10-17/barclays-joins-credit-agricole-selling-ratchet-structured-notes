Barclays Plc (BARC)  sold its largest
structured note in five months as it joined  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
in issuing securities that benefit when long-term interest rates
increase.  Britainâ€™s second-biggest bank by assets raised $82 million
from 10-year ratchet notes in its biggest offering since May 28,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors receive 6
percent in the first year, after which the coupon adjusts
depending on changes in the 10-year swap rate.  Jodie Gray, a London-based spokeswoman for Barclays,
declined to comment on the sale.  Ratchet notes allow investors to profit from moves in
interest rate swaps, which measure the cost of exchanging fixed-rate interest payments for floating. The swaps reached a two-year high of 3.18 percent on Sept. 5 before dropping to 2.76
percent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays issued $112 million of ratchet notes this month,
the most since June 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
 Credit Agricole  sold $42 million after raising $235 million in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
