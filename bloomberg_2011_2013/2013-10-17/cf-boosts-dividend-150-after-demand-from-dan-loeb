CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)  raised
its dividend by 150 percent, two months after activist investor
Dan Loebâ€™s Third Point LLC hedge fund demanded the fertilizer
maker raise its payout.  CF will pay a quarterly dividend of $1 a share, up from 40
cents previously, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said
today in a statement. The payout will be made to shareholders of
record as of Nov. 15, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
