Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-largest lender, will take steps to improve anti-money-laundering controls at its  New York  branch under a U.S. Federal
Reserve order citing lapses in its correspondent banking
business.  The Frankfurt-based company agreed to submit a written plan
to the central bank for enhancing the branch’s compliance with
requirements including those of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the
Fed said today in a cease-and-desist order. Commerzbank agreed
to the order without admitting or denying wrongdoing.  The Fed has been citing some of the world’s biggest banks
for lax controls over transfers that could allow terrorists and
drug rings to move money around the globe. U.S. regulators have
told Citigroup Inc.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
to tighten their procedures.  “Commerzbank is fully cooperating with the Federal Reserve
on this matter and is committed to satisfying the terms of the
agreement,” Margarita Thiel, a spokeswoman for the bank said in
an e-mailed statement today.  As part of its agreement, Commerzbank will hire a
consultant to perform a review of U.S. dollar clearing
transactions from May through October last year and report any
suspicious activity, the Fed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
