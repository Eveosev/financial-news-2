Federated Co-Operatives Ltd.’s
Regina  refinery  plans to shut down some units for a 49-day
maintenance turnaround starting in the last week of March, a
company executive said.  Operations will be reduced to 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a
day during the work from the plant’s full capacity of 130,000
barrels a day, Gil Le Dressay, Vice President of refinery
operations, said in an interview at an official opening event
for the plant’s newest expansion.  The Regina refinery usually schedules an annual turnaround
in the spring in which it shuts down about one-third of the
site’s operations and then restarts for full production for the
agricultural planting season, Le Dressay said.  The company completed a C$2.7 billion ($2.62 billion)
expansion of the refinery in October of last year that increased
its capacity from 100,000 barrels. Final unit revamps for the
expansion were completed this August.  The plant makes gasoline, diesel and lubricants from a
variety of heavy and light crude feedstocks, with the latest
expansion tailored toward light, sweet synthetic crude produced
from  Alberta ’s oil sands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
