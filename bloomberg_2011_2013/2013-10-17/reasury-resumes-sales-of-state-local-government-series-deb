The U.S. Treasury Department said
sales of its state and local government series of non-marketable
securities will resume at 1 p.m. Washington time today, ending a
suspension period that began May 17, the department said in a
statement.  Sales of the SLGS debt had been halted to help the Treasury
to stay under the nationâ€™s debt ceiling of $16.7 trillion while
Congress debated lifting the cap. President  Barack Obama  signed
legislation earlier today reopening the government and
suspending the debt limit until Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
