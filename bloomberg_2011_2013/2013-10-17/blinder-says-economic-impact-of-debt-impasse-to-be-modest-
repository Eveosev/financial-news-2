The economic impact of the recent
U.S. fiscal impasse will be “modest” and the implications for
consumer spending are easy to overstate, said former Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman  Alan Blinder .  The economic cost, “given that it ended when it ended, is
going to be modest,”  Blinder said on  Bloomberg Radio  today.
“But we were flirting with a disaster, of course, and that’s
what finally got people to come to the table.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
