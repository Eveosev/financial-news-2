Kenya  plans to implant microchips in
the horn of every rhino in the East African nation to curb a
surge in poaching and help law enforcers prosecute the culprits,
according to the  Kenya Wildlife Service .  The World Wildlife Fund is donating equipment for the
project, including more than 1,000 microchips and five scanners
at a cost of 1.3 million shillings ($15,294), the Nairobi-based
agency said in a statement yesterday on its website.  “This new technology will ensure that every marked rhino
in the country is traceable,” it said. “Investigators will be
able to link any poached case to a recovered or confiscated horn
and this forms crucial evidence in court contributing toward the
prosecution’s ability to push for sentencing.”  Poachers killed 34 rhinos in Kenya between the start of
this year and August, a 17 percent increase from the whole of
2012 and leaving the country with a population of about 1,025
rhinos, according to government data. The government and
conservationists in the country are boosting security to protect
the wild rhinos, as well as elephants, with measures such as
deploying unmanned drones, using night-vision goggles and
training a 121-member anti-poaching unit that includes
paramilitary forces.  Rhino poaching has been increasing in  Africa  over the past
few years because of growing black markets in  Asia , where the
horn is used as an ingredient in traditional medicines,
according to the World Wildlife Fund. Rhino horns are made of
keratin, the same material as  human fingernails  and hair,
according to the African Wildlife Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
