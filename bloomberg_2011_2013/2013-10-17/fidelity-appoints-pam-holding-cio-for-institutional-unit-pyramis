Fidelity Investments , the second-biggest mutual-fund manager, named Pam R. Holding chief
investment officer for Pyramis Global Advisors, the unit that
caters to institutional clients.  Holding will take over Jan. 1, replacing Young D. Chin, 56,
Pyramis CIO since March 2006, who plans to retire, Jeff Cathie,
a spokesman for the Boston-based firm, said today in an e-mail.
Holding, who joined Pyramis in January as head of  portfolio
management , a new position, will report to Michael A. Jones, the
unit’s chief executive officer.  “We are grateful for all that Young achieved while at
Pyramis,” Cathie said. “His contributions have been recognized
not only by us, but also by the industry.”  Traditionally focused on retail fund clients, Fidelity’s
chairman and CEO Edward “Ned” Johnson III started Pyramis in
2005 to serve large investors, including corporate and public
pension funds. It manages about $190 billion, or about 11
percent of Fidelity’s assets under management.  Holding, who oversaw global value equities at Boston rival
Putnam Investments LLC from 2001 to 2009, earned a bachelor’s
degree from  Princeton University  and an MBA from  Harvard
Business School .  Holding’s appointment was reported earlier by Pensions &
Investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
