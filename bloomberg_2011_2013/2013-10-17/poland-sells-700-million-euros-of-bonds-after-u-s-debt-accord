Poland  sold euro-denominated bonds
after U.S. lawmakers clinched a deal to raise the country’s debt
limit, sparking a rally in emerging-market debt.  The European Union’s largest eastern economy priced 700
million euros ($956 million) more of securities first issued in
January to yield 1.759 percent or 43 basis points above euro
mid-swaps, according to a person familiar with the transaction,
who asked not to be identified because the details are private.  The yield on Poland’s March 2023 dollar-denominated debt
dropped the most in almost a month after U.S. lawmakers agreed
to end a 16-day government shutdown and extend the nation’s
borrowing authority until early next year. Poland, which
financed 91 percent of this year’s borrowing needs by Sept. 30,
planned to sell bonds on international markets in the fourth
quarter, Deputy Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk said Aug. 8.  “The timing makes sense after the U.S. debt issue is
resolved,” Ronald Schneider, who helps manage 800 million euros
in assets at Raiffeisen Kapitalanlage GmbH in Vienna, said in e-mailed comments today.  The yield on the 2023 dollar bonds fell seven basis points,
or or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.895 percent at 6:20 p.m. in
Warsaw. The rate on the January 2019 euro notes sold today rose
seven basis points to 1.75 percent, after falling to 1.65
percent on Oct. 14, the lowest since July 30.  Poland, rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- by
 Standard & Poor’s  as well as  Fitch Ratings , mandated BNP Paribas
SA, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  for
the sale, the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
