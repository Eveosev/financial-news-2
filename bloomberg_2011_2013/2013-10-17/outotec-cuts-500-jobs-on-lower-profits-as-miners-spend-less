Outotec Oyj (OTE1V)  fell the most in more
than three years in Helsinki trading after the Finnish mining
equipment supplier lowered its 2013 sales and profit forecasts
and started talks on dismissing 500 workers globally.  Outotec seeks 50 million euros ($68 million) of annual cost
savings by the end of 2014 as mining customers reduce  capital
spending , the Espoo-based company said in a statement today.
Clients are questioning the sustainability of a global economic
recovery as some projects have have been bogged down by delays
in customer payments and a 30 million-euro project was canceled
last month, it said.  Outotec dropped as much as 14 percent in Helsinki, the
largest intraday decline since Feb. 9, 2010. The shares fell 12
percent to 8.485 euros at 11:34 a.m., the biggest decline among
companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 index. Trading volume was more
than three times the three-month daily average.  Mining equipment makers, including Outotec and  Metso Oyj (MEO1V) ,
will face at least a five-year decline in demand after
benefiting from booming markets since early 2000s, analysts at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said last week. Miners including BHP
Billiton Ltd.,  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and Rio Tinto Group are
stalling investments and focusing on savings as metal prices
remain low.  Outotec said 2013 sales will be as high as 2.1 billion
euros, compared with the previous forecast of as high as 2.3
billion euros. The company lowered its annual operating-profit
margin forecast, excluding one-time costs, by 1 percentage point
to as much as 9.5 percent.  Outotec’s third-quarter orders of 229 million euros were 49
percent lower than a year ago, according to preliminary numbers
published today. Estimated one-time costs from its efficiency
program may reach 30 million euros, it said.  Metso shares fell as much as 5.4 percent after the
Helsinki-based competitor also cut its forecast today, citing a
“substantial loss” in its Valmet Automotive unit. It said
mining and construction equipment sales will be “somewhat”
lower than last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
