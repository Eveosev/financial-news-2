The Howard G. Buffett Foundation
plans to work with  Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest maker of
agricultural equipment, and DuPont Co.’s seed unit to help small
farmers in Africa increase production.  The partners will collaborate initially in  Ghana , the
world’s second-largest cocoa grower, using Deere machines, seed
from DuPont’s Pioneer subsidiary and conservation-based training
from the foundation, they said in a joint statement today. The
group said it hopes to expand the program throughout Africa.  “The long-term food security of Africa depends upon
rebuilding its degraded soils, which can best be achieved
through the widespread adoption of conservation agriculture
practices,” Howard G. Buffett, chairman and chief executive
officer of his namesake foundation, said in the statement .  Africa’s share of global agricultural exports is falling
while food imports and prices rise as its infrastructure lags
behind the rest of the world, according to a report by Rabobank
Group today. With the value of its food markets expected to
triple in the next two decades,  Africa  offers food and
agricultural companies growth opportunities, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
