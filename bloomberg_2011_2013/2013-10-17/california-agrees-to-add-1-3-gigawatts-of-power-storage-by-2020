California regulators today voted
unanimously to require the state’s utilities to purchase 1.325
gigawatts of storage capacity by 2020 to make renewable energy
more reliable and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.  The state’s three biggest utilities must present  plan  for
buying an initial 200 megawatts of storage capacity by March 1,
the California Public Utilities Commission said today in an e-mailed statement.  California is the biggest solar market with 1.86 gigawatts
of installed  capacity , according to the California Solar
Initiative, and is seeking ways to store power produced from
sunlight and other intermittent sources. Requiring utilities
owned by  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ,  Edison International (EIX)  and Sempra Energy to
procure energy-storage capacity will improve the reliability of
the grid, facilitate the integration of renewable power sources
and curb carbon emissions, according to regulators.  “Storage is a game changer that can help people manage
their energy use and expand the capacity of renewable
resources,” Commissioner Catherine Sandoval said in the
statement.  State regulators will need to approve storage-purchase
agreements for utilities to reach the 1.325 gigawatt goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
