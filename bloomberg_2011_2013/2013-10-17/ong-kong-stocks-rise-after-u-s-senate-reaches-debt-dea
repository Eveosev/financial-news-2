Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index heading for a three-week high, after the U.S.
Senate voted to raise the debt limit and end the government
shutdown, moving one step closer to ending the fiscal impasse.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 0.5 percent 23,348.61 as of
9:34 a.m. in Hong Kong, with all but three shares rising on the
50-member gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also
known as the H-share index, added 0.5 percent to 10,681.91.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1
percent after the Senate voted 81-18 to halt the U.S. government
shutdown and raise the debt limit. The House plans to vote later
today and President  Barack Obama  supports the agreement. The
U.S. equity gauge added 1.4 percent yesterday after the Senate
forged a bipartisan deal to end the impasse.  If no solution is reached, the U.S. would exhaust its
borrowing authority today and face the risk of default. Fitch
Ratings put the world’s biggest economy on watch for a possible
credit downgrade yesterday, citing lawmakers’ inability to raise
the debt cap.  The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 17 percent from this year’s low
in June through yesterday as economic data showed China’s growth
is stabilizing. Hong Kong’s equity benchmark traded at 11.1
times estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15.6 for the
S&P 500.  China releases gross domestic product data tomorrow, with
economists predicting 7.8 percent expansion in the three months
to Sept. 30 from 7.5 percent in the previous period. Data on
industrial production and retail sales are also expected to be
released that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
