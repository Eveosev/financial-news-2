JD Sports Fashion Plc (JD/)  climbed for a
seventh straight day after N+1 Singer raised its price target
for the U.K. sportswear chain, citing management changes and
potential for overseas growth.  “New management teams have been appointed to address the
issues in fashion and outdoor and we view international and
multichannel development in the core business as key drivers of
the investment case,” Mark Photiades, an analyst at N+1 Singer
in  London , wrote in a note. He retained a buy recommendation and
raised the price target to 1,350 pence from 1,100 pence.  The  stock  climbed as much as 2.9 percent and was up 2.2
percent at 1,180 pence as of 2:50 p.m. The shares have risen 10
percent in seven trading days, taking the Bury, England-based
company’s market value to 574 million pounds ($926 million).  JD Sports, which acquired the Millets and Blacks outdoor
clothing and equipment brands last year, has more than 800
stores. Its expansion plans include opening six more outlets in
 France  in the second half, after acquiring 15 in Holland and 10
in  Germany  in the first six months, it said Sept. 18.  In the company’s domestic market, retail sales including
fuel increased 0.6 percent in September, the  Office for National
Statistics  said today. In a survey of textile, clothing and
footwear retailers, 136 said their monthly sales increased year-on-year, compared with 93 that said it fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
