Spinner Saeed Ajmal took four
wickets as  Pakistan  ended world No. 1  South Africa ’s 15-match
unbeaten streak in the first cricket Test.  South Africa was all out for 232 on day four at  Abu Dhabi ,
Ajmal taking 4-74. Sixth-ranked Pakistan, which made 442 in its
first innings, reached 45-3 to clinch a seven-wicket victory.
The Proteas were all out for 249 in the first innings.  “It’s really unbelievable and a much-needed win for us, it
was a team effort and everyone contributed,” Pakistan captain
Misbah-ul-Haq, whose side lost to ninth-ranked Zimbabwe in its
last Test in September, said at the post-match presentation.  Misbah scored the winning runs with a six today. He made
100 in the first innings, Khurram Manzoor adding 146.  South Africa captain  Graeme Smith  said he was “extremely
disappointed.”  “Credit goes to Misbah and his boys,” he said. “Right
from session one, they have been ahead in the game and played
better cricket. Even though we showed good character in parts,
our skills were not up to the mark.”  The second game in a two-match series starts in Dubai on
Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
