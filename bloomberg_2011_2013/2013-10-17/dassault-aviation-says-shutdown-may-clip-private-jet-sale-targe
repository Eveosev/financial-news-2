Dassault Aviation SA (AM) , whose biggest
market for its Falcon business jet is the U.S., said a partial
shutdown in the government there has blocked paperwork for new
deliveries that may prevent it from meeting its 2013 target.  The French maker of corporate and fighter jets has
delivered 41 Falcon business planes through the end of September
and aims to deliver about 70 by the year end, up from 66 in
2012, it said today. At least one aircraft couldn’t be delivered
into the U.S. because the Federal Aviation Administration’s
aircraft-registration office was shut, preventing buyers from
formally taking titles of their planes.  Falcon net sales comprise three quarters of the company’s
revenue. In the first nine months, sales rose to 1.9 billion
($2.59 billion) euros from 1.88 billion euros a year earlier.
Total sales for the period rose to 2.59 billion euros compared
with 2.52 billion euros, Dassault said.  “2013 net sales should be higher than 2012 net sales,”
Dassault said. “The ‘shutdown’ in the United States might,
however, impact these forecasts.” Sales in 2012 were 3.94
billion euros.  The U.S. Congress last night voted to fund the government
and lift the debt limit. That allows the world’s largest economy
to avoid default and ends a shutdown that began Oct. 1 and has
taken $24 billion out of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
