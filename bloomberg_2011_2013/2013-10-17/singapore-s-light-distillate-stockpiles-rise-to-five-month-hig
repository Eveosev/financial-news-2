Light-distillate inventories rose
for a second week to the highest level in more than five months
in Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore supplies including naphtha, reformate and gasoline
climbed by 353,000 barrels, or 3.1 percent, to 11.7 million in
the week to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the highest since the
week ended May 1.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene rose 487,000 barrels, or 5.3 percent, to
9.6 million, according to the data. Supplies rebounded from the
lowest in six weeks.  Residual-fuel inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, declined by 724,000
barrels, or 3.3 percent, to 21.1 million, the data show.
Supplies slid for a second week to the least since the week
ended Aug. 21.  The ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude some
offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
