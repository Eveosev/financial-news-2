International peace talks known as
Geneva II and aimed at ending the more than 2 1/2-year conflict
in  Syria  have been provisionally scheduled for Nov. 23-24 ,
according to the country’s deputy prime minister.  The date for the conference was set at a meeting with
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, Qadri Jamil
told reporters in Moscow today.  Geneva II is a “way out for everyone, for the Americans,
for  Russia , for the Syrians, the opposition,” Jamil said. It
has to take place “because all sides are at a dead-end, a
military and political dead-end.”  Efforts to convene the conference have intensified since
Russia and the U.S. reached an agreement last month in Geneva to
destroy Syria’s chemical weapons, averting an American military
strike in retaliation for a chemical attack allegedly carried
out by Syrian government forces on Aug. 21. The Syrian
opposition hasn’t accepted the U.S.-Russian invitation to attend
the talks.  Syrian National Council head George Sabra said Oct. 13 that
his group, one of the leading anti-government movements, won’t
go to the conference.  The meeting should take place even if not all opposition
forces want to attend, Jamil told Russian state television two
days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
