Brazil  has set a cap of 126 reais
($58.28) a megawatt hour for bids in next month’s government-organized auction for contracts to sell energy.  The so-called A-3 auction for power plants coming online in
2016 is scheduled for Nov. 18, power regulator Agencia Nacional
de Energia Eletrica said today in a  report  providing details of
the bid.  More than 15,000 megawatts of wind-energy projects and
3,000 megawatts of solar farms are registered to participate in
the bid, national energy agency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica
said on its  website . About 1,350 megawatts of biomass plants,
gas plants and hydroelectric dams also are enrolled.  In Brazil’s power auctions, regulators set a ceiling rate
and developers bid down the amount at which they are willing to
sell power. The lowest bids win contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
