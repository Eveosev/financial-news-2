Cattle deaths from a blizzard that
began two weeks ago are expected to rise as to many as 20,000.  The deaths based on voluntary reports reached 7,314 today,
compared with about 6,000 on Oct. 15, Mendel Miller, the
assistant state veterinarian, said in a telephone interview from
Pierre, South Dakota. The  South Dakota Animal Industry Board 
estimates about 20,000 cattle were lost from the storm.  In the Black Hills region between Oct. 3-Oct. 5, an
unseasonably early storm produced as much as 4 feet (1.2 meters)
of snow, which was deadly for cattle who still lacked their
winter fur, Jodie Anderson, the executive director of the South
Dakota Cattlemen’s Association, said on Oct. 15.  “At 20,000 head, the losses are clearly significant and
tragic for the ranchers involved, but not so much for the
feeder-cattle market as a whole, although any losses are
unwelcome right now due to the tight supplies,” Doug Houghton,
a Brock Associates analyst in  Milwaukee , said in an e-mail.  South Dakota had the nation’s sixth  largest  herd in January
at 3.85 million head, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
