Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Macau casino
operator controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , surged to a
record in Hong Kong after reporting third-quarter earnings that
beat analyst estimates as its new resort drew more gamblers.  The stock rose 9.2 percent to close at HK$58, the highest
level since its November 2009 listing. The shares have climbed
71 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent gain for the
city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Sands China,  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  and  Melco
Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  have been expanding on Cotai, a piece
of reclaimed land envisioned to be Macau’s equivalent to the Las
Vegas Strip. Sands Cotai Central, the operator’s latest resort
which opened in April last year, has added shops, entertainment
shows and hotel rooms to attract middle-class gamblers to the
world’s largest casino hub.  “Sands has been very strong, especially on the mass-market
segment,” Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based analyst at Union
Gaming Group, said by phone today. “The company has the biggest
footprint in non-gaming entertainment which helps to draw a lot
of family holiday-makers.”  Adjusted property earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization increased 62 percent to $785.3
million in the third quarter, the company said in a stock
exchange statement. That compares with an average estimate of
$732 million from  10 analysts  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The sector is on fire again,” Govertsen said. “Even the
second or third-tier Macau related stocks are enjoying the
strong momentum.”  Neptune Group Ltd. (70)  and Success Universe Group Ltd., which
have investments in the gaming and cruise ship businesses,
surged 17 percent and 8 percent, respectively.  MGM China
Holdings Ltd. (2282)  climbed 4.2 percent and  Galaxy Entertainment  rose
4.1 percent.  Hotel Rooms  Sands China has more than 9,000 hotel rooms and about 40
percent of Macau’s four and five-star offerings, according to
Deutsche Bank AG estimates.  “Its massive room inventory gives it an unparalleled
strategic advantage in Macau,” Karen Tang, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note published today,
raising the company’s target price to HK$65 from HK$53.1, while
keeping a “buy” rating.  Net income for the Hong Kong-listed unit of  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS)  rose 89 percent to $617.9 million from $326.7 million a
year earlier, according to its parent’s filing in U.S. GAAP
standard. Revenue climbed 43 percent to $2.34 billion. Parent
Las Vegas Sands also reported earnings above estimates.  The company plans to invest another $2.8 billion to build a
new Macau resort, to be named the Parisian, which will have a
replica of the Eiffel Tower.  Gambling revenue in Macau, the only place in  China  where
casinos are legal, gained 17 percent to 260.6 billion patacas
($33 billion) in the first nine months of this year, after
raking in $38 billion in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
