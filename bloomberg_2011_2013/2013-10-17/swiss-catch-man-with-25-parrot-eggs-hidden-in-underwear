Swiss customs caught a man hiding 25
parrot eggs in his underwear, leading them to uncover a
smuggling operation of rare bird eggs worth 65,000 Swiss francs
($71,800).  Having just arrived from  Sao Paulo , the man caught the
attention of officials with his awkward gait and was
apprehended, Beat Eugster of the Zurich customs office said.  “He was wearing very wide trousers, and because he was
walking so strangely the agents decided to stop him,” Eugster
said by telephone today. “The agents thought he might have been
carrying drugs.”  In the course of the investigation, authorities discovered
several hundred birds, some of which were endangered species. An
accomplice was found with seven rare parrots valued at 80,000
francs, Eugster said.  In total, the man smuggled more than 150 rare eggs to
 Indonesia ,  Mexico  and  Thailand , the customs office said, adding
that it was unable to determine the origin of the eggs.  The case was made public today because the suspect was
released shortly after his arrest in August 2010 and placed
under covert surveillance, according to Eugster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
