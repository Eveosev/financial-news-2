Beijing Enterprises Water Group Ltd. (371) 
raised $145 million from a share sale to boost working capital,
according to a term sheet obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The company, principally engaged in the construction of
sewage and reclaimed water-treatment and seawater desalination
plants, sold 350 million shares at HK$3.21 apiece, a 5.3 percent
discount to its Oct. 16 close, the terms show. The shares were
originally offered at HK$3.19 to HK$3.29 each.  Beijing Enterprises Water sold new shares equivalent to
4.15 percent of enlarged capital to a controlling shareholder,
Beijing Enterprises Environmental Construction Ltd., in a top-up
placement, according to a statement to the  Hong Kong  stock
exchange yesterday. Deutsche Bank AG managed the sale.  Khazanah Nasional Bhd bought a 5 percent stake in Beijing
Enterprises Water for $152 million to become the companyâ€™s
third-largest shareholder, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund
said on Oct. 4. It said the investment was made as  China  faces
water scarcity due to population growth and urbanization.  The shares of Beijing Enterprises Water were suspended in
Hong Kong yesterday and will resume trading today, according to
the Hong Kong exchange filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
