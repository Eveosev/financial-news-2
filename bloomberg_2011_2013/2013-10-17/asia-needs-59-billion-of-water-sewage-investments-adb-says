Asia needs an estimated $59 billion
in infrastructure investments to improve water supplies and
sanitation to the regionâ€™s 4.3 billion people and support their
economies, according to the  Asian Development Bank .  Facilitating financing and pinpointing critical investment
areas would help close a gap in funding water infrastructure
development and capital improvements to increase capacity and
efficiency of water utilities, according to the Asian Water
Development Outlook 2013 published by the ADB ahead of a Nov.
25-27 water meeting in  Kuala Lumpur .  To contact the reporter on this story:
