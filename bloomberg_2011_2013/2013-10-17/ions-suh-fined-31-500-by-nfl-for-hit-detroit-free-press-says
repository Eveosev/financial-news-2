Detroit defensive tackle  Ndamukong Suh  was fined $31,500 by the National Football League for a hit
on Cleveland Browns quarterback  Brandon Weeden  during the Lions’
31-17 victory four days ago, the Detroit Free Press said.  Suh, 26, said he would appeal the fine, the seventh in his
four-year NFL career, the Free Press reported yesterday. The
player told the newspaper he wasn’t aware the action was being
reviewed for discipline.  No penalty was called after he hit Weeden in the first
quarter on Oct. 13. Dean Blandino, NFL vice president of
officiating, said he would review the play after Suh “lowered
his head” before he struck Weeden’s chest, according to a video
on NFL.com.  Last week, Suh lost his appeal of a $100,000 fine for an
illegal block on Minnesota Vikings center  John Sullivan ,
Roosevelt Barnes, Suh’s agent, told the Associated Press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
