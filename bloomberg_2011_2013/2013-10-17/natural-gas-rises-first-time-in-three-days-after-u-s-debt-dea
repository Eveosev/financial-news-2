Natural gas futures rose for the
first time in three days after U.S. lawmakers voted to increase
the nation’s debt ceiling, easing concern of a default.  Prices rose as much as 0.8 percent today. The  U.S. Congress 
voted to halt the 16-day government shutdown and raise the debt
limit, ending the nation’s fiscal impasse.  Natural gas for November delivery increased as much as 3.1
cents to $3.80 per million British thermal units on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, and was at $3.798 at 12:34 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract fell 2.1 cents to settle at $3.769 yesterday,
the lowest close since Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
