What was lost when China  criminalized  online rumor-mongering in September? Even a casual user of Sina Weibo, China’s leading social-media platform, and other online services would have noticed a drop-off in the volume of posts since the new regulations, and a subsequent  crackdown on prominent users , were announced. But hard data was, as usual, hard to come by.  That changed last week in the aftermath of Typhoon Fitow, a massive storm that  flooded  --  by most accounts  –- up to 70 percent of Yuyao, a prosperous city of about 850,000 located roughly 60 miles south of Shanghai. Over the last several years, natural disasters such as this one have raced to the top of Sina Weibo’s trending topics lists, as users rallied to share information about what precisely was happening in the disaster zone. In many cases, the information was both more current and more comprehensive than what China’s state-run media outlets were able to provide. (This should come as no surprise: A thousand bloggers stranded in a flood zone with smartphones can relay more information, more quickly, than any professionally trained camera crew.)  Not all of the information is accurate. In disaster zones, mistakes are made, incorrect information is sometimes relayed, and yes, rumors are spread. But still, few in China would have chosen China’s state media over Sina Weibo for coverage of April’s tragic  Lushan earthquake in Sichuan , or the notorious -- and fatal --  July 2012 floods in Beijing .   By some accounts, Yuyao's flooding has been as bad, if not worse, than Beijing's last year. But coverage on social media has been nowhere near as intense. According to  data  collated and reported by a researcher at the Communist Party's People’s Daily Public Opinion Monitoring Center, during the most intense period of flooding: Some of the decline in posts to Sina Weibo might be attributed to the  increasing popularity  of the  Weixin  -- or WeChat -- messaging service, which incorporates social-media features. But even the monitoring report makes reference to the government’s ongoing “opinion management” activities. China’s online citizens, especially the most high-profile among them, have clearly begun censoring themselves for fear of arrest. They're right to be worried: On Wednesday, the Yuyao government  announced  -- via its official Sina Weibo account, natch -- that it had arrested two women for spreading what they characterized as flood-related rumors. (The  brief history  of such prosecutions has not been encouraging.)  Such arrests cost China far more than valuable information during a storm. They strike at the very development of Chinese civil society, which has in recent years provided a rare check on government ineptitude and malfeasance, particularly in the state's response to major disasters. The tough new rules don't really increase the government's control over public opinion; rather they fuel resentment at Beijing's monopoly over information. Indeed,  several   reports  indicate that sugar-coated news stories out of the Yuyao floods have catalyzed  anti-government protests  in Yuyao in recent days -- exactly the kind of unrest the Weibo crackdown was meant to prevent.
