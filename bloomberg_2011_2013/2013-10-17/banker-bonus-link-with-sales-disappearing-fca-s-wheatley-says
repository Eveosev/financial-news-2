The biggest banks in the U.K. are
moving away from a culture of linking sales to bonuses after a
series of scandals where products were improperly sold to
consumers, the head of the markets regulator said.  “The early analysis -- and I think we have to stress this
is early analysis -- shows three of the biggest U.K. banks have
removed the direct link to sales in incentive arrangements,”
Martin Wheatley, chief executive officer of the Financial
Conduct Authority, said today at a speech in  London . “This is,
potentially, one of the most significant steps forward for the
U.K. banking industry since 2008.”  The FCA has been scrutinizing how bankers are rewarded
after lenders were forced to pay billions of pounds to
compensate customers who were sold payment-protection insurance
that they didn’t need. U.K. banks have set aside around 15.5
billion pounds ($25 billion) for PPI claims.  “Banks are making strides on reforming reward structures”
in retail branches and call centres, Wheatley said. Concerns
remain over the use of bonus incentives in the retail investment
market, he said.  The FCA plans to review performance management and sales
processes, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
