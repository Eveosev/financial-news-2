German bunds led gains in European
 government securities  on bets the U.S. budget debate that
threatened a default will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to maintain
stimulus, underpinning the appeal of fixed-income assets.  German  10-year yields  fell the most in three weeks as the
White House said President  Barack Obama  signed a measure ending
the 16-day U.S. government shutdown and extending the nation’s
borrowing authority until early next year. Austrian, Dutch and
Finnish bonds also advanced. France sold 8.38 billion euros
($11.5 billion) of notes and inflation-linked bonds, while  Spain 
auctioned 2.5 billion euros of three- and five-year debt.  “Maybe December at the earliest is what the market was
looking at for tapering, even that has been postponed now,”
which is helping bonds, said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
 London . “There’s still a lot of uncertainty about the economic
outlook.”  Germany ’s benchmark 10-year yield dropped six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.87 percent at 4:22 p.m. in
London, the biggest decline since Sept. 24. The 2 percent bund
maturing in August 2023 advanced 0.57, or 5.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.20.  Austrian 10-year yields dropped five basis points to 2.25
percent, similarly-maturity Dutch rates slipped six basis points
to 2.23 percent and  Finland ’s also declined six basis points, to
2.11 percent.  Borrowing Limit  European bonds rallied with Treasuries after U.S. lawmakers
yesterday agreed a plan to end the federal shutdown that started
Oct. 1 and to raise the borrowing limit, avoiding a default.
Congress produced the accord a day after  Fitch Ratings  said it
may cut the U.S.’s AAA rating, citing the government’s inability
to increase the ceiling in a timely manner.  The focus now shifts to a new series of deadlines -- the
first for budget negotiations with a Dec. 13 target. The deal
funds the government through Jan. 15, 2014 and suspends the debt
limit through Feb. 7.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of France and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Germany’s 10-year yield may end the year little changed at
1.90 percent and increase to 2.10 percent by March 31, said
Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . The
yield will be at 1.93 at Dec. 31 and 2.08 percent at the end of
the first quarter, according to the median predictions in
Bloomberg News surveys.  French Auction  France  sold notes maturing in February 2016 and November
2018 and inflation-linked securities due in 2023, 2027 and 2040.
The nation sold the 2018 debt at an average yield of 1.24
percent, matching the level of an auction on June 20 that was
the highest since April 2012.  Spain sold 1.6 billion euros of notes maturing in October
2018 at an average yield of 3.059 percent, down from 3.128
percent at a previous auction on Oct. 3. It allotted 900 million
euros of debt due in July 2016 at 2.064 percent, versus 2.225
percent on Sept. 19.  Spain’s five-year yield fell four basis points to 3.08
percent after dropping five basis points yesterday. The nation’s
10-year yield was little changed at 4.30 percent.  ‘Negative Returns’  European bond markets were expecting a resolution and
underlying sentiment should stay positive for  Europe ’s higher-yielding debt markets, according to ING Groep NV.  “Since the U.S. partial government shutdown on Oct. 1 core
markets have registered negative returns while peripheral
markets have registered positive returns,”  Padhraic Garvey ,
head of developed-market bonds strategy in Amsterdam, wrote in a
note to clients. “We maintain our view that peripheral issuers
such as Italy, Spain and Ireland have viable convergence targets
towards the 150 basis-point area versus 10-year Germany.”  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
bonds over similar-maturity bunds widened five basis points to
177 basis points, the Italian spread widened two basis points to
233 basis points and Spain’s expanded seven basis points to 244
basis points.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 2.4 percent this
year through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. Austrian securities fell 1.7 percent and Dutch bonds
dropped 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
