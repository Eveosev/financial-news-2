Copper climbed to the highest level
in two weeks after the  U.S. Senate  endorsed an accord aimed at
preventing a debt default in the world’s second-largest user of
the metal.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange increased as much as 0.6 percent to $7,300 a metric ton,
the highest since Oct. 3, and traded at $7,283.75 at 9:05 a.m.
Shanghai time.  The Senate voted 81-18 to halt the government shutdown and
raise the U.S.  debt limit , moving one step closer to ending the
nation’s fiscal impasse. The  House of Representatives  plans to
vote later tonight and President  Barack Obama  supports the
agreement. The Senate acted the day before U.S. borrowing
authority was scheduled to lapse.  “The accord ended short-term risk in the copper market and
triggered some short-covering this morning,” said Yu Yi, an
analyst with SDIC CGOG Futures Co. in Beijing. Short-covering
refers to investors reversing bets on further declines.  Stockpiles tracked by the LME fell for 30th straight days
to 502,750 tons yesterday, the lowest since March 7, daily
exchange figures showed.  Copper for delivery in January advanced 0.7 percent to
52,590  yuan  ($8,621) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Metal for delivery in December rose for a sixth straight day,
climbing 0.3 percent to $3.318 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, tin, aluminum, lead and zinc also rose, while
nickel fell.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
