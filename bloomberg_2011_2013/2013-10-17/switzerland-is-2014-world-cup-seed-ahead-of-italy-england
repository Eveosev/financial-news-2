Switzerland, which hasn’t made the
last eight in the  World Cup  in almost 60 years, will be among
the eight top seeds for next year’s tournament ahead of four-time winner Italy after a 14-match unbeaten run.  Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld’s team climbed seven places to world
No. 7 in FIFA’s rankings after the run dating back to May 2012,
 the soccer ruling body  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The top seven ranked teams and host Brazil will be the main
seeds in the Dec. 6 draw under rules FIFA executives agreed on
Oct. 4. The other confirmed seeds are Spain, Germany, Argentina,
 Colombia  and  Belgium . The seeds won’t be drawn together in the
opening-group stage.  Uruguay will be the remaining seed if it defeats Jordan in
a playoff. If not, the Netherlands will beat  Italy  to the spot
by a fraction of a point, FIFA said. World No. 10  England  will
also miss out on a seeding spot.  Seeding for the 2010 World Cup was also based on FIFA
rankings. For the 2006 edition, it was based on teams’  previous
two tournament performances .  Switzerland reached the World Cup quarterfinals in 1954 as
tournament host. The Swiss beat eventual champion Spain at the
2010 tournament but failed to advance past the opening group
phase.  Hitzfeld, 64, will leave his coaching post after the World
Cup, the Swiss soccer federation said on its website today.  The U.S. is ranked 13th, the same as during the last
monthly poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
