Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov 
increased his stake in English soccer team Arsenal to more than
30 percent.  Usmanov announced his holding in the north London club
today in a Regulatory News Service statement. His spokesman,
Rollo Head, was unavailable to comment on the purchase.  Usmanov, using his Red and White Holdings Ltd., had around
29 percent before the latest purchase. He is vying for influence
at the club with  Stan Kroenke , an American who also owns the
National Football League’s St. Louis Rams. Kroenke took control
of the soccer club in 2011 after acquiring stakes owned by two
former board members. Kroenke holds a stake of about 67 percent.  Usmanov and his partner Farhad Moshiri, who together
control Red & White, have said they want to boost their holding
and criticized the team’s board for its financial decisions
after captain  Robin van Persie  left for  Manchester United  last
year. He was the Premier League’s leading scorer last season and
helped United win the title.  Arsenal is atop the league after seven games this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
