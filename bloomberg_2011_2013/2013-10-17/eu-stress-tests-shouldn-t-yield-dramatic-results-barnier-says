The European Union doesn’t expect
“dramatic results” from stress tests due to be carried out
next year, said  Michel Barnier , the bloc’s commissioner for
financial services.  An assessment of banks’ balance sheets by the  European
Central Bank  and European Banking Authority “may throw up
certain funding gaps,” Barnier said in a speech in London
today.  “We are shining a light into the dark corners,” Barnier
said. “Showing that we have nothing to hide.”  Policy makers at the Frankfurt-based ECB will try this
week to agree on the ground rules of its probe into the health
of the 130 banks it will start supervising next year.  For lenders that fail the test of asset quality, the EU
“will have a clear framework in place, with bail-in, and
national and if necessary European backstops,” Barnier said.
Bail-in is the legal framework through which losses can be
imposed on banks’ creditors during a financial crisis.  Barnier also said that “it’s difficult but possible” to
get an agreement by the end of this year on plans to set up a
centralized euro-area system for winding down failing banks. The
move has been billed by EU leaders as a key pillar of their
project to build a banking union that breaks links between banks
and national governments by transferring power to the European
level.  Finance ministers this week signed off the first pillar of
the banking union, which involves transforming the ECB into a
supervisor. The ECB will be ready to assume its supervisory
powers by November 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
