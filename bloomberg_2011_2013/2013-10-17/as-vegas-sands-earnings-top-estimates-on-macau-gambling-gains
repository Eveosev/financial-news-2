Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , the casino
company controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates on continued growth
in Asia. The company raised its dividend 43 percent.  Profit rose to 82 cents a share, excluding some items,
compared with the 77-cent average of 21 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue gained 32 percent to $3.57
billion, the Las Vegas-based company said today in a  statement ,
topping analysts’ estimates of $3.47 billion.  Improving rail and airport links to Macau,  China ’s gambling
enclave, will continue to support Las Vegas Sands’ growth plans,
Adelson, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer,
said on a conference call. Growth in Asia is letting the company
repurchase stock and increase the dividend, even as profit in
Las Vegas declines.  “These infrastructure investments include the world’s most
expensive and extensive high-speed rail system,” Adelson said.
A new bridge “will allow passengers arriving by plane at the
Hong Kong International Airport to reach Macau in as little as
20 minutes.”  Las Vegas Sands repurchased almost $300 million of stock
during the quarter and has committed to spending $75 million a
month under its $2 billion buyback authorization, Adelson said.
The dividend was increased to 50 cents a quarter from 35 cents
previously, starting in 2014, the company said.  Adelson, 80, who owns 51 percent of the stock, said the
company will consider paying a  special dividend  later this year.
A previous special payout of $2.75 a share was approved in
November 2012.  Net Income  Third-quarter net income increased 79 percent to $626.7
million, or 76 cents a share, from $349.8 million, or 42 cents,
a year earlier, the company said.  Consolidated property earnings increased 46 percent to
$1.28 billion, excluding some items, according to the statement,
exceeding estimates of $1.19 billion. The  Sands China Ltd. (1928) 
subsidiary increased property earnings by 62 percent to $785.3
million, the company said, while profit in  Singapore  increased
43 percent to $373.6 million.  Adjusted property earnings in Las Vegas declined 11 percent
to $87.1 million, while income in  Pennsylvania  shrank 7.8
percent to $29.6 million, the company said.  Total gross gaming revenue in Macau, Las Vegas Sands’
largest market, rose 20 percent in the third quarter, resulting
in record three-month revenue of $11 billion, according to
Bloomberg Industries research.  The company is pursuing expansion across Asia, including
 Japan  and South  Korea .  “Japan would obviously be the most expensive investment
we’ve ever made from a single property standpoint,” President
Michael Leven said on the call. “The estimates range anywhere
from $6 billion in  Tokyo  and up. In Korea we would not expect to
spend that kind of money at all.  Las Vegas Sands rose 0.4 percent to $71.22 in extended
trading at 6:18 p.m., after gaining 2.1 percent to $70.97 at the
close in New York. The stock has advanced 54 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
