Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the advisory firm
that’s expanding in Brazil and  Australia , said third-quarter
profit fell 79 percent, missing analysts’ estimates, as revenue
from advising clients plummeted.  Net income slid to $1.8 million, or 6 cents a share, from
$8.59 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
firm said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of 12 cents.  Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 54, said this month that
an “anemic economic recovery” and regulations in industries
including financial services have tempered merger-and-acquisition activity. While global deal volume rose in the third
quarter, it was supported by a few so-called mega deals of more
than $100 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Takeovers below $5 billion fell, the data show.  “Consistent with the view we have expressed all year, 2013
is turning out to be another relatively quiet one in terms of
global transaction activity,” Bok said today in the statement.  Advisory revenue dropped 35 percent to $47 million from a
year earlier even as those fees climbed 11 percent to $211.5
million in the first nine months of the year from the same
period in 2012.  Greenhill rose 1.7 percent to $47.88 at 4 p.m. in  New York .
The shares have dropped 7.9 percent this year, compared with the
30 percent jump in the Russell 2000 Index of small companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
