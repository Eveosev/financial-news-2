The  Detroit  Tigers broke out of a
scoring slump to defeat the Boston Red Sox 7-3 and even the
American League Championship Series at two games apiece.  Torii Hunter had a two-run double and Miguel Cabrera added
an RBI single as the Tigers scored five runs in the second
inning to take a 5-0 lead. It ended a 13-inning scoreless streak
for Detroit that stretched back to Game 2 on Oct. 13.  The Tigers made it 7-0 in the fourth on run-scoring singles
by Austin Jackson and Cabrera.  Boston scored a run in the sixth on an RBI single by Jarrod
Saltalamacchia and added another in the seventh on Shane
Victorino’s run-scoring double. The Red Sox got their third run
in the ninth on Jacoby Ellsbury’s run-scoring triple.  Game 5 in the best-of-seven series is set for tomorrow
night in Detroit.  In the National League, Adrian Gonzalez hit two of the
Dodgers’ four solo home runs as Los Angeles stayed alive with a
6-4 home win against the St. Louis Cardinals, who still lead
three games to two in the series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
