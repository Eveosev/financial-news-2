Hong Kong   stocks  slid, with the Hang
Seng Index dropping for the first time in three days, as  Citic
Pacific Ltd. (267)  declined after filing an injunction in Australian
court to stop its mining right from being terminated.  Citic Pacific fell 4.3 percent.  Tingyi (Cayman Islands)
Holding Corp. (322) , a maker of instant noodles and beverages, slumped
3.7 percent after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its rating on the
stock on slowing sales growth. Longfor Properties Co. dropped
4.2 percent after its chairwoman split her stake in the company
because of a divorce.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a maker of
power tools that counts North America as its biggest market,
rose 3.5 percent as U.S. housing data beat estimates.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.2 percent to 21,228.28 at the
close, reversing earlier gains of as much as 1 percent. More
than twice as many shares fell as advanced in the 49-member
gauge. Trading volume on the gauge was 24 percent below its 30-
day average for the time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland
companies declined 0.6 percent to 10,227.24.  “Hong Kong has rebounded in recent days but there are
still uncertainties including global economic growth and
Europe’s debt problem, so there are some profit taking,” said
Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong
Kong. “Overall it’s in an upward trend.”  The Hang Seng Index advanced 17 percent through yesterday
from this year’s low on June 4 as economic data showed China’s
slowdown may be bottoming and central banks around the globe
added stimulus to spur growth.  The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slid 0.2 percent to 16.35,
indicating traders expect a 4.7 percent swing in the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days. Futures on the Hang Seng Index
rose 0.1 percent to 21,269.  To contact the reporter on this story:
