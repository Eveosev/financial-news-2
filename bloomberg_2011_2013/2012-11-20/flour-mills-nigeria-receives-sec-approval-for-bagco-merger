     Nov. 20 (Bloomberg)--  Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s biggest miller by market value, has won “approval in
principle” from the local Securities and Exchange Commission to
buy Nigerian Bag Manufacturing Co, or Bagco.  The company will recommend to its shareholders an offer of
25 Bagco shares in exchange for one share of Flour Mills, the
miller said in a statement published today on the website of the
Nigerian Stock Exchange.  Alternatively, it will propose a cash consideration of 2.75
naira (2 cents) for each Bagco share, a 39 percent premium to
Bagco’s closing share price on 16 Nov., according to the
statement.  Flour Mills gained 4.7 percent to 66.25 naira, taking its
rise this year to 1.2 percent, while Bagco gained 7 percent to
2.26 naira, taking its gain this year to 33 percent, compared
with a gain of 27 percent in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-
Share Index.  The proposals are subject to approval by regulatory
authorities as well as by the shareholders of both companies,
according to the statement.  “This will ease management decisions with regards to the
operations,” of Bagco, Pabina Yinkere, head of research at
Lagos-based Vetiva Capital Management Ltd., said by phone. Bagco
supplies bags used by Flour Mills for its products, which
include cement, flour, and sugar from next month, when it starts
production at its 750,000-metric ton sugar refinery in Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
