Ukraine’s soccer federation said it
wants former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp to take charge of
its national team.  “The presidium made the decision to start negotiations
with Redknapp’s representatives” over working as head coach of
the national team, the federation said  on its website .  Former Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko this week turned
down the chance to fill the vacancy created when former coach
Oleg Blokhin left to take over Dynamo Kiev.  Ukraine co-hosted the Euro 2012 tournament with  Poland  and
came third in its four-team group, failing to reach the knockout
stage.  Redknapp left Tottenham in June. He previously managed
clubs including Bournemouth, West Ham and Portsmouth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
