Payrolls increased in 35 states in
October, while the  unemployment rate  dropped in 37, showing much
of the U.S. labor market is gaining traction.  California led the nation with a 45,800 advance in
employment, followed by Texas with 36,600 more jobs, figures
from the Labor Department showed today in Washington. The
jobless rate dropped the most in  South Carolina , Alaska and
 Wisconsin .  National employment figures indicate the labor market has
regained strength after stumbling in the middle of the year,
with the jobless rate falling below 8 percent for the first time
since 2009. Future hiring gains may be limited as companies wait
to see whether the more than $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts slated for the start of 2013 take effect.  “There’s been a little bit stronger payroll growth because
there’s been a little bit stronger economic growth,” George Mokrzan, director of economics for Huntington National Bank in
Columbus,  Ohio , said before the report. “As long as we don’t go
over the fiscal cliff, the economy will continue to expand at a
moderate pace, which means continued modest payroll gains.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
