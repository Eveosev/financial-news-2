U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said the British government recognized the Syrian opposition
coalition and will provide communications and other support to
it.  Britain sought assurances from the opposition leadership in
London on Nov. 16 that they would be inclusive of all sections
of Syrian society, committed to democracy and would commit
themselves to human rights, Hague said. The move came a day
after the  European Union  said it viewed the opposition as the
“legitimate representatives” of the Syrian people.  “On the basis of assurances I received and consultations
with European partners yesterday, Her Majesty’s government has
decided to recognize the national coalition of Syrian
revolutionary and opposition forces as the sole legitimate
representative of the Syrian people,” Hague told lawmakers in
the House of Commons in  London  today.  The U.K. will invite the coalition to appoint a political
representative to the U.K. and will give 1 million pounds ($1.59
million) of communications support, including satellite phones
to improve co-ordination within  Syria , Hague said.  France  has
also said it would welcome their representative.  Britain will provide a stabilization response team to help
provide basic needs in opposition-held areas, Hague said, and
will expand its medical assistance, including a focus on
supporting victims of sexual violence in the conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
