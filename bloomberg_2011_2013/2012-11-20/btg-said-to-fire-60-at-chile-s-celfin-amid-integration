Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) , the Brazilian
bank that purchased Chilean brokerage Celfin Capital SA in
February, fired about 60 people from the business, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Celfin,  Chile ’s biggest brokerage, has about 600 employees
after the move, which was part of the process of integrating the
two companies, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the decision hasn’t been made public. The person didn’t
have more details about which employees were affected.  BTG said in February it planned to acquire Santiago-based
Celfin for about $486 million. The Brazilian central bank
approved the transaction on Oct. 30 and the acquisition was
concluded on Nov. 13, BTG said in regulatory filings.  BTG declined to comment on the firings, said an official
who asked not to be identified in keeping with company policy.
Celfin declined in an e-mailed statement to comment on its
workforce policies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
