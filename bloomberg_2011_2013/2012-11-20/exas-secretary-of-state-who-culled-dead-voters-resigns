Texas Secretary of State Hope Andrade, who presided over an effort this year to purge the
deceased from state voter lists, will step down this week.  Andrade, the first Hispanic woman to hold the post, plans
to leave the job Nov. 23, according to a statement posted on her
office’s website. The San Antonio native owns a business and
wants to do other things, said Rich Parsons, a spokesman. She
also advises Governor  Rick Perry  on Mexican border issues.  The purge, begun just weeks before the Nov. 6 election,
prompted a legal challenge and complaints from living voters who
received letters advising them to contact officials to keep
their registration active. State Representative Wayne Smith, a
Baytown Republican, was among those who got such a notice. Under
a settlement, the state put off a deadline for determining
whether a voter had died and shouldn’t be registered.  State officials compared information about more than 76,000
voters with a database of the dead maintained by the U.S. Social
Security Administration, Parsons said. The effort, which led to
the removal of 6,000 deceased people from voting lists, followed
directives contained in a  Texas  law enacted last year, he said.  As the first Hispanic woman to hold the office, Andrade
“has a permanent place in our state’s history books,” Perry, a
Republican who appointed her in July 2008, said in a statement.
“I’m thankful for her service and I’m proud to call her a
friend.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
