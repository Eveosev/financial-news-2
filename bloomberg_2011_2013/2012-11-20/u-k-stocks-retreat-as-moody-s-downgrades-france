U.K. stocks  climbed, extending
yesterday’s biggest rally in more than five months, as euro-area
finance ministers’ met to discuss Greece’s bailout and as
shareholders approved the $31 billion takeover of  Xstrata Plc. (XTA)   Xstrata jumped 3.1 percent after its shareholders approved
the merger with  Glencore International Plc. (GLEN)   InterContinental (IHG) 
Hotels Group Plc climbed 2.7 percent as  Barclays Plc (BARC)  upgraded
the shares.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  rallied to a five-year high after the
airline doubled its dividend.  The FTSE 100 Index climbed 10.44 points, or 0.2 percent, to
5,748.1 at the close in London, extending yesterday’s 2.4
percent rally after President  Barack Obama  said he was confident
he will reach a budget agreement with Congress. The FTSE All-
Share Index also rose 0.2 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
gained 0.6 percent.  “In the next couple of days, the European Union will
signal the next tranche of aid for Greece, providing conditions
are met,”  Michael O’Sullivan , head of portfolio strategy at
Credit Suisse Private Banking in London, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from London. “That has to be voted on by
various European parliaments; so we not quite out of the woods
yet. It does signal this continuation of the plan where the EU
tries to keep the  euro zone  together.”  European finance ministers are expected to discuss ways to
fill a 15 billion-euro ($19.2 billion) gap in Greece’s public
accounts and win over the International Monetary Fun. The
meeting, which started at 5 p.m. in Brussels, follows last
week’s decision by European leaders to grant Greece an extra two
extra years to cut its deficit.  Growth Outlook  Morgan Stanley today forecast the euro-area economy will
shrink 0.5 percent in 2013, cutting its previous projection for
a stagnant gross domestic product. It also lowered its estimate
for growth in the U.K. next year to 0.8 percent, compared with
its earlier forecast of 1 percent.  Xstrata climbed 3.1 percent to 986.6 pence, for the biggest
advance on the FTSE 100. Glencore’s takeover bid was approved by
the company’s shareholders who, however, rejected retention
bonuses totaling about 144 million pounds ($229 million).  Xstrata’s board on Oct. 1 recommended that shareholders
vote for the takeover subject to approval of the retention pay.
Qatar Holding LLC, holder of a 12 percent stake in Xstrata,
abstained from the bonus vote.  John Bond , chairman of the
Xstrata,  said he would step down after the board of the merged
company finds a replacement.  Glencore climbed 1.6 percent to 331.75 pence.  IHG, EasyJet  InterContinental climbed 2.7 percent to 1,633 pence after
Barclays upgraded the world’s largest provider of hotel rooms to
overweight, the equivalent of a buy recommendation, citing the
potential for asset sales.  “We consider IHG to be the most interesting restructuring
story in our leisure coverage over the next one to two years,”
analysts wrote in a note to clients today. “We expect to see
circa $800 million assets sold with proceeds earmarked for
returns to shareholders in 2013.”  EasyJet Plc jumped 6.1 percent to 692 pence, the highest
since November 2007, after the discount airline increased its
annual dividend to 21.5 pence a share from 10.5 pence and
reported a 28 percent jump in full-year pretax profit to 317
million pounds ($504 million).  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) , the parent
company of British Airways, climbed 2.6 percent to 167.6 pence
after  RBC Capital Markets  upgraded the shares to outperform, the
equivalent to buy, from underperform.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  jumped 13 percent to 310.7 pence, the biggest
rally since March 2009, extending yesterday’s 9.3 percent
advance after world’s third-largest platinum producer won
support from shareholders for a $817 million stock sale aimed at
helping it avoid breaching pledges to creditors.  Premier Foods Plc (PFD)  advanced 2.7 percent to 94.75 pence after
the owner of the Hovis bread and Bisto gravy brands announced
plans to close two bakery sites next year and cut 900 jobs to
help drive profitable growth in the unit. “These proposals are
not expected to have an impact on 2012 trading profit,” the
company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
