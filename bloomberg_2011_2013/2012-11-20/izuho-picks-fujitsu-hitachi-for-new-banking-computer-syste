Mizuho (8411)  Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s
third-biggest banking group by market value, selected  Fujitsu
Ltd. (6702) ,  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  and two other companies to develop a new
computer system for the lender’s national operations.  The bank plans to introduce the system by March 2016,
Tokyo-based spokeswoman  Masako Shiono  said by telephone today,
adding  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  and  NTT Data Corp. (9613) 
are also part of the development team.  The network will replace a system set up after Mizuho was
created in 2000 through a merger of three banks. Mizuho plans to
combine its corporate and retail lending units by July 1 to cut
costs and boost profitability.  Development may exceed 400 billion yen ($4.9 billion),
Nikkei Computer magazine reported earlier today without citing
anyone. Shiono declined to comment on costs.  Mizuho last year experienced system outages four days after
a record earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan. The
computer failure delayed about $10 billion of transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
