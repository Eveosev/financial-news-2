Crude oil options volatility
declined with the underlying futures after Hamas said a draft
accord for a cease-fire that would end fighting between  Israel 
and Palestinian groups in the  Gaza Strip  is almost ready.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.95 as of 4:20 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 28.91 yesterday.  Crude oil for January delivery declined $2.53 to $86.75 a
barrel on the Nymex, the biggest decrease since Nov. 7. The
contract surged to $89.28 yesterday, the highest settlement
price since Oct. 19.  The conflict in Gaza threatens further instability in the
 Middle East  and North Africa after a wave of uprisings since
Last year, including one in  Libya  that almost entirely cut the
nation’s crude exports. The region accounted for 36 percent of
global oil output and held 52 percent of proved reserves in
2011, according to  BP Plc (BP) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $80 puts, which gained 13 cents to 42 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,635 lots at 4:59 p.m. January $95 calls were the
second-most active, with 2,489 lots exchanged as they fell 45
cents to 39 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 49
percent of the 52,235 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets made up 58 percent of
the 192,293.  January $105 calls were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 19,279 contracts. They rose 3 cents to 21 cents a
barrel. January $102 calls rose 4 cents to 28 cents on volume of
16,812.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
53,858 contracts. Next were January $110 calls with 38,540 lots
and January $60 puts with 34,935.  To contact the reporter on this story:
