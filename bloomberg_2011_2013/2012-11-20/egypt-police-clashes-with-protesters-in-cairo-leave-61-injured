Egyptian police clashed with
hundreds of protesters in Cairo through the night and early this
morning, leaving at least 61 people injured.  The protesters, who assembled to mark similar
demonstrations a year ago that left 45 dead, gathered near the
Interior Ministry building, chanting “the people want the end
to the regime.” Police used tear gas to repel the demonstrators
who hurled stones and attempted to destroy a wall.  Activists and political groups have called for mass
protests across the country on Nov. 23 to demand the dismissal
of the government, the state-run Ahram gate website reported.
The calls come in the wake of this week’s fatal train and bus
collision in Assiut that left 51 dead, most of them children.  The violence underlined the task facing President Mohamed Mursi, the country’s first popularly elected leader, who’s
struggling to restore order and reinvigorate the economy even as
near-daily protests break out over issues ranging from the
violence in Gaza, to jobs and surging crime.  Protesters are also demanding changes to the Islamist-led
Constituent Assembly, a body tasked with drafting the country’s
new constitution, to make it more representative after 30
liberal and Christian members announced their final withdrawal
from the body on Nov. 18 in protest at what they say is the
body’s monopolization by Islamists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
