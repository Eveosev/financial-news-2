Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s largest
bank, is in talks with employee representatives on reducing
headcount at its Sal. Oppenheim unit as the wealth manager will
use more services offered by its parent.  The company will eliminate overlap between Sal. Oppenheim
and Deutsche Bank over the next 15 months which will affect a
“significant” number of jobs, the Cologne, Germany-based
division said today in an e-mailed statement. Deutsche Bank will
seek to avoid forced firings, it said.  Global banks are letting staff go to reduce costs as
clients shy from trades amid  Europe ’s debt crisis and as
stricter capital rules make some business unprofitable. Deutsche
Bank said Oct. 30 it will complete the majority of a targeted
1,993 job cuts, including 562 in asset and wealth management,
throughout the bank by year-end. It has said staff cuts will
exceed its initial targets.  Almost 500 jobs at Sal. Oppenheim will be cut by Deutsche
bank through the end of the first quarter of 2014,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported today on its website, citing several
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Parts of Sal. Oppenheim, such as public funds, will be
integrated into Deutsche Bank, according to the statement. The
unit will focus on private clients and certain institutional
customers, as well as expanding its custodian bank business in
Luxembourg and Cologne, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
