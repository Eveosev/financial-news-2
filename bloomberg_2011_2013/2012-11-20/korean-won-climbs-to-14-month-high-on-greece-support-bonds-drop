South Korea ’s won rose to a 14-month
high on speculation European finance ministers will find a way
to help Greece finance its  budget deficit  and stem the region’s
three-year debt crisis.  The currency advanced for a second day as euro-area finance
ministers meet today to discuss ways to plug a 15 billion-euro
($19 billion) gap in Greece’s finances and win the International
Monetary Fund’s support to give the nation more time to meet its
debt target. Overseas investors  bought  South Korean shares for
the first time in nine days, according to stock exchange data.  “Risk appetite is supported by some optimism that there
will be an agreement at today’s meeting about a second aid
package for  Greece ,” said Kim Dong Young, a currency dealer at
Industrial Bank of  Korea  in  Seoul . “Rising equities on the back
of foreign buying are also adding to the won’s strength.”  The won gained 0.4 percent to close at 1,082.23 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency earlier
reached 1,080.95, the strongest level since September 2011. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, slid 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage
point, to 5.60 percent. The  Kospi index  of shares advanced 0.6
percent.  The nation’s short-term overseas debt fell the most in a
year as regulators encouraged banks to shift to longer-term
borrowing. External debt maturing in one year or less dropped
$8.1 billion to $132.6 billion as of the end of September from
the previous quarter, the central bank said in a statement
today. Short-term debt accounted for 31.6 percent of the total,
the lowest since 1999, compared with 33.8 percent in the
previous quarter, according to the  Bank of Korea .  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 rose one basis point to 2.87 percent, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap
climbed one basis point to 2.78 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
