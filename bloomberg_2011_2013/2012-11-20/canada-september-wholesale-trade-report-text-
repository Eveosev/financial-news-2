The following is the text
of  Canada ’s wholesale trade report for September from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales fell 1.4% to $48.8 billion in September,
the third decline in four months. Sales were lower in every
subsector.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were down 1.3% in
September.  Sales lower in all subsectors  The motor vehicle and parts subsector was by far the
largest contributor in dollar terms to September’s decline,
followed by the personal and household goods subsector and the
machinery, equipment and supplies subsector. These three
subsectors accounted for more than 85% of the decrease.  Sales in the motor vehicle and parts subsector were down
for a third straight month, posting a 4.0% decline. This trend
coincides with a decrease in imports of motor vehicles and parts
during the same period.  The second largest decline was observed in the personal and
household goods subsector. Sales fell 2.0%, largely as a result
of a 3.3% decrease in the pharmaceuticals and pharmacy supplies
industry.  The machinery, equipment and supplies subsector decreased
1.0%, its second decline in three months. All four industries in
this subsector reported lower sales in September.  Lower sales in most provinces  Sales declined in nine provinces in September.  The decrease was concentrated in Ontario and  Quebec .
Wholesale sales in these two provinces have been on a downward
trend since mid-2012. These declines have almost entirely offset
the increases seen at the beginning of the year in Ontario and
half of the gains observed in Quebec.  Sales in Ontario fell 1.6% in September. This result was in
part due to lower sales in the motor vehicle industry, which
accounts for nearly 20% of the province’s total wholesale sales.  In Quebec, sales were down 1.7% after rising slightly in
August.  In Saskatchewan, sales decreased 3.6%, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline.  Manitoba was the only province to post an increase. Sales
were up 2.7% in September, the second straight advance.  Inventory levels down  Inventories were down 0.4% to $61.4 billion in September,
the first decrease in 10 months.  The decline was primarily due to lower inventories in the
motor vehicle industry (-7.2%), overshadowing the higher
inventories reported by 15 of 25 industries in September.  The slight decline in inventories compared with the
decrease in sales translated into an increase in the inventory-
to-sales ratio from 1.25 in August to 1.26 in September.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
current dollars, unless otherwise noted. For more information on

deflating current dollar values using relevant price indexes.
The wholesale sales series in chained (2007) dollars is a
chained Fisher volume index with 2007 as the reference year.  Data for total wholesale sales in volume, including the
chain Fisher volume index, have been revised from January 2004
onward to reflect methodological enhancements. In addition, the
reference year has changed from 2002 to 2007 for these volume
data. For more information, see Sales in volume for  Wholesale
Trade  ( http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb -

CANSIM table 081-0015. Revised data dating back to January 2004
are now available in this new CANSIM table.  To contact the reporter on this story:
