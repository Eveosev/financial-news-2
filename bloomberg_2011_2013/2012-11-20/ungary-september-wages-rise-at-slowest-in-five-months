Hungaryâ€™s September  average gross
wage growth  unexpectedly slowed to the weakest pace since April,
data from the Budapest-based statistics office showed.  Average gross wages rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier to
213,523 forint ($969) after increasing 3.8 percent in August and
jumping 7 percent in July, the data showed today. That compares
with a 4.4 percent median estimate of eight economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
