The Toronto Blue Jays will bring
back John Gibbons as their manager to replace John Farrell, who
took the same job with the  Boston  Red Sox, the  Toronto Sun
reported , without saying where it got the information.  Gibbons, 50, managed the Blue Jays for parts of five
seasons from 2004 to 2008 and compiled a 305-305 record. After
leaving Toronto, he was a bench coach for the Kansas City Royals
and last season managed the San Diego Padres’ Double-A team in
San Antonio to a 60-80 record.  Gibbons will be introduced today as the Blue Jays’ manager,
the Toronto Sun said. The hiring comes after the club landed
shortstop Jose Reyes and pitchers Josh Johnson and Mark Buehrle
in a 12-player trade with the Miami Marlins, and signed free
agent outfielder Melky Cabrera.  The Blue Jays, who haven’t made the Major League Baseball
postseason since winning back-to-back World Series titles in
1992 and 1993, had a 73-89 record last season and went 154-170
during Farrell’s two-year tenure. He left the club last month to
return to Boston, where he was the Red Sox pitching coach from
2007-10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
