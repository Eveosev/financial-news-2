Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) ’s BlackBerry
is being dropped by a U.S. government agency that cited the
device’s failures.  The  National Transportation Safety Board , which
investigates plane accidents, disclosed its plan to switch to
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 in a document posted last week to a
federal website. The BlackBerrys have been “failing both at
inopportune times and at an unacceptable rate,” according to
the NTSB’s notice.  The 400-employee agency “requires effective, reliable and
stable communication capabilities to carry out its primary
investigative mission and to ensure employee safety in remote
locations,” it wrote.  RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, has been hit by recent
defections by U.S. agencies and is counting on its new
BlackBerry 10 devices to shore up business among its more than 1
million government customers in  North America . Chief Executive
Officer Thorsten Heins said last week he expects at least
400,000 government customers in North America to embrace
BlackBerry 10 in a wave of device upgrades.  RIM rose 1.2 percent to close at $9.71 in  New York . The
shares earlier climbed as much as 4.7 percent following a rating
upgrade from Jefferies analyst  Peter Misek . The stock had
dropped 34 percent this year before today.  Losing Users  The new operating system is at the heart of RIM’s comeback
attempt, following years of market-share losses to Apple’s
iPhone and devices running  Google Inc.’s (GOOG)  Android operating
system. While some of RIM’s earliest and most loyal customers
have been in the U.S. government, it has lost users at agencies
such as the  General Services Administration , which has embraced
a bring-your-own device policy as a way of saving money.  The transportation board’s statement about the reliability
of BlackBerry devices “creates additional headwinds” for RIM,
said Sameet Kanade, an analyst at Northern Securities in Toronto
who rates the company’s shares a hold.  “Once customers start coming out in the open and saying
they’re dissatisfied with the product, it’s very, very
difficult” to gain traction with new customers, he said in a
phone interview. “It’s very difficult for your brand to be
relevant when you’re losing your base itself.”  Older Versions  Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the transportation board,
declined to elaborate on the problems the agency has had with
BlackBerry devices. He didn’t say what generation of BlackBerrys
the agency is using.  Heins said in the interview last week that many government
customers are using older versions of the BlackBerry operating
system.  “Many of these devices sit on BlackBerry 5 or BlackBerry
6, not even on BlackBerry 7, so the experience is not what I
know and what other BlackBerry users know in the consumer
domain,” he said. “It is a three-, four-year-old experience.”  Still, the company has faced two international service
disruptions for BlackBerry network service in the past 15 months
that have marred RIM’s reputation for reliability. Heins
apologized after the most recent incident in September.  Last week, the German-born executive said he’s determined
to win back government business and that the BlackBerry 10  will
be key to doing that. The company reiterated that sentiment in a
statement today.  RIM “has been dedicated to providing government with
secure, reliable mobile communications for more than a decade,”
the company said in an e-mail. “We will soon be launching the
new BlackBerry 10 platform globally to meet our customer’s needs
in the decade ahead.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
