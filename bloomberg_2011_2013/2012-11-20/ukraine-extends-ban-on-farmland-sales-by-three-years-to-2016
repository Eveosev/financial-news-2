Ukraine’s parliament extended a ban
on sales of farmland by three years to January 2016, giving time
to prepare related legislation.  The bill was backed by 269 members of the 450-seat
legislature in Kiev today. It was introduced by Yuriy
Miroshnichenko, a member of President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s Party
of Regions.  Agricultural land in Ukraine amounts to 41.6 million
hectares (102.8 million acres) covering 69 percent of the
nation, with arable land accounting for 32.5 million hectares.
Yanukovych had aimed to start a market for farmland next
January. For now, producers lease land from individual owners of
the country’s approximately 6.5 million plots.  The moratorium was extended because more laws related to a
market in farmland must be approved first, Miroshnichenko said
in an explanatory note on the parliamentary website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
