The coffee producing areas in
 Brazil , the largest grower of the bean, will have more rain this
week, which is expected to benefit the development of coffee
flowers, the weather consultant Somar said today.  The sugar-cane producing areas in the country will also
have rain this week, helping the development of the next crop,
Somar said. The irregular rain in the last 10 days helped speed
up the harvest, Somar said in an e-mailed report today.  The orange-producing regions in the country, the largest
grower of the fruit, are also expected to have rain this week,
Somar said in a separate report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
