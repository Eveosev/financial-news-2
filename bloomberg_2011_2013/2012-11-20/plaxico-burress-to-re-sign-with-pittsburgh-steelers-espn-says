The Pittsburgh Steelers brought back
wide receiver  Plaxico Burress  and signed former New England
Patriots backup quarterback Brian Hoyer, seeking to bolster two
positions depleted by injury.  Burress, 35, played for Pittsburgh from 2000 to 2004 and
rejoins the Steelers after injuries to receivers Antonio Brown
and Jerricho Cotchery.  Burress hasnâ€™t played in the National Football League since
being let go by the  New York  Jets after the 2011 season. He
returned to the NFL last season following a two-year absence,
including 20 months spent in jail on a weapons charge after
shooting himself in the leg while a member of the  New York
Giants . He had 45 catches for 612 yards and eight touchdowns for
the Jets.  The Steelers also gave a one-year contract to Hoyer with
starting quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  out with shoulder and
rib injuries, and backup Byron Leftwich sidelined with fractured
ribs. Charlie Batch, 37, will start this week against the
Cleveland Browns.  Hoyer, 27, spent the past three seasons with the Patriots
after being signed as an undrafted free agent out of Michigan
State, which also produced Burress. Hoyer appeared in 13 games
for New England, completing 27-of-43 passes for 286 yards with
one touchdown and an interception, before being released prior
to this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
