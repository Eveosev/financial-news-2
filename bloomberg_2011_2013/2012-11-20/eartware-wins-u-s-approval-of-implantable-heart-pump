HeartWare International Inc. (HIN)  won
U.S. regulatory approval for its implantable pump for heart-
transplant candidates, providing a smaller device than the only
so-called mechanical heart approved for patients in the country.  The company’s shares rose the most in seven months.
HeartWare, which has marketed its product in  Europe  since 2009,
is prepared to sell the device immediately in the 50 U.S.
hospitals that participated in clinical studies, Doug Godshall,
president and chief executive officer of the Framingham,
Massachusetts-based company, said today in a statement.  HeartWare’s product, designed to support blood flow in
people who have weakened hearts and are awaiting a transplant,
will compete with  Thoratec Corp. (THOR) ’s HeartMate II. HeartWare’s
device is smaller, allowing it to be implanted in smaller
patients, the  Food and Drug Administration  said in a statement.  “Its small size facilitates faster surgery and recovery
times,” Michael Manns, a Bloomberg Industries analyst, said in
a February research report.  HeartWare  rose  9 percent to $89.54 at the close in  New
York , its biggest single-day gain since April 26. Thoratec,
based in Pleasanton,  California ,  fell  1.1 percent to $35.  Heart failure  is a progressive disease that strikes 1 in 5
Americans older than 40. It occurs when a damaged organ can’t
supply enough oxygen-rich blood to keep other organs, such as
the lungs, working. There are few treatments and no cure.  Product Expansion  The pumps are intended to take over for a failing heart,
extending patients’ lives or gaining time to find a transplant
donor. Godshall said HeartWare will expand to more hospitals
that undergo training.  Thoratec’s HeartMate  generated  $366 million in revenue last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HeartMate II is
approved for heart-failure patients whether they are eligible
for transplantation.  HeartWare, which reported $83 million in  revenue  for 2011,
is studying the device in 450 patients who aren’t transplant
candidates, the company said in the statement. The final
patients in the study were implanted in May and will be followed
up for two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
