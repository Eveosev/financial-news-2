Russia produced more pork and
poultry in the first 10 months of the year and less beef,
government figures showed.  Production gained 14 percent from a year earlier in the
period for pork and fell 4.4 percent for beef, the Federal State
Statistics Service said in an e-mailed statement today. Output
of poultry and byproducts increased 15 percent, it said, without
giving amounts.  Beef production in October was little changed from a year
earlier at 17,900 metric tons, said Rosstat, as the service is
known. Output climbed 17 percent to 86,700 tons for pork and
rose 6.1 percent to 284,000 tons for poultry.  Cattle and poultry output by so-called live weight, which
includes skin, bones and byproducts, rose 7.9 percent to 8.8
million tons in the 10-month period, according to Rosstat.  Russiaâ€™s cattle herd amounted to 20.7 million head by the
end of October, 0.3 percent more than a year earlier. The number
of cows increased 0.8 percent to 9 million. Populations gained
6.1 percent to 19.7 million for hogs and expanded 6.8 percent to
25.6 million for sheep and goats, Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
