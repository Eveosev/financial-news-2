Plaxico Burress  will have a workout
and a physical today with the Pittsburgh Steelers, NFL.com said,
citing an unidentified person close to the free agent receiver.  Burress, 35, hasnâ€™t latched on with a National Football
League team since being let go by the  New York  Jets after the
2011 season. The Steelers are seeking depth at wide receiver
after losing Antonio Brown and Jerricho Cotchery to injury.  Burress, who played in Pittsburgh from 2000-04, last season
returned from a two-year absence during which he spent 20 months
in jail on a weapons charge after shooting himself in the leg
while a member of the New York Giants. He had 45 catches for 612
yards and eight touchdowns for the Jets last season.  The Steelers will also have quarterbacks Mike Kafka and
Brian Hoyer in for workouts, NFL.com said. Pittsburgh is without
starting quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  because of shoulder and
rib injuries, while backup Byron Leftwich sustained broken ribs
in a 13-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
