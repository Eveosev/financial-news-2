Gasoline advanced in the Gulf Coast
as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  extended maintenance at its Borger refinery in
 Texas  and Motiva Enterprises LLC said it expects to start a
crude unit at its  Port Arthur plant  in early December.  Phillips 66’s 146,000-barrel-a-day  Borger refinery  planned
to shut two fluid catalytic cracking units for maintenance
expected to last until today, the company said in a regulatory
filing Sept. 24. The plant may start up this weekend, the
company said.  The work has been delayed at least a week because repairs
were more difficult than anticipated, according to a person with
knowledge of the situation.  Motiva’s Port Arthur, Texas, facility, which has the
capacity to process 600,000 barrels a day, expects to start a
crude unit in early December, the company said today. The unit
shut in early June after a small fire, according to people
familiar with the situation.  Conventional 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf Coast
 strengthened  0.50 cent to a discount of 12.25 cents a gallon
versus futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:59 p.m.
Reformulated gasoline was unchanged at 11.50 cents under
futures.  Diesel fuel  in the region gained 0.35 cent to 1.5 cents
a gallon over heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
