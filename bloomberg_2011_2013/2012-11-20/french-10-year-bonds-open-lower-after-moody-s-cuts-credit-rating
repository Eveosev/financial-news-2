French 10-year bonds opened lower
after Moody’s Investors Service stripped the nation of its top
 credit rating .  The yield on the securities rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.09 percent as of 7:09 a.m. London time.  France was cut to Aa1 from Aaa, the rating company said
yesterday. The Moody’s downgrade follows a similar cut by
Standard & Poor’s in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
