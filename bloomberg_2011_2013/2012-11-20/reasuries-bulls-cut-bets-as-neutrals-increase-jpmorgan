Investors in Treasuries cut bullish
bets this week after increasing them to the most in almost four
months the week after President  Barack Obama  won re-election,
according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  proportion  of net longs was at two percentage points in
the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan, down from 11
percentage points the week ending Nov. 13.  Investors raised neutral bets to 68 percent from 59
percent, the survey reported. It touched 70 in the week ending
Nov. 5, the highest level since August, as Obama and former
Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  courted voters.  The percent of outright longs dropped to 17 percent, from
26 percent the previous week, the survey said. The percent of
outright shorts, or bets the securities will fall in value,
remained at 15 percent, according to the survey.  The yield on the benchmark U.S.  10-year note  rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.62 percent at 7:51 a.m. in
New York. It touched a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25
and reached a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn’t available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
