The rand declined for the first time
in three days as metal prices dropped amid concern a credit-
rating cut for  France  signals a worsening economic outlook for
the euro-area, South Africa’s biggest regional trading partner.  The rand retreated as much as 0.7 percent and traded 0.4
percent lower at 8.8647 a dollar as of 5:22 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Yields on the nation’s benchmark 10.5 percent
bonds due Dec. 2026 dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 7.57 percent.  France lost its top  credit rating  at Moody’s Investors
Service, which also maintained a negative outlook for Europe’s
second-largest economy, citing what it called a worsening growth
outlook. The euro area bought 21 percent of South Africa’s
exports in the first eight months of 2012, according to
government data.          Some risky assets “including the rand
are languishing,’  John Cairns , a currency strategist at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments.  Moody’s downgraded France to Aa1 from Aaa and maintained a
negative outlook. The downgrade followed one by  Standard &
Poor’s  in January. The S&P GSCI index of raw materials dropped
0.2 percent today.  Metals and other commodities accounted for 45 percent of
South Africa’s exports in 2011, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
