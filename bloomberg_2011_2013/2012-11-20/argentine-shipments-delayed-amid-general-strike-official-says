Argentine port workers joined a 24-
hour strike that’s delaying shipments, said Guillermo Wade, an
official at the port exporters chamber.  All Parana River ports have shipments waiting to be loaded
with grain, Wade said by telephone from Rosario.  Argentina ’s biggest trade unions blocked highways and
halted train, bus and subway services in their first general
strike against President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to
protest rising prices and taxes. Ships will remain at port as
immigration, customs, health as well as port administration
employees are involved in the strike, Wade said.  “Main roads and highways going to the waterfronts are
blocked,” he said. “This is the first strike in the Kirchner
era affecting the whole shipment infrastructure.”  About 300 trucks had entered Rosario, the country’s largest
soybean export port, today compared with a daily average of
2,900, Lucia Cuffia, a spokeswoman for the Rosario cereals
exchange, said by telephone. Cargill Inc. and  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  are
among grain exporters operating in Rosario.  To contact the reporter on this story:
