Colin Kaepernick threw two touchdown
passes while filling in for injured quarterback  Alex Smith  and
the  San Francisco 49ers  defeated the Chicago Bears 32-7 in the
 National Football League ’s Monday night game.  The 49ers (7-2-1) scored the most points this year against
the Bears (7-3), who entered the game ranking second in the NFL
by allowing an average of 14.8 points per game. The 49ers are
giving up the fewest points per game -- moving to an average of
13.4 points allowed after last night’s win.  “I wanted to come out and show what I was capable of,”
Kaepernick, 25, said after his first career NFL start. “It’s
everything I could have ever wished for.”  It was the second straight loss for Chicago, which was
outgained 355 yards to 143 yards, following a six-game winning
streak.  Both teams were missing their starting quarterbacks due to
concussions. Smith and Chicago’s  Jay Cutler  both were injured
Nov. 11 and ruled out last night. Jason Campbell started for
Chicago, completing 14 of 22 passes for 107 yards and getting
sacked six times and intercepted twice.  “Tonight was probably the worst nightmare,” Campbell said
in a news conference. “One of the toughest games I have been
involved in my career.”  The 49ers built a 20-0 halftime lead, outgaining the Bears
249 yards to 35 yards in the first half. Kaepernick had a 3-yard
scoring pass to  Vernon Davis , Kendall Hunter had a 14-yard
touchdown run and  David Akers  added field goals of 32 and 37
yards.  Smith’s Sacks  San Francisco increased its margin to 27 points early in
the third quarter on a 10-yard scoring reception by  Michael Crabtree . Chicago responded with a 13-yard touchdown pass from
Campbell to  Brandon Marshall .  The 49ers made it 32-7 in the fourth quarter on Akers’
third field goal, a 32-yarder, and a safety.  Kaepernick went 16-of-23 passing for 243 yards with no
interceptions. Aldon Smith had 5 1/2 sacks for San Francisco,
which got its 43rd Monday Night Football victory to tie the
Dallas Cowboys for the most in NFL history.  San Francisco coach  Jim Harbaugh , who missed practice five
days ago when he was treated at a hospital for an irregular
heartbeat, said he was impressed by Kaepernick and declined to
say who would be the team’s Week 12 starter.  “We’ll see,” Harbaugh said in his post-game news
conference. “I usually tend to go with the guy who’s got the
hot hand and we’ve got two quarterbacks that have got a hot
hand. I thought Colin did an outstanding job.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
