Nordic electricity for delivery
January through March fell to the lowest in more than two weeks
as forecasts of increased rainfall indicated more water for
hydropower production.  “Mild and wet weather and weak carbon keep Nordic power in
negative territory,” Danish energy trading company Energi
Danmark A/S said today on its website.  Electricity for delivery next quarter lost 1.9 percent to
40.15 euros ($51.43) a megawatt-hour, the lowest close since
Nov. 5, on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo.
Power for next month fell 1.8 percent to 38.55 euros.  “It’s a bearish picture, with high hydropower and nuclear
supply, and low demand from industries, and also from
households, due to quite mild weather,” Olav Botnen, senior
analyst at Markedskraft AS, a power market analysis and
portfolio management company, said today by phone from
 Stockholm .  Temperatures in the Stockholm area may climb as high as 7
degrees Celsius (45 degrees Fahrenheit) over the next 10 days,
and are set to drop to 3 degrees by Nov. 29, according to the
website of  Sweden ’s Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.  The Nordic region meets more than half its power needs by
running  water through turbines , which is why rain affects
electricity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
