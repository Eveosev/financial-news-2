European stocks  rose for a second
day amid speculation the region’s finance ministers will agree
on a Greek financing deal and optimism Israelis and Palestinians
will sign up to a cease-fire in Gaza.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  jumped to the highest level in five years,
leading travel shares higher, after the budget airline doubled
its dividend.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) 
advanced as investors approved their $31 billion merger.  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  paced a decline in financial shares, dropping
1.7 percent on plans to reorganize its investment bank.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  added 0.3 percent to 269.49 at
the close of trading, extending yesterday’s 2.2 percent jump to
reach a one-week high. The gauge, which fluctuated between gains
and losses at least 10 times today, has rallied 15 percent from
a June 4 low as the European Central Bank announced an unlimited
bond-buying plan and the Federal Reserve began a third round of
asset purchases.  “The market has rebounded on talk that there will be a
cease-fire in  Israel ,” said Stephane Ekolo, chief European
strategist at Market Securities, in  London . “There also is the
possibility of a resolution regarding Greek debt in tonight’s
meeting and that is helping stocks.”  European finance ministers are discussing ways to fill a 15
billion-euro ($19.2 billion) gap in  Greece ’s public accounts at
a meeting in Brussels today. The options under consideration
include recycling ECB profits on Greek bonds, charging Greece
lower interest rates and extending repayment deadlines.  Debt Load  Last week, European leaders granted Greece two more years
to cut its budget deficit. The required extra financing resulted
in a clash with the International Monetary Fund, since it would
add to Greece’s debt load instead of reducing it.  “There are good chances that we will come to a conclusive
mutual solution, but I can’t be entirely sure,” Luxembourg
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters before
chairing the meeting.  International efforts to end a week of fighting between
Israel and Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip will succeed
within hours, according to Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi.
What he termed Israeli aggression against the territory will end
today, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  In the U.S., Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is scheduled to
address the Economic Club of New York at 12:15 p.m. local time.
Investors are speculating the central bank, which has its next
policy meeting Dec. 11-12, will increase bond purchases to spur
the economy.  Housing Starts  U.S.  housing starts  unexpectedly climbed 3.6 percent to a
four-year high in October. Builders broke ground on 894,000
homes at an annual rate after a 863,000 pace in September,
Commerce Department figures showed. The median estimate of 82
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for 840,000 starts.  National benchmark indexes rose in 14 of the 18 western
European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 and  Germany ’s DAX
climbed 0.7 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index increased
0.2 percent.  EasyJet rallied 6.1 percent to 692 pence, the highest price
since November 2007, after increasing its annual dividend to
21.5 pence from 10.5 pence. The discount airline carrier said

($504 million), compared with an average analyst estimate of 314
million pounds.  Xstrata advanced 3.1 percent to 986.6 pence and Glencore
added 1.6 percent to 331.75 pence as Glencore’s $31 billion
takeover of Xstrata was approved by investors, leaving clearance
by regulators in Europe and  China  as the remaining hurdles for
this year’s biggest deal.  In Favor  Shareholders voted in favor of a resolution to approve
Glencore’s offer without retention payments for about 70 Xstrata
managers and then rejected the bonus packages in a separate
ballot, ensuring the deal proceeds, Xstrata said.  Credit Suisse retreated 1.7 percent to 21.19 Swiss francs

Chrysler Group LLC.  Exor SpA (EXO) , which is Fiat’s  biggest shareholder , slipped 3.8
percent to 18.37 euros after UBS also lowered its recommendation
on the shares to neutral from buy.  Soccer Championship  Royal  Imtech NV (IM) , the Dutch provider of infrastructure for
stadiums in this year’s European soccer championship and London
Olympics, tumbled 11 percent to 15.68 euros, the biggest drop in
more than four years. ABN Amro Bank NV downgraded the shares to
sell from buy, saying the company could breach a banking
covenant this year.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  soared 13 percent to 310.7 pence, the biggest

producer jumped 9.3 percent yesterday after winning support from
shareholders for a $817 million stock sale aimed at helping it
avoid breaching pledges to creditors.  Accor SA (AC)  rallied 3.4 percent to 24.71 euros as Exane BNP
