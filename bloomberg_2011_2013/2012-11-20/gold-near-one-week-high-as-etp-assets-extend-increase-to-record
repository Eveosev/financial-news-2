Gold declined from a one-week high
as a Hamas official said a draft accord with Israel that would
end fighting in the Gaza Strip is almost ready, crimping demand
for the metal as an investment haven.  An announcement was likely at 9 p.m. Cairo time, and the
cease-fire will take effect at midnight, Osama Hamdan, a Hamas
official, said by telephone from Beirut. His comments came as
U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  flew to the region to
join truce talks that also include United Nations Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon.  “Signs of a cease-fire seems to have taken some blush off
gold,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
