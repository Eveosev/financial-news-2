Estonian Air will fire almost half
of its employees and reduce flights to 10 or fewer destinations
as the Baltic nation’s national carrier seeks to avoid
insolvency.  “The structure of the company will be based on operating
five aircraft and serving nine to 10 core destinations,” Chief
Executive Officer Jan Palmer said today on the company’s
 website . “Cutbacks in the flight volumes unfortunately lead to
operating with a smaller number of employees.”  The company, which is 97.3 percent owned by the Estonian
government, will dismiss 146 of its current 318 employees, it
said. Of the remaining 172, 100 will be flight crew.  Estonian Air fired Chief Executive Officer Tero Taskila on
Oct. 31, after its nine-month net loss widened to 20.2 million
euros from 11.2 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
