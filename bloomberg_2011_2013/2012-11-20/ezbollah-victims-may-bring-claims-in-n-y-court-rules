A Lebanese bank can face claims in
New York of negligence and breach of duty in a lawsuit brought
by U.S., Israeli and Canadian victims of Hezbollah rocket
attacks and their families, the state’s highest court ruled.  The victims sued American Express Bank Ltd. and Lebanese
Canadian Bank in 2008, saying the banks helped the terrorist
group attack targets in northern  Israel  in July and August 2006
by handling wire transfers of millions of U.S. dollars. The
Lebanese bank, based in  Beirut , merged with Societe Generale
Lebanon last year.  U.S. District Judge George Daniels in 2010 dismissed a
negligence claim against American Express. That decision was
upheld in March by a federal appeals court, which also said it
may later review claims of personal jurisdiction against
Lebanese Canadian Bank that were dismissed by Daniels.  The federal appeals court also said it would seek a
determination from New York’s highest court on whether claims of
negligence and breach of duty can be applied to a foreign bank’s
maintenance of correspondence under state law.  The state court today said the Lebanese bank’s “repeated
use of the correspondent account shows not only transaction of
business, but an articulable nexus or substantial relationship
between the transaction and the alleged breaches of statutory
duties,” Judge Susan P. Read wrote in the decision. “LCB did
not route a transfer for a terrorist group once or twice by
mistake.”  The case is Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, 10-1306, 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ( New York ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
