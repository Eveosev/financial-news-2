European Union weekly pig prices
were mixed as  Germany  was stable, levels in  Spain  fell for a
sixth week and French pig prices rose, said industry group
Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  German pig prices were unchanged at 1.776 euros ($2.27) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) for a third week, Damme, Germany-based ISN
said in a  report  on its website today. Prices in Spain fell to
1.793 euros a kilogram from 1.807 euros, the group said.  The EU is home to 19 percent of the world’s pigs, based on
data from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Germany is the
EU’s biggest pork producer, ahead of Spain and France.  In Germany, “given the pressure from slaughter companies
the further price development is uncertain,” ISN said. “Spain
is still dealing with the consequences of the general strike on
Nov. 14.”  Prices in the three biggest EU producers moved closer this
week, ISN data show. French prices climbed for a second week to
1.739 euros a kilogram from 1.706 euros the previous week,
rising to the highest in four weeks, ISN data show. Pig prices
were stable in Denmark and fell in the Netherlands and  Belgium .  The EU has forecast output of pig meat in the bloc will
decline 3.2 percent next year on higher feed costs and new
animal-welfare rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
