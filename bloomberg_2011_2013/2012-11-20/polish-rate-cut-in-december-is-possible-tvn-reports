Poland’s central bank may reduce
borrowing costs next month amid a worsening economy, policy
maker Andrzej Kazmierczak said in an interview with TVN CNBC.  “There’s a chance, there’s a possibility, that the
Monetary Policy Council will give Poles a Christmas gift and
will lower  interest rates ,” Kazmierczak said in the interview,
broadcast late yesterday. “The macroeconomic situation
justifies monetary easing.”  The council will hold its next rate meeting Dec. 4-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
