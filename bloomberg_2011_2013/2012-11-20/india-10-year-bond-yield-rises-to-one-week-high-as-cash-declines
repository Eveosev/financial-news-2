India ’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing
the yield to a one-week high, on speculation a decline in cash
in the financial system will reduce demand for debt.  Banks borrowed an average 821 billion rupees ($15 billion)
a day from the central bank this month to meet shortages,
compared with 671 billion rupees for the whole of October,
official data show. Bonds also dropped on concern the government
will boost borrowings to meet a revenue shortfall after failing
to raise even 25 percent of its target from an auction of
mobile-phone wave spectrum last week, said N.S. Venkatesh,
treasurer at  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)   “Demand is subdued as liquidity is tight,” said Mumbai-
based Venkatesh. “The fiscal-deficit situation is also not
giving any comfort.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds due June
2022 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.20
percent in Mumbai as of 9:55 a.m., according to the central
bank’s trading system.  The finance ministry plans to raise a record 5.69 trillion
rupees ($104 billion) selling debt in the year ending March 31,
according to the government’s budget estimates.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 7.77 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
