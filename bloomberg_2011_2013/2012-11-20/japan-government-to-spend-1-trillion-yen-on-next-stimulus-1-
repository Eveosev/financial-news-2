The Japanese government will spend 1
trillion yen ($12.3 billion) on a second round of fiscal
stimulus as it tries to revive an economy at risk of sliding
into recession.  The government will tap reserve funds from this fiscal
year’s budget, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told
reporters in Tokyo today. The latest measures follow the
announcement of 750 billion yen of stimulus last month.  Economy Minister  Seiji Maehara  said last week that using
reserve funds won’t be enough to support the economy and the
government should compile a supplementary budget. The  Bank of
Japan (8301)  refrained today from adding to monetary stimulus, with
most analysts in a  Bloomberg News  survey forecasting more easing
in December.  The dissolution of the Diet prior to the election on Dec.
16 may restrict the government’s ability to stimulate an economy
that risks its third technical recession since 2008.  The economy will contract an annualized 0.4 percent in the
September-to-December period according the median forecast in a
survey of economists by Bloomberg News after shrinking 3.5
percent in the third quarter. A textbook recession means two
straight quarters of contraction.  Japanese recessions are officially defined by a government-
charged panel that considers data beyond GDP figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
