Drake & Scull Intentional PJSC, (DSI)  a
supplier of engineering services to the construction industry,
gained the most in more than seven weeks on bets this week’s
drop was overdone.  Shares climbed 1.5 percent, the most since Oct. 1, to 72.9
fils at the close in Dubai. It was the  most traded  on the
benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , which rose 0.8 percent. The stock
had plunged more than 9 percent in the past two days after
third-quarter profit  slumped 93 percent .  “One quarter is not enough to judge the performance of the
company, though results came way below estimates,” said Talal Touqan, head of research at Al Ramz Securities LLC in  Abu Dhabi .  Net income dropped to 3.92 million dirhams ($1.1 million),
reflecting a slowdown in the  construction industry . The median
estimate of four analysts was for a profit of 37.8 million
dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Drake & Scull’s  14-day relative strength index  has fallen
to 23. A reading below 30 indicates to some analysts that a
security is poised to gain. The shares have lost 3 percent this
year, compared with an 18 percent gain for the benchmark index.  Four analysts have a buy rating on the stock, eight
recommend hold while one says sell, according to  data compiled
by Bloomberg.   To contact the reporter on this story:
