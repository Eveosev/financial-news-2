Cargill Inc. will buy between 80,000
and 90,000 metric tons of certified cocoa from Ivory Coast in
the season that started last month, according to Jos De Loor,
the president of Cargill Cocoa and Chocolate.  “We aim to buy 50 percent of certified cocoa by 2015,” De
Loor told reporters in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the world’s largest
producer.  The company will invest as much as $20 million in its
Cargill Cocoa Promise program this season to train cooperatives
and distribute new seeds and fertilizers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
