Anna Gristina, a  New York  woman
accused of running a brothel that prosecutors said catered to
wealthy clients, was sentenced to six months in jail.  Gristina pleaded guilty before New York State Supreme Court
Justice Juan Merchan on Sept. 25 in Manhattan to one count of
promoting prostitution. Merchan today also sentenced Gristina to
a term of probation.  Prosecutors said in court in September that no evidence has
surfaced to support Gristina’s claims of “connections and
influence” in law enforcement agencies including the  New York
City Police Department , the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  and
the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.  Gristina, a British subject who is a legal permanent
resident of the U.S., acknowledged during her plea that she
“knowingly advanced and profited from prostitution by managing,
supervising, controlling and owning a prostitution business and
enterprise” involving activity by two or more prostitutes
between July 18 and July 27, 2011.  She admitted that through phone calls,  text messages  and at
least one face-to-face meeting she arranged for a man known to
her as Anthony to engage in sexual conduct with the two
prostitutes at an apartment on East 78th Street.  The case is People v. Gristina, 12-00751, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
