An over-congested grid in  India ’s
 Tamil Nadu  state, which has the nation’s biggest installed wind
capacity, is forcing farms to stop generating electricity,
 Orient Green Power Co. (OGPL)  said.  The clean-energy developer, backed by Bessemer Venture
Partners, has cut generation at wind farms in the southern state
by as much as 15 percent, Chief Financial Officer J. Sivakumar
told analysts on a conference call yesterday. Other companies
may be suffering greater losses, he said.  The state’s aging power-transmission system is crimping new
investment in Tamil Nadu, where 40 percent of wind capacity in
India is located. The country is the world’s third-biggest wind
market. State authorities have asked wind farms to shut down
turbines to avoid destabilizing the grid and have also delayed
payments to power producers for electricity sold to cash-
strapped state utilities.  Orient Green, which initially planned to build 300
megawatts of wind capacity in the state, has shifted at least 50
percent of that elsewhere “to de-risk this problem of grid
availability,” Managing Director P. Krishnakumar said on the
call. The company may sell land it bought in the state for wind
parks to pay down debt, he said.  Orient Green’s investors include Bessemer Ventures, an
early investor in Skype Technologies SA, and Olympus Capital
Holdings  Asia , according to its website. It operates 398
megawatts of capacity, including 337 megawatts of wind power and
61 megawatts of biomass plants, according to a Nov. 12 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
