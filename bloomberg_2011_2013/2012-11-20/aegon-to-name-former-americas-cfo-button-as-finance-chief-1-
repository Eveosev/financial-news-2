Aegon NV (AGN) , the Dutch owner of U.S.
insurer Transamerica Corp., plans to name Darryl Button as chief
financial officer, succeeding Jan Nooitgedagt.  Button, 43, was finance chief at the insurer’s American
operation, which generates most of its profit, for eight years,
the Hague-based company said in a statement today. Most recently
he was head of Aegon’s Corporate Financial Center, which manages
risk, tax, finance and investor relations. The supervisory board
will propose his appointment at a meeting on May 15.  Aegon is countering low interest rates and market turmoil
by cutting cost and shifting to products that are less sensitive
to market volatility. The company plans to boost the share of
profit it gets from fee-based businesses, which include unit-
linked pensions and variable annuities, to as much as 35 percent
by 2015 from 16 percent in 2010 and 33 percent in the third
quarter.  Aegon also seeks to increase underlying pretax profit by 7
percent to 10 percent a year on average until 2015.  In the Americas, the percentage derived from fee-based
income rose to 26 percent in the first quarter from 15 percent
in 2007, according to a presentation by Button and Mark Mullin,
chief executive officer of the Americas unit, in June. Since
2009 Aegon has restructured its U.S. operations, cutting back
from 12 divisions to three.  Target ‘Focus’  “Nooitgedagt has been instrumental in Aegon’s capital
restructuring, yet from now on investors will focus on how the
company will reach its 2015 growth targets,” said Jan Willem Weidema, an Amsterdam-based analyst at ABN Amro Bank NV. “This
will largely have to come from the U.S. unit and it instills
trust that they name a man with eight years of experience in
that unit as finance chief.”  Aegon  shares  rose 0.1 percent to 4.23 euros as of 11:59
a.m. in Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 8.2
billion euros ($10.5 billion). That compares to a 0.2 percent
gain in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Insurance Index. (SXIP)   Nooitgedagt, 59, will retire at the end of his current
term, the company said. He became CFO in April 2009. During his
tenure, the former Ernst & Young LLP partner helped raise
capital to repay 3 billion euros in state aid received in 2008.
He oversaw the sale of Transamerica Reinsurance to  Scor SE (SCR)  in
2011 for $1.4 billion after tax and led restructuring programs
in the Netherlands and the U.K.  Aegon also said that Chief Risk Officer Tom Grondin will be
appointed to the management board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
