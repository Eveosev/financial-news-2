Bonds of  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  fell
after the world’s largest computer maker reported fourth-quarter
results that included an $8.8 billion impairment charge linked
to the 2011 acquisition of Autonomy Corp.  Hewlett-Packard’s $1.5 billion of 4.65 percent bonds
maturing in December 2021 dropped as much as 3.1 cents to 94.9
cents on the dollar, the lowest since the bonds were issued last
year, before trading at 96.2 cents to yield 5.18 percent at 8:56
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Its $1.2 billion of 6 percent securities due in 2041
dropped 2.9 cents to a record-low 92.7 cents.  The charge is linked to “serious accounting improprieties,
disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations at
Autonomy,” Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard said
today in a statement that also forecast fiscal first-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates amid a continuing slump
in personal computer sales.  Credit-default swaps protecting the debt of Hewlett-Packard
surged 32.9 basis points to 378.5 basis points, the highest on
record, as of 8:30 a.m. in New York, according to data provider
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The contracts, which typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves, pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
