The U.S. signed a five-year
agreement with  Mexico  today that for the first time guarantees
water flow in the Colorado River that empties into the Gulf of
 California .  Most years, almost all water in the river that stretches
1,450 miles (2,333 kilometers) through five western U.S. states
is diverted for agricultural, municipal and industrial purposes
in the two countries, before it reaches the channel’s mouth in
Mexico, according to the  Pacific Institute , an Oakland,
California-based nonprofit research group.  “We’ve been working for more than 15 years to get water
back in the river,”  Michael Cohen , a Pacific Institute senior
associate, said in the statement. The agreement “is a huge step
forward for the embattled Colorado River delta.”  The “Minute 319” pact signed today amends a  1944 water
treaty  between the U.S. and Mexico involving the Colorado,
Tijuana and Rio Grande rivers that included agriculture, fishing
and navigation interests, according to the Pacific Institute.  U.S. Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar ’s 2010 visit to Mexico
to complete the Minute 318 water agreement led to the current
deal, according to a government statement. The first of the so-
called  Minutes , which cover land-use and water issues between
the two countries, was in 1922.  “What we’re doing now in the Colorado River basin provides
an international model for how to resolve water issues,”
Salazar said today on a conference call. “Together we can
ensure to the best of our ability that economies will continue
to grow on both sides of the border.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
