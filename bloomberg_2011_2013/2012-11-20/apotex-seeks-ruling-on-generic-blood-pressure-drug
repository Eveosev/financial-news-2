Apotex Inc. asked a judge to rule
that its plan to market a generic version of the blood-pressure
medicine Benicar won’t infringe patent rights held by drugmaker
 Daiichi Sankyo Co. (4568)  or its American unit.  In a petition filed today in federal court in  Chicago ,
closely held Apotex said a finding of non-infringement on one of
two relevant patents will let it compete sooner with Mylan Inc.,
the maker of generic drugs that also intends to sell a version
of the medication.  Mylan, which lost a challenge to the other patent in 2010,
has exclusive rights to sell its version of the drug for at
least 180 days after that patent expires because it was the
first to seek the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s permission
to do so.  Absent a ruling in its favor on a patent it claims  Daiichi
Sankyo  let lapse in 2009, it will be deprived of sales while the
public is deprived of its competition with Mylan, Toronto-based
Apotex said.  Mylan is based in Canonsburg,  Pennsylvania . Daiichi Sankyo
is based in Tokyo. Its U.S. unit and co-defendant, Daiichi
Sankyo Inc., is based in Parsippany, New Jersey.  The case is Apotex Inc. v. Daiichi Sankyo, 12-cv-9295, U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
