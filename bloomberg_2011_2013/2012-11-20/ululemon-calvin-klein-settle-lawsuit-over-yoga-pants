Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) , the
Canadian yoga-wear retailer, settled a lawsuit accusing Calvin
Klein Inc. of infringing patents for pant designs.  Terms of the settlement are confidential, the companies
said today in a statement. Lululemon withdrew the case in a
filing today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Founded in 1998, Vancouver-based Lululemon entered the U.S.
market in 2003. The company sued New York-based Calvin Klein in
August seeking unspecified damages, including lost profits and
royalties, for infringement of three patents.  The patents cover products sold in the U.S. under the Astro
Pant name, Lululemon said. Calvin Kleinâ€™s alleged infringing
products include knee-length running tights and overlapping
waistband pants.  The case is Lululemon Athletica Canada Inc. v. Calvin Klein
Inc., 12-01034, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
