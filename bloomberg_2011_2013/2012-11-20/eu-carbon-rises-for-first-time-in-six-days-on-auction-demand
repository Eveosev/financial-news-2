European Union carbon recovered from
its lowest price in five months after demand for allowances for
the next phase of the bloc’s carbon market improved.  Permits for December erased losses to close 0.5 percent
higher at 6.74 euros ($8.63) a metric ton on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the first increase since Nov. 12. They
earlier fell as much as 3.9 percent to 6.45 euros a ton, the
lowest since June 8.  Demand at two auctions of EU permits today increased
compared with sales last week, suggesting greater demand. There
were bids totaling 12.1 million tons for a sale by the EU of 4.5
million allowances, while  Germany ’s final sale for Phase 2
permits had bids for almost 6.4 times the amount for sale.  The EU, Greece, Germany and the U.K. are selling 21 million
tons of permits this week as the bloc ramps up its auctioning
program before the start of the third phase of the market, which
runs from 2013 through 2020.  Carbon prices fell 26 percent through yesterday since the
EU proposed on Nov. 12 to delay the sale of 900 million permits
from 2013 through 2015 until 2019 and 2020.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
declined 8.2 percent to 78 euro cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
