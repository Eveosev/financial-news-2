Juhl Wind Inc. (JUHL) , a U.S. renewable-
energy developer, plans to purchase 260 megawatts of aging wind
farms over three years through a joint venture with closely held
8030 Companies.  Working with Boulder, Colorado-based 8030 will help Juhl
expand in the Western U.S., John Mitola, the company’s
president, said today in an interview. The venture may buy about
60 megawatts worth of projects in 2013 and 100 megawatts in each
of the following two years.  The venture is seeking wind farms of less than 100
megawatts that are about a decade old, when equipment typically
needs to be upgraded and a production tax credit that pays 2.2
cents per kilowatt-hour expires, Mitola said.  Juhl, based in Pipestone,  Minnesota , wants to take
advantage of “the changing priorities of the conglomerates”
that are looking to exit the industry, he said. “The shakeout
in the industry has been tremendous, and there are fewer
survivors.”  “We have the capacity to buy about three to five farms a
year, probably three in 2013 averaging about 20 megawatts,”
Mitola said.  Juhl has completed 21 projects and last year purchased its
first wind farm, a 17-turbine facility in Woodstock Hills,
Minnesota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
