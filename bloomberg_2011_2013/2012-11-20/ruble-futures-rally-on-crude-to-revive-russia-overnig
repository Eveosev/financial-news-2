Ruble futures climbed to the
strongest level in a month on speculation a revival in  oil
prices  and relatively high  interest rates  will lure investors to
Russian assets.  Futures on the Russian currency expiring in December added
0.1 percent to 31.473 per dollar during U.S. trading hours
yesterday, the strongest level since Oct. 22. Contracts on the
country’s RTS stock index were little changed at 140,010 as the
Bloomberg Russia-US Index of the most traded Russian companies
in the U.S. was also steady.  The ruble has gained 2.7 percent versus the dollar in 2012,
beating a 1 percent advance in the Chinese  yuan  and a 10 percent
tumble in the Brazilian real, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Russian oil blend Urals crude, while down 1.3 percent yesterday,
has traded at an average $110.49 a barrel this year, up from
$109.47 in 2011. Russia’s 8.25 percent refinancing rate compares
with the euro area’s 0.75 percent benchmark, the U.K.’s 0.5
percent and 4.5 percent in Poland.  “I would still be a buyer of the ruble,”  Rogerio Oliveira , a fixed-income strategist at Peridiem Global Investors
LLC, said by phone from Los Angeles yesterday. “Higher tensions
in the  Middle East  and relatively high interest versus other
currencies, like the euro and the pound, make it very
attractive.”  The ruble surged 0.6 percent to 31.3113 per dollar in
Moscow yesterday, while the 30-stock Micex Index slid 0.2
percent 1,395.77. The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge gained 0.1
percent to 91.82 in  New York , as declines in coal producer OAO
 Mechel (MTL)  and phone operator  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT)  offset  Yandex
NV (YNDX) ’s advance.  Crude Slumps  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, dropped 0.2 percent to $27.34
yesterday, the first decline in four days. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in futures, fell 0.7
percent to 24.72 points.  Crude oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, slumped 2.8
percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday to $86.75
a barrel. Brent oil for January settlement slipped $1.87, or 1.7
percent, to end the session at $109.83 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Prospects of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to end
fighting in the  Gaza Strip  drove yesterday’s declines. A truce
won’t be possible before today because Israel hasn’t responded
to proposals, Hamas official Ezzat al-Rishq said yesterday,
according to a Reuters report. The Israeli military said in
Twitter posts that it hit more than 30 targets in Gaza after
about 8 p.m. local time yesterday.  Ruble Strength  Even if the situation in Gaza is resolved, Israel’s
tensions with  Iran  will probably buoy oil into 2013 and thereby
bolster the ruble, according to Win Thin, global head of
emerging-markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in
New York.  “No one really buys  Russia  for domestic fundamentals,”
Thin said by e-mail yesterday. “I still see the ruble as an oil
play.”  Crude oil futures for November 2013 delivery are trading at
$90.22 a barrel on the Mercantile Exchange. There’s a 33 percent
chance that Israel will wage an air strike against Iran by the
end of next year, according to bets made on Intrade.com,
compared with 36.2 percent a week ago.  The ruble will strengthen to 30.96 per dollar by the end of
the first quarter, according to the median of 23 analysts’
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Falling Yields  Yields on ruble-denominated Russian government debt due in
August 2016 have fallen 28 basis points, or 0.28 percentage
point, this quarter to 7.05 percent yesterday. The  average
sovereign yield  has dropped 10 basis points to 3.42 percent in
the same period, according to an index compiled by JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Yandex, owner of Russia’s biggest Internet search engine,
was the biggest gainer on the Russia-US gauge yesterday, rising
1.6 percent to $22.54. The company isn’t traded in Russia.  American depositary receipts of  Mechel (MTLR) , the nation’s
largest producer of steelmaking coal, dropped 2.1 percent to
$5.96 in New York. The company’s shares slipped 1.8 percent in
Moscow to 189.20 rubles, or $6.05, the lowest since Sept. 5. The
ADRs traded at a 1.4 percent discount to the company’s Micex-
listed shares.  Mobile TeleSystems  Mobile TeleSystems’ ADRs tumbled 2.4 percent in New York to
$17.35 as shares in Moscow slid 0.9 percent to 233.61 rubles, or
$7.46. Each ADR represents two common shares.  Sweden’s Tele2 AB may get control of a mobile venture under
discussion with OAO Rostelecom, Vedomosti newspaper reported,
citing an unidentified person close to a Rostelecom shareholder.  “This is important news with long-term implications on
 Megafon , Mobile TeleSystems and Vimpelcom,”  Luis Saenz , head of
equity sales and trading at BCS Financial Group in London, said
by e-mail yesterday. “The combination of the two and creation
of a single number four player would allow to speed up mobile
data network rollout and get closer to the Big-3.”  ADRs of  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the mobile carrier with operations
in Russia, Italy,  Africa  and Asia, gained 0.7 percent in New
York to $10.81, the second day of advances.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 1.1 percent to HK$4.39 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:14
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
