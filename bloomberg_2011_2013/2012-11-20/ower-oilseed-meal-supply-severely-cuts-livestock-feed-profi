Declining global soybean supplies
will have a more severe effect on the livestock feed sector than
the vegetable oil market because inventories of  palm oil  are
ample, Oil World said.  Supplies of oilseed meal used in feed will be reduced until
April, when the South American soybean harvest eases shortfalls,
the Hamburg-based researcher said today in an e-mailed report.
World inventories of eight oilseed meals may decline to 8.47
million metric tons by the end of this marketing year on Sept.
30, down 7.7 percent from a year earlier. Soybean meal ending
stocks may drop 6.8 percent to 6.86 million tons, Oil World
said.  “The feeding profitability has deteriorated severely in
recent months, and rationing of oil meal demand has started,”
Oil World said. “Additional demand-rationing will be required,
and this is likely to keep oil meal prices on an elevated level
in the near- to medium-term.”  The price of soybean meal is up 36 percent this year on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade, reaching a record $541.80 per 2,000
pounds on Sept. 4 as drought cut U.S. yields following dry
weather that reduced South American output last season. Soybean-
oil futures have declined 8 percent this year in Chicago, as the
price of palm oil tumbled 23 percent on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange.  World palm oil production in the year that began Oct. 1 may
rise to 54.3 million tons, 2.8 million tons larger than the
previous season. Output in  Indonesia  may be 27 million tons, up
1.5 million tons, and Malaysia may produce 19.25 million tons,
up 1 million tons.  Global production of eight vegetable oils may rise by 2.4
million tons this season, the smallest increase in at least 11
years, as supplies of products including rapeseed oil and
sunflower seed oil decline, the researcher said. Stockpiles of
the eight oils may fall by 700,000 tons in the 2012-13 season,
Oil World said.  “Fortunately, large stocks, primarily of palm oil,
accumulated at the start of this season can partly cushion the
poor production in prospect,” Oil World said. World palm oil
inventories at the end of September totaled 9.3 million tons, up
900,000 tons from a year earlier, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
