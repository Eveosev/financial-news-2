Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  said it
signed a conditional agreement to sell its 90-megawatt Talinay
wind project in Chile to  Enel SpA (ENEL) , the Aarhus, Denmark-based
wind-turbine maker said today in a statement on its website.  Vestas gave no further details. Enel Green Power SpA,
controlled by Italy’s Enel, said earlier in an e-mailed
statement that it had secured a 12-year loan of 110 million
euros ($128 million) from the Danish government’s Export Credit
Agency and Citigroup Inc. to cover part of its $165 million
investment in the Talinay wind farm.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
