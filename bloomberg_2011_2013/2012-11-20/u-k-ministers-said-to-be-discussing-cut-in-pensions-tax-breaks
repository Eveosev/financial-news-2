U.K. ministers are discussing the
tax-free amount wealthy savers can put toward their pension as
they seek to raise money to narrow the  budget deficit , a person
familiar with the talks said.  The Financial Times said today that Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  is considering reducing the 50,000-
pound ($80,000) annual limit as he seeks to squeeze 10 billion
pounds from the budget. Osborne is due to present his economic
and fiscal forecasts to Parliament in his Autumn Statement on
Dec. 5.  The person, who declined to be identified because the
negotiations are at an early stage, pointed out that ministers
had failed to reach agreement when similar proposals were
considered previously. The Treasury said the FT report is
speculation.  Osborne reduced the tax-free limit to its present level
from 255,000 pounds in 2010. The FT said a reduction to 30,000
pounds would raise as much as 1.8 billion pounds for the
Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
