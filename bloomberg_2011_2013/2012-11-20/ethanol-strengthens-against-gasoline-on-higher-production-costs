Ethanol futures in  Chicago 
strengthened against gasoline on higher production costs for the
biofuel and gasoline’s biggest decline in two weeks.  The grain-based additive’s discount to the motor fuel
narrowed to 32.55 cents a gallon from 37.15 cents yesterday,
based on December futures prices. Gasoline’s premium was 99.8
cents on Sept. 28.  Corn has soared 15 percent this year as drought in the
Midwest shrank the crop to the smallest in six years, raising
costs for ethanol producers. Gasoline, which includes the
reformulated variety called RBOB, declined today as  Hess Corp. (HES) 
returned its New Jersey refinery to full production for the
first time since  Hurricane Sandy  struck Oct. 29.  “Corn and RBOB keep diverging and that’s the problem,”
said Julie Ward, assistant vice president at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, a broker in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 0.4 cent to
$2.387 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
gained 8.4 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery decreased 4.2 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $2.7125 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest drop since Nov. 7. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery climbed 4.75 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.4725 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Producers’ Loss  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 5.5
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.475 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive gained 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.535, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Ethanol in Chicago advanced 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.38 a gallon and in  New York  the
biofuel added 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.475.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 32 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 31
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol is blended with the motor fuel to stretch supply
and meet federal mandates. A 2007 energy law mandates that about
13.2 billion gallons of the biofuel be blended into gasoline
this year.  Inventory Report  The Energy Department will probably report tomorrow that
 gasoline supplies  rose 1 million barrels last week, according to
the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  Tepid gasoline demand and steady output have combined to
create an ethanol supply glut, Ward said.  “It just keeps stocks heavy,” she said.  Stockpiles of the fuel were 17.9 million barrels in the
week that ended Nov. 9, 4.3 percent higher than a year earlier,
Energy Department data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline  made up about 90 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Nov. 9, Energy
Department data show, down from 92 percent in the prior period
and the lowest level in four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
