Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said U.S. central bankers are looking “very
carefully” at proposals to link changes in monetary policy to
specific economic thresholds, such as the jobless rate.  The Fed now ties its outlook for the benchmark interest
rate to a calendar date. The central bank has said the federal
funds rate is likely to remain “exceptionally low” at least
through mid-2015.  One alternative “would be to provide some specific numbers
on what economic conditions would prompt us or at least make us
consider the process of removing accommodation,” Bernanke said
in response to a question after a speech in  New York .  Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans  has proposed holding
 interest rates  near zero until unemployment falls below 7
percent so long as the outlook for inflation does not climb
above 3 percent. Other Fed presidents have suggested different
thresholds. Some, including Richmond Fed’s  Jeffrey Lacker , have
opposed the idea.  Bernanke said such an approach was “promising,” while
adding that “the committee is still discussing this particular
approach. I don’t want to front-run those discussions, which are
still ongoing.”  He also said that “monetary policy is a complex process”
that poses challenges to this strategy. “Can we reasonably
summarize those conditions under which we would begin to tighten
policy with just two numbers, two or three numbers?”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
