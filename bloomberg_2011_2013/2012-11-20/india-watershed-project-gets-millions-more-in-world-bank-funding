India  signed a credit accord with
the World Bank today for the Himachal Pradesh Mid-Himalayan
Watershed Development Project that raises to $97 million the
funding for water harvesting tanks, catchment areas and drainage
lines to help irrigate more land.   The $37 million in additional funding adds to the original
$60 million project that helped increase farmers’ yields in
maize, wheat and milk, aided in higher availability of water and
raised household incomes by 13 percent, the government said in
an e-mail. The added credit comes from the World Bank’s
International Development Association lending arm, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
