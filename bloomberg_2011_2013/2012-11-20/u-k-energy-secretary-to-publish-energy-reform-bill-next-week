U.K. Energy Secretary  Ed Davey  said
he plans to publish legislation designed to reform the
electricity market next week.  He was speaking about the Energy Bill during an Energy and
Climate Change Committee hearing in London.  “It will be a really attractive package that will
incentivize investment in Britain’s energy infrastructure that’s
sorely needed,” he told the panel of lawmakers. “There’ll be a
lot to read.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
