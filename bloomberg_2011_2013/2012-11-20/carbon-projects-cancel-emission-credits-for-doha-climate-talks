Emission-reduction projects have
proposed to voluntarily cancel 25,000 metric tons of carbon
credits to offset  greenhouse gases  from this month’s  United
Nations  climate talks and to highlight plunging prices.  The Project Developer Forum, a London-based lobby group for
companies that cut heat-trapping gases in emerging nations, will
send the credits to the Clean Development Mechanism registry’s
voluntary cancellation account to offset estimated emissions
from travel and accommodation of 10,000 participants at the
talks in Doha, Qatar.  The value of CERs has plunged 93 percent in the past two
years, according to data from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Credits for December fell 3.5 percent today to 82 euro
cents ($1.05) a ton as of 12:49 p.m., ICE data show. Still, the
so-called CDM has triggered $32 billion in clean-energy
investment in the developing world since it was formed as part
of the 1997  Kyoto Protocol , the forum said.  “The imminent failure of the Clean Development Mechanism
is the greatest threat yet to clean energy in the developing
world,”  Gareth Phillips , chairman of the PD Forum, said in the
statement. “The plummeting value of CERs places this future in
grave danger.”  The group called on climate envoys to adopt demanding
emission reduction targets and allow use of CERs to meet those
limits, according to the statement.  Advanced  developing countries  should pay for some credits
as part of their own effort to reduce greenhouse gases, the
forum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
