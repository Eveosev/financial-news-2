Sharp Corp. (6753) , the world’s worst-
performing major stock, will book a 25.3 billion yen ($311
million) one-time charge this quarter to eliminate jobs.  The charge, for 2,960 workers who accepted buyout offers,
is already factored into earnings  forecasts  for the year ending
March 31,  Osaka , Japan-based Sharp said in a statement today.
Sharp, which sought about 2,000 voluntary retirements, closed
the offer Nov. 9, it said.  Japan’s biggest liquid-crystal display maker said Nov. 1 it
may post a record net loss of 450 billion yen this fiscal year,
compared with its earlier projection for a 250 billion yen
deficit. Faced with falling demand for TVs, a stronger yen and
competition from Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.,
Japanese electronics makers including Sharp, Sony Corp. and
 Panasonic Corp. (6752)  have resorted to closing factories, eliminating
jobs and cutting costs to revive profit.  Sharp  fell  1.7 percent to 172 yen in Tokyo trading today,
extending its loss this year to 74 percent, the worst performer
among more than 1,600 companies in the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of
developed nations.  The company’s turnaround plan includes seeking voluntary
retirements, cutting salaries, selling assets and reducing
capital investments, Sharp said Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
