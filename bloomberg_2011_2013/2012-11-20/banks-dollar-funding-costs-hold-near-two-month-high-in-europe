The cost for European banks to
convert euro interest payments into dollars near the highest in
more than two months, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to borrow in dollars, was 29 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate at 8:15 a.m. in  London , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The measure reached minus 30 on Nov. 16, the
most expensive since Sept. 5.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 30 basis
points, or 0.3 percentage point, below Euribor.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held at the highest in more than a week.
The difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known
as the Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 12.4 basis
points, the highest since Nov. 7.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was 0.077 percent
yesterday from 0.079 percent on Nov. 16. The Eonia swap, an
estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the next
three months, was little changed at 6.7 basis points.  The  volume  of overnight lending as measured by the EBF in
Brussels rose to 22.2 billion euros of transactions yesterday,
the highest since Oct. 30, from 20.8 billion euros on Nov. 16.
Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European Central
Bank yesterday to 240 billion euros ($307 billion) from 216
billion euros on Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
