The euro traded near a two-week high
against the dollar as European finance ministers continued to
work toward an agreement on extra financing for Greece.  The yen held a five-day decline before data forecast to
show  Japan  posted a trade deficit for a fourth straight month.
European finance chiefs and the International Monetary Fund
meeting in Brussels will try to plug a 15 billion euro ($19
billion) hole through 2014 for Greece’s finances and seek an
elusive formula for putting its debt on a sustainable path. New
Zealand’s dollar remained lower against most of its major peers
after whole milk powder prices fell.  “The decision on Greek aid at the finance ministers’
meeting would be a big focus,” said Yoshitsugu Fujita,
assistant vice president of global markets in New York at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “Should things turn out positive,
that will give a short-term boost to the euro.”  The euro traded at $1.2816 at 8:20 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.2817 yesterday, when it touched $1.2830, the highest since
Nov. 7. The yen was unchanged at 81.68 per dollar, after having
weakened 2.8 percent in the past five days. It was little
changed at 104.68 per euro from 104.69.  European finance ministers have “good” chances of
clinching a deal on  Greece ’s financing and are determined to
keep the IMF involved in the program, Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker said yesterday. Recycling European Central
Bank profits on Greek bonds, charging Greece lower interest
rates and extending repayment deadlines are among the options
under consideration.  In Japan,  exports  probably fell 4.9 percent in October from
a year earlier, leaving a trade deficit of 360 billion yen ($3.7
billion), according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before the data are released today.  Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. said on its
GlobalDairyTrade website milk powder for January delivery fell
2.5 percent. The near-term contract for New Zealand product fell
to $3,255 a metric ton, the lowest price since Oct. 2.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed 81.73 U.S. cents
from yesterday, when it dropped 0.4 percent to 81.72.  To contact the reporters on this story:
