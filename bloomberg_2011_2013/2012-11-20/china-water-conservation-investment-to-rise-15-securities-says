Investment in water conservation
this winter and next spring among governments and private
companies in  China  will increase by more than 15 percent to more
than 336.4 billion  yuan  ($54 million), the China Securities
Journal reported.  The nation will raise public-finance spending further by
requiring that 10 percent of the profits from land grants be
used for water-conservation construction, the  report  said,
citing Chen Lei, minister of water resources.  This year, Chinaâ€™s government has earmarked about 91
billion yuan, or 20.8 billion yuan more than a year ago, to keep
drinking water safe in rural areas, renovate and construct
large-scale irrigation and pumping stations, reinforce dangerous
dams and conserve water and soil,  Du Ying , vice chairman of the
National Development and Reform Commission, was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
