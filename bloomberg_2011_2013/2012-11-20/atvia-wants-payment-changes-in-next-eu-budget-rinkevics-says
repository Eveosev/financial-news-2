Latvia wants the European Union’s
next seven-year budget to amend the current funding for direct
payments, which go to the country’s farmers, Foreign Minister
Edgars Rinkevics said on his Twitter Inc. account.  EU leaders will meet in Brussels this week to debate the
2014-2020 spending plan amid a row between net recipients of the
bloc’s aid and net contributors, who seek a leaner budget.  The latest compromise to be discussed includes 74 billion
euros ($95 billion) in cuts from the European Commission’s
original proposal for a budget of about 1 trillion euros, Slovak
Premier  Robert Fico , who also wants changes in cohesion funding,
said today in Bratislava, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
