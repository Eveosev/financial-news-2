Poland was the biggest net recipient
of funds from the European Union budget in 2011, getting more
than double the amount channeled to  Greece , the next largest.  The CHART OF THE DAY ranks the blocâ€™s 27 nations, showing
how much each paid into or received from the central budget last
year. The funds equal about 1 percent of the total gross
domestic product of the EU.  Leaders of the EU gather in Brussels tomorrow for a summit
to hammer out a seven-year blueprint of about 1 trillion euros
($1.28 trillion). The U.K., which opposes any increase in the
spending plan, ranks as the fourth-biggest net contributor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
