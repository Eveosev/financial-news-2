Chinese stocks  fell, with trading
volume on the benchmark index plunging to the lowest level in
almost a year, after foreign direct investment in  China  dropped.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  slumped 1.2 percent, pushing
a gauge of financial companies to the second-steepest loss among
 industry groups  in the  CSI 300 (SHSZ300)  Index.  Ping An Insurance Group
Co. (2318)  slid 3.2 percent as Bank of Communications Co. said HSBC
Holdings Plc’s possible sale of Ping An shares may hurt investor
sentiment. Anhui Water Resources Development Co. jumped the most
in three weeks after the China Securities Journal reported the
nation’s investment in water conservation will increase.  “The foreign direct investment decline shows the economy
isn’t doing that well,” said Mao Sheng, an analyst for Huaxi
Securities Co. in Chengdu. “Investors need another quarter to
verify if the economy has started to recover and are waiting for
policy actions from the new leadership.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 0.4 percent to 2,008.92,
the lowest close since Sept. 26. It earlier rose as much as 0.3
percent. Trading volumes slumped to the lowest level since Dec.
12, 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The CSI 300
fell 0.5 percent to 2,164.88.  The Shanghai index trades at 9.6 times estimated profit for
2012 after losing 8.7 percent this year, compared with the 17.8
average multiple since Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data 
in 2006. The measure briefly fell below the 2,000 level
yesterday for the second time in almost eight weeks.  “A level of 2,000 is really psychological, but not a real
key support,” Tacky Cheng, a Hong Kong-based technical analyst
at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in e-mailed comments today.
“Primary support is 1,945,” he said.  FDI Report  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong retreated 0.3 percent today. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, advanced 2.2 percent in  New York . Sales of
previously owned U.S. homes climbed in October, while confidence
among U.S. homebuilders unexpectedly gained in November to a
six-year high.  Foreign direct investment in China fell 0.2 percent in
October to $8.31 billion from a year earlier, an 11th decline in
12 months, the Ministry of Commerce said. Investment in the
first 10 months of the year dropped to $91.7 billion, the
ministry said in a statement.  A  gauge  of Chinese banks, brokerages and insurers in the
CSI 300 slid 0.7 percent, the most among 10 industry groups.  China Construction Bank, the second-biggest lender, slumped
1.2 percent to 4.16  yuan .  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398) 
Ltd., the largest lender, slid 0.5 percent to 3.83 yuan.  Reserve Requirements  China may refrain from cutting lenders’ reserve
requirements for the rest of the year, according to economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The People’s Bank of China will
probably keep the reserve-requirement ratio for large lenders at
20 percent, based on the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey conducted Nov. 14-19. That compares with the
half-point cut projected last month and the full point forecast
in September.  Ping An declined 3.2 percent to 35.33 yuan. HSBC’s possible
sale of its shares in Ping An would impact investor sentiment as
the bank has been a strategic partner of the Chinese insurer,
Bank of Communications analyst Li Wenbing said in a report.  Charoen Pokphand Group, controlled by Thai billionaire
Dhanin Chearavanont, may pay HK$60 for each Hong Kong-listed
Ping An share owned by HSBC, the Shanghai Securities News
reported today, citing an unidentified person. Ping An’s  Hong
Kong  shares slipped 1 percent to HK$57.85.  Water Stocks  Anhui Water  jumped  3.1 percent to 10.63 yuan, while
Chongqing Three Gorges Water Conservancy & Electric Power rose
0.9 percent to 11.77 yuan.  China’s investment in water conservation this winter and
next spring will rise by more than 15 percent to more than 336.4
billion yuan ($54 billion), the China Securities Journal
reported, citing Minister of Water Resources Chen Lei.  Trading volumes on the Shanghai index were 35 percent lower
than the 30-day average today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  was at 12.5, compared with this
year’s average of 17.1.  The Shanghai Composite slid 2.6 percent last week as the
Communist Party held a meeting to appoint new leaders. Xi
Jinping was named general secretary, putting him in line to
become president.  “There’s still uncertainty about the direction that the
new administration is going in,”  Timothy Ghriskey , chief
investment officer at New York-based Solaris Group LLC, which
manages about $2 billion of assets including Chinese stocks,
said by phone yesterday. “Investors are sort of holding back
now as they would want to see actually what happens in actions,
not just in words.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
