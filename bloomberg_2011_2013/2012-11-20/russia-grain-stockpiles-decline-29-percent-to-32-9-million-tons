Russia, the third-biggest  wheat
exporter  last season, had 32.9 million metric tons of grain
stockpiles as of Nov. 1, down 29 percent from 46.3 million tons
a year earlier, the Federal State Statistical Service said.  The stocks figure includes big agricultural producers with
19.3 million tons, down from 28.4 million tons a year earlier,
and procurement and milling companies with 13.6 million tons,
down from 17.9 million tons, the service known as Rosstat said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Procurement firms and millers had about 9.3 million tons of
wheat stocks, of which 7.6 million tons is of milling quality,
Rosstat said. That’s down from about 13.3 million tons of the
grain, including 10.5 million tons of milling wheat, a year
earlier.  Most of the stocks, about 8.4 million tons, are held in the
Central federal district, which is 6.8 percent less than a year
earlier, according to the statistics service. About 7.7 million
tons are in Volga, or nearly 33 percent less than a year
earlier. Inventories in the Southern federal district fell about
37 percent to 5.7 million tons. The North-Caucasus federal
district had about 2.1 million tons, or 50 percent. The Southern
and North-Caucasus districts are the closest to  Russia ’s main
exporting routes,  Rosstat’s figures don’t include small, private farm or
household reserves.  Wheat for March delivery little changed at $8.5875 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade by 3:31 p.m. Moscow time. It’s
advanced 32 percent this year.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
