Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened as
better-than-forecast U.S. home sales boosted confidence a
recovery in the world’s largest economy is gaining momentum.
 Government bonds  were steady after a 30-year debt auction.  Purchases of existing houses increased to a 4.79 million
annual rate last month, exceeding the 4.74 million median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, figures from the
National Association of Realtors showed yesterday. Taiwan’s
export orders rose 3.2 percent in October from a year earlier,
more than the 0.2 increase forecast in a Bloomberg survey,
according to data released just before the market closed.  “The  U.S. economy  is seeing more signs of recovery,” said
Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei. “Asian currencies will continue to have appreciation
pressure.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.145,
based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. It touched NT$28.959 on Nov.
12, the strongest level since September 2011. One-month implied
volatility dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to
3.8 percent.  The island sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of 30-year bonds
today at 1.705 percent, compared with the 1.703 percent median
estimate of fixed-income traders surveyed by Bloomberg. The
yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022 was steady
at 1.118 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight  interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.384 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
