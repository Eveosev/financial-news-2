Cesky Aeroholding AS, a holding of
state airline and the Prague airport, picked the Ceska
Sporitelna AS as an adviser for the sale of the state-run
airline.  “We chose the winner from three bids offered, according to
the lowest price,” Michaela Lagronova, a spokeswoman for the
Holding, said by phone today.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and Patria Finance
AS were the other bidders, Lagronova said. Ceska Sporitelna is
the Czech unit of  Erste Group Bank AG. (EBS)   The Czech Finance Ministry sent out letters to 50 largest
world’s airlines asking them to indicate a preliminary interest
in the unprofitable state carrier Ceske Aerolinie AS before the
end of this month. The government is looking for a partner to
develop CSA and may even sell a stake in the carrier, the
ministry said.  Czech Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek should name
airlines that showed preliminary interest in the carrier after
the government’s session on Dec. 5, Lagronova said.  The government merged the carrier with Letiste Praha AS,
Prague’s international airport, in a bid to the overhaul CSA
after an attempt to sell it in 2009 failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
