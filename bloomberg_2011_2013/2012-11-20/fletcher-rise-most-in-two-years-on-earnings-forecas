Fletcher Building Ltd. (FBU) ,  New
Zealand ’s biggest maker of construction products, rose the most
in more than two years in Wellington trading after forecasting a
rise in full-year profit.  The stock  rose  3.7 percent to NZ$7.65 at the 5 p.m. close,
its biggest gain since Sept. 6, 2010. It earlier climbed to as
high as NZ$7.70. Operating earnings will rise as much as 22
percent in the year ending June with a stronger second-half,
Auckland-based Fletcher said in a statement today.  The forecast is underpinned by rebuilding in the
earthquake-wrecked city of Christchurch as seismic activity
eases and housing demand is boosted by the return of insurance
companies writing new policies, Fletcher said. New  home
construction  in Auckland, New Zealand’s biggest city, and
 government spending  will also help, the company said.  “The board believe that this is achievable, on the basis
of the momentum seen in New Zealand recently which is expected
to continue for the whole of the year,” Chairman Ralph Waters
said in the statement.  The Christchurch earthquake killed 185 people in February
2011. The demolition of the city center, which was wrecked in
the 6.3-magnitude temblor, should be completed by the middle of
next year, Waters said.  Declines in new housing in Australia, where the company got
47 percent of sales last year, could affect the forecast, it
said. The company plans to reduce  capital spending  by about
NZ$100 million ($82 million) in the coming year, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
