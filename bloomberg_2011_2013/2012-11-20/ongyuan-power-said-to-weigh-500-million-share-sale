China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the nation’s biggest wind-power producer, may raise about $500
million by selling shares in Hong Kong, three people with
knowledge of the matter said.  Longyuan, which said in May that it would offer up to 1.36
billion shares in Hong Kong, is planning to offer about 813
million shares, two of the people said, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The company’s
advisers have been gauging investor interest in the offering
this month, the people said.  The final timing of the sale hasn’t been decided, and will
depend on Longyuan’s  market price . At its closing price of
HK$4.85 apiece yesterday, a sale of 813 million shares would
raise about HK$3.9 billion ($503 million). The stock slipped 0.8
percent to HK$4.81 apiece as of 3:26 p.m. in Hong Kong trading
today.  Secondary stock sales in Hong Kong have raised about $31
billion this year, almost 10 times the value of initial public
offerings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The largest
additional sale this year was a $6 billion offering of shares in
 AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , by American International Group Inc., the data
show.  China Resources  China Resources Gas Group Ltd. (1193)  is also considering a stock
sale to raise about HK$2.7 billion as early as today, after its
stock rose to a record high yesterday, two people with knowledge
of that plan said.  The Hong Kong-based gas distributor halted its shares from
trading today in the city pending announcement of a share sale.
The stock has surged 66 percent this year, closing yesterday at
HK$18.46.  Longyuan, based in Beijing, said in May that it would use
the share sale proceeds to fund new renewable energy projects,
including wind farms, according to a filing to  Hong Kong ’s stock
exchange. Its shares are down about 17 percent since the
fundraising plan was announced on May 11.  “We aren’t in discussions with investors,” Lan Peizhen,
Longyuan’s investor relations manager said by phone today. “We
got approval for the share sale from shareholders in July and
will choose a proper timing to implement it by July 2, 2013.”  China ’s goal of deriving 15 percent of its energy from non-
fossil fuels by 2020 is helping wind project developers to
expand installed capacity. The nation added 20 gigawatts of wind
farms in 2011, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Longyuan increased its total installed wind-power capacity
by about 23 percent to 10.6 gigawatts in 2011 from the previous
year, the company said in March. Its third-quarter profit rose
30 percent to about 260 million  yuan  ($42 million), according to
calculations based on nine-month results released this month.
Sales from the wind-power business rose 43 percent to 1.7
billion yuan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
