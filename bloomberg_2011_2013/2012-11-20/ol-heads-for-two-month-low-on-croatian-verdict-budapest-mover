Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  headed for the lowest in
more than two months after a Croatian court found former Prime
Minister Ivo Sanader guilty of taking bribes from  Hungary ’s
largest refiner, a charge that both parties denied.  The shares fell 2.9 percent to 17,550 forint by 12:12 p.m.
in Budapest, the lowest on a closing basis since Sept. 13. The
benchmark BUX stock  index , in which Mol has the biggest
weighting at 33 percent, dropped 1.2 percent.  Judge Ivan Turudic in Zagreb sentenced Sanader to 10 years
in prison after he was found guilty of offenses including taking
a bribe from Mol between 2008 to 2009, when he was premier. In
exchange, he arranged with a “highly positioned” Mol manager
to give the Hungarian company controlling rights over  INA
Industrija Nafte d.d.  in a January 2009 shareholding agreement,
Judge Turudic said.  Sanader has maintained his innocence and can appeal the
verdict. Mol “categorically rejects” the accusations, which
formed part of a “political case” lacking any evidence, crime
or motive, the company said in a statement on its website today.
Mol regards the outcome of the court case as “preliminary,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
