The European Union must evenly
distribute spending cuts in its proposed seven-year budget to
avoid disproportionately affecting cohesion programs for new
members, Slovak Premier  Robert Fico  said.  “We understand that there must be some cuts,” Fico told
lawmakers today in Bratislava, the capital. “We are worried
that they will happen at the expense of reducing regional
differences” through cohesion funds to poorer member states.  EU leaders will meet in Brussels this week to debate the
2014-2020 spending plan amid a row between net recipients of the
bloc’s aid and net contributors, who seek a leaner budget. The
latest compromise to be discussed includes 74 billion euros ($95
billion) in cuts from the European Commission’s original
proposal for a budget of about 1 trillion euros, Fico said.  Slovakia, which uses EU funds to finance three-quarters of
its public-investment projects, opposes allotting most of the
planned savings, as much as 29.5 billion euros, to cuts in aid
for less developed regions, Fico said. The country will also
push for a faster reduction of the gap between direct payments
to farmers in western and eastern EU states and will demand more
resources for shutting down nuclear plants, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
