Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat
importer, will keep Ukraine on its list of approved sources for
the cereal as long as traders supply contracted quantities even
if there is an export ban on Ukrainian grain.  If a ban is put into place traders must supply the North
African country with grain from another Black Sea country and
bear any extra costs, Nomani Nomani, vice chairman of Egypt’s
state-run General Authority for Supply Commodities, said by
phone from Cairo today.  Drought may cut the combined wheat harvests in Ukraine,
Russia and Kazakhstan by 37 percent this year, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has estimated. Ukraine ranked eighth
among world wheat exporters last year.  The east European country told Egypt that it has 1.1
million metric tons of grain for export, Nomani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
