U.S. stock futures were little
changed after data showed housing starts in October climbed to a
four-year high.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in December
rose 0.1 percent to 1,384.5 at 8:33 a.m. in New York.  Starts rose 3.6 percent to a 894,000 annual rate, the
fastest since July 2008, after a 863,000 pace in September,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington . The
median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for starts to fall to 840,000. Building permits, a proxy for
future construction, eased after surging the previous month.  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, giving the S&P 500 its biggest
advance since Sept. 6, amid better-than-forecast sales of
previously owned homes and as President  Barack Obama  expressed
confidence that he will agree on a budget compromise with
Congress.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
