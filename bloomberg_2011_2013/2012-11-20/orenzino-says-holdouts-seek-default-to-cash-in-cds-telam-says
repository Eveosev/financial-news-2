Holders of Argentine defaulted bonds
are expecting the government to be declared in “technical
default” amid a legal battle in the U.S. in order to cash in
credit-default swaps, Argentine Economy Minister Hernan Lorenzino said, according to state news agency Telam.  Argentina  has the cash and the willingness to continue to

restructurings following the country’s 2001 default, Lorenzino
said in an interview aired by radio station Radio Continental,
