Canadian  wholesale sales  fell at the
fastest pace in 19 months in September, with automobiles and
personal goods leading declines across every major category.  Sales dropped 1.4 percent in September to C$48.8 billion
($49 billion), Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa. The
agency pared its estimates for the prior two months. The decline
exceeded all 13 forecasts in a Bloomberg economist  survey  with a
median estimate of a 0.5 percent increase.  Receipts have stagnated after reaching a record C$50
billion in May, and today’s report is another sign that global
strains are slowing the world’s 11th largest economy.  Bank of
Canada  Governor  Mark Carney  has said global businesses are
delaying investment decisions because of uncertainty about the
measures policy makers are taking to revive economic growth.  “It’s pretty bad; it reaffirms the weak quarter that we
have had in Canada,” said Mazen Issa, Canada macro strategist
at TD Securities in Toronto. “The 1 percent quarterly growth
rate expected by the Bank of Canada looks a bit strong at the
moment” for the third quarter, he said.  The Canadian dollar was little changed at 99.68 cents
versus the  U.S. dollar  at 9:44 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0031.  Motor vehicle and parts sales fell 4 percent in September
to C$8.03 billion, the third straight decline,  Statistics Canada 
said. Excluding the automobile category, sales fell 0.8 percent.  Major-Category Declines  Personal and household goods sales fell 2 percent to C$6.83
billion.  Machinery and equipment  dropped 1 percent to C$10.8
billion.  All seven major categories tracked by the agency fell in
September, Statistics Canada said. About 85 percent of the total
decline came from the automobile, personal goods and machinery
categories.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, fell 1.3 percent.  Statistics Canada today also reduced the estimated gain for
August to 0.3 percent from 0.5 percent, while widening the July
decline to 0.9 percent from 0.7 percent.  Wholesale sales were 2.2 percent higher in September than
the same month  a year earlier , the slowest pace since December
2009.  Inventories fell for the first time in 10 months in
September, by 0.4 percent to C$61.4 billion. The inventory-to-
sales ratio, a measure of how many months it would take to
deplete stocks at the current sales pace, rose to 1.26 in
September from a revised 1.25 in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
