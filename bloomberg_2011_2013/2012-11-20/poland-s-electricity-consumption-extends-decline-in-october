Polish power use fell in October,
extending a decline from the first nine months as economic
growth slows, according to the country’s transmission grid.  Electricity consumption in the period declined 0.3 percent
to 129.5 terawatt-hours, compared with a 2.4 percent increase in
the same period of last year and a 0.2 percent drop in the first
nine months,  PSE Operator SA  said today on its website. In
October, power demand decreased 1.4 percent from a year earlier
to 13.5 terawatt-hours.  Poland’s economy grew 2.3 percent in the second quarter,
down from 3.6 percent in the previous period and 4.1 percent a
year earlier. The amount of electricity generated in the first
10 months fell 1.9 percent to 131.7 terawatt-hours, as a 5.5
terawatt-hour decrease in output from hard coal plants was only
partly offset by a 2.2 terawatt-hour increase in production from
lignite-fired generators.  Wind farms produced 3.2 terawatt-hours of electricity, or
50 percent more than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
