Internet advertising spending is
projected to increase 15 percent in 2013, while total ad growth
will be weaker on concerns about Europe, the U.S. budget and the
lack of major media events next year.  Global Web ad spending is expected to jump to $101.8
billion next year from $88.4 billion, according to Zenith
Optimedia Group Ltd. Total spending on ads may grow 4.9 percent
to $530 billion, trimmed from the 6 percent increase estimated
earlier this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
Industries released today.  Digital and emerging markets will drive growth,  Paul Sweeney , a Bloomberg Industries analyst, said in a report. While
the London Olympics and the  U.S. presidential election  helped
boost spending on advertising in 2012, there will be no
comparable high-profile sporting or political events in 2013.  “A deepening of the European crisis has led to heightened
caution in developed markets, as agencies reported drastic
budget cuts in the third quarter,” Sweeney said.  Mobile ads, which still make up a smaller part of total
spending, may grow 51 percent to $9.7 billion, according to New
York-based EMarketer Inc.  Martin Sorrell , chief executive officer at the world’s
largest advertising company,  WPP Plc (WPP) , has voiced concerns about
the outlook as pressure mounts form the coming “fiscal cliff”
-- $607 billion in spending cuts and tax increases to
automatically take effect in January unless lawmakers act.  WPP cut full-year sales targets for 2012 following third-
quarter results last month. Revenue growth for the year will be
2.5 percent to 3 percent, down from an earlier forecast of about
3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
