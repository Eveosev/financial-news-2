The ruble appreciated for a second
day as exporters bought the currency to pay local taxes and as
euro-area finance ministers prepared to discuss  Greece ’s
finances.  The ruble appreciated 0.6 percent to 31.2875 against the
dollar by 4:07 p.m. in Moscow. It climbed 0.4 percent versus the
euro to 40.0950 and added 0.5 percent against the central bank’s
euro-dollar target basket.  Domestic companies are converting dollar revenue to pay
about 250 billion rubles ($8 billion) of value-added tax this
week, according to ZAO Citibank in Moscow. Euro-area finance
ministers meet in Brussels today to try and plug a 15 billion-
euro ($19 billion) hole in Greece’s finances and win over
support from the International Monetary Fund.  Europe  is Russia’s
biggest trade partner.  “Risk aversion is lower” on speculation a Greek deal will
be reached, Olga Ponomarenko, an economist at Citibank, said by
e-mail.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8345 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.9400 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points to 199,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields was little changed at 6.9705
percent after tumbling seven basis points yesterday, the most in
more than a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
