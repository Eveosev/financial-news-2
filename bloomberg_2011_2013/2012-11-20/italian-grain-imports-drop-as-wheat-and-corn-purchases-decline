Italian grain imports fell in the
year’s first eight months as the world’s second-biggest wheat
buyer cut purchases of the cereal and also bought less corn and
barley, the Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti said.  Shipments of grain and cereal products slid to 6.6 million
metric tons with a total value of 1.91 billion euros ($2.5
billion), Anacer, as the Rome-based industry group is known,
wrote in an e-mailed statement today. That compared with 8.34
million tons and 2.37 billion euros a year earlier.  Italy imported more wheat in the 2011-12 crop year than any
other country except  Egypt , according to government figures and
the International Grains Council. The European country is the
world’s largest pasta maker, the International Pasta
Organisation says.  Soft-wheat imports fell to 2.85 million tons costing 661.3
million euros in the eight-month period from 3.23 million tons
and 816.3 million euros a year earlier, according to Anacer.  Buying of durum wheat, the hard variety used for pasta,
declined to 941,050 tons worth 280.6 million euros, compared
with 1.35 million tons and an import bill of 368.6 million euros
in last year’s first eight months.  Italians ate an average 26 kilograms (57 pounds) of pasta
per capita last year, about triple the figure of 8.8 kilograms
for the U.S., according to the pasta organization. They consume
more wheat on average than people in other countries of  Europe 
or  North America ,  data  from the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center show.  Corn, Barley  Eight-month corn imports dropped to 1.3 million tons from
1.92 million tons, and the value fell to 298.6 million euros
from 454.5 million euros, according to Anacer. Barley shipments
slid to 342,170 tons from 652,995 tons, with a worth of 73.5
million euros, against 144 million euros.  Including spending on oilseed and protein-crop products,
the value of imports declined to 2.97 billion euros from 3.47
billion euros a year earlier.  Italy’s eight-month cereal-industry exports amounted to
1.89 billion euros, against the year-earlier 1.9 billion euros,
Anacer reported. Pasta sales rose to 1.07 billion euros from
989.9 million euros.  The country’s grain-trade deficit shrunk to 1.09 billion
euros from the year-earlier shortfall of 1.57 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
