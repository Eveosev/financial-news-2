Winter wheat in the U.K., which had
its wettest summer in a century this year, showed the worst-ever
symptoms in the current season of fungal diseases fusarium ear
blight and septoria tritici, CropMonitor said.  There was a “marked increase” in ear blight, with 96
percent of field samples displaying symptoms, the crop-quality
service said in a  report  e-mailed today. Some types of fusarium
can result in yield losses or the development of  mycotoxins ,
chemicals that can harm humans and animals, according to the
Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.  “Ear blight symptoms were recorded at the highest-ever
levels since the survey began,” said CropMonitor, which is run
by government and industry groups. Some field samples also
showed fusarium on plant stems and  nodes , where leaves emerge
from stems, according to the report.  Septoria tritici, which also can cut yields, was the most
common foliar  disease , with 97 percent of crops affected,
CropMonitor said. Brown rust was recorded on 17 percent of field
samples and tan spot affected 14 percent of crops.  Powdery mildew affected only 4 percent of crops, the lowest
level ever recorded and down from last year’s results showing 34
percent of crops were infected.  The U.K. is the third-largest wheat producer in the 27-
nation European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
