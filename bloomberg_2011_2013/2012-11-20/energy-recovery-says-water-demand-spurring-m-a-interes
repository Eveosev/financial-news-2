Energy Recovery Inc. (ERII) , which supplies
equipment to the desalination industry, said it’s a possible
takeover target amid booming global water demand.  “There are a lot of industrial concerns that are looking
at us,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Rooney said in a telephone
interview yesterday, without identifying any prospective buyers.
“We don’t really want to be bought out.”  More than 100 desalination projects are being studied
worldwide, he said. Based in San Leandro,  California , Energy
Recovery fits plants built by Spain’s  Acciona SA (ANA)  and  General
Electric Co. (GE)  with a pressure exchanger that reduces power costs
when filtering seawater through membranes to produce tap water.
Rooney said the company has more than 90 percent of that market.  The stock jumped 11 percent to $2.87 at the close in  New
York . Earlier it gained as much as 30 percent, the steepest
intraday rise since July 2008.  Before today, the stock had returned 10 percent in the past
year compared with an average 21 percent for global peers
tracked by Bloomberg, and traded at 1.69 times book value, below
the industry average of 3.93.  Third-quarter sales rose to $10.5 million from $4.93
million a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
third-quarter net loss of $1.83 million compares with an $11.3
million loss in the same year-ago period.  Desalination equipment orders are forecast to triple over
five years to become a $17 billion business, according to
forecasts by Global Water Intelligence, an industry consultant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
