Nordic power exports may climb as
high as 100 terawatt-hours by 2050, if the region succeeds in
pioneering a low-carbon energy system.  “With the right infrastructure and pricing in place, the
Nordic region could achieve annual exports of 50 TWh to 100 TWh
over the longer term,” according to an interim  report  released
today in Oslo by the  International Energy Agency  and Nordic
Energy Research, an intergovernmental funding institution
financed by  Sweden ,  Denmark ,  Finland ,  Norway  and Iceland.  For this to happen, the region must source a quarter of
total annual electricity output from wind power by 2050,
compared with 7 percent last year.  The region must also build more flexible generation
capacity, as well as boosting grid interconnections, demand
response and power storage, which will need investments equal to
0.7 percent of cumulative GDP over the period, according to the
report.  It said the stemming of global warming to 2 degrees Celsius
is at stake. Nordic countries have set their targets higher than
those recommended by the IEA, aiming for deeper cuts than a 70
percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 from 1990.  “Considering its rich renewable energy resources and
strong policies already in place, the Nordic region could be the
first in the world to achieve a carbon-neutral energy system,
but it will not be easy,” Markus Wrake, head of the IEA’s
Energy Supply Unit, said in a  statement .  Key challenges include getting social acceptance for new
grids and power plants, as well as boosting  carbon capture  and
storage technology development, where progress has been slow and
uncoordinated, according to the report.  The final report will be published in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
