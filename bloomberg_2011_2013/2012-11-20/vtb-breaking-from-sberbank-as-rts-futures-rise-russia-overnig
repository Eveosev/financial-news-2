VTB Group and OAO Sberbank are
diverging in the stock market by the most in 15 months on
speculation the government will accept a lower price for shares
in VTB to shore up the lender’s financial position.  VTB,  Russia ’s second-largest bank, added 0.6 percent in
Moscow yesterday, while shares of Sberbank gained 1.5 percent.
VTB is down 12 percent this year and its 60-day correlation
coefficient with Sberbank, which has risen 10 percent, is 0.65,
the least since August 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Futures on Russia’s RTS Index increased 0.2 percent to 140,130
in New York, while the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the
most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S. climbed for a third day.  Russia’s two biggest banks will be fully privatized in five
to 10 years, RIA Novosti cited First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov as saying yesterday in comments confirmed by his
office. The central bank raised 159.3 billion rubles ($5.1
billion), reducing its stake in Sberbank to 50 percent plus 1
voting share in September. VTB, which is 75.5 percent owned by
the state, plans to raise as much as $3 billion selling new
shares in the first half of 2013, Chairman  Andrei Kostin  said
Nov. 14.  “VTB is capital constrained, so the government is likely
to sell at any reasonable price and this creates downward
pressure on the stock,” Bruce Bower, a partner at Verno Capital
in Moscow, which manages about $200 million, said by e-mail
yesterday. “The Sberbank placement showed that the government
will go ahead with privatizations. The most likely scenario is a
primary placement in the first half of 2013 to keep VTB’s
capital ratios stable.”  Profit Slumps  American depositary receipts of Sberbank jumped 1.7 percent
to $11.07 yesterday, after its shares in Moscow increased to
87.38 rubles, or $2.78. One ADR equals four shares. VTB isn’t
traded in the U.S. Thirty-day  volatility  on VTB’s Moscow stock
has climbed from an almost two-year low of 17.42, reached on
Nov. 12, to 18.48 yesterday.  The correlation coefficient between the two lenders was as
much as 0.88 in May. A reading of 1 implies two securities are
trading in lockstep.  VTB’s net income in the second quarter dropped 63 percent
to 10.1 billion rubles as bad-debt provisions climbed 24 percent
to 11.9 billion rubles, the bank said in a statement on Sept.
20. The Moscow-based lender  posted  a 1.2 billion-ruble trading
loss because of the “challenging market environment,”
according the statement.  Sberbank, which is the distribution agent for Russia’s
pensions, said Oct. 5 that net income in the first nine months
of 2012 climbed 5.9 percent to 269 billion rubles. Non-
performing loans remained little changed at 3 percent of the
bank’s loan portfolio, according to the statement.  ‘More Capital’  “Sberbank operations have done better, it has a stronger
financial position and it doesn’t have an overhang anymore,”
Ilya Kravets, who helps manage $100 million of assets at
Daniloff Capital LLC, including Sberbank shares, said by phone
in New York yesterday. “VTB still has some issues. There’s
still an overhang of the government selling a significant
portion of their holding.”  The government has “in principle” expressed support for
VTB’s issuance of new shares before the sale of stock held by
the state, Chairman Kostin said in an interview at Bloomberg’s
headquarters in New York last week. The bank needs to raise
funds to bring “more capital into the company, the capital that
we need now for further development,” he said.  Russia will probably eventually reduce its stake in VTB to
as low as 65 percent, Kostin said.  ‘Market Conditions’  VTB  trades  for 6.5 times estimated earnings over the next
12 months, while Sberbank’s valuation is 5.5 times. The average
valuation for companies on the Russia’s 30-stock Micex Index is
at 5.3 times and compares with 5.7 for stocks in the Bloomberg
Russia-US gauge.  The timing of the share issue would “be subject to market
conditions,” Kostin said. VTB is the  worst performer  in the
MSCI Russia/Financials Index this year.  The Bloomberg Russia-US equity gauge climbed 1.1 percent to
91.74 yesterday, led by OAO  Mechel. (MTLR)   The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, advanced 1.6 percent to $27.40 for
a third day of gains, the longest stretch in a month. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in stock
futures, slipped 2.8 percent to 24.96.  Mechel Surges  Mechel, Russia’s largest coal producer for steelmakers,
rose 4.3 percent to $6.09, rebounding from a Sept. 5 low. The
company’s Moscow shares increased 0.5 percent to 192.6 rubles,
or the equivalent of $6.13.  The Moscow-based coal miner extended a 13 billion ruble
credit line with VTB to mid-2013 from this year after agreeing
to pay nearly twice the interest rate, Vedomosti newspaper said,
citing a financial statement.  Russia’s Moscow Exchange is making its government bond
market accessible through the Euroclear SA platform for settling
trades at the end of this year. Equities won’t be Euroclearable
until July 2014 because of concerns an increase in outside
investors will impact liquidity, Oksana Derisheva, deputy
director of the primary market at the exchange, said in an
interview on Nov. 16 in Moscow.  “It seems Russia’s sell side is not internally fully ready
to support efficiently the new changes taking place in Russia’s
post-trade environment in stocks,” Luis Saenz, head of equity
sales and trading at BCS Financial Group in  London , said by e-
mail yesterday. “A tiered approach is therefore prudent, first
getting fixed income Euroclearable and then equities.”  Unrest Fuels Crude  Crude oil rose for a second day amid concern that unrest in
the Middle East will disrupt supply and on confidence that a
deal can be reached to avoid automatic U.S. spending cuts and
tax increases. Crude for January delivery surged 2.7 percent to
$89.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday,
the highest settlement price since Oct. 19.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, gained 2 percent
to $110.44 while Brent crude climbed 2.5 percent to $111.70.  Futures contracts on the ruble rose 0.2 percent to 31.583
per dollar in New York, after Russia’s currency gained 0.7
percent to 31.49 versus the dollar in Moscow yesterday.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
added 0.7 percent to HK$4.47 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:29
a.m., poised for the biggest one-day advance since Nov. 13. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.4 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
