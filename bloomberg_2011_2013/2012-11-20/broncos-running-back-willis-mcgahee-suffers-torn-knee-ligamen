Denver Broncos running back Willis McGahee tore a ligament in his right knee during yesterday’s
30-23 win against the San Diego Chargers, coach John Fox said.  McGahee, who ranks 11th in the National Football League
with 731 yards rushing this season, may miss the next six to
eight weeks, the Denver Post reported. Fox didn’t have a
timetable for McGahee’s return, saying he’s “week to week.”
McGahee, 31, rushed for 1,199 yards for Denver last season, the
first time he’d topped the 1,000-yard mark since 2007.  The Broncos probably will use a group of running backs to
help offset the loss of McGahee, Fox said. Knowshon Moreno is
expected to play this week after being inactive the past eight
games as he recovered from a knee injury, while Lance Ball and
Ronnie Hillman also will share time in the backfield. Hillman
had 12 carries for 43 yards against the Chargers, while Ball
rushed six times for 35 yards.  “Right now, we feel really good about the guys we have,”
Fox said at a news conference. “They’re trained in our system.
Obviously, we’re disappointed to lose a player of Willis’
caliber. We’re disappointed for him.”  The Broncos have won five straight games and six of their
past seven to improve their record to 7-3 heading into this
week’s game at the Kansas City Chiefs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
