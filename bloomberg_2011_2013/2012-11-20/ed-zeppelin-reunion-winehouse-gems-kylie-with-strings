Five years ago, there were 20,000 of
us at  London ’s O2 for a Led Zeppelin concert billed as “the
band reunion of the century.”  Most had won seats in a worldwide lottery on a website that
had 25 million hits from those seeking tickets. On Dec. 10,
2007, the opening notes of “Good Times Bad Times” rang out to
an ovation filmed by 18 movie cameras.  Now the millions who didn’t manage to get tickets can hear
and see the show on CD and DVD/Blu-Ray. After years of delay,
the good news is that “Celebration Day” captures the gig in
full. The bad news is that it looks increasingly certain that
Zeppelin will resist offers for more concerts.  The occasion was a tribute for Atlantic Records founder
Ahmet Ertegun. The Zeps rapidly realized they wanted to play for
much longer than the 20 minutes originally suggested.  The result is one of rock’s greatest shows, one of the
finest I’ve seen. That includes the  Rolling Stones ,  Bruce Springsteen  and the Who with its original drummer, Keith Moon,
who, like Led Zep’s John Bonham, died at the age of 32.  Zep used Bonham’s son Jason as replacement at the O2, and
he did a fine job, locking with bassist John Paul Jones on songs
such as “Black Dog.” There were bone-crunching guitar riffs
from Jimmy Page,  Robert Plant ’s still spine-tingling vocals, and
there was a sense of celebration that the band was playing its
first full show in 27 years.  As a live album, it doesn’t have the youthful energy of
“How the West Was Won,” though it has a sense of never-to-be
repeated occasion which makes it  masterful . Rating: *****.  Winehouse Talent  Amy Winehouse  at last has a posthumous album and video that
do justice to her talent.  “At the  BBC ” is much that the spotty “Lioness: Hidden
Treasures” claimed to be and wasn’t. Her first appearance on
Jools Holland’s TV show, a slow version of “Valerie” and jazz
numbers with Johnny Dankworth are highlights, set among some
less-stellar performances. Still, what a voice. Rating: ***.  Soundgarden’s Return  Soundgarden’s first release in 16 years is “King Animal.”
It starts with the aptly named “Been Away Too Long.”  It’s well produced and tuneful, yet lacks some of the
aggressive edge of earlier outings such as 1991’s
“Badmotorfinger.” These guys were once as scary as Nirvana.
This is just a little too safe. Rating: **.  Minogue, Amos  Kylie Minogue  and Tori Amos have been following the same
route used by Sting and  George Michael  and adding strings.  Minogue reinterprets her hits on “The Abbey Road
Sessions”: “Can’t Get You Out of My Head” comes with plucked
violins. Rating: **.  Amos is more adventurous with her choice of material on
“Gold Dust” with the Metropole Orchestra. Rating: ***.  Seductive Del Rey  Lana Del Rey also uses strings for “Ride,” the Rick Rubin-produced single. It has stirred up critics on Twitter, who
see it as manufactured and bland. It’s still seductively
beautiful, like the previous “Video Games.” Del Rey’s album
“Born to Die” now comes in a deluxe “Paradise Edition” with
a bonus disc, all ready for the holiday season. Watch it sell.
Rating: ****.  Led Zeppelin’s “Celebration Day” on Atlantic is available
in various formats starting at $14.99 for two CDs. The Winehouse
box on Universal has formats from $16.69, with artist royalties
going to charity. Soundgarden is on Republic, Minogue on EMI,
Amos on Deutsche Grammophon and Lana Del Rey on Interscope at
prices starting at $14. Download prices vary across services.  Information:  http://soundgardenworld.com/ ,
