Nigerian Bag Manufacturing Co. Plc,
a packaging manufacturer, rose to the highest in more than 15
months after Flour Mills of  Nigeria  Plc said it received
approval to buy the company.  The stock gained 7.1 percent to 2:26 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the highest since August
2011. About 12.8 million shares or almost triple the three-month
daily average, traded, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The boards of the two companies propose to recommend
shareholders accept 25 shares of Bagco for one share of Flour
Mills, Flour Mills said in a statement published today on the
website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange , or 2.75 naira a share in
cash.  “What they are offering the shareholders is a significant
hike from the current market price, so I should expect that the
price of the stock should jump,” Pabina Yinkere, head of
research at Lagos-based Vetiva Capital Management Ltd., said by
phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
