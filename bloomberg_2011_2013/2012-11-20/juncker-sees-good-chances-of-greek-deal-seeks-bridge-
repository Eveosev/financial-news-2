European finance ministers have
“good” chances of clinching a deal on  Greece ’s financing and
are determined to keep the International Monetary Fund involved
in the program, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker 
said.  “There are good chances that we will come to a conclusive
mutual solution, but I can’t be entirely sure,” Juncker told
reporters before chairing a meeting of euro-area finance
ministers in Brussels today. “It’s clear that Greece has
delivered.”  Asked whether an accord is likely with the IMF on Greece’s
debt sustainability, Juncker said the euro ministers are
exploring “a sufficient number of bridge-building elements” to
satisfy the IMF.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
