Developed countries that don’t join
a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol shouldn’t be
allowed to use United Nation carbon offsets to help cut their
greenhouse-gas emissions, the Basic group of nations said.  Developed countries that don’t take on binding targets for
a second period starting in 2013 shouldn’t be eligible to use
Certified Emission Reductions generated by investments in clean-
technology projects in developing countries, ministers from
 India , China, Brazil and South Africa, known by their French
acronym Basic, said today in a joint statement.  Japan,  Canada  and New Zealand have all announced they don’t
plan to participate in a second round of emission cuts under the
1997 treaty. While  Russia  has indicated it may not take on new
targets, it has yet to fully spell out its stance. That leaves
the European Union and Australia as the main countries seeking
new targets.  The Basic countries met for two days of talks in Beijing
before the annual UN climate change conference in Doha next
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
