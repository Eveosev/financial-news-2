Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the top
performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  this year , may
commit as much as $10 billion to dividends and share repurchases
in 2013, said International Strategy & Investment Group Inc.  The lender has improved capital by the most among the
biggest U.S. banks and could fare comparatively well after
Federal Reserve stress tests, Ed Najarian, an ISI analyst, said
yesterday in a research note. Bank of America may have the
equivalent of about $30 billion in capital beyond the minimum
required by regulators, he wrote.  “We certainly don’t expect Bank of America to return
anywhere near $30 billion in capital,” said Najarian, who has a
buy rating on the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company. “We
still think $5 billion to $10 billion in total dividends and
stock buybacks is likely for 2013, which would still be an
upside surprise versus Street expectations.”  Bank of America’s  dividend  of 1 cent a share, smaller than
the payouts of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , is a
vestige of the duress the lender faced when it took $45 billion
in U.S. bailouts after swallowing Countrywide Financial Corp.
and Merrill Lynch & Co. While the rescue was repaid in 2009,
regulators haven’t allowed the firm to boost its dividend.  Najarian, who had a hold  rating  on Bank of America since
July 2010, upgraded the stock to buy this month, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. He said he expects the shares to hit
$12 within a year. Bank of America climbed 4.1 percent to $9.49
in New York yesterday and has advanced 71 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
