A group led by  Saudi Arabia ’s ACWA
Power International signed a $1 billion deal to supply  Morocco 
with electricity from the North African nation’s first solar-
thermal power plant.  The government of Morocco will purchase power for 25 years
from the 160-megawatt plant ACWA is developing with  Spain ’s
Aries Ingenieria & Sistemas SA and TSK Electronica &
Electricidad SA in Ouarzazate for Morocco’s Solar Energy Agency.  The Riyadh-based ACWA said it selected Spain’s  Acciona SA (ANA) 
and Sener Grupo de Ingenieria SA to design and build the project
in September. The plants use mirrors that concentrate sunlight
to generate steam and power turbines. The plant will capture
470,000 tons a year of carbon dioxide emission, it said.  ACWA said it intends to sign a project-financing agreement
by the end of the year and start operating the plant in the
second half of 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
