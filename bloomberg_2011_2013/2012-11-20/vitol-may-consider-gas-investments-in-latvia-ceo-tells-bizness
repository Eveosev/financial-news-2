Vitol Group, a Swiss oil trader with
revenue of almost $300 billion last year, may consider investing
in natural gas in  Latvia ,  Dienas Bizness  reported, citing an
interview with chief executive Ian Taylor.  Vitol may have been a “a bit naïve” with its initial
investment in  Ventspils Nafta (VNF1R)  A/S because it didn’t know the
company’s history or how things worked in Latvia, Taylor said,
in the interview. Vitol owns 49.5 percent of Ventspils Nafta.  The price of oil will probably decline next year and may
trade between $90 to $120 per barrel, said Taylor, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
