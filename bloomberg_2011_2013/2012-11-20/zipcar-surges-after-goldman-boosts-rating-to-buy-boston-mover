Zipcar Inc. (ZIP) , the company that rents
cars by the hour or day, climbed to a six-week high after
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised its rating on the stock to buy.  The shares gained 7.1 percent to $7.53 in New York for
their highest close since Oct. 8. Zipcar, based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts,  has declined  44 percent this year.  The rating change from neutral is “a high-risk, high-
reward contrarian call,” Goldman said in a Nov. 19 report.
Zipcar’s profit may rise more than investors expect because of
“potentially higher operating margins in new and established
markets” such as Boston, New York,  San Francisco  and
Washington, according to the report.  Zipcar, which created the business of hourly car rental in
Cambridge in 2000, has suffered as competition increased.
Enterprise Holdings Inc. and  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , the two
largest companies in the U.S. industry, have expanded hourly
rentals this year.  Goldman raised its 12-month price target on Zipcar’s shares
to $8.75 from $8. The stock reached a closing peak of $29.27 on
April 19, 2011, six days after Zipcar’s initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
