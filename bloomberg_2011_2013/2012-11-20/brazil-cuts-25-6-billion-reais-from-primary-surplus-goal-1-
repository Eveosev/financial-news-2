Brazil’s government will cut 25.6
billion reais ($12.3 billion) from its 2012 primary  budget
surplus  target after a drop in  tax collection , according to the
Planning Ministry.  The central government, which includes the Treasury, the
central bank and social security agency, is allowed to discount
from its  fiscal goal  some investments made under its growth
acceleration program to avoid reducing public spending amid
slower economic growth.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration reduced taxes on
cars, furniture, house appliances and payroll to boost economic
growth, in a move that made it harder for the government to meet
its fiscal target, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters
Nov. 6. Latin America’s biggest economy will expand 1.5 percent
this year, less than the U.S. and Japan, according to Bloomberg
estimates.  The government, before discounting for investments,
targeted a budget surplus before interest payments of 97 billion
reais. In the first nine months of the year, the so-called
primary surplus was 54.8 billion reais, or 43.5 percent of the
2012 goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
