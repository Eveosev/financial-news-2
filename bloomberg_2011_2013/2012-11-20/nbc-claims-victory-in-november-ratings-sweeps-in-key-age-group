Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC said it won the
November “sweeps” ratings contest, drawing the most prime-time
TV viewers in a key age group for advertisers for the first time
in nine years.  Based on preliminary Nielsen data, the network averaged a
larger audience in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic than  CBS
Corp. (CBS) ’s CBS,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC and  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox, NBC
said today in an e-mailed statement. NBC hadn’t finished first
since 2003.  NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” was the highest rated
prime-time series on any day, averaging a 7.6 rating. The
singing competition “The Voice” was the top unscripted series
of sweeps, according to the statement. “Revolution,” which
airs on Mondays after “The Voice,” was the top new drama with
a 2.8 rating.  Comcast, which purchased a controlling stake in NBC
Universal in January 2011, has invested billions in the
broadcast network to improve its programming. NBC finished the
2011-2012 TV season in third place among 18-to-49 year olds
after seven consecutive years in last place.  The sweeps end Nov. 21 and official results for the month
will be released Nov. 26 by  Nielsen. (NLSN)  NBC will have to overcome
the challenge of losing “Sunday Night Football” at the end of
December as it competes with Fox’s “American Idol,” which
begins in January, to maintain its lead through May 2013, when
the TV season ends.  Comcast rose 1.5 percent to $36.56 at the close in New
York. The Philadelphia-based company’s shares have gained 54
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
