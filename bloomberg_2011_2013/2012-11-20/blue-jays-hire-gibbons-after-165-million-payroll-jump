The Toronto Blue Jays brought back
John Gibbons to manage a Major League Baseball team that has
added five All-Stars and at least $165 million in payroll this
offseason.  Gibbons, 50, managed the Blue Jays for parts of five
seasons from 2004 to 2008 and compiled a 305-305 record. He
succeeds John Farrell, who took the same job with the  Boston  Red
Sox last month.  The Blue Jays yesterday finished a 12-player trade with the
Miami Marlins that brought All-Stars Jose Reyes, Mark Buehrle,
Josh Johnson and John Buck to Toronto. The team also signed All-
Star outfielder Melky Cabrera, who batted .346 last season
before being suspended for violating the sport’s drug policy.  “Front office has put together a legitimate contending-
type team,” Gibbons said today at a press conference in
Toronto. “Now it’s the manager’s job and coaches’ job to pull
it all together as a team.”  The Blue Jays were 73-89 last season, fourth in the five-
team American League East. The team hasn’t made the postseason
since winning World Series titles in 1992 and 1993, and has
finished higher than third in the division once in that 19-year
span.  Gibbons took over as manager of the Blue Jays midway
through the 2004 season, leading the team to a 20-30 record to
close the year. He was fired 74 games into the 2008 season
following a 35-39 start, and last season managed the San Diego
Padres’ Double-A affiliate in San Antonio.  Instinct Move  Toronto General Manager Alex Anthopoulos said his decision
to rehire Gibbons was based on instinct. He acknowledged that
some fans and media members might not support bringing back a
manager for a second stint.  “I’ve got more conviction in this hiring than I’ve had in
any,” he said. “If I am going to be wrong, I am going to be
wrong doing what I believe in.”  Johnson and Buehrle join a starting pitching staff that had
just one regular with a winning record last season, Brandon Morrow. Toronto’s hit .245 as a team last season, 11th in the
14-team American League.  The Blue Jays also added outfielder Emilio Bonifacio in the
trade with Miami, which was approved yesterday by baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig. Toronto parted with seven players,
including shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria and pitcher Henderson
Alvarez, and took on $165 million in salary, according to
MLB.com.  The Blue Jays were 154-170 during Farrell’s two-year
tenure. He left the club last month to return to Boston, where
he was the Red Sox pitching coach from 2007 to 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
