Belgium ’s federal government reached
an agreement on the budget for next year, Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said.  “We have an agreement on the 2013 budget and on extra
measures for competitiveness and employment,” Di Rupo said in a
message posted today on  Twitter  after overnight talks.  Government ministers agreed on measures for almost 3.8
billion euros ($4.9 billion) in savings and taxes to meet its
budget-deficit goal next year of 2.15 percent of gross domestic
product,  De Tijd  and  L’Echo  reported without saying where they
got the information.  More than 700 million euros will come from savings in
social-security spending and another 700 million euros from
departmental and state businesses, according to  De Tijd . The
ministers also agreed on more than 1 billion euros of new taxes
and 1.3 billion euros in one-time measures, the newspaper said.  The government will elaborate on the  budget agreement  at a
press briefing in Brussels today at 11 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
