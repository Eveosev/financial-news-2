The  University of California,
Berkeley  fired football coach Jeff Tedford after a 3-9 season
that ended with five consecutive conference losses.  Tedford, 51, was relieved of duties today and a national
search for his replacement will begin immediately, Athletic
Director Sandy Barbour announced on the school’s athletics
website. Tedford was 82-57 in 11 seasons at Cal, including eight
bowl appearances and a share of the Pac-10 title in 2006.  “Ultimately, I believed that we need a change in direction
to get our program back on the right track,” Barbour said.
“Coach Tedford deserves credit for the extraordinary effort he
undertook to turn this program around.”  A two-time Pac-10 Coach of the Year, Tedford is owed $6.9
million over the final three years of his contract, according to
ESPN. He sent 40 players on to the  National Football League ,
including quarterback  Aaron Rodgers , wide receiver  DeSean Jackson  and running back Marshawn Lynch.  Cal opened the season 1-4, the lone win against Southern
Utah University. After wins over UCLA and Washington State, the
Golden Bears were outscored 212-74 over their final five games,
all losses. The team is 15-22 in the last three seasons.  Cal’s classroom performance has dipped in recent years, as
well. The team’s Academic Progress Rate, a  National Collegiate
Athletic Association  metric for the eligibility and retention of
athletes, dropped in each of the past three annual reports, to
936 in 2011 from 970 in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
