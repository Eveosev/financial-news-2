Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
producer, will cut the surcharge on sales to  Japan  and  South
Korea  in 2013 by 8.6 percent, reducing the fee for a second year,
before an agreement for  China  sales.  The premium for grade-A metal to  Korea  will decrease to $85
a metric ton from $93 this year, said two industry executives
familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified as the
terms are private. The 2013 fee for Japan will be at the same
level, two industry executives said last week.  Copper is trading 11 percent below this year’s high on
concern that Europe’s debt crisis and an economic slowdown in
China will curb demand. Codelco’s settlement may set a benchmark
for regional producers. The fee for China, the world’s biggest
consumer, may drop to $100 a ton in 2013 from $110 this year,
according to the median of 11 estimates from executives,
analysts and traders compiled by Bloomberg.  “Given the strong expectation that Chinese demand is going
to recover earlier next year, the negotiation results should be
higher for China,” Lian Zhen, an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co.,
said by phone from  Shanghai .  The fee is added to immediate-delivery prices on the London
Metal Exchange to reflect regional supply and demand and to
cover shipping and insurance costs. A call to Codelco’s
headquarters in Santiago wasn’t immediately answered.  Copper will average $3.57 a pound in 2013, 20 cents less
than the April estimate, on slower China demand and greater-
than-expected mine supply, according to a survey of analysts and
traders by Chile’s state-run copper commission Cochilco. Codelco
cut the surcharge to $85 in 2013 from $90 for European clients,
two people with direct knowledge of the matter said in October.  Copper for delivery in three months on the LME dropped 0.5
percent to $7,763.50 a ton at 1:29 p.m. in  Seoul . The price
touched $8,765 on Feb. 9, the highest this year. The March-
delivery contract was little changed at $3.537 a pound on the
Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
