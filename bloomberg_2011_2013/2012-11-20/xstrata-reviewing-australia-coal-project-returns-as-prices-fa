Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the world’s largest
thermal-coal exporter, said it’s reassessing the viability of
its coal projects in Australia because of declining prices.  “We’re reviewing all those projects,” Mick Buffier, group
executive for corporate affairs and sustainable development at
unit Xstrata Coal, said in an interview, while attending a
conference in Sydney. “It’s part of a normal business. So much
depends on the market, price level and individual projects that
have different cost structures.”  Thermal coal prices, which fell to a near three-and-a-half
year low this month, have forced job cuts and project deferrals
in Australia as the industry battles lower prices and rising
costs.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Xstrata cut almost 900 jobs at coal
operations in September.  Xstrata, whose shareholders are expected to back this
year’s biggest takeover later today, owns coal, copper, zinc and
lead operations, as well as a suite of development projects in
 Australia . This includes the A$6 billion ($6.2 billion) Wandoan
thermal coal project in Queensland, where the Zug, Switzerland-
based company is awaiting a state government decision on
granting a mining lease.  “It’s a matter of getting the right return on capital,”
Buffier said. “As prices have come down, projects that would
have been viable at very high levels tend to be put back. As
prices move up, we’d look again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
