Sales at major South Korean
department stores declined for a fifth month in October as the
slowest economic growth in three years damped sentiment.  Outlays at the three biggest chains declined 0.4 percent
from a year earlier in October after a 0.8 percent drop in
September, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in a statement
today.  Discount-store sales  declined 6.6 percent last month, the
report showed.  South Koreans may still wait until after a presidential
vote next month and for a budget compromise in the U.S. before
spending more, said Lee Sang Jae, a Seoul-based economist at
Hyundai Securities Co. Asia’s fourth-biggest economy grew 1.6
percent in the three months through September from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since 2009, according to an initial
estimate. The revised figure is due Dec. 6.  “Household spending is unlikely to pick up until
uncertainty over the election and the U.S. fiscal cliff clears
up,” Lee said before the data release. “That is likely to be
after the first quarter of next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
