Slovenian banks bad loan ratio
increased in September as non-performing loans advanced and less
credit was given to the economy, the central bank said.  “The credit risk is reflected in a 20.2 percent annual
increase of bad loan reserves and asset writedowns in September
from a year earlier,”  Banka Slovenije  said, according to an e-
mailed statement today. Bad loans, considered payment overdue
more than 90 days, advanced 3 percent from the end of 2011 to
14.2 percent in September.  Total assets at lenders in the Adriatic nation dropped by
1.9 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in the first nine months to
46.9 billion euros while banks boosted their capital by
receiving 2.2 billion euros of funding from the  European Central
Bank , the central bank said.  Slovenian state-owned banks like Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d. and  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.  are at the center of
concern among investors that the nation may become the next in
the euro region to seek international aid to prop up the
lenders. The reluctance of banks to lend will probably worsen
the outlook for the  export-driven economy , which is forecast to
shrink an annual 1.8 percent before recovering in 2014, central
bank Governor Marko Kranjec said Oct. 1.  Bad loan reserves and asset writedowns led to a pretax loss
of 76 million euros for the Slovenian bank industry in the first
nine months of the year, the bank said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
