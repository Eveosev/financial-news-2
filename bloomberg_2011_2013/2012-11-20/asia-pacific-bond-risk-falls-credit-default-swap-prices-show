The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 4.5 basis points to
181 basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark is on track for its lowest close in more
than two months, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 2 basis points
to 143 as of 11:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit Agricole
SA. The gauge is set for its lowest close since Nov. 7, or
almost two weeks, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 2 to 121 basis points as of 8:32
a.m. in Hong Kong, Westpac Banking Corp. prices show. The
measure is on course for its lowest close since Nov. 8,
according to data provider CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
