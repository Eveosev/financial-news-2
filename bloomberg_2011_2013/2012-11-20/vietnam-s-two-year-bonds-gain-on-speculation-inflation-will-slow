Vietnam ’s two-year bonds rose for a
third day, pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost three
months, on speculation inflation will slow. The dong was steady.  Consumer prices in  Ho Chi Minh City  may rise 0.1 percent in
November from the previous month, online newswire VnEconomy
reported today, after increasing 0.4 percent in October. Annual
 inflation  has averaged 5.97 percent in the second half of 2012,
less than half the rate in the previous six months, official
data show. Vietnam will cut  interest rates  in 2013 as price
pressures decrease, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said Nov. 14.  Speculation about slower price increases “is sending
positive signals and bond traders reacted to the news,” said
Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at Viet Capital Securities in Ho
Chi Minh City.  The  yield  on the two-year bonds fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 9.36 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest
since Aug. 27. The yield on benchmark five-year bonds was
unchanged at 9.90 percent.  The dong traded at 20,855 per dollar as of 2:17 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,853 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
