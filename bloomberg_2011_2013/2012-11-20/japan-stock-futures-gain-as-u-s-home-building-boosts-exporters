Japanese stock futures gained as
U.S. new-home construction rose to a four-year high, more
evidence of a revival in the industry that’s helping propel the
world’s biggest economy and boosting the outlook for Asian
exporters. Australian shares were little changed.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s
second-biggest maker of construction and mining equipment that
gets 80 percent of sales outside Japan, climbed 1 percent. ADRs
of  Sharp Corp. (6753)  sank 2.1 percent after the TV maker said it will
book a 25.3 billion yen ($311 million) one-time charge this
quarter to eliminate jobs. David Jones Ltd., Australia’s second-
largest department-store company, fell 0.8 percent as sales
missed estimates.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring next
month closed at 9,200 in Chicago yesterday, up from 9,120 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,190 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.1
percent.  “The foundations have been laid for a significant recovery
in the U.S.,” said Peter Esho, chief market strategist at City
Index Ltd., a provider of equities, bonds and  currency trading 
in Sydney. “There is cause for some optimism. The housing
market is finally starting to improve.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent yesterday as the
increase in housing starts tempered a tumble in Hewlett-Packard
Co. shares. Stocks had earlier declined as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank doesn’t have the
tools to offset the potential harm to the economy from the so-
called fiscal cliff.  Budget Talks  If talks between President  Barack Obama  and the Republicans
and Democrats fail to produce an agreement on the U.S. budget,
it will trigger more than $600 billion in automatic tax
increases and spending cuts that may throw the country into a
recession.  Housing starts rose 3.6 percent to a 894,000, the fastest
annual rate since July 2008 and exceeding all estimates in a
Bloomberg survey, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday
in Washington. The median forecast of 82 economists called for
an 840,000 pace.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11 percent from this
year’s low on June 4 through yesterday as central banks added
stimulus to spur economic growth and data showed a slowdown in
China may be ending. The Asian benchmark index traded at 13.6
times estimated earnings, according to data compiled by
 Bloomberg News .  Of the 565 companies on the  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index that
