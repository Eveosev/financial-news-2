Hochtief AG (HOT)  said Marcelino Fernandez Verdes will become chief executive officer, as Spanish owner
Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA solidifies control
over  Germany ’s biggest construction company.  Verdes will succeed Frank Stieler with immediate effect,
the companies said in a statement today. Thomas Eichelmann was
named chairman to replace Manfred Wennemer, who will leave at
the end of the year for personal reasons, Hochtief said.  Stieler’s abrupt departure follows an acrimonious takeover
battle last year that resulted in a loss of independence at the
hands of Hochtief’s largest shareholder, a maneuver that had
caught management off guard. Stieler’s predecessor, Herbert Luetkestratkoetter, resigned shortly after ACS took control
after fighting for months to avert the takeover.  “My priority for the years to come is to improve the
profitability and to continue the sustainable growth of
Hochtief,” Fernandez Verdes said in the statement.  The Spanish company has focused on expanding abroad to
counter a contracting domestic market. A break-up of the
business isn’t being considered, the company said. The new
management team will take 3 to 4 months to develop a strategy,
it added,  Hochtief rose as much as 2.5 percent today in  Frankfurt  and
closed at 38.62 euros, valuing the business at 2.97 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
