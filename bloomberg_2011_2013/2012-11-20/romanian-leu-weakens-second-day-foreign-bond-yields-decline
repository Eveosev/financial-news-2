Romania ’s leu weakened for a second
day after the country sold less debt than planned yesterday as
the central bank maintained a cap on liquidity provided to
lenders for a seventh week while demand soared to a record.  The leu depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 4.5361 per
euro by 1 p.m. in Bucharest. Yields on 2019 Eurobonds fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.91 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Banca Nationala a Romania maintained a cap on funding
at 6 billion lei ($1.7 billion) yesterday even as demand rose to
30 billion lei, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, keeping
funding tight for a seventh week at its repurchase agreements
auction. Rising yields for leu-denominated debt prompted the
 Finance Ministry  to raise only 407 million lei in 2014 notes,
below its 500 million lei target.  “The recent gains of the leu looked artificial, driven
largely by the central bank,” Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-based
economist at ING Bank Romania SA, wrote in an e-mailed note
today. “Therefore, we expect the leu to continue to move
sideways inside the 4.53-4.55 per euro range today.”  A campaign for the general elections started on Nov. 9 as
the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Victor Ponta goes head-
to-head with the opposition party supporting president Traian Basescu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
