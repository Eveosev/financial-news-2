U.S. Steel Corp. (X) , the largest U.S.
producer of metal by volume, has yet to complete talks to sell
its Slovak unit, prompting local officials to offer incentives
to keep the steelmaker, Slovak Premier  Robert Fico  said.  Fico said the government is ready to offer incentives to
ensure the U.S. company remains at the local plant, one of the
largest employers in the country. He met today with the unit’s
chief executive officer, David Rintoul, in the capital
Bratislava.  Jan Baca, a spokesman for U.S. Steel, declined to comment
today on the government’s offer. The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker
said Nov. 13 it received an offer for the company’s last
European steel mill and is considering it.  “Based on the direction of the discussion, I think that
they will rather leave,” Fico told reporters. “If they choose
to stay, the government is ready to talk about the conditions.”  U.S. Steel is paring back operations in  Europe , where
slowing demand is weighing on prices and shipments. In January,
it sold its Serbian mill for $1, triggering a $450 million
charge in the first quarter.  U.S. Steel bought its Slovak operations in 2000 for $475
million. The have an annual production capacity of 5 million
tons and include two coke batteries, three blast furnaces and
other units that produce sheets, tin-mill products and pipes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
