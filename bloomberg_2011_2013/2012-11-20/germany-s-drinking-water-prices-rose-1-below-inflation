German drinking water prices rose an
average of 1 percent last year, below the inflation rate, as
total living costs increased 2.3 percent in 2011, the country’s
utility lobby BDEW said today in an e-mailed statement.  Germany ’s water consumption last year dropped to its lowest
in at least two decades even as investments from utilities
increased, BDEW said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
