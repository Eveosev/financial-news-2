Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.09 percent to 0.21 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank plans to buy $1.75 billion to $2.25
billion of securities maturing from February 2036 to November
2042 today, according to the  New York  Fed’s website. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace short-term
debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort
to keep borrowing costs low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
