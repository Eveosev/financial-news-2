Philippine bonds advanced, pushing
the 15-year yield to the lowest level in more than three months,
on speculation slowing inflation will give the central bank more
room to lower interest rates. The peso rose.  Annual expansion in the  $225 billion economy  decelerated to
5.4 percent last quarter from 5.9 percent in the previous period,
according to the median  estimate  of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before an official report next week. Consumer
prices climbed 3.1 percent in October from a year earlier, the
least in four months. The  Philippines  plans to cut its overseas
debt-sales target by as much as half in 2013 to $1.5 billion,
Treasurer Rosalia de Leon said yesterday.  “Because of the benign inflation and growth concerns,
there’s another rate cut being factored in,” said Antonio Espedido, treasurer at  China Banking Corp. (CHIB)  in Manila.  The yield on the 5.875 percent bonds due March 2032 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.58 percent as
of 4 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.
That is the lowest level since July 27.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas reduced its benchmark interest
rate to a record-low 3.5 percent in October, the fourth
reduction in 2012. Policy makers next meet to review borrowing
costs on Dec. 13.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 41.165 per dollar in  Manila ,
data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
