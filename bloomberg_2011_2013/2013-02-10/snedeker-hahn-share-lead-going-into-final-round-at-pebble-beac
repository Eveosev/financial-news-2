Brandt Snedeker  and James Hahn share
the lead going into the final round at the Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am.  Snedeker carded a 68 yesterday and James Hahn scored a 6-
under 66 as they finished three rounds at 12-under 202.  “It was a great day. It was a fun day, played great pretty
much from start to finish,” Snedeker said. “A couple of
hiccups here and there, but I’m in great shape.”  Snedeker is going for his fifth PGA Tour title today. He
has won one of three times he held the lead after 54 holes.  Chris Kirk, who fired a 6-under 64 yesterday, is alone in
third place at 11-under, while Patrick Reed is one stroke back
at 10-under 204.  Defending champion  Phil Mickelson  put two balls in the
water on the 18th at Pebble Beach, where he fell on the rocks
looking for his first tee shot.  “I got lucky. I didn’t get hurt,” said Mickelson, who
ended the round at 1-over 73 to make the cut at 1-under 213.  The top 25 amateur teams today are chasing Jordan Spieth
and Dallas Cowboys quarterback  Tony Romo , who are 26 under par.  To contact the reporter on this story:
