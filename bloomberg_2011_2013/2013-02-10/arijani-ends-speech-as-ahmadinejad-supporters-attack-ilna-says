Iran’s Speaker of Parliament  Ali Larijani  cut short an address at a gathering to mark the
revolution’s 34th anniversary after he was attacked by backers
of President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , his political rival, Iran
Labour News Agency reported.  Larijani, the main speaker today at a commemorative event
in Qom, was unable to finish his speech after about 100
followers of the Iranian president interrupted him by shouting
slogans and then by throwing objects including clay tablets,
usually used for prayers, and shoes, ILNA said.  Larijani was led away after protesters attempted to reach
the area he was speaking from, the news service reported.  Ahmadinejad has been embroiled in a growing dispute with
Larijani, his long term political opponent. Larijani is seen as
potential candidate in the June presidential election in which
Ahmadinejad is constitutionally unable to run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
