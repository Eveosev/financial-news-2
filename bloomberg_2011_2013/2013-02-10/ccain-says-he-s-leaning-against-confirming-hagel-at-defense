Senator John McCain said he’s
leaning against voting to confirm Chuck Hagel, President Barack
Obama’s nominee as defense secretary, citing Hagel’s opposition
to then-President George W. Bush’s plan to send additional
troops to Iraq.  Commenting today on the “Fox News Sunday” program,
McCain, an Arizona Republican, said Hagel was wrong to oppose
the so-called surge and he knows he was wrong, yet he refused to
say so under questioning at a Senate Hearing. When asked if it
was fair to say that he was “leaning” against voting to
confirm Hagel, McCain agreed. Hagel, a former Rebublican senator
from Nebraska, is a Vietnam war veteran, as is McCain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
