Qatar plans to pursue joint
investments with  OAO Gazprom  after the Russian gas-export
monopoly opened an office in the Arab state’s capital, Qatar’s
energy minister said.  “Qatar is always looking for opportunities to cooperate,
especially for investment throughout the world,”  Mohammed Bin Saleh Al Sada  told reporters at the official opening today.  Russia and Qatar, holders of the world’s first- and third-
biggest gas reserves respectively, have increased cooperation
since the Persian Gulf country raised exports of liquefied
natural gas to Europe, Gazprom’s largest market. Qatar, the
biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, is pursuing energy
projects abroad amid a moratorium on new development of its
North Field, the world’s largest gas reservoir.  Qatar increased its capacity to export liquefied natural
gas, which is transported by ship, from zero to 77 million tons
in the 15 years ended 2011. During that time, it signed deals to
export LNG to European nations including Italy, Spain, Poland
and the U.K. The added supply of Qatari gas has encouraged
importers to cut their dependence on Russian supplies.  The  Gas Exporting Countries Forum , headed by Russia’s
Leonid Bokhanovskiy, is headquartered in Doha. The 13-member
group seeks to promote cooperation on gas exports. Qatar
Petroleum International, the foreign investment arm of the state
energy company, said two years ago it was negotiating buying a
stake in OAO Novatek’s Yamal LNG project in Russia’s arctic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
