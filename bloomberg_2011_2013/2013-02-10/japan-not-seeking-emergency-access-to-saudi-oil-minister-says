Japan isn’t seeking an agreement
with Saudi Arabia to raise production if it makes an emergency
request for oil supply, Japanese Trade Minister  Toshimitsu Motegi  told reporters in Abu Dhabi today.  Motegi comments came two days after Nikkei newspaper
reported that the Japanese minister visited the kingdom to sign
an agreement to secure future oil supply to limit shocks to
Japanese economy as Saudi Arabian exports may decline on growing
local consumption.  “At the moment there is no concern whatsoever that Japan
is undersupplied in terms of oil,” Motegi said, adding that his
meeting with Saudis was not to ask “for any specific request
for an increase of production or supply.”  Japan’s Motegi met yesterday in Riyadh with Saudi deputy
oil minister  Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman . Both Japan and Saudi
Arabia “agreed that petroleum market is stable” and supplies
are “sufficient” to meet current global demand, the ministry
said in a statement issued following the meeting and carried by
Saudi Press Agency.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s largest crude oil
exporter known as Saudi Aramco, has the capacity to position
more than four million barrels of crude oil in storage tanks on
Okinawa, Chief Executive Officer  Khalid Al-Falih  said May last
year.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
