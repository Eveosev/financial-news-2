Ben Brust hit a 3-pointer with 43
seconds left in overtime to lift the University of Wisconsin to
a 65-62 victory over the third-ranked University of Michigan in
college basketball.  In another upset among the top five teams yesterday,
Oklahoma (15-7, 6-4 Big 12) handed fifth-ranked Kansas (19-4,
7-3 Big 12) its third straight loss 72-66. Second-ranked Florida
(19-3, 9-1 SEC) beat Mississippi State (7-15, 2-8 SEC) 83-58.  At Kohl Center in Madison, Brust made a 3-point jumper at
the buzzer to tie the score 60-60.  In overtime, Traevon Jackson hit a jump shot to give the
Badgers a 62-60 lead with just under four minutes remaining. Tim
Hardaway Jr. scored a minute later to tie the game at 62-62.
With 43 seconds remaining, Brust hit his fourth 3-pointer in
seven attempts.  “It was awesome, something I’ll remember forever, and I’m
sure a lot of people will,” Brust told reporters.  Brust scored 14 points, Jared Berggren added 13 and Sam
Dekker had 12 for the Badgers, who improved to 17-7 and 8-3 in
the Big Ten Conference.  Trey Burke led the Wolverines with 19 points followed by
Hardaway with 18 and Mitch McGary with 12. Michigan fell to 21-3
and 8-3 in the Big Ten.  To contact the reporter on this story:
