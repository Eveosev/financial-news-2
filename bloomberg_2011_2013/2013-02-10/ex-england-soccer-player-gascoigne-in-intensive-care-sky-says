Ex-England soccer player
 Paul Gascoigne  has been taken into intensive care in the U.S.
after his health worsened, Sky reported, citing his former
Tottenham teammate Gary Mabbutt.  Gascoigne, 45, who’s in Arizona to have treatment for
alcohol addiction, suffered a reaction to a detox procedure,
Mabbutt said.  “I spoke to Paul’s medical team in the U.K. this morning.
They had spoken to Paul and he’s recovering and hopefully soon
he will be back into the clinic to continue his rehab,” Mabbutt
was cited as saying.  Former Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Rangers player
Gascoigne played 57 times for England, helping the nation to the
1990 World Cup semifinals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
