Prime Minister  David Cameron’s 
government will fund planned improvements to financial support
for the elderly in England by raising more money through
inheritance tax, Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said.  The amount any individual pays for care in old age will be
capped at 75,000 pounds ($118,000) before the government steps
in when the measures come into force in 2017, Hunt told
lawmakers in the House of Commons in London today. People with
assets of less than 123,000 pounds will receive help sooner. The
government’s aim is to encourage wealthier people to take out
insurance or use pension products to cover the 75,000-pound cap.  The extra cost will be partly funded by extending a freeze
for three years until 2019 on the level at which people start
paying inheritance tax on estates at 325,000 pounds, Hunt said.  “For too long, the issue of social care has been ducked by
successive governments, leading to an unfair system that has
seen people selling their homes and losing nearly everything
they’ve worked for to pay for their care,” Hunt said. “These
historic reforms will give everyone the protection they want in
their old age and save the family home.”  The policy is based on a 2011 report by  Andrew Dilnot , a
former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He
recommended a cap of 35,000 pounds on what people paid and said
his plan would prevent people spending more than a third of
their wealth on care costs instead of as much as 90 percent
under the existing system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
