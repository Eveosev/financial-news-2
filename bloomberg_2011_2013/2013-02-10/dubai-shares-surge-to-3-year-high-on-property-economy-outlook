Dubai’s benchmark stock index
rallied to the highest level in more than three years led by
 Emaar Properties PJSC  on investor optimism a real estate
recovery in the emirate is set to continue this year.  Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper
which had its price estimate raised at HSBC Holdings Plc, surged
5.7 percent. Emirates NBD PJSC, the United Arab Emirates’
biggest lender by assets, rose the most this month. The
benchmark  DFM General Index  jumped 2.2 percent to 1,899.51, the
highest level since November 2009, at the close in Dubai.  “Real estate stability is enough to see a continued equity
rally in the country,” said  Saad al Chalabi , a senior
institutional trader at Al Ramz Securities in Abu Dhabi. “Most
stocks on the bourse are under book value” with some trading at
strong multiples compared with other markets in the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council, he added.  Dubai stocks gained 16 percent in January, their best start
to a year since the exchange started operations in 2000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the bourse. The
city’s property market is recovering as tourism, hotel and
restaurant industries grew after a 2008 crash sent home prices
tumbling more than 65 percent. The economy may have expanded 5
percent in 2012, the fastest pace since 2007, the government
forecasts.  Dubai shares have a  price-to-book value  of 0.8 times,
compared with 1.8 times for stocks on Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All
Share Index,  the Persian Gulf’s largest bourse. The measure’s 31
companies trade at a 2013 estimated price-to-earnings ratio of
10.7 times, compared with 11.3 times for Saudi shares.  Property Rebound  Emaar surged to 5.01 dirhams, the highest close since
November 2008. Dubai’s economic and real estate recovery will
probably boost the price to 6 dirhams as apartment sales pick up
amid increasing demand, HSBC said last week. Positive trends in
Dubai’s property sector are set to continue in 2013, helping
Emaar’s performance,  Shuaa Capital PSC  said in January.  The DFM General Index’s 14-day  relative strength index 
jumped to 75 today from 70 at the close last week. A reading
above that level indicates to some analysts that a security or
index is poised to decline. About 206  million shares  were traded
today, compared with a 12-month daily average of 184 million
shares. The measure was the GCC’s best-performer last year with
a gain of 20 percent. Emirates NBD added 1.6 percent to 3.76
dirhams today.  Favorite Market  Elsewhere in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All
Share Index  advanced 0.2 percent to 7,012.17, the highest close
since Feb. 4. The world’s biggest oil exporter may allow
foreigners to invest directly in stocks in the next year,  John Burbank , founder of $3.7 billion San Francisco-based hedge fund
Passport Capital LLC, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television last week.  “The place that we probably have by far the biggest weight
relative to other people would be Saudi Arabia, which is our
favorite emerging market,” Burbank said. Passport has about 17
percent of its capital invested in the Arab world’s largest
bourse. The kingdom allows non-resident foreigners to invest in
shares through equity swaps and exchange-traded funds.  Oman’s  MSM30 Index  rose 0.2 percent, while Kuwait’s  gauge 
and Qatar’s  QE Index  gained 0.1 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
Index  slipped 0.5 percent after rising 0.9 percent last week,
its eighth week of gains. Bahrain’s  measure  declined 0.2 percent
and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  of the biggest companies in the
Persian Gulf slipped less than 0.1 percent. In North Africa,
Egypt’s benchmark EGX 30 Index increased 0.2 percent.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index  advanced 0.2 percent at the close in
Tel Aviv. The yield on the government’s benchmark 4.25 percent
bonds due 2023 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 4.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
