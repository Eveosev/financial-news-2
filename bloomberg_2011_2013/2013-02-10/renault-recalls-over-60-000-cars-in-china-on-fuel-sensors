Renault SA  recalled more than 60,000 Koleos sport-utility vehicles in China because of a faulty fuel sensor, according to China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.  The 61,508 affected imported cars are models from 2009 through 2012, the agency said in a  statement  on its website dated Feb. 6. Renault will provide free replacement sensors for the vehicles, which may show faulty fuel-level readings and could pose a safety risk. Calls and e-mails to Renault seeking comment weren’t returned outside normal business hours.  Renault is looking to replicate the success of other foreign carmakers in China, the world’s largest automobile market. Passenger-vehicle sales in the country surged 49 percent to a monthly record in January, as demand for SUVs almost doubled, the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in an e-mail on Feb. 7.  Renault faces competition from rivals such as General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG. China sales at GM., currently the top overseas carmaker in the country, surged 26 percent last month from a year earlier, the company’s best month ever. Volkswagen has said it aims to become the top-selling automaker in the world by 2018.  This latest recall for Renault comes after the agency said on Jan. 25 that the company would recall 5,097 Koleos vehicles in China because of a welding flaw.
