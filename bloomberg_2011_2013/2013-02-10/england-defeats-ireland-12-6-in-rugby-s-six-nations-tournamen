Owen Farrell  kicked all England’s
points in a 12-6 win against Ireland that lifted his team atop
the standings after two rounds of rugby’s Six Nations.  All the points came from penalty goals in wet conditions
yesterday.  Ronan O’Gara , who came on for the injured Jonathan
Sexton, got two for the home team as England secured its first
win against Ireland in Dublin for 10 years.  “To come here with a young side and close out the game was
great,” England coach  Stuart Lancaster  said on the Rugby
Football Union’s website. “To keep our composure in the heat of
the battle, it’s a testament to our players’ maturity.”  England, which opened Europe’s annual rugby championship by
beating Scotland, is the only team that can secure a so-called
Grand Slam sweep this year. The English lead with four points
ahead of Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Italy on two. France has
no points after two losses and visits England next on Feb. 23.  England led 6-0 at halftime in the the first tryless game
between the two sides since 1984. O’Gara tied the scores just
before the hour mark, though Farrell booted the final six points
with England a man down after  James Haskell  was sin-binned.  Defending champion Wales ended a run of eight straight
losses two days ago by beating France 16-6 in Paris. Scotland
defeated Italy 34-10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
