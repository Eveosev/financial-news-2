2007 and a price-to-earnings ratio of almost 15. The  Stoxx

candidates to head the Bank of Japan, said additional monetary
easing can be justified this year.  “With the strong start this year, it’d be very
understandable if stocks pause here to get a gauge of how growth
is going to shape up through the middle part of the year,”
 James McDonald , chief investment strategist at Northern Trust
Corp. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. His firm
manages $759 billion.  Low Volume  Equity trading volume was lower than average, with markets
in Japan, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam,
Singapore and Malaysia closed for public holidays.  The  S&P 500  has rallied about 6.4 percent in 2013 as U.S.

ADB, not as a BOJ contender.  The Group of Seven nations are considering releasing a
