Syria’s chemical weapons appear to
be secure, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General  Martin Dempsey  said.  “On the occasions when we have noted movement, they’ve
been movements that appeared to us to be intended to secure
them, not to use them,” Dempsey said in a session with
reporters on his aircraft returning from Afghanistan. He added
that “our ability to have a completely clear understanding is
somewhat limited. We don’t have persistent or perfect visibility
on” that nation’s chemical weapons intentions.  The Syrian regime headed by  Bashar al-Assad  has produced,
stored and weaponized chemical weapons, yet “little is known
from open sources” about the size and condition of the
stockpile, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service said
in a report in December.  The regime reportedly has stocks of nerve and blister
agents such as Sarin, VX and mustard gas and a loss of control
over chemical weapons in Syria could have “unpredictable
consequences,” the agency said.  The “mosaic of information” obtained to date suggests
that the chemical and biological weapons stores are secure,
Dempsey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
