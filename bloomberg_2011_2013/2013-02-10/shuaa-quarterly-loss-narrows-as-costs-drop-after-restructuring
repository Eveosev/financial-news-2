Shuaa Capital PSC, the investment
bank controlled by Dubai’s ruler, said fourth-quarter loss
narrowed as it reduced costs by 72 percent after restructuring.  The net loss was  20.7 million dirhams  ($5.6 million)
compared with 112 million dirhams a year earlier, Shuaa said in
an e-mailed statement today. Revenue climbed 25 percent to 25.2
million dirhams, while fourth-quarter expenses dropped to 39.2
million dirhams.  Shuaa, which has reported annual losses since 2008 as the
global financial crisis led to a drop in volume on local stock
markets, completed a restructuring program to reduce non-core
assets, cut jobs and generate recurring revenue. The company
stopped offering retail brokerage and said in October it plans
to boost lending to small and medium-sized businesses and high-
net-worth individuals to improve profit margins.  “The reduced scale of our industry and the renewed need
for capital and advisory expertise are playing out in our
favor,” Shuaa said.  Total assets slipped to 1.4 billion dirhams at the end of
2012 from 1.6 billion dirhams the year earlier. Shuaa expects
results of between a loss of 18 million dirhams and profit of 6
million dirhams in 2013, it said in November.  Shuaa shares  surged 9.1 percent in January, the best start
of a year since 2009, after declining 0.2 percent in 2012. That
compared with a gain of 20 percent for the  DFM General Index 
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
