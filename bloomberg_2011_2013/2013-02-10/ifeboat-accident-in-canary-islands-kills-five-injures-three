Five people died and three were
injured when a lifeboat dropped from a docked cruise ship
operated by  TUI AG ’s Thomson during an emergency drill in the
port of Santa Cruz de La Palma, in the Canary Islands.  All of the people involved were crew members, a spokeswoman
for the Ministry of Public Works said by phone, asking not to be
identified in line with government policy. Members of the
national police and civil guard were called to the scene of the
accident, she said.  The three injured are males in their early 30s, two of whom
suffered mild concussions, said a police official on the island,
who corroborated the details of the accident. One has been
discharged from the hospital and the other two will probably be
released from the hospital imminently, Thomson said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “We are working closely with the ship owners and managers,
Louis Cruises, to determine exactly what has happened and
provide assistance to those affected by the incident,” Claire
Borgeat, a Thomson spokeswoman, said in the statement.  The cruise ship, Thomson Majesty, was operated by Thomson
Cruises. The company is a division of TUI Travel Plc, which is a
majority-owned unit of Germany’s  TUI . A message left at TUI
Travel outside office hours wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
