The average price of a London home
will climb at least 31 percent to 500,000 pounds ($790,050) by
the end of the decade, according to a forecast by the Center for
Economics and Business Research.  Price appreciation will be driven by the British capital’s
ties to fast-growing emerging markets, a “high concentration”
of service firms and an economy that isn’t reliant on government
spending, the London-based research group said in a statement
yesterday. Other cities will experience slower growth due to
cuts in government spending, the company said.  “This last feature of the London economy will shield the
capital from the worst effects of public-spending cutbacks,”
CEBR said. “High rates of immigration to the capital bring a
range of skills, languages and international commercial links
which are forecast to fuel London’s economic and house-price
growth.”  CEBR expects the average London home price to be 383,000
pounds in 2013.  Outside of London, house prices in southeast England will
rise by 25 percent on average by 2018 and residences in eastern
England will climb by 26 percent, the firm predicted. Price
appreciation will be slower elsewhere, with valuations rising 6
percent in Northern Ireland and 2.3 percent in northeast
England, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
