The New York Knicks and Brooklyn
Nets both lost home games to National Basketball Association
division leaders, while  LeBron James  set a franchise scoring
record in leading the Miami Heat past the Los Angeles Lakers.  The Los Angeles Clippers withstood a 42-point effort from
New York’s  Carmelo Anthony  in a 102-88 win over the Knicks
yesterday at Madison Square Garden in New York.  The San Antonio Spurs improved their NBA-best record to
40-12 with a 111-86 rout of the Nets at the Barclays Center last
night even though they were without  Tim Duncan  and  Manu Ginobili 
due to injury.  Tony Parker  had 29 points and 11 assists for the
Spurs, who have won 12 of their past 13 games.  James scored 32 points in Miami to lead the Heat to a
107-97 win over the Lakers, marking the team-record fifth
straight game he’s had at least 30 points. The NBA’s three-time
Most Valuable Player is shooting 71.4 percent from the floor
during that stretch, hitting 55 of 77 attempts.  “I say this to Miami fans, don’t take it for granted,”
Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  said at a news conference after his
team’s fifth straight win. “He’s making greatness look easy.”  At Madison Square Garden,  Jamal Crawford  scored 27 points
off the bench, while  Chris Paul , in his second game since
returning from a knee injury, added 25 points for the Clippers.  Blake Griffin  had 17 points and 12 rebounds for Los
Angeles, which improved to 36-17, the third-best record in the
Western Conference. The Clippers are five games ahead of the
second-place Golden State Warriors atop the Pacific Division.  Anthony had 40 or more points for the fifth time this
season for the Knicks.  Raymond Felton , who left the court with a
head injury in the third quarter and returned in the final
period, had 20 points for New York.  Four-Game Lead  The Knicks drop to 32-17 with their second defeat in three
games and lead the Nets by four games in the Eastern
Conference’s Atlantic Division. Brooklyn (29-22) managed 29
points against the Spurs during the second half last night in
losing for the sixth time in its past nine games.  San Antonio hit 12-of-19 three-point shot attempts and
pulled away by outscoring Brooklyn 30-14 in the third quarter.  The Heat sit atop the Eastern Conference with a 34-14
record after pulling away from the Lakers behind James and
 Dwyane Wade , who scored 16 of his 30 points in the fourth
quarter.  Kobe Bryant  led the Lakers (24-28) with 28 points.  “Any time I can be linked with NBA history it’s
humbling,” James told reporters. “And the best part is that we
got another win.”  Also yesterday, the Boston Celtics pushed their NBA winning
streak to seven games as  Paul Pierce  had 27 points, 14 rebounds
and 14 assists in a 118-114 triple-overtime victory against the
Denver Nuggets. The Oklahoma City Thunder routed the Phoenix
Suns 97-69 and the Orlando Magic snapped a 12-game losing skid
with a 110-104 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
