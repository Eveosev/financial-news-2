The U.S.  condemned  a rocket and
mortar attack on a refugee camp for Iranian exiles next to
Baghdad’s international airport that killed six people and
wounded about 40 yesterday.  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon denounced the
assault yesterday, according to a  statement  on the UN website.
Both he and the U.S. urged Iraqi officials to investigate and
find those responsible.  “The United States condemns in the strongest terms the
vicious and senseless terrorist attack,” Victoria Nuland, U.S.
State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement on the
agency’s website. “The terrorists responsible for this attack
must be brought to justice.”  Al-Mukhtar army, the military wing of the Iraqi Hezbollah
movement, claimed responsibility for the assault, the Middle
East News Agency reported, citing a statement issued by the
Iraqi militia. The country’s government said it had started an
investigation into the incident, and that there is little it can
do to protect the camp from rocket fire, the Associated Press
reported. About 3,100 people live in the compound, according to
the news agency.  The camp is home to members of Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK,
the militant wing of a Paris-based Iranian  opposition group , the
National Council of Resistance of Iran, according to the
Associated Press. Iraq’s Shiite-led pro-Iranian government
considers MEK a terrorist group, the AP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
