The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps rose 24.75 cents a gallon in the past two
weeks to $3.5918 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Feb. 8 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The average is up 8.17 cents from a
year earlier. It was the biggest jump since the two weeks ended
March 4, 2011.  “Now that wholesale price hikes have accelerated,
retailers will not be able to delay much further before passing
through these hikes to consumers,”  Trilby Lundberg , president
of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“That’s enough reason for us to expect a few more pennies at
the pump even if crude oil prices do not rise.”  West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York Mercantile
Exchange fell 16 cents to $95.72 a barrel in the two weeks to
Feb. 8.  Crude inventories  rose 2.62 million barrels in the week
ended Feb. 1 to 371.7 million, according to data from the Energy
Information Administration. Supplies at  Cushing , the delivery
point for the Nymex futures contract, dropped 0.6 percent to
51.4 million barrels. Refineries ran at 84.2 percent of
capacity.  Gasoline futures on the Nymex advanced 18.3 cents, or 6.4
percent, to $3.0588 a gallon in the past two weeks. Futures have
risen 8.8 percent this year.  Stockpiles Rose  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  rose 1.74 million barrels to 234
million, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistics arm.  Oil may fall this week as technical indicators signal that
prices may have risen too quickly to be sustainable, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  Eighteen of 37 analysts, or 49 percent, forecast crude will
increase through Feb. 15. Twelve respondents, or 32 percent,
predicted an increase and seven said there would be little
change. Last week, 42 percent of analysts projected a gain.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in Los Angeles, where the average was $4.10
a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Billings,
Montana, where customers paid an average of $3.05 a gallon.  Regular gasoline on Long Island averaged $3.93 a gallon,
according to Lundberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
