Egypt agreed to export 1,200 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending Feb. 7, according to the
Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association.  The country has shipped 37,194 tons of the fiber, valued at
$107.2 million, since Sept. 1, the association said today in its
weekly bulletin. Exports in the past week included 350 tons of
the Giza 88 variety and 850 tons of Giza 86, it said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton. The
cotton is used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh
and India are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
