The University of Notre Dame needed
five overtimes to upset 11th-ranked University of Louisville
104-101 in college basketball.  The 25th-ranked Fighting Irish and the Cardinals are tied
at 19-5 overall and 7-4 in the Big East Conference after last
night’s three-hour and 40-minute game at Purcell Pavilion at the
Joyce Center in South Bend, Indiana.  “Many times it looked like we lost it,” Notre Dame coach
 Mike Brey  said during a televised interview. “We got to a
hundred (points) because we played an extra game although it
still only counts as one Big East win.”  During regulation play, Notre Dame had a 27-24 halftime
lead on Jack Cooley’s jumper and two free throws by Eric Atkins
in the final minute. Notre Dame trailed 56-48 with 44 seconds
left in the game before Jerian Grant made three 3-pointers, a
layup and free throw to tie the game at 60-60 and force overtime.  With two minutes left in the fifth overtime, Atkins hit a
jumper for a 100-98 the Fighting Irish the lead. Notre Dame
added another layup and free throw to make it 103-100 with 19
seconds left.  Louisville’s Russ Smith hit the first of two free throws
with 13 seconds to pull the Cardinals within two points. Notre
Dame’s Pat Connaughton then added a foul shot before Smith
missed a 3-pointer that would have tied the game.  Grant had 19 points, Garrick Sherman had 17, Connaughton
scored 16 and Atkins and Cameron Biedscheid each contributed 14
points for Notre Dame.  Louisville’s Chane Behanan had a game-high 30 points and 14
rebounds, Luke Hancock scored 22, Smith had 21 points and 10
rebounds and Gorgui Dieng tallied 17 points and 13 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
