Marion Rolland of France clinched a
surprise win in the women’s downhill event at the World Ski
Championships in Schladming, Austria, today.  Rolland, 30, finished the 3-kilometer (1.9-mile) course in
1 minute 50.00 seconds. Nadia Fanchini of Italy was second, 0.16
second back, and Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch was third, 0.7
second behind the winner.  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S., the Olympic champion, missed the
race after sustaining season-ending injuries in a super-G crash
last week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
