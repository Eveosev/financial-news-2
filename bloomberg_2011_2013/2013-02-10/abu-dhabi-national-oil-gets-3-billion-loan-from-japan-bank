Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. agreed to
take a $3 billion loan from Japan Bank for International
Cooperation as the Asian country provides financing to secure
crude supplies, government officials from both nations said.  JBIC, as the state-linked lender is known, is extending
credit to Abu Dhabi’s government-owned oil company, known as
Adnoc, for a five-year period, Japanese Trade Minister
 Toshimitsu Motegi  said at a press conference in the emirate
today. He said the interest rate on the loan is confidential.  The loan is the third between Adnoc and JBIC, following
similar agreements for the same amount of money in 2007 and
2010. Japanese companies have stakes in oil- and natural-gas-
producing ventures in Abu Dhabi and are consumers of the fuels.  Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, holds most
of the country’s oil. The emirate is negotiating new joint
venture agreements for its main oil production concession to
replace the deals that expire next year.  Adnoc and JBIC signed the loan agreement today in Abu
Dhabi,  Nasser Ahmed Al Sowaidi , chairman of the emirate’s
Economic Development Department, said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
