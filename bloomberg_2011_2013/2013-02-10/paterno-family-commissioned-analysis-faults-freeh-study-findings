A report commissioned by the family
of former Pennsylvania State University football coach  Joe Paterno  faulted the report by  Louis Freeh  released last year as
“fundamentally flawed.”  Former U.S. Attorney General  Dick Thornburgh  and other
experts found that, based on a review of evidence, Paterno
didn’t attempt to hide any information or impede the
investigation into former assistant coach  Jerry Sandusky .  Freeh’s investigation failed Penn State, the university’s
board of trustees and Sandusky’s victims by not finding the
truth, the report released this morning said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
