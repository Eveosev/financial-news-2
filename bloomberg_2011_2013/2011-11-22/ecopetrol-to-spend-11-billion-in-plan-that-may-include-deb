Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s largest oil
company, plans to invest $11 billion next year as part of a bid
to more than double its crude production in 2020.  The Bogota-based company may use debt to help fund spending
next year, when average production will rise to 800,000 barrels
a day, according to an e-mailed statement distributed yesterday
after markets closed.  The government-controlled company is moving ahead with an
$80 billion investment plan through 2020 to be funded by  cash
flow  and the sale of debt and stock, according to the statement.
The company’s rising output has helped make Colombia the third-
largest oil producer in  South America  after Venezuela and  Brazil 
as the nation also draws spending from investors including
billionaires Eike Batista and Carlos Slim.  Third-quarter profit more than doubled at Ecopetrol after
 oil prices  and production rose. Quarterly production of oil and
natural gas rose to 731,500 barrels a day from an average
632,400 barrels a year earlier. Ecopetrol aims to increase
production to 1 million barrels in 2015 and 1.3 million barrels
in 2020.  Ecopetrol slid 20 pesos, or 0.5 percent, to close at 3,955
pesos in Bogota yesterday. The stock has slipped 3.5 percent
this year, less than a 14 percent drop by Colombia’s benchmark
Colcap index.  Ecopetrol this year sold 2.4 trillion pesos ($1.24 billion)
in stock in August, falling short of its target of 2.5 trillion
pesos amid a rout in international markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
