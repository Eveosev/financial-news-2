The outlook on  Michigan ’s general-
obligation debt was changed to positive from stable by Moody’s
Investors Service.  Moody’s assigned the state’s Aa2 rating, third highest, to
the planned sale of $200 million in bonds.  The revision “reflects Michigan’s progress in rebuilding
financial reserves and running structurally balanced budgets,
which signals an improving credit trajectory,” according to a
report today. After the auto industry’s crisis in 2009,
“Michigan is rebuilding its balance sheet.”  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC
have had rising revenue and profits since their bankruptcies and
restructurings, earning a combined $13.5 billion last year. Auto
jobs in Michigan have increased 34 percent since their January
2009 low, according to the Center for Automotive Research in  Ann
Arbor .  Michigan’s  unemployment rate  in January was 8.9 percent,
compared with a national 7.9 percent, according to federal
statistics.  The  extra yield  demanded by investors in the $3.7 trillion
municipal market to own debt from Michigan and its
municipalities, relative to top-rated bonds, narrowed to 0.58
percentage point on March 13, matching the lowest since April
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread has
since widened to 0.63 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
