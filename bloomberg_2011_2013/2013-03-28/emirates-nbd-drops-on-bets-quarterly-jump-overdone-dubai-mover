Emirates NBD PJSC declined to the
lowest level in almost three weeks on investor bets gains this
quarter, the best on record, were overdone.  The shares of the biggest bank in the  United Arab Emirates 
tumbled 4 percent to 3.82 dirhams, the lowest since March 10, at
the close in Dubai. They were the biggest decliners on the
benchmark  DFM General Index, (EMIRATES)  which gained 0.5 percent.  The drop trimmed Emirates NBD’s surge this year to 34
percent, compared with an advance of 14 percent for Dubai’s
gauge. The shares traded at as high as 8 times estimated
earnings this week, the most expensive in at least two years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They closed at 7.5
times today, still above a ratio of 7 for  Dubai Islamic Bank
PJSC (DIB) , the sheikdom’s biggest Shariah-compliant lender.  “We expect to see profit taking,” said Tariq Qaqish,
deputy head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal Capital
PSC. “The stock has outperformed the Dubai index.”  Emirates NBD tumbled 5.7 percent in the past five days, the
worst weekly performance since April.  Three analysts recommend investors  buy the shares , while
four have a hold rating and one says sell, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
