The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 5 basis points to
123 basis points as of 11:08 a.m. in Sydney, National Australia
Bank Ltd. prices show. The measure, which rolled to a new series
on March 20, is set to snap six months of declines with an 8.8-
basis-point jump, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 2 basis points to 121.5 as of
8:49 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The benchmark is headed for an 8.2-basis-point increase
this quarter, its first since the period to June 30, according
to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 2 to 111 as of 9:23
a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices. The gauge has
fallen 13.7 basis points so far in March, set to decline for the
sixth straight month, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
