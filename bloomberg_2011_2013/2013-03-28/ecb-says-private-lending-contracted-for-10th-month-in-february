Lending to households and companies
in the euro area contracted for a 10th month in February as the
region struggles to emerge from recession.  Loans to the private sector fell 0.9 percent from a year
earlier after dropping an annual 0.9 percent in January, the
Frankfurt-based  European Central Bank  said today.  While Germany, the region’s largest economy, is showing
signs that it is returning to growth, France is stagnating and
Italy remains mired in recession, damping demand for credit in
the 17-member currency area. Potential turmoil caused by the
imposition of  capital controls  in Cyprus following a bailout
this month may endanger ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s prediction
that the region’s economy will gradually recover in the second
half of the year.  “The banks would like to give more loans but it’s a
problem of demand,” said Thilo Heidrich, an economist at
 Deutsche Postbank AG (DPB)  in Bonn. “The euro area is still in
recession in many places; in the course of the year loan growth
should gradually revive.”  The rate of growth in M3  money supply , which the ECB uses
as a gauge of future inflation, fell to 3.1 percent in February
from 3.5 percent in January, the ECB said today.  M3 grew 3.3 percent in the three months through February
from the same period a year earlier. M3 is the broadest gauge of
 money supply  and includes cash in circulation, some forms of
savings and money-market holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
