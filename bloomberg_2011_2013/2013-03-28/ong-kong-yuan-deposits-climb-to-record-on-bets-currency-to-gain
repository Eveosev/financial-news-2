Yuan  deposits in Hong Kong climbed
to a record in February as a brightening outlook for the world’s
second-largest economy spurred speculation China’s currency
would appreciate.  Savings rose 28 billion yuan ($4.5 billion) from the
previous month to 652 billion yuan, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority said in a  statement  on its website today. That
surpassed the previous record of 627.3 billion reached at the
end of November 2011. That was a fifth straight monthly gain.
Taiwan banks started interbank yuan trading in February and
began taking in yuan deposits, offering interest rates that were
double those available in Hong Kong.  “There’s been stronger expectations of yuan appreciation
since the start of the year,” said Nathan Chow, a Hong Kong-
based economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “Even though Taiwan
is offering higher interest rates, it’s unlikely to be a big
drain on Hong Kong’s pool of yuan.”  The yuan reached a 19-year high of 6.2095 per dollar in
Shanghai on March 25. The currency was little changed at 6.2143
per dollar today. China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index for
manufacturing for March will be 51.2, indicating a sixth month
of expansion, according to the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists before official data on April 1.  The currency will appreciate 1.8 percent to 6.12 per dollar
in 2013, almost double last year’s 1 percent advance, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Hong Kong handled 221.7 billion yuan of trade settled in
the Chinese currency in February, a 17.4 percent decrease from
January, according to HKMA data. The decline was due to changes
in the timing of Chinese New Year holidays, which fell in
February this year and January in 2012, a spokeswoman at the
HKMA wrote in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
