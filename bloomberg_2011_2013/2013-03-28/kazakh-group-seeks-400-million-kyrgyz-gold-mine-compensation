Visor Group, a Kazakh private-
equity investment company, said its partners filed an
arbitration claim March 13 against Kyrgyzstan over its interest
in a gold deposit.  Visor is seeking more than $400 million at the World Bank’s
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for
the expropriation of its interest in the Jerooy gold deposit,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the company based
in Almaty,  Kazakhstan . The Kyrgyz government’s press office
didn’t reply to an e-mailed request for comment sent after
working hours. No contact phone number is listed on the
government’s  website .  Visor owns 60 percent of the shares in Jerooyaltyn CJSC, a
joint venture with a Kyrgyz state-owned company formed to
develop the deposit, it said. The damages were caused by the
Kyrgyz government annulling Jerooyaltyn’s license, attempting to
liquidate the joint venture, failing to provide documentation,
land plots and other cooperation necessary for developing the
deposit and treating Jerooyaltyn unfairly in Kyrgyz courts,
Visor said.  “This expropriation and unfair and inequitable treatment
violated Visor’s rights under international treaties and Kyrgyz
law,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
