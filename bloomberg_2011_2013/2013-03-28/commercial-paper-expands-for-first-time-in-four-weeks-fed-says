The market for corporate borrowing
via  short-term IOUs  expanded for the first time in four weeks,
led by a rise in issuance from non-U.S. financial institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
climbed $5.3 billion to $1.022 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the  Federal Reserve  said today on its website.
Thatâ€™s the first rise since a $200 million increase for the
period ended Feb. 27 and the highest level since then.  Commercial paper sold by  overseas financial institutions 
increased for a third week, surging $9.6 billion to $223.2
billion, the highest level since the period ended Feb. 13. The
 amount issued by U.S.-based financial companies  fell for a
fourth week, dropping $3.1 billion to $304.8 billion, the least
since the week ended Dec. 19, according to the Fed.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
