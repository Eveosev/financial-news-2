The Easter Sunday  Boat Race  between
Oxford and Cambridge universities may see snow for the first
time in three decades, the U.K.’s Met Office said.  Snow flurries are possible amid temperatures of up to 5
degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the
forecast for London on March 31, when the 159th Boat Race takes
place on the River Thames. The last time it snowed during the
annual race was 1983, the Met Office said, when Oxford won.  Freezing temperatures have disrupted flights, train
services and sporting events across large parts of the U.K. this
month. In  Scotland  and Northern Ireland, thousands of homes were
without power after severe snowstorms and strong winds damaged
cables last weekend.  March may be the coldest month since 1962, with a mean
temperature of 2.5 degrees Celsius that’s three degrees below
the long-term average, according to the  Met Office .  U.K. bookmaker  William Hill Plc (WMH)  is offering odds of 25-1
that snow will fall during the race. That means a successful $1
bet would return $25, plus the stake.  Oxford, which lost last year after the race was interrupted
by a man who jumped into the river, is the 2-5 favorite to win,
with Cambridge at 7-4, according to William Hill.  Cambridge has an 81-76 lead in the series, which started in
1829 after a Light Blues student wrote to an Oxford friend
proposing a race.  The event is one of the main fixtures on the British sports
calendar. The 4.25-mile (6.8-kilometer) race has drawn crowds of
250,000 spectators on the banks of the Thames and millions more
spectators on television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
