The Canadian dollar fell against
the majority of its 16 most-traded peers as signs of an economic
slowdown in the U.S., the country’s largest trading partner,
damped investor appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The currency advanced earlier to the strongest level in
more than a month versus its U.S. counterpart as  Canada ’s
economy grew at a faster-than-forecast pace in January. It
trimmed gains as more Americans than projected filed
applications for unemployment benefits and business activity in
the U.S. expanded at a slower pace than predicted. The so-called
loonie rose this week and month amid data showing  consumer
prices  rose at the fastest monthly pace in more than 20 years.  “You’re contrasting some of the slight upside surprise
with respect to gross domestic product today -- which gave the
Canadian dollar a bit of a lift, at least immediately after the
print -- with some of the wider concerns around risk assets more
generally,” said  David Tulk , chief macro strategist at Toronto-
Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit by phone from Toronto. “This
is a case where it seems to balance each other out.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the water fowl on the C$1 coin, was little changed at
C$1.0162 per U.S. dollar at 5:00 p.m. in Toronto after reaching
C$1.0146, the strongest since Feb. 20. One loonie buys 98.41
U.S. cents.  Bonds, Oil  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bonds was little
changed to yield 1.87 percent. The 2.75 percent security
maturing in June 2023 fell 6 cents to C$96.59.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, rose 0.6
percent to $97.19 per barrel in New York, and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks rose to a record high.  Canadian output  increased 0.2 percent to an annualized
C$1.56 trillion ($1.54 trillion), following a 0.2 percent drop
in December, Statistics Canada said in Ottawa. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 25 economists was for a 0.1
percent expansion in the month.  “We got a little uptick in the currency, but now we’re
back to where we were before the numbers, so a muted reaction at
best,” Matthew Perrier, director of foreign exchange at Bank of
Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. “We had a couple upside
surprises this week on the Canadian data, so a mild positive for
the currency, but it’s only two data points and sort of backward
looking ones. We’ll have to see some more data points in the
weeks ahead to see if we’re having a real uptick on the Canadian
front.”  U.S. Reports  First-time  jobless claims  in the U.S. rose by 16,000 to
357,000 in the week ended March 23, the highest level in more
than a month, Labor Department data showed in  Washington . The
median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for an increase to 340,000. The four-week average climbed from
the lowest level in five years.  The MNI Chicago Report’s business  barometer  fell to 52.4
this month, the lowest level of the year, from 56.8 in February.
A reading greater than 50 signals expansion. The median forecast
of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 56.5.  Traders were the least bearish on the loonie in almost two
months as so-called risk reversals show option traders are
paying almost the least for protection against loonie weakness
since Feb. 4. The three-month 25-delta risk reversal rate fell
to 0.92 percentage point from 1.47 percentage points on Feb. 26,
its highest since Sept. 4.  The Canadian dollar has gained 1.9 percent this month
against nine other developed-nations currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index. The U.S. dollar has
climbed 0.3 percent and the euro has lost 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
