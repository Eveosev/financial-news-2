Corn plunged the most since May,
sparking a slump in soybeans and wheat, after the government
said U.S. inventories were bigger than analysts forecast and
that farmers will plant the most since 1936.  Inventories of corn on March 1 totaled 5.399 billion
bushels in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter,
the Department of Agriculture said today. While that’s down 10
percent from 2012 and a nine-year low, analysts expected 4.995
billion. Farmers will sow 97.282 million acres, up from 97.155
million in 2012 and the most in 77 years, the USDA said.  Prices this month jumped 4.5 percent before today and
reached a seven-week high yesterday on concern that rising
demand from makers of ethanol and animal feed would erode
inventories before a record harvest arrives in September. After
today’s USDA report, corn prices plunged the maximum allowed on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, while soybeans fell the most since
September and wheat futures had their biggest drop since 2011.  “It comes down to two things -- the size of the crop and
feed usage,” Arlan Suderman, a senior market analyst at Water
Street Solutions Inc. in Peoria,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “Maybe USDA underestimated the size of the crop and
then feed usage came in less than expected.”  Corn futures for May delivery plunged by the exchange’s 40-
cent limit, or 5.4 percent, to settle at $6.9525 a bushel as of
2 p.m. in Chicago, the biggest decline since May 22 and the
lowest price since March 8. Trading was more than triple the
average of the past 100 days.  Speculators  As of March 19,  hedge funds  and other speculators had
boosted net-long  positions , or bets that corn prices would rise,
for three straight weeks to 145,535 futures and options
contracts, the most since Feb. 5, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show.  The government quarterly inventory reports have become
harder to predict, resulting in more surprises and big price
moves. In the six years prior to today, analysts’ estimates for
March inventories missed the USDA tally by 123 million bushels
on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
enough corn to feed 15.4 million pigs, or 14 percent of the U.S.
herd, until they are big enough to be sold for slaughter.  For the 11 quarters since June 2010, the average intraday
price swing on the day of the USDA inventory report was 5.6
percent, with prices rising six times and falling five.  Feeding Less  Operators of cattle feedlots probably used less of the
grain as the domestic herd on March 1 dropped 7 percent from a
year earlier, more than the 6.4 percent expected by analysts,
Dennis DeLaughter, an analyst at Vantage RM in Houston, said by
telephone.  The worst drought since the 1930s cut corn production by 13
percent and left inventories on Dec. 1 at 8.03 billion bushels,
the lowest for that date since 2003, according to the USDA. Use
of the grain in livestock feed for the year that began Sept. 1
is forecast to rise to 4.55 billion bushels from 4.548 billion a
year earlier, even after the price gained 17 percent in the 12
months through yesterday.  The production decline may have been overstated, DeLaughter
said. The USDA raised its Dec. 1 corn stockpiles estimate by
2.26 million bushels, indicating more was in storage at the
beginning of that month than previously thought.  “That tells us there was a very large amount of corn that
was uncounted during the fall quarter,”  Terry Reilly , a senior
commodity analyst at Chicago-based Futures International LLC,
said by e-mail. “That lessens our confidence in USDA’s fall
survey.”  China Sales  Soybean stockpiles on March 1 totaled 999 million bushels,
also the lowest since 2004 and down 27 percent from 1.374
billion a year earlier, the USDA said. Analysts forecast
inventories at 948 million bushels.  Last year’s drought and increased sales to  China  eroded
inventories in the U.S., which until this year was the world’s
biggest shipper of the oilseed.  Exports  from Sept. 1 through
March 14 totaled 31.9 million metric tons, up 24 percent from
the same period a year earlier, USDA data show.  Soybean planting will drop 0.1 percent to 77.126 million
acres, the USDA said, based on its annual survey of farmers.
Analysts forecast an increase to a record 78.351 million.
Seeding may decline because growers expect prices to drop as
output rises in  South America .  Brazil ’s crop is forecast by the
USDA at a record 83.5 million tons and exports at 38.4 million,
making it the world’s largest shipper.  South America  “About the only positive number we saw in the report was
lower new-crop soybean acres,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser
at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City , Illinois, said in a
telephone interview. “That was the only thing below average
trade guess. There’s been a lot of things building against the
soybean market, and the biggest thing that’s been building is
the huge crop in South America.”  Soybean futures for May delivery tumbled 3.4 percent to
close at $14.0475 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest drop since
Sept. 17.  March 1 wheat inventories totaled 1.234 billion bushels, up
2.9 percent from 1.199 billion a year earlier, according to the
government. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 1.165
billion, on average.  Wheat futures for May delivery tumbled 6.7 percent to
$6.875 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest decline since September
2011.  Corn is the most valuable U.S. crop, followed by soybeans,
hay and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
