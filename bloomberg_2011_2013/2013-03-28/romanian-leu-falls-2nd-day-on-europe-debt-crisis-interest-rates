The leu weakened for a second day
on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen and as the Romanian
central bank kept the highest interest rate in the European
Union unchanged today.  The leu trimmed its first-quarter gain as investors
speculated Slovenia may follow Cyprus as the next euro-region
member requiring a bailout. The Banca Nationala a Romaniei left
its policy rate at 5.25 percent today, matching the estimates of
20 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The local currency softening overshot our expectations,”
Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-based economist at ING Bank Romania,
wrote in a note today. “As core markets uncertainty looks bound
to last for yet another day, we see the leu trending between
4.41 per euro and 4.42 per euro today.”  The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 4.4218 per euro by
1:57 p.m. in Bucharest, paring its gain in the first three
months to 0.7 percent.  Slovenia’s pledge to continue austerity measures failed to
stem a rise in bond yields to record highs as investors worry
the Alpine nation will follow Cyprus as the next euro-region
member requiring a bailout.  Cyprus’s commercial banks reopened today, with new rules
curbing access to cash after being closed since March 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
