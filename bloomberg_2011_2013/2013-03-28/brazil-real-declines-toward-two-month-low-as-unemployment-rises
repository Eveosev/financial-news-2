Brazil ’s real fell toward a two-
month low as a report showed unemployment rose and traders
speculated that the central bank will allow the currency to
weaken as it prioritizes  job creation  over damping inflation.  The real slid 0.3 percent to 2.0163 per dollar at 12:43
p.m. in Sao Paulo after falling to 2.0173 on March 26, the
weakest level since Jan. 25. Swap rates due in January 2015 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.46 percent.  “The market knows that the real has already been stronger
and that didn’t help inflation,” Jose Carlos Amado, a currency
trader at Renascenca DTVM in Sao Paulo, said in a phone
interview. “Rather, it harmed exporters.”  Unemployment increased to 5.6 percent in February, the
highest level since June, from 5.4 percent in the prior month,
the national statistics agency said today.  Brazil’s central bank reduced its 2013 growth forecast to
3.1 percent from 3.3 percent and said the probability that price
increases will breach the 6.5 percent upper limit of the target
range for the first time in a decade has increased to 25
percent, up from 14 percent in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
