The euro appreciated against the
dollar and erased a decline versus the yen after German retail
sales unexpectedly rose in February.  Europe â€™s shared currency advanced 0.3 percent to $1.2813 at
7:06 a.m. London time. It was little changed at 120.71 yen after
depreciating 0.5 percent earlier.  German sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings,
gained 0.4 percent from January, the Federal Statistics Office
in Wiesbaden said today. Economists forecast a drop of 0.6
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
