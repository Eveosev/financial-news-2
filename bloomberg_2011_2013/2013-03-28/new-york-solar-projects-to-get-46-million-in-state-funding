The  New York  State Energy Research
and Development Authority, which administers incentive programs
for solar energy, is awarding $46 million to 76 projects in the
state.  The funds will be paired with $100 million in private
financing to support projects totaling 52 megawatts of capacity,
the authority said today in a statement on its website. Units of
Exelon Corp.,  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  and  SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) 
were among the 28 recipients.  The program caps funding at $3 million a project and
requires private investments, according to the statement.
Today’s awards represent the first of three rounds for current
proposals under review, the authority said.  The incentives have been dropping as solar energy costs
have declined. The “portfolio-weighted average” incentive
awarded today was 88 cents a watt, or about 30 percent of the
cost to build the projects, down from $1.30 a watt in 2011 and
93 cents a watt in 2012, the authority said.  New York ranked 10th in the nation for new solar capacity
installed in 2012, according to the Solar Energy Industries
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
