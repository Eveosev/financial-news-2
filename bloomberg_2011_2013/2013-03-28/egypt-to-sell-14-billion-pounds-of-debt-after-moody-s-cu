Egypt’s local-currency borrowing
costs surged the most in three months after Moody’s Investors
Service cut ratings of local banks due to their exposure to
government debt and the central bank raised  interest rates .  Average yields on six-month and one-year treasury bills
jumped 78 basis points, or 0.78 percentage point, at today’s
auction to 13.81 percent and 14.46 percent, according to central
bank data on Bloomberg. That’s the biggest increase since a sale
of similar-maturity debt on Jan. 3. The Arab country raised 6.8
billion Egyptian pounds ($999 million), missing a 7 billion-
pound target.  Deposit ratings of Egypt’s three biggest banks were cut to
Caa1 at Moody’s this week because the government has “reduced
capacity to support” them.  National Bank of  Egypt SAE, Banque
Misr SAE and Banque Du Caire SAE hold  government securities 
equal to 800 percent to 900 percent of their  Tier 1 capital ,
Moody’s estimates show. Local banks bid for 2 times the amount
of one-year bills offered today, down from 2.5 times last week.  “Demand is declining and forcing yields higher because the
market is saturated with government debt as banks took on bigger
positions throughout the quarter,” Amr Seif, chief dealer at
Piraeus Bank Egypt, said by phone.  Higher Yields  The Arab country’s borrowing costs have surged since
Moody’s downgraded its sovereign rating on March 21 to the
fifth-lowest junk score, citing political turmoil that’s stalled
an International Monetary Fund loan and hindered the economic
recovery. The yield on Egypt’s $1 billion of benchmark 5.75
percent dollar-denominated 2020 bonds has jumped 89 basis points
since the decision to 8.33 percent as of 3:34 p.m. in Cairo.  The central bank’s move to raise its benchmark rates last
week “naturally means higher inflation and higher yields,”
Seif said. “For foreign banks like us,  Egypt ’s downgrade also
reduces the amounts of government debt we can hold.”  The debt sold today will be issued April 2, the first step
in a plan to raise 170 billion pounds during the second quarter.
The pound weakened 0.1 percent to 6.8031 a dollar, taking this
year’s depreciation to 6.4 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The central bank sold $38.4 million at a currency auction
today at a weighted average exchange rate of 6.7931.  To contact the reporter on this story:
