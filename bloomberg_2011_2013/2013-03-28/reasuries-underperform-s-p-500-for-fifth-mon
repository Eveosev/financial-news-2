Treasuries rose for a third week,
the longest winning streak since November, amid concern  Europe 
will struggle to contain its sovereign-debt crisis even as
Cyprus’s banks reopened after two weeks of turmoil.  Benchmark 10-year note yields were little changed today
after data showed the  U.S. economy  slowed less than previously
estimated in the fourth quarter, while claims for jobless
benefits rose last week. The yields fell earlier to a three-week
low. The U.S. auctioned $29 billion of seven-year debt to lower-
than-average demand.  “The Europe crisis is still full-blown, and at some point
we’re are going to go to lower yields because of it,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets
America Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve  and bid at U.S. debt offerings. “It’s just a
matter of time before the next shoe drops in Europe.”  The  10-year yield  declined six basis points this week, or
0.06 percentage point, to 1.85 percent at 2 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 2
percent security due in February 2023 gained 18/32, or $5.63 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 11/32. The yield decreased today to
1.83 percent, the lowest level since March 4, before reversing
the drop.  Yields on the current  seven-year note  lost seven basis
points this week to 1.21 percent. They slid to 1.18 percent
today, the lowest since Jan. 2, before erasing the decline and
trading little changed.  The New York-based Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association recommended Treasuries trading end at 2 p.m.
in advance of the Good Friday holiday and stay  closed  tomorrow.  ‘Dance Around’  “We’ll dance around these levels, maybe up to 1.90 percent
if Cyprus continues to calm down,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief
economist in  New York  at the primary dealer Mizuho Securities
USA Inc. “We have an economy going nowhere quickly. The
headwinds keep on changing.”  Treasuries have underperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index this month as the Fed’s efforts to spur the economy
boosted stocks. U.S. government bonds returned 0.2 percent in
March through yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S.
Treasury Index showed, versus a return by the  equities index  of
3.3 percent including reinvested dividends. Treasuries have lost
0.2 percent this year, after returning 2.2 percent in 2012.  U.S. government debt  was less costly today after reaching
the most expensive level in 2013 yesterday, a gauge showed. The
10-year term premium, a model that includes expectations for
 interest rates , growth and inflation, was negative 0.73 percent
after touching negative 0.78 percent yesterday. A negative
reading indicates investors are willing to accept yields below
what’s considered fair value.  Today’s Auction  The seven-year notes sold today drew a  yield  of 1.248
percent, compared with an average forecast of 1.243 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of six primary dealers. The record auction
low yield was 0.954 percent in July, and yields reached 1.416
percent at the January sale, a 10-month high.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with amount of securities offered, was 2.56, matching
the October sale’s figure, the lowest level since 2009. The
average ratio at the past 10 sales was 2.68.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 35.5 percent of the notes, compared
with 33.4 percent in February and an average of 39.3 percent at
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.5 percent of
the notes, compared with the 10-auction average of 16.3 percent.  Three Sales  The auction was the last of three Treasury note sales this
week totaling $99 billion. The government sold $35 billion in
five-year securities yesterday at a yield of 0.76 percent. The
March 26 auction of $35 billion in  two-year  debt drew a yield of
0.255 percent.  The Fed bought $4.76 billion of Treasuries today due from
March 2017 to November 2017. The  central bank  is purchasing $85
billion of Treasury and mortgage bonds a month to support the
economy by putting downward pressure on borrowing costs.  Treasuries have gained 0.7 percent since the Cyprus turmoil
took center stage about two weeks ago, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes show. German bonds returned 1 percent during the
same period.  The Central Bank of Cyprus imposed new bank rules including
a daily limit on withdrawals and restrictions on transfers to
accounts outside the country.  EU Proposal  Cyprus’s lenders had been shut since March 16 when the
European Union presented a proposal to force losses on
depositors in exchange for a 10 billion-euro ($12.8 billion)
bailout. That plan touched off protests and political upheaval,
and was rejected by the country’s parliament. A subsequent
agreement imposed larger losses on uninsured depositors.  “The market probably finds it hard to argue what is
happening in Cyprus is a one-off event,” said Robin Marshall,
director of fixed income at Smith & Williamson Investment
Management Ltd. in  London . “That should support safe-haven
assets including U.S. Treasuries.”  Europe’s debt crisis began in  Greece  three years ago.
Cyprus is the fifth euro-bloc member to seek international aid.  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 0.4 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, up from a 0.1 percent prior estimate
and following a 3.1 percent pace in the third quarter, revised
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington .  First-time jobless claims rose by 16,000 to 357,000 in the
week ended March 23, the highest level in more than a month,
Labor Department data showed. A Bloomberg survey called for an
increase to 340,000. The four-week average climbed from the
lowest level in five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
