Google Inc. (GOOG)  is testing an online
shopping service with same-day delivery in San Francisco with
partners including  Target Corp. (TGT)  and  Walgreen Co. (WAG)   The pilot project, called Google Shopping Express, lets
local residents order items from participating retailers, which
also include Toys “R” Us Inc.,  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  and  American Eagle
Outfitters Inc. (AEO) , Google  said  on its website. Customers can get
items from multiple stores.  Google is expanding in e-commerce to compete with
 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest online retailer, as it
seeks to step up growth and lessen its dependence on Web search,
which now accounts for most of revenue. Last month, Google
agreed to buy Channel Intelligence Inc. to add online marketing
tools retailers use to bolster Internet sales. In November,
Google acquired BufferBox Inc., a service for delivering e-
commerce goods to physical kiosks.  Shops including Nob Hill Foods and Blue Bottle Coffee are
also included in the service, Google said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
