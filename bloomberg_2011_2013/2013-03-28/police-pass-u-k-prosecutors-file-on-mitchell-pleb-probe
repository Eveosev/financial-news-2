Police gave prosecutors a file of
evidence about officers accused of misconduct over allegations
that a government minister insulted police guarding the U.K.
prime minister’s residence.  Three officers have been arrested in the probe that stems
from allegations that former Conservative Party Chief Whip
Andrew Mitchell called police “plebs” when they refused to let
him cycle through the main gate at 10 Downing Street in
September. While Mitchell denied he used the term, he resigned
from his post a month later as the scandal continued.  A report by Channel 4 News televised on Dec. 18 said a
police officer had posed as a member of the public and falsely
claimed to have witnessed the events in an e-mail to a lawmaker.  The  Metropolitan Police Service  in  London  said in a
statement today that seven officers have been given notices that
they are being investigated for gross misconduct, including the
three that have been arrested.  The MPS said it is investigating the source of media leaks
about the case, whether an officer lied about witnessing the
incident and whether there was a conspiracy with any other
officers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
