Copper advanced, paring a second
quarterly decline, as strikes at Chilean ports raised concern
that supplies may be disrupted from the largest producer of the
metal used in pipes and wires.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.7
percent to $7,656.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
and was at $7,618 at 10:24 a.m. in  Shanghai . The metal, which
hasn’t dropped over consecutive quarters since 2008, has lost 4
percent this year after a 3.3 percent fall in the period to
December.  Workers at Antofagasta and Iquique ports in northern  Chile 
went on strike in solidarity with a stoppage at Angamos, the
main northern harbor for Codelco, the world’s largest producing
company. Codelco is seeking other ports to export cathode.  “The strikes offer some temporary support,” Zhang
Tianfeng, an analyst at Dongxing Futures Co., said from Shanghai.
“Looking forward, how the  crisis in Cyprus  unfolds will provide
clues in terms of whether copper can stand firm at this level.”  Banks in Cyprus, which averted a default this week after an
international bailout, will open their doors to customers today
for the first time in almost two weeks, with new  capital
controls  in effect.  Copper has dropped this quarter even amid signs that growth
is recovering the U.S. as stockpiles tracked by the LME have
surged. Holdings reached 567,900 tons yesterday, 77 percent
higher since December, and the highest level since 2003.  Copper for July delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
traded little changed at 55,610  yuan  ($8,948) a ton, while the
May contract on the Comex gained 0.2 percent to $3.4485 a pound.  On the LME, aluminum, lead and zinc climbed after falling
to the lowest levels since November yesterday, while nickel
declined.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
