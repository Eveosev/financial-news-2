Wheat traded near a five-week high
as freezing weather threatened the winter crop in the U.S., the
world’s largest shipper.  Wheat for May delivery was little changed at $7.375 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 10:37 a.m. Singapore
time after touching $7.4075 yesterday, the highest level for a
most-active contract since Feb. 21. Prices are up 3.2 percent
this month, paring a quarterly decline to 5.2 percent.  Temperatures averaged well below normal in the central and
southern plains, and freezing conditions may have damaged the
crop in the Southern Plains, DTN said in a report yesterday.  “Talk that the recent cold snap in the U.S. Southern
Plains will cut yield potential supported prices,”  Luke Mathews ,
a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote
in a report today.  Corn for May delivery fell 0.1 percent to $7.345 a bushel
on volume that was 40 percent below the 100-day average for that
time of day. Soybeans for delivery in the same month dropped 0.2
percent to $14.515 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
