In a  previous post , I argued that banks are inherently unstable. Then I presented  some ways  to make them -- and the rest of us -- safer. Some people think that this is the wrong objective. Risk and financial panics sound bad, the argument goes, but without them we would never invest in new technologies and infrastructure that improve our standard of living. Their counterintuitive conclusion is that distortive subsidies and devastating crises are the price we pay for civilization. Steve Randy Waldman made  this case  the best. According to him, the flaw at the heart of every bank is actually a feature that encourages more risky investment than any rational person would choose to undertake: His memorable conclusion was that "you can have opacity and an industrial economy, or you can have transparency and herd goats." Michael Pettis made a similar argument in a  recent column  for the Financial Times:  I have enormous respect for both Waldman and Pettis, but I think they may be overstating the case in favor of the status quo. Yes, the U.S.'s 19th century railway boom was made possible by reckless loans that were rarely repaid. But the most innovative firms -- particularly those in information technology and pharmaceuticals -- are allergic to debt and prefer to fund their risky investments with equity and retained earnings. The banks and "shadow banks" that fund themselves with short-term debt have proven to be much better at enabling speculative trading, leveraged buyouts, and real-estate bubbles than investments that actually improve our standard of living. It isn't obvious that much will be lost if nonfinancial companies and regular people no longer funded these activities with their liquid savings. (Matthew C.
