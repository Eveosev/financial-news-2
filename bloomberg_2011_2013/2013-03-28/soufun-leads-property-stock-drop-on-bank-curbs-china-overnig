Chinese equities  retreated in New
York, capping their first slump in three quarters, on concern
new limits on wealth-management products will reduce bank
lending to real estate companies.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. slipped 0.7 percent to 92.2
yesterday, for a 7 percent decline this quarter.  SouFun Holdings
Ltd. (SFUN) , China’s biggest real estate information website, and
property agent  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ)  both dropped the most
in two weeks.  China Life Insurance Co. (LFC)  slid 3.8 percent, while
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. traded at the
widest discount to its  Hong Kong  stock in a week.  China, which tightened restrictions on the  property market 
March 1, told banks yesterday to limit investments of client
money in debt that isn’t publicly traded to 35 percent of funds
raised from the sale of wealth-management products in a bid to
cut violations of lending limits. The products may have climbed
to 13 trillion  yuan  ($2.1 trillion) at the end of 2012, from 8.5
trillion yuan in 2011, according to Fitch Ratings.  “These funding curbs may be more important than previous
curbs on the property sector, if the money really isn’t
available that’s when demand starts to fall apart,”  Michael Shaoul , the chairman of Marketfield Asset Management LLC, which
oversees more than $6 billion, said by phone in New York. “At
some point in 2013 we’ll exceed the lows of 2012,” he said,
referring to Chinese stock indexes.  ETF Drops  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., slipped 1.1 percent to $36.93
in New York, bringing its decline over the past three months to
8.7 percent, the biggest slump in six quarters. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added 0.4 percent to 1,569.19, boosting its
2013 jump to 10 percent. U.S. markets are closed for a holiday
today.  E-House, based in Beijing, plunged 3.5 percent to $4.65 in
 New York , the steepest one-day slump since March 13. SouFun,
also based in Beijing, slid 3 percent to $26.21, extending its
monthly loss to 2.4 percent. E-House gained 13 percent this
quarter, while SouFun added 4.8 percent.  The curbs on banks will hurt not only the real estate
sector, which is partly financed by lending through wealth-
management products, but also the wider economy, according to
Marketfield’s Shaoul. China’s  economy  emerged from a seven-
quarter slowdown in the last three months of 2012, when gross
domestic product rose 7.9 percent.  ‘Real Pressure’  “The whole Chinese economy has become much more credit
driven over the last 18 months or so,” Shaoul said. “The real
estate sector has become a big part of the Chinese economy. If
the authorities really start to constrain liquidity in the one
strong part the economy, overall you’re going to see some real
pressure.”  China  Life, the country’s biggest insurer, sank 3.8 percent
to $39.42 in New York yesterday, the lowest close since July 12.
The company’s American depositary receipts have lost 21 percent
this year.  Beijing-based China Life said yesterday that 2012 net
income declined 40 percent to 11.06 billion yuan ($1.8 billion)
from a year earlier. Impairment losses from equity investments
jumped 140 percent to 31.1 billion yuan last year, the company
said in a statement.  China Life’s smaller competitor Ping An Insurance (Group)
Co. reported a 3 percent jump in profit last month as higher
banking revenue helped offset a jump in investment losses. China
Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. reported a 39 percent drop in
profit for last year March 24 as investment losses more than
doubled.  ‘Soft Spot’  Semiconductor Manufacturing (981) , a chip foundry known as SMIC,
tumbled 4.3 percent to $2.92 in U.S. trading, sliding the most
since Feb. 19. The company’s ADRs, each representing 50
underlying shares in the Shanghai-based foundry, traded 1.4
percent below the Hong Kong-traded stock, the biggest discount
in five days.  SMIC’s second-quarter outlook “looks like a soft spot with
sales looking flat to slightly up off a strong first quarter,”
Credit Suisse Group AG analysts wrote in a report dated March
26. The ADRs have climbed 15 percent this quarter.  China Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH) ,  Asia ’s biggest carrier by
passenger numbers, climbed 3.1 percent to a three-week high of
$28.64 in New York. The ADRs are up 11 percent in 2013.  At least three analysts reiterated  ratings  equivalent to
buy after the Guangzhou-based company said March 26 that it
expects domestic demand to rebound in 2013 as China’s growth may
accelerate under the nation’s new leaders. The carrier’s 2012
net income was 2.62 billion yuan ($420 million), lower than the
previous year and trailing the average of nine analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg for 2.78 billion yuan.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng  China Enterprises Index dropped 1.3
percent to 10,896.22 yesterday, retreating from a two-week high.
The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares tumbled
2.8 percent to 2,236.30 yesterday, the lowest level in three
months. The gauge has lost 1.5 percent this year, while the Hang
Seng is down 4.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
