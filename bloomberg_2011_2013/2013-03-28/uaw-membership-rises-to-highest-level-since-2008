The United Auto Workers membership
rose 0.5 percent to 382,513 last year, the union’s highest since
2008 and the third consecutive gain, as U.S. automakers added
employees amid rising sales.  The UAW disclosed the 2012 figure, the largest for the
union since its membership totaled 431,037 in 2008, in an e-
mailed statement yesterday that cited a union filing with the
U.S. Labor Department. The union added 1,794 members from
380,719 in 2011.  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC
gained sales in the U.S. last year when combined they earned
$13.5 billion. While the UAW’s 2012 gain followed a 1.1 percent
increase in 2011, the UAW’s total membership is still only about
one-fourth its size in 1979, when it peaked at 1.5 million
members.  “This is the third straight year of membership growth,
which is a very positive sign for the union,” said Kristin Dziczek, director of the labor and industry group for the Center
for Automotive Research in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. “They seem to
have turned the corner after the previous five straight years of
significant declines. It’s a tough battle to get back to where
they once were, though.”  The UAW, based in Detroit, is seeking to rebuild membership
by trying to organize workers at the U.S. factories of
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  The UAW previously failed to
convince workers to join the union at Nissan as well as the U.S.
factories of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267)   Union President  UAW President  Bob King  has said the union’s future depends
on expanding membership by organizing workers at the U.S.
factories of European and Asian automakers. He failed in a
pledge to organize one of those plants in 2011.  Volkswagen has said it’s in exploratory talks concerning
possible labor union representation at a Chattanooga, Tennessee,
factory. IG Metall, the union representing most VW workers in
Germany, has encouraged the company’s workers in Chattanooga to
join the UAW.  “It’s ultimately for the workers to decide how and by whom
they want to be represented,” Markus Schlesag, a Volkswagen
spokesman, said in a telephone interview. The talks are still at
an early stage, he said.  GM’s U.S. light-vehicle sales last year increased 3.7
percent while Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford’s gained 4.7 percent
and Chrysler’s rose 21 percent. The increases for Detroit-based
GM and Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler came three years
after they reorganized in U.S.-backed bankruptcies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
