Fallout from Cyprus’s bailout may
trigger a financial crisis in Ukraine and stem capital inflows
into the former Soviet republic, Capital Economics Ltd. said.  Ukraine relies on Cyprus for about a third of its foreign
direct investment because companies channel cash through the
island for tax purposes, according to Liza Ermolenko, a London-
based emerging-markets economist. Introducing capital controls
risks disrupting those inflows, which may curb business
activity, she said today in an e-mailed note.  “Ukraine is extremely exposed if the Cypriot bailout
triggers a fresh spike in financial-market tensions,” Ermolenko
said. “Wider vulnerabilities mean the Cypriot crisis may still
be enough to tip Ukraine into a financial crisis of its own.”  Ukraine slipped into a recession in the fourth quarter as
weakening demand for commodity exports such as steel caused a
decline in industrial output. The current-account gap widened to
a record 8.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, while
FDI rose 8.7 percent to $7.8 billion.  Ukraine “is on the brink of a balance-of-payments crisis”
and GDP will probably contract 0.5 percent this year, Ermolenko
said. Its total external financing requirement over the next 12
months is about 40 percent of GDP, she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
