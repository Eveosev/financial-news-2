Veolia Environnement , Europe’s
biggest water company, sold its water and wastewater business in
 Portugal  to  Beijing Enterprises Water Group Ltd. (371)  for 95 million
euros ($121 million) to help cut debt.  The utility announced the divestment of subsidiary Veolia
Water’s CGEP operations that hold four concessionary contracts
for public water and wastewater services and serves 270,000
people mainly in northern Portugal today in a statement. The
proceeds will go fully to the group’s debt-reduction program.  Veolia announced plans this month to cut 10 percent of the
jobs at its French water division. Chief Executive Officer
Antoine Frerot is more than halfway into a two-year plan to
curtail debt and scale back global operations. Paris-based
Veolia sold 3.7 billion euros of assets in 2012 and expects to
expand that to 6 billion euros with this year’s divestments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
