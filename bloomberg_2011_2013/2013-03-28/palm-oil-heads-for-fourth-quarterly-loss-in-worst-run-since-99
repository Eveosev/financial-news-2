Palm oil declined to head for a
fourth quarterly loss on concern that demand for the most-
consumed edible oil will weaken as  Europe ’s debt crisis drags on.  The contract for delivery in June lost as much as 1.5
percent to 2,411 ringgit ($777) a metric ton, the lowest level
since March 19, on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange in Kuala
Lumpur. Most-active prices traded at 2,420 ringgit at the midday
break, 0.7 percent lower this year. A fourth quarterly loss
would be the worst streak since 1999.  Cyprus’s banks reopen today for the first time in almost
two weeks, with new rules curbing customers’ access to cash
after a bailout this week probably averted a financial collapse.
Europe is the largest buyer of palm after India and  China , U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. The region’s economy will
contract for a second straight year in 2013, according to the
median of analysts’ forecasts tracked by Bloomberg.  Global market concerns “over the possible impact of
capital controls in Cyprus have downward pressure on crude palm
oil,” said Sim Han Qiang, an investment analyst at  Phillip
Futures  in  Singapore .  Palm oil has dropped 30 percent over the past year as
supplies from Malaysia and Indonesia, the largest producers,
expanded to a record and demand fell in Europe. Stockpiles in
Malaysia reached an all-time high in December.  Refined palm oil for September delivery fell as much as 1.8
percent to 6,304  yuan  ($1,014) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, and was at 6,306 yuan. Soybean oil for delivery in the
same month lost 1 percent to 8,058 yuan a ton.  Soybean oil for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent to 50.61
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in May traded declined 0.3 percent to $14.4925 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
