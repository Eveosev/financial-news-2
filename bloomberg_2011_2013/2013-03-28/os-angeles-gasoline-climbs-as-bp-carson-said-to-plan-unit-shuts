Spot gasoline in Los Angeles
advanced against futures for the first time in three days as  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s Carson refinery in Southern California was said to be
planning two unit shutdowns for work beginning April 1.  BP’s 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson plant, the second-largest
in the state, will shut an isomerization unit and a jet treater
for planned maintenance beginning next week, a person with
direct knowledge of the schedule said today. BP will also shut
the No. 1 reformer and the mid-barrel unit later this month for
repair, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles gained
0.75 cent to a discount of 0.25 cent against gasoline futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:57 p.m. East
Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The same fuel in
San Francisco slid 1.25 cents to a premium of 5.25 cents a
gallon above futures.  The state Energy Commission said yesterday that Carbob
stockpiles had dropped for a third straight week, declining 6.2
percent to 5.47 million barrels in the seven days ended March
22, the lowest level since November. Production of the fuel
jumped 5.8 percent to 6.21 million barrels.  The fuel’s  premium  in San Francisco over Los Angeles
slipped for the first time in six days, narrowing 2 cents to 5.5
cents a gallon. San Francisco strengthened to 7.5 cents a gallon
over Los Angeles yesterday, the biggest spread since September.  Diesel Prices  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco jumped
15 cents against Nymex heating oil futures to a premium of 22.5
cents a gallon, the highest level since Sept. 11. The same fuel
in Los Angeles gained 2.5 cents to a premium of 7 cents a gallon
over futures, a seven-day high.  Distillate fuel oil inventories on the U.S. West Coast, the
PADD 5 region, declined 4.5 percent last week to 12.4 million
barrels, the lowest level since September, the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm, said yesterday.  State supplies  of CARB diesel dropped 13
percent to 2.2 million barrels, a five-week low, the state
Energy Commission said.  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  low-sulfur diesel  weakened 7.5 cents
to a premium of 10 cents a gallon as the contract rolled into
April trading against May heating oil futures. Conventional, 84-
octane  gasoline  there, which also rolled into April, rose 4
cents to a discount of 8 cents against May gasoline futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed for the
first time in seven days, dropping 17.3 cents to $20.74 a barrel
