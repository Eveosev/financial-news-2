Crude options volatility rose for
the first time in five days after sliding below 16 percent
yesterday. Oil futures climbed to a six-week high.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 16.29 percent at 2:55 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 15.97 percent yesterday.  “With higher prices, you expect to see volatility come
down, but it’s up today because we were at extreme lows,” said
Jim Colburn, a vice president and energy options broker at
Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York . “Oil markets don’t stay down
that low for long. You don’t want to be overly short vols at
these levels.”  West Texas Intermediate oil for May delivery gained 65
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $97.23 a barrel on the Nymex, the
highest settlement since Feb. 14. Prices rose a fifth day in the
longest rally this year.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $90 puts, which fell 2 cents to 8 cents a barrel on volume
of 3,104 contracts at 3:13 p.m. June $88 puts were the second-
most active, with 2,934 lots traded. They declined 4 cents to 33
cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading volume.
Calls made up 51 percent of yesterday’s trading volume of
127,393 contracts.  June $100 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 9,565 contracts changing hands. They rose 8
cents to $1.14 a barrel. May $90 puts slid 5 cents to 10 cents a
barrel on 8,605 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,314 contracts. Next were December $100 calls at 34,181 and
December $110 calls at 32,234.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
