OstChem Holding AG, owned by
Ukrainian billionaire Dmitry Firtash, resumed chemical
production at its Estonian plant as it seeks to sell fertilizers
in the European Union.  AO Nitrofert will produce 280,000 tons of ammonia and
carbamide a year, Firtash’s Group DF, which combines all his
assets, said today in an e-mailed statement. The plant will sell
fertilizers mainly to North Europe, according to the statement.  “Resuming production at our Estonian factory opens up for
us new opportunities to enter the European market, which can
consume 10 million tons,” said Boris Krasnyansky, the chief
executive officer at Group DF. “The EU market is a huge market
and we want to work there and earn there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
