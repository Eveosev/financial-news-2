The Miami Heat’s winning streak
ended at 27 games, six shy of the National Basketball
Association record, with a 101-97 loss to the Chicago Bulls.  The Heat, who lost for the first time since Feb. 1, own the
second-longest winning streak in NBA history behind the 1971-72
Los Angeles Lakers, who won 33 in a row.  “They play unbelievable basketball,”  Luol Deng , who led
the Bulls with 28 points, said in a televised interview. “We
knew how good they were. We locked in.”  LeBron James scored 32 points,  Chris Bosh  added 21 and
 Dwyane Wade  had 18 for Miami, which has the best record in the
NBA at 56-15.  The Heat trailed by 13 points in the first half last night
at Chicago’s United Center before rallying to take a 59-58 lead
late in the third quarter. Chicago, which led by one point
entering the fourth quarter, outscored the Heat 32-29 in the
final period.  Carlos Boozer  had 21 points and Jimmy Butler added 17 for
the Bulls, who improved to 39-31.  At New York’s Madison Square Garden, J.R. Smith scored 35
points and Carmelo Anthony added 22 for the Knicks (44-26) in
their 108-101 victory against the Memphis Grizzlies (47-24).
 Mike Conley  had 26 points and Jerryd Bayless added 24 points for
the Grizzlies, who trailed 69-41 at halftime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
