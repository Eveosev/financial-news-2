Corvex Management LP and Related
Cos. offered to buy  CommonWealth REIT (CWH)  for $24.50 a share, or
about $2.9 billion, and said they will pursue removing the
company’s board if a takeover bid isn’t accepted.  The proposal is a reduction from the group’s February bid
of $27 a share and follows a CommonWealth stock offering that
the investors objected to, Corvex and Related said today in a
statement. Together, they own about 9 percent of the Newton,
Massachusetts-based real estate investment trust and are its
largest shareholders.  Keith Meister’s Corvex and Related, led by Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Blau, said in a letter to the company’s board that
the offer may be reduced further if CommonWealth goes ahead with
a sale of its 56 percent stake in  Select Income REIT (SIR) , which it
spun off last year in an initial public offering. Select Income
and CommonWealth are both managed by Reit Management & Research
LLC, or RMR.  “We continue to believe that CWH is significantly
undervalued due to its obsolete externally advised management
structure and flawed corporate governance,” the New York-based
investors said in the letter. “We have unfortunately concluded
that you as a board are not prepared to independently undertake
or evaluate any such value-enhancing steps.”  Tim Bonang, a CommonWealth spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the latest offer by the
investors.  CommonWealth was little changed at $22.16 at 1:29 p.m. in
 New York  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
