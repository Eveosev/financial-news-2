Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
 Brazil ’s biggest power utility by sales, rose the most in four
months after announcing dividend payments and a plan to return
to profitability.  Preferred shares of Eletrobras, as the company is known,
surged 15 percent to 12.58 reais at 1:56 p.m. in Sao Paulo and
rose as much as 17 percent, its biggest intraday advance since
Nov. 30. The stock was the best performer on the benchmark
Bovespa index, which was little changed.  Eletrobras said in a regulatory filing after the market
closed yesterday that it will invest as much as 52.4 billion
reais ($26 billion) through 2017. Investors see the plan as a
reaction to President Dilma Rousseff’s decision last year to cut
electricity prices to contain inflation and boost the economy,
said  Pedro Galdi , the chief strategist at Sao Paulo-based
brokerage SLW Corretora, who rates the stock buy.  “The utility is also paying dividends for 2012, which is
another good sign of efforts to continue to be a company that
remunerates well,” Galdi said.  Eletrobras will pay 1.63 real per preferred stock in April,
the company said in a separate filing yesterday. Shares in the
government-run utility slumped 61 percent in 2012, while the
Bovespa advanced 7.4 percent.  Eletrobras, which reported a 6.88 billion real net loss
last year, would have had a 3.2 billion real profit if it didn’t
have to renew concession terms, Chief Financial Officer Armando
Casado de Araujo told reporters today.  At the same event, Chief Executive Officer Jose da Costa
Carvalho said about 4,500 of the company’s 27,000-person
workforce will probably accept a voluntary retirement package as
the company strives to bring down costs by 30 percent and make
distribution units profitable by 2015.  “We have to reduce our costs and fast,” he said.  The company will seek about 3 billion reais in government-
backed loans from state banks as part of the 18.5 billion reais
still needed to fund investments through 2017.  To contact the reporters on this story:
