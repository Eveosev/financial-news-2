Cheltenham Racecourse , home to the
annual jump-racing festival in southwest  England , will get a 45
million-pound ($68 million) makeover to improve the viewing
experience for spectators, the Jockey Club said.  The new development will feature a “state-of-the-art”
grandstand for 6,500 people, Jockey Club Group Chief Executive
Officer Simon Bazalgette said in an interview today. It will
replace the current block, containing private boxes, that was
built in the 1920s.  “The time is right to enhance Cheltenham, which is not
just a major racing event, it’s an important international
sports event,” Bazalgette said.  The new building will include annual members’ facilities,
general public viewing areas and private boxes as well as Royal
Box facilities. It will also feature elevated walkways and
multitier viewing of the parade ring. Subject to planning
permission, it is scheduled to be ready in time for the 2016
horse racing festival.  The  Jockey Club , the largest commercial group in British
racing, has invested more than 80 million pounds at Cheltenham
in the past three decades. The group said it has spent 155
million pounds on improving and refurbishing some of its 15
courses, including new grandstands at Aintree and Epsom Downs in
the past 10 years.  More than 235,000 people attended this month’s four-day
Cheltenham Festival, whose highlight is the Gold Cup race.  “We capped the attendance on Gold Cup day because we
didn’t think we had the facilities to match,” Bazalgette said.
“We know that if we have the facilities, there is demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
