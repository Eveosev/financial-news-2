U.S. temperatures will probably be
seasonal or above by the second week of April, breaking a cold
snap expected at the beginning of the month, according to MDA
Weather Services.  From April 7 to April 11, the West, Ohio Valley and South
may reach 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (about 2 Celsius) above
normal. Seasonal weather is forecast from the  Great Lakes  into
New England, said MDA in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  “While exact details still differ between models, all have
turned notably warmer since yesterday,” MDA said.  The U.S. heating season, when the most natural gas used,
ends with March. April is the start of a transition to warmer
weather, when more energy is used to cool, rather than heat,
homes. About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heat.  The warmup from April 7 to April 11 follows a week in which
colder air is expected to grip the East. From April 2 to April
6, temperatures may be at least 3 to 4 degrees below normal from
the Great Lakes to New England and 5 to 7 degrees lower from
Texas to the southern Atlantic coast.  The normal average temperature on April 1 in  New York City 
is 47 degrees Fahrenheit (8 Celsius), according to MDA. In
Boston, it’s 43; in  Chicago , 44; in Houston, 67; in  St. Louis ,
52; and in Burbank, California, it’s 60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
