New Zealand  cricketer Jesse Ryder
remains hospitalized in an induced coma after he was attacked
outside a bar, officials said today as police charged two men
over the assault.  Ryder is in a “stable condition in intensive care” and
still requires help with breathing following an injury to his
lungs, Heath Mills, chief executive officer for the New Zealand
Cricket Players’ Association, said in a  statement  released by
police. The effects of his head injury “cannot be fully
determined at this stage,” Mills said.  Police arrested and charged two men, aged 20 and 37, over
the assault, and they will appear in Christchurch District Court
on April 4,  New Zealand Police  said in statements on its
website.  Ryder was involved in two separate altercations outside a
bar in the suburb of Merivale on March 28, with the second
attack resulting in him receiving “significant head injuries,”
Detective Senior Sergeant Brian Archer said yesterday. The 20-
year-old who was arrested was charged in relation to the first
incident, police said today.  Ryder last played for New Zealand in February 2012 before
being stood down for a breach of team protocol involving an
incident at a bar when he responded to taunts from a patron. He
played a game for his Wellington provincial team in Christchurch
on March 27.  He is contracted to play for the Delhi Daredevils in the
Indian Premier League which begins on April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
