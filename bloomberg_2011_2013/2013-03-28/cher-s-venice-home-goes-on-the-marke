Apparently the woman's world Cher sings about doesn't include her 3-bedroom  home in Venice . The pop superstar is selling her modern abode for $1.89 million. When compared with her sprawling 6-bedroom  Malibu estate ,  Cher's 2,250-square-foot Venice home  is quite modest. While it has been remodeled with  modern features  including high ceilings, sliding glass walls and a  sleek rooftop deck , the home's biggest selling point seems to be its location at  125 Vista Pl, Venice, CA 90291 .  The house is within walking distance to shops, bars and art galleries on Venice's Main Street and Abbot Kinney Boulevard. An outdoor bamboo shower and built-in barbecue on the roof are also nice additions to the artsy-meets-chic property. Cher purchased the home in May 2010 for $1.54 million, according to property records. An  estimated monthly payment  is $6,833, assuming 20 percent down on a  30-year fixed mortgage . While the pop icon continues to make headlines for her  outrageous outfits , the release of her upcoming album has been delayed until September. She released a new single late last year and  reportedly  plans to release another track this June. The listing for the Venice home is provided by  Hilton & Hyland's Rayni Romito .
