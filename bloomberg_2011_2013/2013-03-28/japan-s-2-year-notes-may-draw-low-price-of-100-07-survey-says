Japan’s sale of 2.9 trillion yen
($30.8 billion) in two-year notes may have a lowest-accepted
price of 100.07, according to the median forecast of 12 traders
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.1 percent
notes ranged from 100.06 to 100.08, according to the survey.  Two traders said 100.06, one trader said 100.065, five said
100.07, three said 100.075, and one said 100.08.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
