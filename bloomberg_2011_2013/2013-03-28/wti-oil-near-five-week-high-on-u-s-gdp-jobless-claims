West Texas Intermediate oil climbed
for a fifth day, capping the longest rally this year, as the
U.S. economy grew at a faster pace than previously estimated in
the fourth quarter.  Prices reached a six-week high as gross domestic product
rose at a 0.4 percent annual rate, up from prior estimate of 0.1
percent, the Commerce Department reported today in Washington.
Oil  demand  in the U.S., the biggest crude-consuming country,
increased by the most since December in the seven days ended
March 22, the Energy Information Administration said yesterday.
WTI’s discount to Brent shrank to the smallest since July.  “GDP is better than earlier estimates and a strong economy
is bullish for oil,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. “It
looks like the spread will keep contracting.”  WTI for May delivery gained 65 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$97.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Feb. 14. The rally since March 21 was the
longest since Dec. 20 and brought crude’s advance for the
quarter to 5.9 percent.  The volume of all futures traded was 26 percent below the
100-day average at this time of day at 3:26 p.m. Prices
increased 3.8 percent this week, a fourth consecutive rally.
They were 5.6 percent higher this month. The market will be
closed tomorrow for Good Friday.  Brent Drops  Brent for May settlement rose 33 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
end the session at $110.02 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all contracts traded was
14 percent below the 100-day average. Prices gained 2.2 percent
this week. They fell 1.2 percent in March and 1 percent in the
quarter.  The European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI shrank $12.79
a barrel, the narrowest since June 25.  The 0.4 percent rate of economic growth in the fourth
quarter followed a 3.1 percent pace in the third, revised
Commerce Department figures showed. The slowdown was because of
the biggest slump in military spending since 1972 and a cut in
the rate of inventory building.  “GDP is better than it was,” said Kyle Cooper, director
of commodities research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “The spread
still has further room to contract. It could easily trade back
down to $5 within the next 12 to 24 months.  The U.S. accounted for 21 percent of global oil consumption
in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World
Energy.  Fuel Demand  Petroleum demand in the U.S. increased 6.2 percent to 18.9
million barrels a day, the most since Feb. 8, the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday.  Oil also gained as  OPEC  crude production slipped to a 16-
month low in March as output from Nigeria dropped to the least
in more than three years, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Output in the 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries declined 70,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to an average
30.554 million barrels a day this month from a revised 30.624
million in February, the survey of oil companies, producers and
analysts showed.  Futures fell as much as 0.3 percent in intraday trading as
more Americans than projected filed  applications  for
unemployment benefits. Jobless claims increased 16,000 to
357,000 last week, the highest level in more than a month, the
Labor Department said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
an increase to 340,000.  Economic Outlook  ‘‘Although the overwhelming evidence appears to be that
there are improvements in the economy, the picture isn’t a
robust one,” said Addison Armstrong, director of market
research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The
jobless claims took some of the support out of the market. Today
is the last trading day of the quarter and you’ve got some
profits and you probably want to take them.”  WTI may rise toward $100 after the May contract settled
above $95.55 a barrel, a key Fibonacci level, for a third day,
according to technical analysis from Bill Baruch, a senior
market strategist at Iitrader.com, a commodity-trading firm in
Chicago. The figure is the 61.8 percent retracement level from a
March 4 low of $89.79 on a three-month Fibonacci study.  The price may test $100 if it breaches $97.92, the Feb. 20
intraday high, Baruch said yesterday.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was 16.1 percent, up from 16 percent yesterday.
The figures have slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 339,489
contracts as of 3:27 p.m. local time. It totaled 458,517
contracts yesterday, 18 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.71 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
