German retail sales unexpectedly
rose for a second month in February, adding to signs the
domestic economy is returning to growth.  Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, gained
0.4 percent from January, when they surged a revised 3.0
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.
Economists forecast a decline of 0.6 percent, according to the
median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . From a year
earlier, sales dropped 2.2 percent.  Germany ’s economy,  Europe ’s largest, is weathering renewed
turbulence in the debt crisis, after inconclusive Italian
elections and a botched bailout of Cyprus roiled financial
markets. With unemployment near a two-decade low, the Bundesbank
predicts the economy will expand again in the current quarter,
after contracting 0.6 percent in the final three months of 2012.  “We see strong German consumption going forward due to the
very robust labor market,” said  Alexander Krueger , chief
economist at Bankhaus Lampe KG in Dusseldorf. “Still, even
while the growth conditions are very good at the moment, the
debt crisis keeps boiling over and that’s weighing on demand.”  The German Labor Agency will release unemployment data for
March in Nuremberg at 9.55 a.m. today. The unemployment rate is
expected to hold at 6.9 percent, according to a separate  survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
