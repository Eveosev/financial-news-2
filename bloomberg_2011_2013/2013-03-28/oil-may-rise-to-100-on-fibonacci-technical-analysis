West Texas Intermediate may rise
toward $100 after prices settled above a key Fibonacci level for
a second day, according to a technical analysis by Iitrader.com.  The May WTI contract has climbed for the past four sessions
and settled above $95.55 a barrel for the past two. That’s the
61.8 percent retracement level from a March 4 low of $89.79 on a
three-month Fibonacci study. The price may test $100 if it
breaches $97.92, the Feb. 20 intraday high, said Bill Baruch, a
senior market strategist at Iitrader.com, a Chicago commodity
trading firm.  “The $95.55 level is now the support,” Baruch said. The
$97.92 price “is where the market broke down in February, and
if we move above the level, the market will make new highs. We
are looking at $100.”  Oil for May delivery gained 24 cents to settle at a five-
week high of $96.58 yesterday on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Futures touched a three-month intraday high of $99.11
on Feb. 13. Prices last traded above $100 in September, and
crude last settled above the level in May.  A breach below the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of
$94.44 may set a bearish trend for oil, Baruch said. The
Fibonacci sequence of numbers is used by traders to predict
areas of support and resistance as markets repeat earlier
movements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
