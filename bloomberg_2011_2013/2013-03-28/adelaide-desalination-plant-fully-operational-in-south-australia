The Adelaide reverse-osmosis
desalination plant has been declared fully operational following
commissioning, capable of providing drinking water for as much
as half of the city’s needs.  “ South Australia  is the driest state on the driest
continent on Earth,” Trility Managing Director Francois Gouws
said today in a statement. The Adelaide plant “ensures South
Australians are protected from the environmental and economic
impact of protracted drought.”  AdelaideAqua Pty Ltd., a venture between Trility and
Acciona Agua SA, will operate and maintain the A$1.8 billion
($1.9 billion) plant under a 20-year contract with the South
Australian government-owned water utility SA Water. The plant
can produce up to 100 billion liters of drinking water a year.  The Adelaide facility reduces the need for severe water
restrictions and allows the state to take less water from the
Murray River, South  Australia  Premier Jay Weatherill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
