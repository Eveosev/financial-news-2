U.K.  consumer confidence  held
steady this month as households adjusted to a “new normal”
amid accelerating inflation and a sluggish economic recovery.  A sentiment index by GfK NOP Ltd. stayed at minus 26, the 
London-based group said in a report today. Economists had 
forecast a decline to minus 27, according to the median of 19 
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Still, measures of the 
outlook for the economy and personal finances both declined.  While an unchanged reading “may not seem like cause for
rejoicing, it does now begin to seem that the public’s mood has
climbed slightly out of the very deep trough it was in for
almost all of 2012,” said GfK Managing Director Nick Moon.
“What we are seeing now looks more like the new normal than a
temporary boost.”  Higher energy bills and inflation that’s outpacing wage
growth may restrict further gains in sentiment. Data yesterday
showed Britons’ disposable income fell 0.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, while clothing retailer Next Plc said on March 21 that
the coming year is likely to be “challenging.”  A measure of Britons’ outlook for the economy over the next
12 months fell 2 points to minus 27 this month, while their view
of the past year also declined, GfK said. Consumers’
expectations for their personal finances slipped 1 point to
minus 6. The gauge of the climate for making major purchases
rose 3 points to minus 23.  GfK interviewed 2,000 people from March 1 to March 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
