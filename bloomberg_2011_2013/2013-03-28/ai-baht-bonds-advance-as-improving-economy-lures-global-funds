Thailand ’s baht strengthened for a
second day and  government bonds  rose on speculation a
brightening outlook for the economy will spur global demand for
the nation’s assets.  Overseas investors bought $3.2 billion more sovereign debt
than they sold this month and pumped a net $209 million into
equities, official data show. Imports rose 5.3 percent in
February after an increase of 41 percent in January, a fifth
monthly advance, a government report today showed.  “Increasing imports show domestic demand in Thailand
remains strong and the nation’s solid outlook continues to
attract funds from overseas,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of
Rakuten Securities Inc.’s fixed-income business unit department
in  Tokyo . “Inflows are basically supporting the baht and bonds
and the trend will continue for now.”  The baht gained 0.2 percent to 29.26 per dollar as of 3:15
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency reached 29.08 on March 20, the strongest level since a
1997 devaluation sparked the Asian financial crisis. It has
rallied 5.3 percent in six months, the best performance among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Thailand’s $346 billion economy expanded 6.4 percent in
2012, outpacing growth of 5.6 percent in  Malaysia , 6.2 percent
in Indonesia and 1.3 percent in Singapore, according to official
data. The Bank of Thailand raised its 2013 expansion forecast to
4.9 percent in January from 4.6 percent in October.  One-month implied volatility in the baht, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped two basis points to 5.21 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds due June
2023 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.46
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That was the lowest
level since Nov. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
