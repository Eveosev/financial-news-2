Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross Jr. said he’s prepared to invest $1 billion more in the shipping
industry, increasing his bet on distressed transportation assets
to $2.5 billion.  “It’s within a few months of hitting the real bottom,”
Ross, the 75-year-old chief executive officer of WL Ross & Co.,
said of the shipping industry in an interview today with  Erik
Schatzker  and Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg Television’s “Market
Makers.” “We believe that by 2014 it will start to turn
around. In a lackluster economy there will be scrappage of
older, less-efficient ships and the new market will absorb these
vessels.”  Ross, whose firm oversees $9 billion, has raised more than
half of the $500 million he’s seeking for a new private-equity
fund to buy distressed shipping and other transportation assets,
a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News earlier
this month. Ross said there is room for competition as
investment firms including Blackstone Group LP,  Apollo Global
Management LLC (APO)  and  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  are seeking to invest in
transportation assets.  “We’re all in different segments and it’s a huge
industry,” he said. “There’s around $360 billion of vessels
out there, so there’s plenty of room for more than one
investor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
