The  European Central Bank  said
banks will repay 7 billion euros ($9 billion) of 3-year loans
next week.  Some 5 banks will return 3.8 billion euros borrowed in the
first of the so-called Longer Term Refinancing Operations, and 6
will repay 3.2 billion euros of the second tender, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. That takes the
total amount of money repaid early to 244.7 billion euros, or 24
percent of the amount lent.  The ECB’s 3-year loans helped prevent a credit crunch last
year as European banks shied away from  lending  in the midst of a
worsening debt crisis. With excess  liquidity  in the financial
system still around 365 billion euros, some banks are choosing
to take the option to repay the funds, offered at the average of
the ECB’s benchmark rate over their duration, early.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on March 7 that the
repayments “reflect improvements in financial-market confidence
over the last few months and receding financial-market
fragmentation,” adding that monetary policy will remain
accommodative for “as long as needed.”  The central bank still allows banks to borrow as much money
as they want against eligible collateral for periods of one
week, one month and three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
