The Bovespa index was headed for
its third monthly drop as lower commodities pushed raw-material
producers lower on concern the global recovery will falter.  Beef producer  Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3)  was the worst performer
on the gauge today after reporting a loss that was wider than
forecast. Sugar-cane processor  Cosan SA Industria e Comercio  and
farm company  Vanguarda Agro SA (VAGR3)  fell with commodities.  The Bovespa was headed for a 2.7 percent drop in March at
11:12 a.m. in  Sao Paulo  and was little changed at 55,921.04 for
the day. Forty-six stocks declined today while 22 advanced.
 Brazil ’s real was little changed at 2.0129 per dollar. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials lost 0.1
percent after a report showed jobless claims in the U.S.
increased more than forecast.  “The Bovespa is now reflecting the concern about the
outlook for the world economy,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief
strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA, said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo. “Economic data that came out in the
U.S. today were a bit worse than expected, and that’s weighing
on the market.”  Marfrig sank 6.1 percent to 8.36 reais. The company posted
a net loss of 284.2 million reais in the fourth quarter,
compared with an average estimate for an adjusted loss of 39.9
million reais among nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Cosan fell 2.9 percent to 44.82 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
