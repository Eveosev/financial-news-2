Belgium’s  budget deficit  surpassed
the European Union’s target last year as a shrinking economy
curbed tax revenue growth and taxpayer funds were used to
replenish Dexia SA’s capital following its dismantlement.  The  budget deficit  widened to 3.9 percent of gross domestic
product from 3.7 percent a year earlier, the Brussels-based
 National Bank of Belgium  said today in a statement. The
shortfall compares with the government’s own target of 2.8
percent and a limit of 3 percent under the EU’s excessive
deficit procedure.  Public debt  climbed to 99.6 percent of GDP
from 97.8 percent in 2011.  The Belgian economy shrank 0.2 percent last year, curbing
revenue from sales taxes and levies on investment income and
mortgage registrations. Federal tax receipts rose about 6.1
percent, 0.4 percent short of the amount needed to meet the
deficit target, former Finance Minister Steven Vanackere said on
Jan. 17. Primary expenditure rose 4.6 percent to a record 51.3
percent of GDP. The deficit figure also includes 2.92 billion
euros ($3.74 billion) spent on Dexia preferred stock on Dec. 31,
equivalent to about 0.77 percent of GDP.  The national bank released the figures on its website
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
