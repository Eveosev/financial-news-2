Xerox Corp. (XRX) , the printer and copier
pioneer, hired Kathryn Mikells as its chief financial officer,
choosing an executive with experience across diverse industries
as it broadens its services.  Mikells, 47, joins Xerox on May 2 from home-security
provider ADT Corp., where she was also CFO, according to a
statement yesterday. She has worked in the same post at Nalco
Holding Co., a water-treatment and energy-technology company,
and at former United Airlines parent UAL Corp.  Xerox Chief Executive Officer  Ursula Burns  is shifting away
from the traditional printing business toward services, which
make up about half of revenue today and will be two-thirds by
2017, the company has forecast. Printing is declining as
customers access more of their documents on computers and mobile
devices.  “Kathy brings to Xerox extensive experience in financial
management coupled with broad global business acumen in both
services and technology,” Burns said in the statement.  Mikells replaces Luca Maestri, who was hired in January by
Apple Inc. as its corporate controller. She’ll get a salary of
$700,000, Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox said in a separate
filing. Maestri’s salary was $650,000 in 2011, the most recent
year for which the data are available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
