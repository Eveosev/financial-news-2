Spot gasoline on the U.S.  Gulf
Coast  strengthened as the nation’s largest refinery extended
maintenance on a crude unit and coker.  Motiva Enterprises LLC will keep a delayed coker its Port
Arthur, Texas, plant shut for another week to 10 days and
expects a crude unit to be idled for at least two more weeks for
repairs, three people familiar with operations said.  The units have been down since about the middle of February
for approximately 38 days of planned work. Maintenance on the
crude unit, the smallest of three at the 600,000-barrel-a-day
refinery, is running behind schedule and no restart date has
been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  The discount for  reformulated, 84-octane gasoline  to be
blended with ethanol on the Gulf Coast shrank by 2 cents to 4.5
cents a gallon versus futures on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange at 1:57 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It’s the smallest differential since March 22.  Conventional gasoline for blending with ethanol in  Chicago 
narrowed by 2 cents to a discount of 24 cents a gallon below
Nymex futures. Implied gasoline demand in the U.S. rose 0.9
percent last week to 8.4 million barrels a day last week, the
U.S. Department of Energy reported yesterday.  “Snow is melting, people are filling their cars, and
gasoline is finding its feet,” said Steve Mosby, vice president
of supply consultant ADMO Energy LLC.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago strengthened by 3.38
cents to 8.25 cents a gallon above heating oil futures on the
Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
