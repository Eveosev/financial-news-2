Codelco, the biggest copper
producer, had a 5.1 percent drop in annual output on lower ore
grades at its aging mines in northern  Chile ’s Atacama Desert.  The century-old Chuquicamata mine posted a 20 percent
output slump, dragging down the company’s production to 1.647
million tons from 1.735 million tons in 2011, according to a
 presentation  delivered at its Santiago headquarters. Output
including Codelco’s share of the El Abra and Anglo Sur mines,
slid to 1.758 million tons from 1.796 million tons.  Chief Executive Officer Thomas Keller is spending a record
$25 billion to retain Codelco’s No.1 producer status as the
state-owned company stops mining in pits exhausted of profitable
ore and taps new areas. Overall copper content fell to 0.73
percent last year from 0.8 percent in 2011.  Codelco had capital expenditure of $4.1 billion last year
and said its Ministro Hales project is 78.5 percent complete.
The company achieved the milestone of handing over $100 billion
to the state over its history, Keller said.  A two-week strike at the Angamos port, which has spurred
protests of support at other ports in the country, has impeded
Codelco shipments, Chief Financial Officer Ivan Arriagada said.  About 30,000 tons of copper is stored at ports awaiting
shipment, he said. Industrial action at ports haven’t affected
production, the CFO said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
