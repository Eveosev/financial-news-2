The pound rose to the strongest
level in two months against the euro amid concern financial
turmoil in Cyprus will lead to a worsening of  Europe ’s debt
crisis, underpinning demand for the safety of the U.K. currency.  Sterling advanced versus all except one of its 16 major
counterparts as a government report showed Britain’s services
industries expanded in January. The Central Bank of Cyprus is
imposing capital controls including a 300-euro ($383) daily
limit on withdrawals and restrictions on transfers to accounts
outside the country to halt a capital flight. U.K. government
bonds were little changed.  “It’s very much a flight to safety,” said Shant Movsesian, a foreign-exchange strategist at 4Cast Ltd. in
London. “The U.K. is a safe haven for many. The bad news is
already out there in the U.K. but clearly the cracks that are
there in Europe are still to be seen.”  The pound gained 0.1 percent to 84.41 pence per euro at
10:38 a.m.  London  time after appreciating to 84.16 pence, the
strongest level since Jan. 24. The U.K. currency gained 0.2
percent to $1.5153.  Cyprus’s banks were shut March 16 when the European Union
presented a proposal to force losses on all depositors in
exchange for a 10 billion-euro bailout. That plan touched off
protests and political upheaval, and was rejected by the
country’s parliament. A subsequent agreement imposed larger
losses on uninsured depositors.  Services Expand  U.K. services, which account for about three quarters of
the economy, rose 0.3 percent from December, when they dropped
0.4 percent, the Office for National Statistics said. That’s the
biggest increase since August.  Sterling has gained 0.4 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro weakened 1.8 percent
and the dollar climbed 0.5 percent.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield was at 1.72 percent after
falling to 1.71 percent, the lowest level since Nov. 13. The
price of the 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 was 100.28.  U.K. government bonds returned 1 percent this quarter
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bunds gained 0.5 percent, while U.S. Treasuries were
little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
