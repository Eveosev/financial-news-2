Hearst Corp., the closely held
magazine publisher and broadcaster, said President Steven Swartz
will succeed Frank Bennack as chief executive officer.  The appointment is effective June 1, New York-based Hearst
said yesterday in a statement. Bennack, who has spent more than
50 years with the company, will continue as executive vice
chairman of the board and lead the executive committee. William R. Hearst III is chairman.  Bennack, 80, remains a trustee of the trust set up under
the will of William Randolph Hearst, the founder. He first
became CEO of the family run company in 1979, according to the
statement. He stepped down in 2002 and returned in 2008 as CEO
after his successor, Victor Ganzi, resigned.  Swartz, 51, has been with the company for more than 20
years, according to the statement. He was named president in
December after being appointed chief operating officer in March
2011, a title he still holds. Swartz serves on the board and
also is a director of two Hearst foundations. He is also a
trustee under the founder’s will.  Hearst’s interests include 15 daily and 36 weekly
newspapers, including the Houston Chronicle, San Francisco
Chronicle, San Antonio Express-News and Albany Times Union. The
company publishes Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, Elle and O,
The Oprah Magazine; and operates 29 TV stations. The company has
stakes in cable networks Lifetime, A&E, History and ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
