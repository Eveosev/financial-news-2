Rubber declined the most in a week
on concern that demand for the commodity will weaken as  Europe ’s
debt crisis is deepening and pending U.S. home sales fell.  The contract for delivery in September fell as much as 2.2
percent, the most since March 22, to 276.4 yen a kilogram
($2,936 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange and was at
276.7 yen at 10:49 a.m. Futures have lost 8.5 percent this year.  Asian stocks fell and Japanese currency strengthened as a
bailout for Cyprus and a political deadlock in  Italy  raised
concerns the region’s debt crisis is deepening. Fewer Americans
signed contracts to purchase previously owned homes in February,
indicating a pause in momentum for an industry that is helping
power the economy.  “Market players become very sensitive about Italian
political problem and Cyprus,” said Naohiro Niimura, a partner
at research company Market Risk Advisory in Tokyo. “Weak U.S.
economic data are also bearish.”  The Institute of International Finance said yesterday banks
in Portugal, Spain and Italy may come under funding pressure
after a deal earlier this week in Cyprus rescued the island’s
financial system at the expense of bank creditors.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 0.9 percent to 22,435  yuan  ($3,610) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 0.3 percent to 86.80 baht ($2.97) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
