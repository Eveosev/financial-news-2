U.K. Chief Secretary to the
Treasury  Danny Alexander  wrote to most Cabinet ministers asking
them to identify cuts of a further 10 percent of their
departmental budgets in the year starting April 2015, a
government official said.  The move is part of a process to identify how the
government will find the 11.5 billion pounds ($17.4 billion) it
has pledged to cut from spending in that year, according to the
official, who declined to be identified because the letter is
confidential. Ministers were asked to plan for about 3 billion
pounds more of reductions than are needed, the official said.  Health care, education and foreign aid will be protected
from spending cuts. The Ministry of Defence has been asked to
plan for a 1 percent rise in its equipment budget and a 5
percent reduction in other areas, according to the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
