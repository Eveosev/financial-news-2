German stocks  closed little
changed, as a late selloff pared gains on the benchmark  DAX (DAX) 
Index, amid a report that showed retail sales in the country
unexpectedly increased, while concern grew that the euro-area
debt crisis will deepen.  Bayer (BAYN)  AG, Germany’s largest drugmaker, and EON SE paced
advancing shares.  RWE AG (RWE)  snapped three days of losses after
selling its Net4Gas unit.  Wirecard (WDI)  AG jumped to its highest
price since it sold shares to the public in October 2000 as
Baader Bank advised investors to buy the stock.  The DAX rose less than 0.1 percent to 7,795.31 in
Frankfurt, paring an earlier advance of as much as 0.7 percent.
The gauge completed a monthly increase of 0.7 percent. The DAX
added 2.6 percent in the quarter as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a
budget and American jobs data beat estimates. The broader HDAX
Index added 0.2 percent today.  Retail sales in Europe’s largest economy gained 0.4 percent
last month from January, when they surged a revised 3 percent,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast a decline of 0.6 percent. German
unemployment unexpectedly rose in March, another report showed.  “In the stressful situation in Europe,  Germany  is an
island of protection,” said Jacques Porta, who helps manage
about $776 million at Ofi Gestion Privee in Paris. “It’s my
preferred market in Europe. I’m overweighting German shares
compared with other European markets.”  Cypriot Banks  In Cyprus, banks opened their doors today for the first
time in almost two weeks, with new rules curbing access to cash
preventing an initial panic to withdraw deposits. The Central
Bank of Cyprus’s capital controls include a 300-euro ($383)
daily limit on withdrawals and restrictions on transfers to
accounts outside the country.  In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed above
its record closing level.  Bayer advanced 1.6 percent to 80.47 euros, completing a 6.1
percent gain this month. A close at this price would be the
highest for the stock in two decades.  EON rose 1.3 percent to 13.62 euros. Germany’s biggest
utility plans to buy as much as 1.56 billion reais ($776
million) in shares of MPX Energia SA from billionaire  Eike
Batista  making it the largest shareholder in the Brazilian
company. Separately, the company said it sold its Hungarian gas
units for 870 million euros ($1.12 billion) including debt.  RWE Deal  RWE climbed 1.2 percent to 29.08 euros. The country’s
second-largest utility sold its Czech pipeline operator Net4Gas
to Allianz SE and Borealis Infrastructure for almost 1.6 billion
euros ($2 billion) to help curb debt.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-largest maker of  luxury
vehicles , slid 2 percent to 42.45 euros.  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW)  lost 2.6 percent to 67.31 euros. A gauge of the
automobile industry in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 1.2
percent, for the biggest decline among the 19 groups on the
gauge.  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) , Germany’s biggest solar-energy
company by market value, slid 5.6 percent to 18.67 euros. The
stock fell for a second day after SMA yesterday predicted a
“tough year” for the industry.  Wirecard climbed 3.9 percent to 21.55 euros. Baader Bank
started covering the shares of the provider of Internet-payment
and processing services with a buy rating.  “That Wirecard is the only independent electronic-payment
processing services company with a full banking license is a
clear differentiating factor from the competition,” analyst
Knut Woller wrote in a note.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  gained 2.2 percent to 27.85 euros.
The broadcasting company said 2012  revenue  rose 7.7 percent to
2.97 billion euros.  Suss MicroTec AG (SMHN)  jumped 7.2 percent to 8.91 euros for the
biggest gain since Jan. 7. The maker of equipment for the
production of microelectronic devices said it received an order
for bonding equipment. It did not disclose the financial
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
