Cypriot banks lost 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) in deposits in February amid rising uncertainty
about the country’s ability to secure a bailout.  Deposits decreased 2.2 percent from January, when they
dropped 2.1 percent, European Central Bank data show. That’s the
ninth straight decline. Cypriot deposits in February totaled
46.4 billion euros, down from 47.4 billion the previous month.  Outflows probably increased in March, when Cyprus agreed to
tax deposits of more than 100,000 euros and wind down  Cyprus
Popular Bank Pcl (CPB) , the country’s second biggest, with viable
assets being taken over by  Bank of Cyprus Plc , the largest
lender. Banks, which had been closed since the levy on deposits
was first proposed on March 16, are reopening today after
capital controls have been imposed.  “A catastrophe has been averted” when the country signed
on to the bailout conditions “but the impact on the Cypriot
economy is going to be huge,” UBS AG Chairman Axel Weber, a
former president of the German Bundesbank, said in an interview
yesterday. “Banks will become even more dependent on ECB
liquidity because deposits will be largely drained.”  The ECB said on March 25 it won’t stop the Cypriot central
bank from providing the island’s banking sector with emergency
funding. It had previously threatened to veto lending if a deal
that promised fresh capital and ensured the solvency of the
Mediterranean island’s banks wasn’t reached.  To contact the reporters on this story:
