Wind-power generation in  Scotland 
surged 19 percent to a record in 2012 as energy from clean
sources contributed 39 percent of the region’s total electricity
needs.  Electricity generated from renewables rose 7 percent from
2011 to more than 14,600 gigawatt-hours, the Scottish government
said today in an e-mailed statement. Nearly 39 percent of the
region’s total electricity needs came from renewables in 2012,
enough to power every home in Scotland.  Scotland wants all its electricity to come from clean
sources by 2020 and it has set an interim target for half to
come from renewables by 2015. It contributed about 35 percent of
total U.K. renewable generation last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
