 Polish airline LOT, the first
European airline to receive  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliners, is
leasing an Airbus SAS A330 to operate transatlantic flights as
the U.S. aircraft remains barred from commercial service.  The A330 is being leased from  Portugal ’s Hi Fly and will
fly for LOT from April 12 to the end of May, by which time the
Warsaw-based carrier hopes 787s will return to service, airline
spokesman Marek Klucinski said by phone. If Dreamliner
operations remain suspended, the lease can be extended, he said.  LOT has taken delivery of two of eight 787s with one
stranded in  Chicago  after its inaugural transatlantic flight and
the other parked in Warsaw. The disruption is costing LOT, which
is surviving on state aid, around $50,000 per day, Tomasz Balcerzak, chief of operations, has said.  The A330 will be used on flights from Warsaw to  New York 
and Chicago, LOT said in a statement. The aircraft, which will
be operated partly by LOT crew, can accommodate 18 passengers in
business class and 288 in economy.  LOT said it will seek compensation from Boeing for costs
associated with the 787 delay. Those negotiations will resume
once the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has decided when
the jet can return to service.  The FAA grounded the global 787 fleet after incidents
involving the aircraft’s lithium-ion battery produced by Tokyo-
based  GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  Boeing conducted a flight test to validate
a proposed battery fix on March 25 and Chief Executive Officer
Jim McNerney said today in Washington D.C. that commercial
operations would resume soon.  Boeing used a third LOT 787, which has yet to be handed
over to the carrier, for this week’s test.  To contact the reporter on this story:
