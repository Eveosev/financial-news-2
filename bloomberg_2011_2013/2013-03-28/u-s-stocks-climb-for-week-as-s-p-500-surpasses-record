U.S. stocks  rose for the week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a record, as data
bolstered confidence in the world’s largest economy while
concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis faded.  All  10 groups  in the  S&P 500  rallied, as health-care and
utility companies led gains. Visa Inc. surged 6.1 percent to a
record after Nomura Holdings Inc. said a shift away from cash
would help the bank-card network.  Biogen Idec  Inc. jumped 8.2
percent to an all-time high after winning U.S. approval for its
first multiple sclerosis pill. McGraw-Hill Cos. rose 7.7 percent
after announcing a $500 million share buyback.  The S&P 500 added 0.8 percent to 1,569.19 for the week,
surpassing the previous all-time high set in October 2007 of
1,565.15. The benchmark index ended the first quarter with a
gain of 10 percent, its best performance in a year. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  jumped 66.51 points, or 0.5 percent, to
14,578.54, also a record. U.S. financial markets had a shortened
week because of the Good Friday holiday.  “More than anything, economic news hasn’t been as bad as a
lot of people have predicted,” Thomas Garcia, head of equity
trading at  Santa Fe , New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment
Management Inc., said by telephone. His firm oversees about $80
billion. “The market has just been resilient. Cyprus tried to
take down the market. There have been reasons for the market to
go down and we sit here at all-time highs.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX) ’s advance above its record marks the recovery
from a  bear market  that wiped more than $10 trillion of value
from the world’s largest stock market. The measure has surged
132 percent from its March 2009 low as  profits  expand for a
third straight year and the  Federal Reserve  commits to
continuing its unprecedented monetary stimulus.  Economic Data  A 5.7 percent jump in durable goods orders and the biggest
increase since 2006 for the S&P/Case-Shiller index of  home
prices  were among the latest data points to fuel optimism in the
economy. Gross domestic product rose at a 0.4 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, up from a 0.1 percent prior
estimate, revised Commerce Department figures showed.  Concern over Cyprus eased after the nation’s banks reopened
for the first time in almost two weeks on March 28. Earlier in
the week, the Mediterranean island’s struggles to stave off
financial collapse reignited speculation Europe’s debt crisis
may intensify.  The  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against claims,
slumped 6.4 percent during the week to 12.70. The gauge, known
as the VIX, surged 20 percent in the prior week amid concern
about Europe. It is down 30 percent for the year.  Quarter’s End  “There’s no doubt that a new record high will continue to
give the bulls something to hang their hats on,” Jordan Irving,
who helps oversee $175 million at Irving Magee Investment
Management in Philadelphia, said by phone. “People are just
sort of letting things ride coming into the quarter’s end, and
we’ll see next week whether or not the market is really as
resilient as it appears to be in terms of shrugging off all this
news coming out of Europe.”  Health-care stocks posted the biggest advance out of 10 S&P
500 groups, increasing 2.4 percent. UnitedHealth Group Inc.
rallied 5.1 percent to $57.21. The biggest U.S. medical insurer
and Humana Inc. rose after congressional researchers said the
Medicare program has the authority to raise payments to
insurers. Humana added 3 percent to $69.11.  Utility and consumer-staple companies also rose, climbing
2.4 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.  Intel Corp . rose 2.4 percent to $21.84. The world’s largest
chipmaker is making progress in talks with Time Warner Inc.,  NBC
Universal  and Viacom Inc. to obtain TV shows and films for a
first-of-its-kind online pay-TV service, according to people
with knowledge of the situation.  Global Shift  Visa surged 6.1 percent to $169.84, the highest price since
the company’s March 2008 initial public offering. Nomura
analysts Bill Carcache and Tulu Yunus said a long-term global
shift away from cash would help Visa at the expense of Western
Union Co.  Biogen Idec jumped 8.2 percent to an all-time high of
$192.62. The fourth-largest U.S. biotechnology company by market
value won marketing approval from the  Food and Drug
Administration  for the multiple sclerosis pill Tecfidera. The
drug may generate $3.25 billion in annual revenue by 2017 for
the Weston, Massachusetts-based company, according to the
average of eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  McGraw-Hill rose 7.7 percent to $52.08. The company said
some of the proceeds from the $2.4 billion sale of its education
division to Apollo Global Management LLC will be used to fund a
$500 million accelerated  share repurchase .  Financial stocks had the worst performance out of 10 S&P
500 groups, increasing 0.1 percent. The KBW Bank Index lost 0.6
percent, declining for the second straight week. Bank of America
Corp., the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, tumbled 3 percent
to $12.18 for the  biggest drop in the Dow . JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
the biggest bank, erased 2.7 percent to $47.46.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. slid 8.4 percent to $19.01
for the biggest drop in the S&P 500. The largest U.S. iron-ore
miner tumbled after analysts at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse
Group AG said new supply in  North America  may reduce the
commodity’s price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
