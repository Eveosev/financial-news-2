Treasuries were little changed
after the U.S. auctioned $29 billion in seven-year notes to
weaker-than average demand.  The securities drew a  yield  of 1.248 percent, compared with
an average forecast of 1.243 percent in a Bloomberg News survey
of six of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. The  bid-to-
cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
amount of securities offered, was 2.56, versus an average of
2.68 at the past 10 sales. Treasuries are heading for a third
week of gains amid concern Cyprus’s banking turmoil will worsen
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “Considering the fact that we’ve rallied as much as we have
coming into the auction and it’s a short day, if it tails, it’s
still a success,” Larry Milstein, managing director in New York
of government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., said before
the sale. An auction tail is the amount of yield in excess of
where the security was trading before the sale.  The  current  seven-year note yield rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.22 percent at 11:36 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched 1.18
percent earlier, the lowest level since Jan. 2.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note was little changed
at 1.85 percent. It touched 1.83 percent earlier, the lowest
level since March 4.  The New York-based Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association has recommended that Treasuries trading end
at 2 p.m. in advance of the Good Friday holiday and stay closed
tomorrow.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 35.5 percent of the notes, compared
with 33.4 percent in February and an average of 39.3 percent at
the past 10 sales.  Direct Bidders  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.5 percent of
the notes, compared with the 10-auction average of 16.3 percent.  Seven-year notes have returned 0.3 percent this year,
compared with a 0.2 percent decline by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-
year securities gained 3.9 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall advanced 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the last of three note sales this week.
The government sold $35 billion in five-year securities
yesterday at a yield of 0.76 percent. The March 26 auction of
$35 billion in two-year debt drew a yield of 0.255 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
