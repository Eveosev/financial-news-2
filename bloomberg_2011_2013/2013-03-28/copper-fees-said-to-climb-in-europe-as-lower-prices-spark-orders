The premium copper buyers are being
asked to pay in  Europe  climbed this month as low prices helped
spur demand, according to four traders with direct knowledge of
the market.  The fee is $90 a metric ton, according to the midpoint of
the estimates from the traders, who asked not to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media. The
midpoint fee was $60 a ton in the first week of March.  Copper prices have dropped 3.8 percent this year on the
London Metal Exchange. Some buyers are interested now also
because of potential supply restrictions due to a ports strike
in  Chile , the world’s largest producer, the traders said. Supply
of scrap metal is already limited, they said.  The range for the fee is $80 to $100 a ton, compared with
$50 to $90 a ton three weeks ago. The premium is added to the
price of copper cathode, a form of refined metal, for immediate
delivery on the LME at Rotterdam and includes insurance and
shipping costs.  Buyers are being asked to pay $80 to $85 a ton for copper
warrants, certificates giving the bearer ownership of metal
stored in LME-approved warehouses in Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest
port, according to four traders. The fee, which doesn’t cover
insurance or shipping, was $65 to $70 a ton in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
