Chile ’s peso reached a two-week
high as a reopening of banks in Cyprus buoyed the global
economic outlook and eased demand for a refuge in the dollar.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 472.25 per U.S. dollar
at 10:39 a.m. in Santiago after touching 471.50, its strongest
intraday level since March 15. The currency extended its
quarterly rally to 1.5 percent.  “The reopening of banks hasn’t been chaotic in Cyprus, and
that is causing people who sought refuge in the dollar to reduce
their positions,” Alexis Osses, an analyst at XDirect Chile
Ltda., said in a phone interview.  Volatility in the Chilean peso is at the lowest level in 15
years as it trades in a narrowing range. Speculation that the
central bank will intervene to weaken the currency has prevented
it from appreciating while faster-than-forecast economic growth
and stable interest rates warded off declines.  The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.2819 today as banks in
Cyprus reopened with a 300-euro daily limit for cash withdrawals
after being closed since March 16. The price of copper, Chile’s
main export, fell 0.2 percent in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
