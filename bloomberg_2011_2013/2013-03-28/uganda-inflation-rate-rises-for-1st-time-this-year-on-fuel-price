Uganda ’s inflation accelerated in
March for the first time since December as fuel prices
increased, stifling the prospect of interest-rate cuts.  Inflation quickened to 4 percent from a revised 3.5 percent
in February, Vincent Nusbuga Musoke, principal statistician at
the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, told reporters today in the
capital, Kampala. Prices rose 0.9 percent in the month, he said.  Acceleration in inflation may force the central bank to
keep its benchmark rate at 12 percent, where it has remained
since December, said Arthur Nsiko, an economist at the Kampala-
based research company African Alliance Uganda Ltd. An increase
in rates would go against the bank’s efforts to stimulate growth
by boosting lending, he said.  The prices of gasoline, diesel, kerosene, gas and firewood
rose in the month, the bureau said without giving details. Food
prices declined 0.9 percent from a year earlier, compared with a
2 percent drop in February.  Underlying inflation, which excludes food crops, fuel,
electricity and metered water, quickened to 6.8 percent in March
from a revised 5.6 percent in February, the bureau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
