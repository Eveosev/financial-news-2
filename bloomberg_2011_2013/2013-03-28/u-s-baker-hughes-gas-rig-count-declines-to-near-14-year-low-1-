The number of gas rigs in the U.S.
declined to near a 14-year low, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Gas rigs dropped by 29 to 389, while  oil rigs  climbed by 30
to 1,354 this week, data posted on Baker Hughes’ website show.
Total energy rigs increased by two to 1,748, the field-services
company based in Houston said. The rig-count figures were
released a day early this week because of the Good Friday
observance tomorrow.  The U.S.  gas rig count  has shrunk to almost a fourth of its
peak in September 2008 as a glut of domestic supplies pushed
prices of the fuel down to 10-year lows and drove energy
producers toward more profitable oil and liquids-rich plays.
Improvements in drilling technologies have also weakened total
demand for additional rigs in the U.S.  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , the world’s largest oil-services
company, said last week that first-quarter drilling in  North
America  “is coming below expectations,” with customers
reactivating fewer rigs than initially planned.  “The outlook for rig activity and pricing levels in North
America continues to be uncertain,” Paal Kibsgaard, the
Houston-based company’s chief executive officer, said at the
March 18 Howard Weil Conference in  New Orleans .  Oil and gas producers’ capital expenditures will be
“little changed” this year from 2012, according to a Bloomberg
Industries analysis of 44 operators’ plans. Of the 44, 21
companies plan to increase investments by an average of 13
percent, and 17 are cutting spending by about 22 percent, the
analysis shows. Six will spend about the same as last year.  Gas Supplies  Gas stockpiles  were 3.5 percent above the five-year average
last week, according to the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm. Supplies fell 5.1
percent to 1.781 trillion cubic feet in the seven days ended
March 22. They reached a record high of 3.929 trillion cubic
feet on Nov. 2.  Natural gas for May delivery fell 5.3 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $4.015 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:22 p.m. Futures were are up 83
percent from a year ago.  U.S. oil output  climbed  1,000 barrels a day to 7.15 million
in the week ended March 22 and, earlier this month, reached a
20-year high, according to EIA data. Stockpiles rose 3.26
million barrels to 385.9 million last week and reached a 22-year
high of 387.3 million in June.  Crude for May delivery on the Nymex rose 22 cents to $96.80
a barrel. Prices have increased 5.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
