Wheb Venture Partners LLP, a clean-
technology investor backed by Ben Goldsmith, son of late
billionaire financier James Goldsmith, bought a majority stake
in low-energy light maker Hoffmeister Leuchten GmbH.  Wheb provided growth capital to help the German company
expand in new markets and broaden its product offering, the
London-based investor said today in an e-mailed statement,
without disclosing how much it paid. Hoffmeister may also look
to buy other companies with similar expertise, it said.  “Lighting currently accounts for 20 percent of global
energy consumption, meaning that low-energy LED lighting
represents a major growth theme for  energy efficiency ,” Joerg Sperling, a partner at London-based Wheb, said in the statement.  Energy-saving lights account for about 7 percent of the
global market and this may rise to 64 percent by 2020,
representing a market of as much as $70 billion a year, Wheb
said, citing data from The Climate Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
