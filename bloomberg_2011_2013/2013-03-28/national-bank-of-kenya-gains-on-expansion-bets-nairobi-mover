National Bank of Kenya Ltd ., a
state-controlled lender, headed for its biggest gain in two
weeks on bets planned expansion and investment in technology
will boost profitability.  The shares surged as much as 9.8 percent to 22.50 shillings
before trading 7.3 percent higher at 22 shillings by 1:30 p.m.
in the capital, Nairobi, the biggest gain on a closing basis
since March 12. More than 91,000 shares traded, 1.5 times the
three-month daily average.  The lender is planning a rights offer next year to fund its
expansion, Managing Director Munir Ahmed said March 25. National
Bank plans to open as many as 15 branches 2013 and 10 in 2014.
Last year the company opened 10 outlets for a total of 60.  “Growth in the bank’s earnings will be from ongoing branch
expansion expected to attract new deposits and grow interest and
non-interest income in the medium-term,” Kestrel Capital ( East
Africa ) Ltd. said today in an e-mailed note to clients. “The
bank’s high cost base will decline in the medium-term from
investments made in upgrading operating IT software in the
year.”  Shares in National Bank plunged 10 percent on March 25
after the lender said 2012 net income fell to 729.8 million
shillings ($8.5 million) from 1.55 billion shillings a year
earlier. Total interest expenses were 3.66 billion shillings
from 1.38 billion shillings in 2011.  “National Bank provides a cheaper entry into the banking
sector for investors who are banking on correction of
earnings,” Ian Gachichio, a research analyst at Kestrel, said
in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
