Gold futures fell, capping the
longest run of quarterly declines since 2001, as banks in Cyprus
reopened, easing concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen
and curbing demand for haven assets.  Cyprus’s banks opened for the first time in almost two
weeks. The  U.S. economy  grew at a faster pace than previously
estimated in the fourth quarter, Commerce Department figures
showed today. Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by
bullion contracted 6.9 percent this quarter amid speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will rein in stimulus. Gold prices have
fallen 4.8 percent this year.  “The support that gold got from Cyprus is fading, and
there are no new reasons to buy,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “This has been a very
disappointing quarter for gold.”  Gold futures for June delivery slipped 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,595.70 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices capped a second straight quarterly drop.  Trading was 30 percent lower than the 100-day average for
this time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 1 percent to $28.323
an ounce on the Comex, extending this week’s drop to 1.3
percent. Prices lost 6.3 percent this quarter.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery retreated 0.6 percent to $1,574.60 an ounce. The
metal advanced 2.1 percent this year.  Palladium futures for June delivery slipped less than 0.1
percent to $768.25 an ounce. Prices have surged 9.2 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
