Investment AB Kinnevik (KINVA) , the
publicly traded investment vehicle of Sweden’s Stenbeck family,
rose to the highest in almost two years after its  Tele2 AB (TEL2B) 
affiliate agreed to sell Russian operations to VTB Group.  Kinnevik  jumped  as much as 5.6 percent to 157.7 kronor, the
highest intraday price since May 2011, and was trading up 5.4
percent at 11:31 a.m. in  Stockholm . The shares have gained 16
percent this year. Kinnevik owns 30.5 percent of the capital and
47.7 percent of the votes in Tele2, a Swedish wireless provider.  VTB, Russia’s second-biggest bank, agreed yesterday to
acquire Tele2’s business in the country for $2.4 billion in
cash, and to take on $1.15 billion in net debt. Tele2 is pulling
out of Russia after 12 years following the Stockholm-based
mobile operator’s failure last July to win a wireless license.  Kinnevik will use the 3.8 billion kronor ($582 million) it
receives from Tele2’s Russian disposal to reduce debt, while it
will keep a goal of spending as much as 3 billion kronor on
investments this year, the Stockholm-based  investment company 
said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
