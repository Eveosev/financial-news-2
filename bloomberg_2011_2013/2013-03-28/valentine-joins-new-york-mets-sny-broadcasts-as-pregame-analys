Former  New York  Mets manager  Bobby
Valentine  will join SNY, the official television home of the
team, as part of the network’s broadcast crew for pre- and post-
game coverage for 12 to 15 games this season.  Valentine, 62, will team with host Chris Carlin and former
Mets pitcher and lead studio analyst Bob Ojeda, beginning with
Opening Day on April 1 against the San Diego Padres.  “As a former Mets Manager, Bobby brings an insightful and
contemporary perspective to our studio coverage,” SNY executive
producer Curt Gowdy, Jr. said in a statement.  Valentine, who managed the Mets from 1996 to 2002, was
fired after one season by the Boston Red Sox in October after
leading the team to its worst record since 1965.  Valentine last month was hired as athletic director at
Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut, and also
serves as a radio analyst with NBC Sports.  He also managed the  Texas Rangers  and in Japan and was a
television analyst for ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
