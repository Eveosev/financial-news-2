The Bovespa index rose as
speculation Brazilian policy makers will delay interest-rate
increases boosted stocks that are linked to domestic demand.  Homebuilder  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  gained even after
reporting an unexpected loss in the fourth quarter as  Brazil ’s
swap rates declined. Cosmetics maker Natura Cosmeticos SA was
the best performer on the MSCI Brazil/Consumer Staples index.  The Bovespa index gained 0.3 percent to 56,225.22 at 10:26
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , paring this quarter’s rout to 7.7 percent.
The real gained 0.1 percent to 2.009 per dollar. Swap rates on
contracts due January 2015 fell 0.01 percentage point to 8.44
percent after the central bank said in a report today that
monetary policy should be conducted in a “cautious” way even
after it increased inflation forecasts for this year.  “The report from the central bank shows that the
government is not willing to sacrifice growth to tame
inflation,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco
WestLB do Brasil SA, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  Brookfield rose 1.2 percent to 2.53 reais. Natura added 0.5
percent to 48.06 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
