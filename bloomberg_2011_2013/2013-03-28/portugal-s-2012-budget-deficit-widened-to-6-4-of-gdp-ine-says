Portugal ’s budget deficit last year
widened to 6.4 percent of gross domestic product from 4.4
percent in 2011, according to the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute.  Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar indicated on March 15 that
the deficit, measured using rules set under the European Union’s
excessive deficit procedure, widened last year on one-time items
and the EU’s statistics office’s ruling that revenue from the
sale of airport operator ANA-Aeroportos de Portugal SA couldn’t
be factored in.  Public debt will decrease to 122.4 percent of GDP this year
from 123.6 percent in 2012, the INE said in an e-mailed
statement on the European Union’s excessive-deficit procedure.
Debt was 108.3 percent of GDP in 2011.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
unemployment and lower demand from European trading partners as
he raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($100
billion) aid program from the euro area and the  International
Monetary Fund . The government on March 15 announced wider
deficit targets as it forecast the economy will shrink twice as
much as previously estimated this year.  The government targets a deficit of 5.5 percent in 2013, 4
percent in 2014 and 2.5 percent gap, below the EU limit, in
2015. It forecasts debt will peak at 123.7 percent of GDP in
2014.  EU officials last year had already given Portugal more time
to narrow its budget gap after  tax revenue  missed forecasts.
Gaspar on Oct. 3 announced an “enormous” increase in taxes.
The government also plans to cut spending by about 4 billion
euros through 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
