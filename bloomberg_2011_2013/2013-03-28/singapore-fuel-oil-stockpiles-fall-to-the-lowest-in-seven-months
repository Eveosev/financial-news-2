Singapore â€™s stockpiles of  fuel oil 
fell to the lowest level in more than seven months, according to
data from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue, dropped 7.4 percent to
17.1 million barrels in the week ended yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. This
category excludes bitumen. Supply is the lowest since Aug. 22.  Supplies of  middle distillates  such as gasoil and kerosene
rose 9.2 percent to 10.06 million barrels, the data showed.
Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, reformate and
gasoline declined 3.7 percent to 10.67 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, IE Singapore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
