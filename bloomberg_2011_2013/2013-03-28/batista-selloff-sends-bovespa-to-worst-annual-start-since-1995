The Bovespa index is posting its
worst start to a year since 1995 as billionaire  Eike Batista ’s
companies plunged, leading a tumble in commodity producers, amid
concern they’re losing access to the financing they need.  Batista’s iron-ore producer  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) 
and oil company  OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3)  were the
biggest  losers  on the gauge in the first quarter as each fell
more than 47 percent.  Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s biggest iron-ore
producer, had its biggest quarterly decline since the three
months ended in June 2010 as prices for steel fell.  The Bovespa dropped 7.5 percent from January through March
in Sao Paulo, the biggest first-quarter decline since a 32
percent plunge at the beginning of 1995, when the central bank
increased borrowing costs to curb hyperinflation. Brazil’s
benchmark  index , which rose 0.6 percent to 56,352.09 today, is
the fifth-worst performer this year among 94 major equity gauges
tracked by Bloomberg.  “It hasn’t been a good quarter for the stock market for a
lot of different reasons, such as the weak performance by OGX
and other companies owned by Eike,” Joao Pedro Brugger, who
helps oversee 220 million reais at Leme Investimentos Ltda.,
said in a phone interview from Florianopolis, Brazil. “It’s
hard to be optimistic about the  Bovespa. (IBOV) ”  MMX fell 4.7 percent to 2.21 reais today, extending its
quarterly decline to 50 percent. OGX lost 3.3 percent to 2.31
reais, extending its quarterly slump to 47 percent. Shares in
Batista’s public companies declined as much as 85 percent in the
past year after OGX cut oil output targets, erasing more than
$25 billion of his personal fortune.  Batista’s Slump  The Brazilian billionaire is giving up control of power
generator  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  after shares slumped 27 percent in the
past year. EON SE, Germany’s biggest utility, will share
management decisions with Batista after it acquires 25 percent
of MPX’s shares from him for as much as 11 reais each, or a
total of 1.56 billion reais, according to a statement today from
the Rio de Janeiro-based company.  Vale dropped 1.2 percent to 33.24 reais, extending its
quarterly decline to 19 percent, the biggest since a 23 percent
plunge in the second quarter of 2010.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials lost
0.4 percent after a report showed jobless claims in the U.S.
increased more than forecast. The real fell 0.5 percent to
2.0217 per dollar.  Marfrig Declines  Beef producer  Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3)  was the worst performer
on the gauge today after reporting a loss that was wider than
forecast. Shares sank 5.2 percent to 8.44 reais after the
company posted a  net loss  of 284.2 million reais in the fourth
quarter, compared with an average estimate for an adjusted loss
of 39.9 million reais among nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Some consumer stocks gained today after data from the
national statistics agency showed that Brazil’s unemployment
rate increased less than economists forecast in February.  Cia.
Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar , the country’s
biggest retailer, climbed 1.1 percent to 106.81 reais.  Lojas
Americanas SA (LAME4)  added 0.3 percent to 17.40 reais.  While the job market is tight, investors are still worried
about the outlook for the economy after growth slowed in 2012
for a second straight year to 0.9 percent.  “Growth last year was ridiculous, so everyone is waiting
for some hard evidence that things are really going to be better
this year,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco
WestLB do Brasil SA, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Eletrobras Gains  Power utility  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  rallied 16
percent to 12.70 reais today, the most in four months, after
announcing dividend payments and a plan to return to
profitability.  The Bovespa has retreated 11 percent from this year’s high
on Jan. 3 amid concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profits in industries including utilities and energy.
The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  of shares in Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and China
has lost 6.5 percent over the same period.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.4 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.8 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The Bovespa gained 7.4 percent in 2012.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 6.85 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.56 billion reais this year
through March 26, according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
