Northland Power Inc. (NPI) , a Canadian
power-generation company, sold a 50 percent stake in a wind
energy project that’s under development in Ontario,  Canada , to
two native groups.  The Aamjiwnaang and Bkejwanong First Nations acquired the
interest in the company’s Grand Bend Wind Farm, which will
consist of as many as 48 2.3-megawatt  Siemens AG (SIE)  wind turbines,
Toronto-based Northland said today in a statement. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  The Ontario Power Authority agreed to buy Grand Bend’s
output under a 20-year contract that pays 13.5 Canadian cents
(13.3 cents) a kilowatt-hour, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The wind farm is expected to cost C$385 million,
Gordon Potts, Northland’s business development director, said by
e-mail.  “We are seeking to put forth a new development model
thinking out of the box that will maximize the economic benefit
to the First Nation for future generations to come,”
Aamjiwnaang First Nation Chief Chris Plain said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
