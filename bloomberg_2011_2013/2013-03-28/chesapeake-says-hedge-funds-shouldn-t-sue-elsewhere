Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  said  hedge
funds  asking to withdraw from its dispute with  Bank of New York
Mellon  Corp. over the redemption of bonds shouldn’t be allowed
to pursue any other litigation if they do so.  “Such a condition will avoid the possibility, however
remote, of pointless duplication,” Richard Ziegler, an attorney
for the company, said in a letter yesterday to U.S. District
Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan.  Chesapeake and indenture trustee BNY Mellon are scheduled
to face off at trial beginning April 23 over the gas producer’s
disputed claim it met a deadline to redeem $1.3 billion in bonds
early at par, or 100 cents on the dollar. The hedge funds, which
had earlier been allowed to intervene in the case, said March 25
their withdrawal would reduce the number of parties involved.  Chesapeake, the second-biggest  natural gas producer  in the
U.S., issued the early redemption notice on March 15. A week
earlier, the Oklahoma City-based company sued  BNY Mellon ,
seeking a court order that it had until that date to issue the
notice and avoid making a $400 million “make whole” payment to
investors.  The case is Chesapeake Energy Corp. v. Bank of New York
Mellon Trust Co., 13-cv-01582, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
