Brazil’s real climbed to a one-week
high after the central bank raised its inflation forecasts,
spurring speculation that policy makers will allow the currency
to strengthen to curb price increases.  The currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0083 per dollar
at 10:10 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the strongest level on a closing
basis since March 20. The real extended its quarterly advance to
2.2 percent. Swap rates due in January 2014 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.73 percent.  “The report shows that the central bank is more concerned
with inflation,” Gustavo Rangel, the Latin America chief
economist at ING Bank NV, said in a phone interview from London.  The central bank raised its market scenario forecast for
inflation in 2013 to 5.8 percent from 4.9 percent and increased
its reference scenario inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from
4.8 percent.  The real rose yesterday for the first time in seven days
after the central bank sold currency swaps to limit its decline.
The intervention was the first since March 11, when the central
bank sold reverse currency swaps to weaken the real.  President Dilma Rousseff said yesterday in South Africa
that anti-inflation policies shouldn’t sacrifice growth, fueling
speculation that the government will try to control price
increases by allowing currency appreciation while putting off
projected borrowing cost increases. She later reiterated the
government’s commitment to curbing inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
