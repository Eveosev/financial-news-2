Canadian stocks fell, extending a
monthly decline, as commodity shares slumped amid lower gold
prices and an unexpected rise in U.S. jobless claims.  Novagold Resources Inc. and Alacer Gold Corp. fell at least
2.4 percent as gold prices slid. Financial firms declined with
Bank of  Nova Scotia  falling 0.9 percent and Royal Bank of Canada
dropping 0.8 percent. BlackBerry gained 2.5 percent after the
smartphone maker’s fourth-quarter earnings beat analysts’
estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 33.55
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,666.10 at 10:43 a.m. in Toronto.
The S&P/TSX has fallen 1.2 percent in March.  First-time jobless claims in the U.S. rose by 16,000 to
357,000 in the week ended March 23, the highest level in more
than a month, Labor Department data showed today. The increase
halted recent progress in the labor market.  Canada’s economy grew at a faster-than-estimated pace in
January on gains by manufacturers, suggesting it may be picking
up some speed after ending last year with the slowest growth
since the recession. Output increased 0.2 percent, following a
0.2 percent decline in December,  Statistics Canada  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
