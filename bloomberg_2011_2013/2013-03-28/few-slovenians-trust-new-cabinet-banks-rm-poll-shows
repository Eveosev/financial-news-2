One in three Slovenians trust the
new government of Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek, while even
fewer have faith in the nation’s banks, which are at the center
of concern the country may be forced to seek a bailout.  Bratusek’s week-old Cabinet was trusted by 31.6 percent of
respondents to a survey conducted by RM Plus. Twenty percent
trust banks, including Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and  Nova
Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d. The survey was carried among 700
people between March 22-25 with a 3.5 percent margin of error
and published in the Maribor-based  Vecer newspaper  today.  Slovenia’s government pledged to continue with austerity
measures that have failed to stem a rise in bond yields to
record highs as investors worry the Alpine nation will follow
Cyprus as the next euro-region country to require a bailout.  European Union officials are striving to contain a debt
crisis that prompted Cyprus to join  Greece ,  Portugal , Ireland
and Spain in agreeing on a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
