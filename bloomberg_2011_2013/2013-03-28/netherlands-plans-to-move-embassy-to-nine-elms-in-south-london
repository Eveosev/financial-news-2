The Dutch government will move its
U.K. embassy to a site in the Nine Elms district of south
 London , according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc., the broker that’s
acting as its adviser.  The diplomatic mission will be relocated from Hyde Park
Gate to a building that will be constructed in Nine Elms in the
borough of Wandsworth, Helen Basil, a Cushman & Wakefield
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The property at 38 Hyde Park Gate will be sold, Dutch
embassy press attache Weijer Losecaat Vermeer said by telephone.
He said the location of the new embassy hasn’t been decided.  The U.S. government is relocating its embassy from
Grosvenor Square in London’s West End to Nine Elms, close to the
Battersea Power Station, where a new diplomatic quarter is
growing. The Chinese government is in talks to move its embassy
to a site neighboring the planned U.S. embassy, Property Week
reported on March 22.  The Evening Standard reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
