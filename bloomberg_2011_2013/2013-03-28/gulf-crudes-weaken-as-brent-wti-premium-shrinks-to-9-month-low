Spot U.S. Gulf crudes weakened
against futures as the spread between U.S. and European
benchmark crudes narrowed to the least in almost nine months.  Brent’s premium to West Texas Intermediate narrowed to as
little as $12.48 a barrel, the smallest intraday level since
July 5. Gulf crudes compete for space in U.S.  Gulf Coast 
refineries with foreign oils priced against Brent.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI fell 50 cents to
$15.75 a barrel at 2:07 p.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. LLS is the light, sweet benchmark on the
Gulf Coast.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened 50 cents to a premium of
$16.75. HLS averaged a 59-cent-a-barrel  premium  over LLS in
March, the highest for any month since June.  Mars Blend was unchanged at a premium of $11.75 a barrel
against WTI. Poseidon crude weakened by 15 cents to an $11.50-a-
barrel premium.  Southern Green Canyon weakened 25 cents to a premium of $10
a barrel.  Thunder Horse  weakened by 30 cents to $14 a barrel
more than the U.S. benchmark.  In Canada, Syncrude strengthened by $1 to an $8.25-a-barrel
premium to WTI. Western  Canada  Select, a blend of heavy crude
from  Alberta , narrowed its discount by 90 cents, to $14.35 a
barrel below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
