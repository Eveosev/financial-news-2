Cattle rallied to a two-week high
on signs of increasing demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices were
little changed.  Beef-export sales totaled 17,340 metric tons (38.2 million
pounds) in the week ended March 21, 29 percent more than the
four-week average, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed
today. The domestic feedlot herd totaled 10.857 million head as
of March 1, down 7 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said in
a report on March 22.  “Packers are in a position where they need to buy
cattle,”  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures Inc.
in  Oklahoma City , said by telephone. “They think demand is
going to show up. Our supplies are still very tight.”  Cattle futures for June delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
$1.24 a pound at 10:03 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after touching $1.24075, the highest for a most-active contract
since March 13.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement rose 1.1 percent
to $1.437 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for June settlement were little changed, down
less than 0.1 percent at 90.65 cents a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
