Morgan Stanley gave Colm Kelleher
and  Greg Fleming , the leaders of its two businesses,
compensation packages of $8.6 million each for 2012, a decline
of 7 percent from a year earlier.  Kelleher, president of the investment banking and trading
division, received $2.41 million of deferred cash in addition to
$2.41 million of  options , the New York-based firm said yesterday
in a filing. Fleming, who runs the brokerage and asset-
management unit, was awarded $2.43 million of deferred cash and
$2.43 million of options. Both men got a $3 million long-term
incentive award in addition to their salaries.  Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income trading unit lost market
share in 2012 as clients shied away from trading with the bank
during a credit-rating review by Moody’s Investors Service in
the second quarter. The brokerage division posted a 12 percent
pretax margin, below Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman ’s
long-term goal of 20 percent.  Still, the firm’s shares jumped 26 percent last year and
profitability improved, excluding accounting charges related to
its own debt. Kelleher, 55, won out over rival Paul J. Taubman
to lead the investment bank, and met goals for reducing risk-
weighted assets in fixed-income trading a year ahead of
schedule. Fleming, 50, boosted the brokerage’s profit margin in
the fourth quarter above his target for the middle of 2013.  “I am proud of the work we have done to lay a strong
foundation for Morgan Stanley’s future,” Gorman wrote in his
 annual letter  to shareholders. “While we sometimes wish that
markets were faster to recognize our progress, we are pleased
that equity investors appear to have taken notice of our
momentum.”  Almost Doubling  Gorman, 54, received a package of $9.75 million -- a 7.1
percent decrease from 2011 -- that included a $3.75 million
long-term incentive disclosed in January. His salary is almost
doubling this year to $1.5 million from $800,000 in 2012.  Gorman’s pay, excluding the long-term incentive, was 40
percent below his target for the year, the firm said in a
presentation urging shareholders to approve the pay packages in
an advisory vote. The board’s compensation committee took into
account the firm’s “subpar” financial performance and its
“significant strategic progress” in setting the awards,
according to the presentation.  Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat received $8 million of
total compensation for 2012, compared with $8.75 million a year
earlier. Porat, 55, has informed the White House that she’s no
longer interested in serving as deputy secretary of the U.S.
Treasury Department after being a candidate for the role, people
familiar with the matter said.  Annual Savings  Taubman, who has announced plans to leave the firm later
this year, also received $8.6 million. He got the same breakdown
of awards as Fleming in addition to a $750,000 salary.  The bank eliminated 1,700 jobs in January as Gorman pursues
$1.6 billion of annual savings during the next two years.  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  is deferring all bonuses for employees who have both
total pay of more than $350,000 and incentive compensation of at
least $50,000, a person briefed on the matter said in January.  “After reducing our headcount by more than 6,000 since the
end of 2011, we believe our firm is sized appropriately for the
operating and regulatory environment as we currently see it,”
Gorman wrote in his letter. The firm had 55,358 employees after
the January cuts, according to a  presentation  that month.  The bank disclosed that China Investment Corp. cut its
 stake  in the bank by 25 million shares to 125 million shares.
CIC owned 6.4 percent of Morgan Stanley as of Dec. 31, according
to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
