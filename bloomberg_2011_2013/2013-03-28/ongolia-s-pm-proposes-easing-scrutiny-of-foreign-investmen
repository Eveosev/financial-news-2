Mongolia is planning to ease
restrictions on foreign investment to encourage more private
companies to do business while keeping restrictions on state-
owned groups, Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag said.  The planned amendments would remove a requirement for
parliament to review minority investments by non-state-owned
companies, the prime minister said. Parliamentary review of all
investments by state-owned or associated companies would remain.  The existing law “imposed barriers to foreign
investment,” Altankhuyag said today at a conference attended by
Mongolia’s diplomatic community. The changes will be considered
during the spring session of parliament, which begins on April
5, he said.  The changes may boost investor confidence in the wake of
protracted disputes with key Mongolia investors, including Rio
Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company.  Mongolia wants to create a new law on investment that will
stabilize tax rules in order to prevent frequent rule changes
that can create uncertainty, the prime minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
