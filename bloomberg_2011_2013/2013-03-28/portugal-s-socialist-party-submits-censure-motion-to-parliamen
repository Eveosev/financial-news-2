Portugal’s Socialist Party has
submitted a motion of censure in parliament against the
government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, Carlos
Zorrinho, the party’s parliamentary leader said.  “We want to show the Portuguese that there is an
alternative way,” Zorrinho said in comments broadcast by SIC
Noticias television station today. “This government is no good,
its policies are worthless.”  The motion will be voted on April 3 and is almost certain
to be defeated by the ruling coalition, which has a majority in
parliament.  The coalition government is backed by the Social Democrats
and the conservative CDS party, which together have a majority
of seats in the legislature. The Socialist Party is the biggest
opposition group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
