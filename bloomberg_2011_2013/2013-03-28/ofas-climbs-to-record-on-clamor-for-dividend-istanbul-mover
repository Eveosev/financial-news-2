Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) ,
the Turkish carmaker co-owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , jumped to a record as
investors seized upon the last opportunity to secure a dividend.  Tofas rose for a fifth day, climbing 4.8 percent to 13.05
liras at the close in Istanbul, the highest level since at least
January 1995. The number of shares traded was 1.1 times the
stock’s three-month average daily volume, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Istanbul Stock Exchange National 100 (XU100) 
index advanced 1.3 percent as Standard & Poor’s raised Turkey’s
credit rating to BB+, one level below investment grade.  “The movement in Tofas can mostly be attributed to the
approaching dividend payment,” Onur Marsan, an analyst at
Garanti Securities in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “Today is the last day to buy and thus join
investors who will benefit from the payout -- the company will
hold its general shareholders meeting tomorrow.”  Tofas reported 2012 net income of 448.3 million liras ($247
million) on Feb. 6, beating the average estimate of 445.6
million liras in a Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts. The company
announced it will pay a cash dividend of 0.96 lira a share,
corresponding to a dividend yield of 8.3 percent. Subject to
shareholder approval tomorrow, the payment will be made April 5.  Tofas, which is 37.9 percent owned by Turin, Italy-based
Fiat, trades at 13.3 times estimated 12-month earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a
12.8 multiple for Istanbul-based  Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO) , 6.4
for Russia’s  AvtoVAZ OAO (AVAZ)  and 6.8 for India’s  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) 
Eleven analysts recommend buying Tofas shares, while 15 maintain
a hold recommendation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
