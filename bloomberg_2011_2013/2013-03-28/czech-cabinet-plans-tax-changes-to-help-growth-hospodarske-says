The Czech government plans a series
of tax changes to help restore economic growth,  Hospodarske
Noviny  reported, citing Deputy Finance Minister Ladislav Mincic.  The Cabinet wants to allow faster depreciation of assets,
expecting the measure to encourage investments, and abolish the
income tax on dividends one year earlier than initially planned,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
