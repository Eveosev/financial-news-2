Etablissements Maurel & Prom (MAU) , a
French oil and gas explorer, posted a 65 percent drop in profit
after the previous year’s results were buoyed by asset sales. It
pledged to boost output in Gabon this year.  Net income fell to 58 million euros ($74 million) in 2012
from 165 million euros the year before, the Paris-based company
said today in a statement. Sales rose 26 percent to 472 million
euros. Asset sales totalled 135 million euros in 2011.  Maurel had average production of 15,688 barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2012, with output in Gabon surpassing
22,000. The connection of new wells may push production from
Gabon above 27,500 barrels a day by the end of the year after
last year’s results were affected by the collapse of a platform.  Maurel spun off its Nigerian operations in 2011 to
concentrate on projects in Gabon, Tanzania and  Colombia . Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Francois Henin, who owns 24 percent of
the company, has long said he’s searching for a buyer or partner
for Maurel and regularly meets with potential investors,
although no acceptable offers have emerged.  Maurel’s exploration plans for this year include Peru,
Mozambique and  Namibia  as well as Tanzania, Colombia and Gabon,
according to today’s statement.  Maurel, which first struck oil in the Republic of Congo in
2001, has divested businesses ranging from fish farming to
shipping to focus on energy. It drilled more than 100
exploration wells in the past decade, with a success rate of 46
percent, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
