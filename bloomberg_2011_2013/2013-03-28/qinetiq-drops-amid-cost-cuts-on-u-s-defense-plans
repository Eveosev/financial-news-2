Qinetiq Group Plc (QQ/) , the partner to
the U.K. military for a new drone development center, fell the
most in more than nine months after saying it will take a charge
of $25 million on cost cuts to adjust to lower U.S.  defense
spending .  Qinetiq fell as much as 5.3 percent to 195 pence, the most
since June 15, and slipped 1.7 percent to 202.50 pence at 9.46
a.m. in  London . The stock has risen 10 percent this year.  “The majority of these cost reductions are in the U.S.
Services division where reduced federal services spending is
creating a more competitive trading environment,” the London-
based company said in a statement today. Acquired goodwill held
in the unit will be reassessed at the end of the month, when the
company’s financial year closes, it said.  Qinetiq and other defense contractors are contending with
slowed activity at the Pentagon as well as reduced military
spending in the U.K. The company’s cost cutting is focused on
reducing property and infrastructure costs, as well as trimming
management layers, it said today.  “It’s a reminder of the continued deterioration in the
U.S. services end market,” William Shirley, a London-based
analyst at  Liberum Capital  who has a hold rating on the stock,
said in a note today. “The market remains tough and Qinetiq
needs to pull another rabbit out the hat.”  The company, which is scheduled to report full-year results
on May 23, said its U.K. business is performing well, in part
owing to a “more competitive cost base.” The company
reiterated that it is on course to meet its financial forecasts
for the year ending March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
