Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) , the
nation’s biggest lender by branches, rose to a record after
reporting that profit soared by almost eight times in 2012.  The shares gained 4.8 percent to 3.25 cedis by 1:02 p.m. in
the capital, Accra, the highest since February 1997, when
Bloomberg began compiling the data. More than 128,000 shares
were traded, or more than 5.6 times the three-month daily
average.  Net income climbed to 143 million cedis ($74 million) from
18 million cedis a year earlier, Ghana Commercial Bank said in a
statement e-mailed by the country’s bourse today. Loans to
customers jumped 78 percent to 848 million cedis while net
interest income, the money made from lending, advanced to 325.2
million cedis from 206.9 million cedis in 2011, it said.  Banks in West Africa’s second-biggest economy have led the
Ghana Stock Exchange’s 44 percent rise this year, as many boost
lending to clients in the country where growth is forecast by
the  Finance Ministry  to reach 8 percent this year, faster than
the sub-Saharan African average.  Ghana Commercial Bank’s stock has jumped 55 percent this
year, faster than the composite measure and the  gauge  of
financial stocks, which has climbed 49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
