Stocks rallied, sending the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  to a record, and the euro rebounded from a four-month low as the reopening of Cyprus banks eased concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis. Commodities erased early gains. Treasuries were little changed and the dollar fell.  The  S&P 500  jumped 0.4 percent to 1,569.19 at 4 p.m. in  New York , eclipsing its previous closing high of 1,565.15 set in October 2007. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.5 percent, while the euro appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.2819. German bunds erased an advance after the 10-year yield fell to the lowest in almost eight months. The yen was higher against most of its major peers, while the  Dollar Index  lost 0.3 percent.  The S&P 500’s advance above its record close marks the completion of the recovery from a  bear market  that  wiped out  more than $10 trillion of value from the world’s largest stock market. Gains today came as Cyprus’s banks reopened with new rules curbing access to cash after being closed since March 16. German retail sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, increased 0.4 percent last month from January, while U.S. government data showed the economic growth slowed less than previously estimated last quarter.  “It is encouraging that we finally hit that record but I expect in time we will move to higher levels,”  Peter Jankovskis , the chief investment officer at Lisle, Illinois- based Oakbrook Investments LLC, said in a phone interview. His firm oversees $3.3 billion. “As the headlines hit the tape, it causes people to experience some regret and decided they have to step in,” he said. “That hopefully will propel the market even higher.”  Fed Stimulus  Financial markets in the U.S. and most of the world will be closed tomorrow for the Good Friday holiday.

Of nine advances, four have lasted longer than the mean and the market rose for about six years during those periods.  “Inasmuch as investors are constantly examining value and opportunity in the markets, I would say the psychological component of a new high is probably more important to the media than to professional investors,”  Mike Shea , a managing partner at New York-based brokerage firm Direct Access Partners LLC, said in an interview. “That having been said, clearly there is less low-hanging fruit than there was in 2009, 2010.”  Market Leaders  Among stocks moving today, McDonald’s Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. added at least 0.8 percent to pace advances among the biggest companies. GameStop Corp. rallied 5.8 percent after quarterly profit topped estimates. Deckers Outdoor Corp. increased 6 percent after Jefferies Group Inc. raised its price target.
