At least five state legislatures
are considering bills to tighten oversight of methadone clinics
after allegations that take-home doses of the drug are
contributing to illegal street sales, misuse and deaths.  Measures in  West Virginia , Minnesota,  Indiana ,  Pennsylvania 
and  Maine , if passed, could increase costs or limit revenue for
the nation’s largest methadone chains -- both of them backed by
private equity firms: CRC Health Corp. is owned by Boston-based
Bain Capital Partners LLC; and Colonial Management Group LP is
in the  portfolio  of Warwick Group Inc. of  New Canaan ,
 Connecticut .  Police, prosecutors and state regulators have linked
clinics operated by CRC and Colonial to doses of the synthetic
narcotic that were diverted into black-market sales -- sometimes
with deadly results.  The array of legislation reflects concerns that some for-
profit clinics -- which distribute the synthetic narcotic to
help patients beat addictions to heroin and other opiates --
don’t provide enough services, said Robert Lubran, director of
pharmacologic therapies at the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration.  “We know for-profit providers often provide a lower level
of service” than non-profit counterparts, Lubran said.  “It’s a question across the nation: Is it a cash cow these
providers are running or are they really trying to help our
citizens?” said Meshea Poore, a Democratic member of West
Virginia’s House of Delegates.  Threatening Treatment  Many of the legislative proposals are misguided and pose a
threat to methadone treatment, which is already rigidly
regulated and has been used effectively to treat drug addiction
for decades, said Mark Parrino, president of the  American
Association  for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, a methadone
advocacy  group .  “The system is in need of reform, but good reform,” said
Joycelyn Sue Woods, executive director of the  National Alliance 
for Medication Assisted Recovery, a patient advocacy
 organization . “Once you start passing all these laws, you make
it impossible for people who need treatment to get treatment.”  In West Virginia, measures that unanimously passed the
House of Delegates health committee last week would require at
least one counselor for every 40 patients -- a ratio that’s
lower than those in such states as  North Carolina  and Indiana.
Clinics would also have to report to a legislative oversight
panel on the number of take-home doses they distribute --
methadone that patients carry out instead of taking under staff
supervision.  Crossing Borders  West Virginia clinics distribute take-home doses more often
than those in neighboring Kentucky and  Ohio , contributing to a
high number of out-of-state patients, said Poore. “They come
here, get their take homes and some sell them,” she said.  Poore offered an amendment to the West Virginia bill that
would bar out-of-state residents from seeking treatment in West
Virginia. It has been referred to the House of Delegates’
judiciary committee after passing the health committee.  Cupertino, California-based CRC, which operates seven of
West Virginia’s nine methadone clinics, will oppose “any
regulations that would restrict an individual’s access to
quality, evidence-based treatment options,” said spokeswoman
Kristen Hayes. She didn’t comment on specific bills.  Bloomberg News  reported in February that investigators in
West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky and Virginia had linked
diverted methadone that turned up in illegal street sales or
deaths to carryout doses from CRC clinics. Former employees said
their caseloads were sometimes so high they didn’t have time to
provide adequate counseling or check on patients.  Meeting Rules  Philip Herschman, CRC’s chief clinical officer, called the
article “misleading and biased” and said CRC meets rigid rules
in deciding which patients get take-home doses.  In 2010, 4,577 people died of overdoses involving methadone
-- down from 5,518 in 2007 yet almost six times the number in
1999, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Much of the current state legislation is based on
incorrect claims that attribute the increase to addiction
treatment centers, Parrino said. Instead, most methadone
overdose deaths stem from physicians’ prescribing the drug as a
pain killer, he said, citing national studies.  In  Minnesota , legislation to tighten methadone clinic rules
followed a state decision to revoke the license of Duluth’s Lake
Superior Treatment Center. Inspectors found patient caseloads
were too heavy and take-home doses weren’t properly controlled.
Methadone from the clinic has leaked into illegal street sales,
said Dan Danielson, an investigator with the Carlton County
Sheriff’s Office.  Nine Deaths  Nine people connected to the 4,000-member Fond-du-Lac Band
of the Lake Superior Chippewa tribe died last year in incidents
involving methadone, said Phil Norrgard, the tribe’s human
services director. In one of those cases, authorities have
traced the methadone to the Duluth clinic, Norrgard and
Danielson said.  Colonial Management, which operates that clinic and more
than 50 other treatment centers in 18 states, has appealed the
revocation. Christopher Hassan, the Orlando, Florida-based
company’s chief executive, declined to comment, according to his
assistant, Renee Seabridge.  “We thought Minnesota was the worst,” said Thomas Huntley, a Democratic-Farm-Labor party member and state
representative from Duluth who co-sponsored the methadone bill
in the Minnesota House. “This has become a very national
issue.”  Provision Struck  In Indiana, a bill would require a legislative commission
to study the use and prescribing of methadone and how to improve
monitoring of patients.  A House committee on Monday struck from the measure
language that would have required clinics to run patients’ names
through a state prescription database to check for other sources
of methadone or pain-control medications. That provision would
have helped prevent methadone’s misuse, said its sponsor,
Patricia Miller, a Republican state senator from Indianapolis.  The requirement ran afoul of federal patient-privacy laws,
said Lubran, the U.S. substance-abuse official. Lawmakers also
stripped out language that would have limited methadone
treatment in Indiana clinics to two years.  Miller’s bill was revised after her committee heard
testimony from five opponents -- two who represented CRC, two
from a non-profit mental health agency and a professor of
addiction psychiatry at  Indiana University ’s school of medicine.  CRC served 69 percent of Indiana’s 14,200 methadone
patients in 2011, according to state records. That year, the
company’s East Indiana Treatment Center in Lawrenceburg saw
2,479 patients -- just 380 of them from Indiana, records show.  Study Required  To counteract state proposals aimed at restricting
methadone treatment, the American Society of Addiction Medicine
has begun an advocacy campaign, said president Stuart Gitlow.
“You wouldn’t say to a person with a chronic condition like
diabetes, you’ve been doing well on your insulin for two years
and now it’s time to stop,” Gitlow said.  In Maine, a measure that took effect in January caps state
funding for methadone patients at 24 months. Now Lawrence E.
Lockman, a Republican representative from Amherst, has sponsored
a bill to ban the state Medicaid program from paying for any
methadone treatment.  “Some of these clinics are doing little more than
dispensing the drug,” Lockman said. “There’s very little
accountability. The for-profits in particular don’t have a lot
of incentive to taper people off of the methadone they’re
getting paid for. We need some accountability so taxpayers know
what we’re getting.”  For-Profit Clinics  Bethany Allen, an aide to Maine  House Republicans , cited
clinics in Bangor operated by Colonial Management and Discovery
House, a Rhode Island-based, for-profit chain that operates 18
clinics in four states.  There’s no difference between standards at for-profit and
nonprofit methadone clinics, said Richard Froncillo, an
ombudsman for Discovery House. All have to follow the same rules
set by at least four state and national organizations, he said.  Discovery House also opposes legislation under
consideration in Pennsylvania that would make it harder for
patients to get take-home doses during their first six months of
treatment, Froncillo said. The company follows state and federal
rules in distributing take-home doses, he said, and its clinics
require patients to account for their carryout bottles.  Pennsylvania lawmakers last year created a “methadone
death and incident review team” that’s charged with examining
the circumstances of methadone-related deaths in the state,
including car crashes and overdoses.  “We need to get a handle on how the deaths happen and
where the methadone is coming from,” said Gene DiGirolamo, a
Republican from Bensalem who helped craft the bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
