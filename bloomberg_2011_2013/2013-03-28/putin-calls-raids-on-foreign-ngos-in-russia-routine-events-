Russian President Vladimir Putin
called raids at non-government organizations “routine events”
after prosecutors and tax inspectors searched offices including
Amnesty International.  The checks are designed to determine whether the NGOs’
activities “comply with their declared goals” and whether
their work meets Russian legislation on the “inadmissibility of
financing political activities from abroad,” Putin said today
at a meeting with human-rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin.  Russia  in 2012 required groups that get money from abroad
to register as “foreign agents” and submit to tighter control.
The Justice Ministry threatened to close human-rights
organization Memorial, vote-monitor Golos and the Moscow branch
of graft watchdog Transparency International after they vowed to
flout the rules. Putin’s administration ordered the closing of
U.S. aid agency USAID, which has financed Golos and Memorial.  The St. Petersburg office of the Konrad Adenauer
Foundation, which affiliated with  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
Christian Democratic Union, was searched March 26 by Russia’s
state prosecutor. The Friedrich Ebert Foundation, which is
affiliated with  Germany ’s Social Democratic Party, has also been
targeted.  Germany has “great concern” over raids undertaken by
Russian authorities on German political foundations in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert
said March 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
