The  University of Pennsylvania 
filed a lawsuit accusing a  California  company of violating a
trademark associated with the Wharton Business School.  The Wharton Business Foundation, which has locations in
Beverly Hills, California, and Blue Bell,  Pennsylvania , is using
Penn’s 132-year-old Wharton trademark without authorization,
lawyers for the university said in a complaint made public today
in federal court in Philadelphia.  The California company’s use of the name “creates a
likelihood of confusion in the marketplace,” the University of
Pennsylvania said in its complaint.  Wharton Business Foundation operates a website with the
Wharton name and offers services including business education
and business consultation through its Wharton Business
Foundation University, according to the complaint. The company
also advertises and maintains a toll-free phone number (888) 4-
WHARTON, the university said in its filing.  Penn has been using the Wharton registered mark for
business education since as early as 1881 and for business
consultation since 1953, lawyers for the university said in the
filing. The university is seeking a  jury trial  and a court order
barring the misuse of its mark.  Officials at the Wharton Business Foundation didn’t
immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the
complaint.  The case is The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania
v. Wharton Business Foundation, 13-cv-01616, U.S. District Court
Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia)  To contact the reporter on this story:
