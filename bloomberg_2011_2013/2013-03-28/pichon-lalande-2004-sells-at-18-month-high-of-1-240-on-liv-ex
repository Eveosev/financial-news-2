The 2004 vintage of Bordeaux wine
producer Chateau Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande sold at
an 18-month high of 820 pounds ($1,240) a case on  London ’s Liv-
ex wine market yesterday, according to the Liv-ex market’s
Cellar Watch website.  The sale was 41 percent above a 21-month low of 583 pounds
reached in August, although below the $1,476 a case paid at an
Acker Merrall & Condit auction in  Hong Kong  on Jan. 25,
according to Liv-ex and Acker’s online sale results. Pichon-
Lalande ranks as a second growth in the 1855 classification of
Bordeaux’s Medoc wines, and is in the Pauillac appellation on
the left bank of the Gironde estuary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
