Inovalis Real Estate Investment
Trust raised C$105 million ($103 million) in its Canadian
initial public offering to invest in European office properties,
according to two people familiar with the transaction.  Inovalis REIT sold 10.5 million units for C$10 each,
yielding 8.25 percent, the top end of its marketed range, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the terms
aren’t public.  The Toronto-based REIT plans to invest in three office
properties in and around Paris and one property in Hanover,
 Germany , after the transaction closes, according to a Feb. 28
filing with Canadian regulators. Inovalis SA, which currently
manages the properties, agreed to buy a 10 percent ownership in
the REIT, the filing said.  Desjardins Securities Inc. led a group of investment banks
on the sale. The banks have an option to sell an additional 15
percent, which would raise proceeds to C$120.8 million. A
message left with David Giraud, chief executive officer of
Inovalis REIT, wasn’t immediately returned.  Canadian companies have raised $630 million in 18 IPOs this
year, the slowest start since 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
