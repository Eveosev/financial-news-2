The clash over the top prosecutor’s
job was politically driven,  Egypt ’s justice minister said, a day
after an appeals court annulled President Mohamed Mursi’s
appointment.  The ruling threatened to deepen Mursi’s clash with the
judiciary and was seen by Islamists as another example of
judicial bias against them. The court voided Mursi’s decree
appointing Talaat Ibrahim as prosecutor-general, in place of an
official from the era of deposed leader  Hosni Mubarak .  “The case of the prosecutor-general is first and foremost
a political crisis, and not a legal or judicial one,” Justice
Minister Ahmed Mekki said in an interview with Al-Jazeera
Mubashir Misr, the local arm of the pan-Arab satellite channel.
Mekki said he had not seen the court’s opinion.  The ruling can be appealed, and in the meantime, Ibrahim
remains in office.  Mursi’s decision in November to replace Abdel-Meguid
Mahmoud with his own appointee came as he moved to shield his
decisions from judicial review. The move outraged his secular
opposition and revolutionary youth groups, who saw it as an
infringement on judicial powers.  The tensions added to a simmering political crisis between
the Islamists and secularists, a battle that has stymied the
country’s economic revival efforts two years after Mubarak’s
2011 ouster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
