JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , facing
criticism that it misled investors about a change to a risk
model as trades backfired last year, told U.S. regulators that
the bank wasn’t obligated to disclose the move until May.  While there was an “interim change” to the lender’s so-
called value-at-risk model during the first three months of
2012, that adjustment had been reversed by the time the company
filed its quarterly report in May, then-Chief Financial Officer
Douglas Braunstein told the Securities and Exchange Commission
in a Dec. 3  letter  that was released yesterday.  “As a result, the firm believes there was no model change
within the meaning of” securities-disclosure laws, he wrote.  The alteration to the model in January 2012 has been blamed
for exacerbating trading losses that exceeded $6.2 billion last
year. The bank disclosed the change and initial losses of about
$2 billion in a May 10 regulatory filing, almost a month after
reporting first-quarter results.  Braunstein, 52, was responding to a  Nov. 7 letter  from the
SEC that asked the bank to explain why it didn’t think it was
required to disclose the change sooner.  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon , 57, said May 10 that
the company had reviewed the effectiveness of the January VaR
model, deemed it “inadequate” and decided to return to the
previous version. Restoring the use of the earlier model meant
the risk was twice what the bank told investors in April.  VaR measures the maximum possible trading losses on a
position or trading unit with 95 percent probability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
