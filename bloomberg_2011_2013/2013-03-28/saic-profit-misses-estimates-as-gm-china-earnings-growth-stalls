SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) , China’s largest
automaker, reported full-year profit that missed analysts’
estimates after earnings growth stalled at its venture with
 General Motors Co. (GM)   Net income increased 2.6 percent to 20.8 billion  yuan  ($3.3
billion) last year, Shanghai-based SAIC, which has joint
ventures with GM and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said in a statement today.
That missed the 22 billion yuan average of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales gained 10 percent to
478.4 billion yuan, also missing estimates.  GM, the biggest foreign automaker in China, saw profit in
the country fall 0.2 percent in 2012, after 14 percent growth
the previous year, as the economy grew at the slowest pace in 13
years. That overshadowed higher earnings from SAIC’s venture
with Volkswagen.  SAIC forecast revenue will increase 2.4 percent, the
slowest expansion in five years, to 490 billion yuan in 2013 and
for deliveries to rise 9.1 percent to 4.9 million units.  GM brands such as Cadillac and Chevrolet underperformed the
broader Chinese passenger-vehicle market, which grew 7.1 percent
last year.  By contrast, Volkswagen’s sales increased 25 percent in the
market last year as it benefited from new models and a backlash
against Japanese brands following a territorial dispute over
islands in the  East China Sea .  SAIC gained 2.1 percent to 15.23 yuan at the end of trading
in Shanghai today, before earnings were released, while the
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.8 percent. The stock
has fallen 14 percent this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
