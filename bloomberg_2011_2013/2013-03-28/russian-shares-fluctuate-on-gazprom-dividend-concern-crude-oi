Russian  shares  swung between gains
and losses as oil advanced and OAO Gazprom fell on bets the
natural gas export monopoly will pay a lower-than-forecast
dividend.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  sank 0.2 percent to 1,422.34 by 11:31 a.m.
in Moscow, taking its retreat this year to 3.6 percent. Gazprom,
which has the biggest weighting in the Micex, dropped 1.2
percent.  State-run Gazprom said late yesterday that 2012 net income
dropped 37 percent to 556 billion rubles (17.9 billion), based
on local accounting standards. That translates into a 5.9 ruble-
a-share dividend given the company’s policy of returning 25
percent of net income to shareholders. Crude climbed for a fifth
day in  New York , adding as much as 0.4 percent to $96.94 a
barrel.  Cyprus’s banks will open their doors to customers today for
the first time in almost two weeks, with new rules curbing
access to cash.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.3
times estimated earnings. That compares with a multiple of 10.8
times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which has slid 2.5
percent this year.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, was little changed at $27.49
yesterday in New York. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the  stock futures , rose 0.5 percent to 19.39
today. The  Bloomberg-Russia gauge  added 0.3 percent to 97.17
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
