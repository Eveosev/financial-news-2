Georgia  dropped charges against
three photographers who admitted to spying for Russia in 2011.  The decision was announced today by Corrections and Legal
Assistance Minister Sozar Subari during a speech on Rustavi-2
television. The move is a first step by the new government to
“restore justice” in the Black Sea nation, he said.  Zurab Qurtsikidze from the European Pressphoto Agency was
arrested in July 2011 together with President Mikheil Saakashvili’s personal photographer, Irakli Gedenidze, his wife
Natia and Foreign Ministry photographer Giorgi Abdaladze. Natia
Gedenidze was released on bail and her charges later dropped.
The other three were released conditionally because they
cooperated with the investigation.  Billionaire Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili’s Georgian
Dream coalition won parliamentary elections last October,
defeating Saakashvili’s party. The tycoon promised to restore
justice, raise living standards and improve relations with
 Russia , with which Georgia fought a five-day war in 2008 over
the breakaway South Ossetia region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
