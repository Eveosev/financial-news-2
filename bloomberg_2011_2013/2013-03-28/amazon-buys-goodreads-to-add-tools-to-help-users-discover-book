Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  said it’s acquiring
Goodreads, a website that helps users share book
recommendations, adding tools to help it sell more wares and get
people to spend more time on the Kindle e-reader.  Goodreads has 16 million members and boasts more than
30,000 book clubs, Seattle-based Amazon said in a statement. The
acquisition will probably close in the second quarter and the
Goodreads headquarters will remain in San Francisco, Amazon
said. Acquisition terms were not disclosed.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Bezos  is using aquisitions and
partnerships to add content that will help his company boost
sales of books and lure users to the Kindle reader, which
competes with other devices, including Apple Inc.’s iPad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
