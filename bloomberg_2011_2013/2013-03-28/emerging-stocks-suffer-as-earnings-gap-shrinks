Emerging-market companies have to
become more profitable to draw the foreign investment needed to
lift their shares, according to  Pierre Lapointe , head of global
strategy and research at Pavilion Global Markets Ltd.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the differential between
returns on capital -- equity and debt -- for companies in the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index and those in the MSCI World Index,
which tracks developed markets.  Returns on the emerging-market gauge came out ahead last
year by as little as 0.7 percentage point, the narrowest spread
since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap as
of yesterday was 1.1 points, well below a peak of 4.8 points in
May 2002.  “The reward for taking more risk by investing in emerging
markets is now minimal,” Lapointe, based in  Montreal , and two
colleagues wrote yesterday in a report with a comparable chart.
Many foreign investors “are probably sticking with developed
markets,” they added.  MSCI’s emerging-markets index, comprised of stocks from 21
countries, had a 2.2 percent loss for the year as of yesterday.
The decline contrasted with a 6.8 percent gain for MSCI World,
covering 24 developed markets. The emerging-market gauge has
trailed since August 2011.  “What will it take for emerging markets to start
outperforming again?” the report said. “They need to boost
profitability.” Returns on capital in most emerging countries
represented in the MSCI index have fallen since 2007, when the
indicator set a record, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
