German government bonds opened
little changed after a report showed retail sales in Europe’s
biggest economy unexpectedly rose for a second month in
February.  The yield on the nation’s  10-year securities  was at 1.27
percent as of 7:07 a.m. London time. The two-year rate was at
minus 0.026 percent.  Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, gained
0.4 percent from January, when they surged a revised 3.0
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.
Economists forecast a decline of 0.6 percent, according to the
median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
