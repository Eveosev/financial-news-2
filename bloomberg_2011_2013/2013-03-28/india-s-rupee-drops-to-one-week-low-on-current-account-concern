India ’s rupee dropped to the lowest
level in a week before a report that economists predict will
show the current-account deficit widened to a record.  The  shortfall  in the broadest measure of trade rose to
$30.5 billion in the three months through December from the
previous quarter’s $22.3 billion, according to the median of 11
estimates in a Bloomberg survey before government data due 5
p.m. in  New Delhi . The rupee’s losses will be limited by bunched
fund inflows because of holidays yesterday and tomorrow,  Andhra
Bank (ANDB)  said. India’s financial year ends March 31.  “The current-account concerns are still persisting, and we
will see importer demand for dollars,” said Vikas Babu, a
trader at the state-run lender in Mumbai. “With today
effectively being the last trading day for the rupee this fiscal
year, and with little or no trade globally on April 1, we should
also see inflows coming in.”  The rupee was little changed from March 26 at 54.3600 per
dollar as of 9:47 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier declined as much as 0.2 percent to
54.4650, the lowest level since March 20. Andhra Bank’s Babu
predicts the rupee will stay between 54.30 and 54.60 today. The
currency, which has moved little this week and month, weakened
6.4 percent during the past year.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.97 percent. The rate has dropped
186 basis points in the past 12 months. The rupee’s volatility
seems “too low,” considering increased risks that  Europe ’s
debt crisis could damp inflows, Sean Yokota, head of Asia
strategy at  Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA) , wrote in a March
27 report.  Bonds Gain  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell one
basis point to 7.98 percent today, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate on the benchmark 10-year note,
which has dropped 56 basis points in the past year, rose two
basis points this week and 11 basis points this month after the
central bank on March 19 lowered  interest rates  for the second
time in 2013 and said room for more easing is “quite limited.”  The debt sell-off “is overdone,” according to Barclays
Plc, which on March 26 recommended buying the benchmark note and
targeting a drop in yield to 7.40 percent by the end of
September. The rupee will be relatively stable, ending 2013 at
55, according to the U.K. bank, which says investors should
refrain from hedging positions.  Debt Limits  All restrictions and sub-limits governing foreign funds’
purchases of Indian government and corporate notes will be
removed from April 1, while keeping the overall cap at $25
billion for sovereign debt and $51 billion for securities issued
by companies, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in
New Delhi on March 23. A new “on tap” system will replace the
existing quota auction procedure, he said.  The move comes as the government estimates India will need
more than $75 billion of foreign capital the next financial year
to fund the current-account shortfall. The gap is a “greater
worry” than the  budget deficit , Chidambaram said Feb. 28.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.38 per
dollar, compared with 55.36 on March 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.34 versus 55.41 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy
or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
