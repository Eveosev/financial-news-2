Elektroprivreda Srbije JP, Serbia’s
state-run power company, agreed to buy a coal excavator from
ThyssenKrupp Foerdertechnik GmbH and a conveyor from  Kopex SA (KPX) 
for its mining operation that feeds its biggest thermal plants.  The unit of  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  will provide the excavator for
31 million euros ($40 million) and Poland’s Kopex SA will supply
the 29 million-euro conveyor for RB Kolubara DOO, Belgrade-based
Elektroprivreda, or EPS, said in an e-mailed statement. The new
equipment will cut costs by 26 million euros a year, it said.  The purchase is part of a 181 million-euro project to
improve coal management and cut pollution at Kolubara’s open-pit
mines that fuel EPS’s Termelektrane Nikola Tesla plants.  Financing is arranged with an 80 million-euro loan from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 65 million
euros from  Germany ’s development bank Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau, or KfW, a 9 million-euro grant from the German
government and 27 million euros of EPS’s own cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
