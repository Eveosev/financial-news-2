Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda  pledged to continue easing until a 2 percent inflation
target is reached, in a sign he wants the central bank to
strengthen its commitment to ending deflation.  “The 2 percent price stability target has been set by the 
policy board, and of course, we will work to continue monetary 
easing until that is realized,” Kuroda said in parliament today.  Investors expect Kuroda, who said this week he wants to
reach the inflation target in two years, to add to monetary
stimulus at his first policy-setting meeting on April 3-4. Bond
yields fell to a 10-year low today as Kuroda says he wants to
expand purchases of government debt.  Kuroda’s wording today was stronger than that of BOJ board
member  Ryuzo Miyao , who has proposed at two meetings this year
that the bank continue with its zero-interest rate policy until
2 percent inflation is “in sight.”  Miyao’s proposals were rejected by the other eight board
members, including former Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his two
deputies who stepped down March 19.  In the BOJ’s policy statement after its Feb. 13-14 meeting,
the central bank said it would ease “as long as it judges it
appropriate to continue.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
