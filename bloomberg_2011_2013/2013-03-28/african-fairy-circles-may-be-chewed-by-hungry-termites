Mysterious bare spots dubbed
“fairy circles” that have been long observed in the African
grasslands are caused by termites, a scientist suggests.  The  Psammotermes allocerus  termite that lives in the sandy
soil beneath the circles kill the grass by chewing its roots,
according to a study in the journal  Science . By clearing the
grass, the termites not only feast, they also allow water to be
retained in the soil during the dry season.  The circles also contribute to a larger natural advantage.
They allow other species, including geckos, aardvarks,  bat-eared
foxes  and spiders to easily find and feed on the termites, said
 Norbert Juergens , a scientist at the University of Hamburg in
Germany who is the study’s lead author.  The circles are “like oases in the desert,” Juergens
wrote in the journal article. They are found in the Namib
Desert, which runs from mid-Angola to northwestern  South Africa ,
according to the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
