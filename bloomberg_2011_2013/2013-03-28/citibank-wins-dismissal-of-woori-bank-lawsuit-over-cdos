Citigroup Inc. (C)  won dismissal of a
lawsuit by  South Korea ’s Woori Bank Co., which sought to recover
$95 million in losses from collateralized debt obligations.  U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in  Manhattan 
yesterday granted Citigroup’s request to dismiss Woori’s claims
because the bank didn’t provide the required detail to show how
Citigroup made misleading or false statements that caused Woori
to buy the securities. The judge allowed Woori to try to file an
amended complaint.  Woori Bank claimed Citigroup used misleading credit ratings
to mask the fact that many of the mortgages underlying its CDOs
and residential mortgage-backed securities were likely to
default, according to a complaint filed May 15.  Woori Bank , a unit of Woori Finance Holdings Co., lost
similar rulings in cases it brought against  Bank of America 
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
over losses from CDOs.  Christopher Lebsock, a lawyer for Woori Bank, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail yesterday after regular
business hours seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Woori Bank v. Citigroup Inc., 12-cv-03868, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
