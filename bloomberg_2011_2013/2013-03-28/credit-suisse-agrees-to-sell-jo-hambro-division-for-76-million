Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-largest bank, agreed to sell British wealth
manager JO Hambro Investment Management Ltd. to a Bermudian
investment firm for 50 million pounds ($76 million).  Bermuda National will own 63 percent of London-based Hambro
following the sale, with the unit’s managers owning the
remainder, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said in a
 statement  today. Hambro has more than 100 employees and 3.6
billion pounds of assets under management.  Credit Suisse acquired Hambro in 2001, paying about 90
million pounds, analysts said at the time, to widen the range of
services it offers wealthy clients in Britain. Yesterday, the
Zurich-based firm bought Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management
operation in the U.K.,  Italy  and Dubai to add about $13 billion
of assets. The bank’s wealth management arm oversaw about 798.5
billion Swiss francs ($840 billion) at the end of 2012.  Bermuda National (BNL)  already owns Bermuda Commercial Bank, one
of the island’s four licensed lenders, and Westhouse, a
stockbroker that also operated in the U.K. The company said it
will fund the acquisition with cash, debt funding and an
investment by Hambro employees.  The  fund manager , which was founded in 1986, made a pretax
profit of 6.6 million pounds in 2012 on revenue of about 25.2
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
