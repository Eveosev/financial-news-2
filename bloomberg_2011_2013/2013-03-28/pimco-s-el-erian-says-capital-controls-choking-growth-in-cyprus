Capital controls imposed in Cyprus
to prevent an outflow of capital from the troubled nation are
“choking the economy,” according to Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s Mohamed El-Erian,  “We’re looking at a depression in Cyprus,” El-Erian,
chief executive officer of the world’s largest manager of bond
funds, said in a television interview on “In the Loop” with
 Betty Liu .  Cyprus’s banks opened for the first time today in almost
two weeks, with new rules curbing access to cash preventing an
initial panic to withdraw deposits. The Central Bank of Cyprus’s
money controls include a 300-euro ($383) daily limit on
withdrawals and restrictions on transfers to accounts outside
the country.  Cyprus’s lenders have been closed since March 16, when the
European Union presented a proposal to force losses on all
depositors in exchange for a 10 billion-euro bailout. That plan
touched off protests and political upheaval on the island, and
was rejected by the country’s parliament. A subsequent agreement
shut Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl, the second-largest lender, and
imposed larger losses on uninsured depositors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
