Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  is taking $80
million in financing from potential acquirer  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) 
for a second straight month, even as it continues to weigh a
competing offer from  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)   The financing, part of a prearranged agreement with Sprint,
can be exchanged for Clearwire stock at $1.50 a share under
certain conditions, the Bellevue, Washington-based wireless
Internet provider said today in a statement. The company said it
also remains in talks with Sprint about its $2.97-a-share offer
to acquire full control of Clearwire.  The move helps Sprint tighten its grip on Clearwire, which
has struggled to profit from its Internet service. Sprint, the
third-biggest U.S. mobile-phone company, already owns slightly
more than 50 percent of Clearwire, making it difficult for Dish
to gain control even with its higher $3.30-a-share offer.  Clearwire was little changed yesterday in New York at
$3.25. That price, a 12 percent increase for the year, shows
investors expect the company to sell for a higher price than
Sprintâ€™s offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
