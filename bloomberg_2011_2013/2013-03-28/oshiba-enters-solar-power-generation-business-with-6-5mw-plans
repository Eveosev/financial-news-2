Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the Japanese maker
of flash-memory chips, elevators and nuclear reactors, will
enter the solar power generation business through projects with
combined capacity of 6.5 megawatts.  A 1.5 megawatt plant in Kanagawa prefecture, south of
Tokyo, will start running on April 1 and three more stations are
planned to be set up by the end of March 2014, the company said
in a statement today.  Toshiba has been supplying equipment to thermal, nuclear,
geothermal, and solar power plants, according to the statement.  “We will contribute to the expansion of clean energy
through power generation projects using our technology,” it
said.  Japan  introduced an incentive program in July for clean
energy following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident.
Toshiba said the company will consider entering other clean
energy generation businesses such as wind, geothermal and small
hydro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
