Credit-default swaps insuring
against losses on European financial debt climbed for a 10th
day, the longest streak since August 2011, as the bank  crisis in
Cyprus  and political turmoil in  Italy  alarm investors.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps protecting the
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers rose four basis points to
205, with the gauge heading for its worst month since November
2011. Contracts on Italy jumped to the highest since Nov. 16.  Cyprus’s banks opened their doors for the first time since
policy makers imposed losses on depositors and bondholders,
escalating  Europe ’s debt crisis for investors. Pier Luigi
Bersani, leader of Italy’s biggest coalition, will report today
on his negotiations to form a government after saying “only an
insane person” would want to rule the nation at the moment.  “We expect the volatility and widening mode to continue,”
analysts led by Mark Harmer at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam wrote
in a note. “It seems that any negative headline has the
potential to trigger another bout of panic selling.”  Credit-default swaps on Italian sovereign debt climbed 15.5
basis points to 310.5. Contracts on  Spain  increased 13 basis
points to 302.25.  The extra yield investors demand to hold European financial
bonds instead of government debt jumped to 176 basis points, the
highest since Feb. 8, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s Euro Financial Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
