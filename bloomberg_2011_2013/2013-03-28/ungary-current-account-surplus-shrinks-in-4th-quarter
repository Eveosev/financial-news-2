Hungaryâ€™s current-account surplus
narrowed more than economists forecast in the fourth quarter.  The surplus was 242 million euros ($310 million), compared
with a revised 843 million-euro surplus in the third quarter and
a surplus of 1 million euros a year earlier, the Budapest-based
central bank said in an e-mailed statement today. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12 economists was for 268
million euros.  Hungary, whose economy is suffering from a second recession
in four years, has run current-account surpluses for the past
three quarters, central bank data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
