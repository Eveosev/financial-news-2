Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby will
miss eight to nine months with a torn ligament in his left knee,
the Premier League soccer club said on its website.  Diaby, 26, suffered the injury in training yesterday and
scans revealed a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Surgery will
be scheduled for a later date, Arsenal said.  Diaby has been limited to just 42 appearances over the past
three seasons because of injury. He’s played in 16 games this
campaign, missing more than three months with a thigh problem.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
