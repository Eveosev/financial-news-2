Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s
largest maker of computer-networking equipment, is cutting 500
jobs, or less than 1 percent of its total workforce, as the
company focuses on businesses that are growing.  “We routinely review our business to determine where we
need to align investments based on growth opportunities,” Karen Tillman, a spokeswoman for  San Jose , California-based Cisco,
said in a statement. “This week, Cisco performed a limited
restructuring that will impact approximately 500 employees.”  Cisco and networking companies such as  Juniper Networks
Inc. (JNPR)  and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  are facing increased competition
from rivals such as Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei Technologies Co.
at a time when capital expenditures are under pressure. They are
also grappling with a shift toward “software-defined
networking,” which performs tasks that have typically been
handled by routers and switches.  The pressures prompted FBR & Co. analyst  Scott Thompson  to
lower his rating on Cisco stock on March 21, citing how the
innovations “blur the lines” between networking equipment and
standard computer servers.  Cisco  rose  0.3 percent to $20.90 at the close in New York.
The shares had advanced 6.3 percent this year compared with a 10
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  With the latest cuts, Cisco will have eliminated 8,300 jobs
over the past two years as it has exited consumer businesses
while expanding in corporate software and technology services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
