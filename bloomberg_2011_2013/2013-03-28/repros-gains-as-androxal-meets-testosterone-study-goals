Repros Therapeutics Inc., (RPRX)  maker of
an experimental drug to restore normal testosterone levels to
men with hypogonadism, gained the most in more than two years
after the drug met study goals.  Repros soared 76 percent to $16.10 at the close in New
York, for the biggest one-day  increase  since December 2010. The
shares of the Woodlands, Texas-based company have almost
quadrupled in the past 12 months.  The medicine, Androxal, is designed to treat men with
secondary  hypogonadism , a condition characterized by low levels
of the hormone testosterone caused by a problem in the
hypothalamus or pituitary gland, according to the  Mayo Clinic .
The 151-patient study showed that 79 percent of men treated with
Androxal reached a 24-hour average testosterone level in the
normal range, the company said today in a statement, meeting the
study’s main goal.  Androxal also was shown to be generally well-tolerated and
met a “non-inferiority” goal in sperm count compared with
placebo, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
