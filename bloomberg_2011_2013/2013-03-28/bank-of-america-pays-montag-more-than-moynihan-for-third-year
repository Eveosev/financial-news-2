Bank of America Corp.  co-Chief
Operating Officer Thomas K. Montag received a 21 percent raise
to $14.5 million for 2012, topping his boss  Brian T. Moynihan 
for the third straight year.  Montag, 56, got a $5.46 million cash bonus for 2012,
$8.19 million in restricted stock units and an $850,000 base
salary, the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based lender said today in
a regulatory  filing . That compares with the $12 million awarded
to Moynihan, 53, giving the chief executive officer a raise of
more than 70 percent from 2011.  “This says to everybody that Brian is OK with Tom getting
a superior compensation; Montag is doing a great job in a
business that’s very tough right now,” said  Jeanne Branthover ,
managing director at Boyden Global Executive Search Ltd. in New
York. “However, Brian is catching up with him in pay as other
divisions are starting to recover.”  Bank of America, the  second-largest U.S. lender , has relied
on Montag’s investment-banking operations to support the company
while Moynihan dealt with struggling consumer units that handle
mortgages and credit cards. Montag is the former head of trading
at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  who joined Bank of America during
its 2009 takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co.  Income at Bank of America’s global banking and markets
divisions slipped 3.6 percent last year to $6.8 billion as
revenues from equities sales and trading dropped 24 percent.
Montag contended with “challenging economic periods, delivering
solid revenues, while reducing noninterest expense,” the lender
said in the filing.  Beating CEOs  Moynihan wasn’t the only bank CEO who earned less than
Montag.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  chief  Jamie Dimon ’s pay was cut 50
percent to $11.5 million after a review concluded he bore
responsibility for the $6.2 billion “London Whale” trading
loss.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s  James Gorman  saw his compensation drop
7.1 percent to $9.75 million.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  gave new CEO
Michael Corbat $11.5 million, excluding the value of profit-
sharing plans.  David Darnell, the 60-year-old Bank of America co-COO who
runs retail banking and wealth management, got a 19 percent
raise to $9.5 million in total compensation. Chief Financial
Officer  Bruce Thompson , 48, got a 10 percent raise to $11
million. While the lender disclosed the size of executives’
restricted-stock grants last month, it didn’t release total
compensation figures until today.  The annual base salaries of Montag and Darnell for 2013
rose last month to $1 million from $850,000 each, the company
said. Moynihan’s base salary rose to $1.5 million from $950,000.  SEC Standard  The figures represent what the bank’s board decided top
executives deserved for their  performance  last year. Bank of
America also released calculations conforming to U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission standards that reflect the awards that
vested during the year, as well as changes in pension plans and
perks such as the use of corporate aircraft.  Under that method, Moynihan’s 2012 compensation was $8.3
million, compared with $8.1 million the previous year. Montag
received $14.4 million, compared with $14.3 million in 2011.
Most of the compensation of top executives is in the form of
share units to be paid in the future if they meet performance
targets.  Moynihan’s use of corporate aircraft was valued at
$477,060, while Thompson’s was pegged at $5,237.  To contact the reporter on this story:
