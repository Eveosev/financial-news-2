China  stocks  fell, dragging the  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  down the most in three weeks, as banks tumbled on
concern new wealth-management product rules will hurt earnings
and as the government signaled more flexible  interest rates .  Industrial Bank Co. lost 9.2 percent, while China Minsheng
Banking Corp. declined 7.6 percent, leading a gauge of  financial 
companies to an 11-week low. A directive from the banking
regulator for lenders to limit the investment of client funds in
debt that isn’t publicly traded will hurt revenue for some banks
by 2 percent, according to a Citic Securities Co. report today.  “The regulation will hurt banks’ profits,” Zhou Lin, an
analyst at Huatai Securities Co., said by phone from Nanjing.
That will drag on stocks because “banks have a big weighting”
on benchmark indexes, he said.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 2.4 percent to 2,245.57
at 10:27 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 Index, which tracks stocks
in Shanghai and Shenzhen, tumbled 2.9 percent, the most since
March 4, to 2,508.96.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index dropped 1.7 percent.  The CSI 300 Financials Index slumped 4.7 percent, the most
since March 4 and the  biggest drop  among the CSI 300’s 10
industry groups. The rule to cap investment by Chinese banks’
wealth management products in non-exchange traded products will
reduce growth of total social financing, leading to pessimistic
expectations about economic recovery, analysts led by Mao
Changqing at Citic Securities wrote in a report today.  Banks also fell on concern the government will relax or
remove a cap on  deposit rates  or the floor on lending rates.
China will introduce new measures to promote “interest-rate and
exchange-rate liberalization,” the State Council, or cabinet,
said in a statement yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
