Indonesia ’s bonds headed for the
worst three-month loss in two years on concern a government plan
to cut subsidies will spur inflation. The rupiah fell for a
seventh quarter in the longest losing streak since 1998.  Contracts measuring the nation’s credit risk climbed to an
almost seven-month high as official data showed  global investors 
pared purchases of local debt to 160 billion rupiah ($16
million) this month through March 26, from 8.43 trillion rupiah
in February. Indonesia is considering steps to limit subsidized-
fuel usage while not ruling out price increases, Finance
Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said last week. Consumer prices
gained 5.31 percent in February, the most in 20 months, the
latest figures show.  “There is no clear indication on what will be done to fuel
subsidies, but inflation will start rising from the February
high even before any real changes in policy,” said Billie
Fuliangsahar, the head of treasury at PT Rabobank International
Indonesia in Jakarta. “I still see current yields as too low,
considering the risks.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 climbed
41 basis points since Dec. 31 to 5.60 percent as of 8:56 a.m. in
Jakarta, the most since the three months through March 2011,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield
rose 25 basis points in March and fell one basis point today.
Local financial markets are shut tomorrow for a holiday.  Five-year  credit-default swaps  on Indonesia’s debt rose 24
basis points this quarter to 160 basis points yesterday, the
highest since Sept. 5, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  Rupiah Falls  The rupiah weakened 0.9 percent this quarter to 9,724 per
dollar, prices from local banks show. It traded at a 0.5 percent
premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which rose
0.6 percent in the same period to 9,771, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Both the spot rate and the forward contracts
advanced 0.1 percent today.  Bank Indonesia  increased dollar supply in the domestic
market in January to support the rupiah and reduce the gap
between its local and overseas rates, which reached the widest
since September 2011 at 2.6 percent on Jan. 11, Hendar,
 executive director  for monetary policy, said that month.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,730 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,753 the previous day and 9,792 on Dec. 31.
Today’s rate will be released at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed three basis points, 0.03 percentage point, this quarter
to 5.78 percent. It dropped eight basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
