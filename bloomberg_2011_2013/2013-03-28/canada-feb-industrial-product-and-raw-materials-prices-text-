The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by  Statistics Canada .  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) rose 1.4% in
February, led by higher prices for petroleum and coal products.
The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) increased 2.2% as a result
of higher prices for crude oil.  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  After remaining nearly unchanged in the last few months,
the IPPI grew 1.4% in February, its largest advance since June
2008. Although petroleum and coal products were mainly
responsible for the increase, all major commodity groups except
meat, fish and dairy products were up.  The petroleum and coal products group (+6.6%) posted its
largest gain since March 2011. Price increases were observed for
most products, including gasoline (+8.3%) and  diesel fuel 
(+5.6%). The increase in gasoline prices was partly attributable
to reduced supply and higher world prices for crude oil. The
IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products rose 0.6% in February.  Motor vehicles and other transportation equipment (+1.0%)
also contributed to the advance of the IPPI in February,
primarily as a result of higher prices for motor vehicles. The
depreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar was
largely responsible for this increase.  Some Canadian producers who export their products report
their prices in US dollars. Consequently, the 1.8% decrease in
the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar may
have the effect of increasing the IPPI. Without the measurable
effect of the exchange rate, the index would have risen 1.0%
instead of 1.4%.  Among the other commodity groups that contributed to the
upward movement was primary metal products (+1.3%), specifically
aluminum products (+2.5%), copper and copper alloy products
(+2.7%) and other non-ferrous metal products (+1.0%). Prices for
primary metal products have been fluctuating on a monthly basis
since November 2012.  In contrast, meat, fish and dairy products (-0.3%) declined
because of lower prices for meat products. It was the only major
commodity group that decreased in February.  Industrial Product Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with February 2012, the IPPI increased 1.0%, after
edging down 0.1% in January.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the advance of
the IPPI was largely a result of petroleum and coal products
(+3.6%), specifically diesel fuel (+5.0%) and gasoline (+3.4%).
The IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products was up 0.7% on a
year-over-year basis.  With a 9.7% increase, lumber and other wood products also
made a substantial contribution to the year-over-year increase
of the IPPI. Higher prices for lumber and ties (+18.1%) were
largely responsible for the increase. Prices for lumber and
other wood products continued the upward trend observed since
February 2012.  Motor vehicles and other transportation equipment posted a
1.0% year-over-year gain, mostly a result of the 1.3%
depreciation in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar.
Without the measurable effect of the exchange rate, the IPPI
would have risen 0.7% instead of 1.0% on a year-over-year basis.  Among the other commodity groups that posted increases was
fruit, vegetables and feeds (+2.3%), specifically feeds (+10.9%).  In contrast, the increase of the IPPI was moderated mainly
by primary metal products (-3.8%). The largest year-over-year
declines were in iron and steel products (-2.8%), aluminum
products (-5.4%) and nickel products (-12.2%).  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  The RMPI rose 2.2% in February, the second consecutive
monthly advance. All major product groups were up, except for
non-metallic minerals.  The increase of the index was mostly a result of mineral
fuels (+3.3%), particularly crude petroleum (+3.5%). The RMPI
excluding mineral fuels was up 1.3% in February.  Upward pressure was also exerted on the RMPI by non-ferrous
metals (+2.7%), which increased mainly because of higher prices
for copper concentrates (+3.8%) and zinc concentrates (+6.2%).  Raw Materials Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with the same month one year earlier, the RMPI
decreased 2.0%, continuing the downward trend that began in
March 2012.  The decline of the RMPI was largely because of mineral
fuels (-4.8%), specifically crude petroleum (-4.8%). The RMPI
excluding mineral fuels increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis.  Compared with February 2012, non-ferrous metals (-1.0%)
were also down, primarily as a result of lower prices for
radioactive concentrates (-15.8%) and precious metals (-6.3%).  The year-over-year decline of the RMPI was moderated
slightly by vegetable products (+4.5%), wood products (+2.7%)
and animals and animal products (+1.0%).  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months (for
example, when the July index is released, the index for the
previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product  Price Index  (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including the transportation, wholesale, and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes the full
effect of exchange rates into account.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the  Bank of Canada , and it is available on CANSIM in table
176-0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
