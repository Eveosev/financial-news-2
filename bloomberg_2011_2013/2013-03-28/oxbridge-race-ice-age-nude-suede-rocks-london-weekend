An Ice-Age nude, a legendary boat race and a gourmet Easter Egg meal are among Muse’s arts and leisure recommendations this weekend.  STAGE  It’s your last chance to see a couple talk over their relationship in the tub. “Mydidae” (a Jack Thorne play ending Saturday at the Trafalgar Studios) has naked Marian and David discuss their past, which seems banal enough until you find out there was a tragedy along the way. Expect more soul- than flesh-baring:  http://www.atgtickets.com  or +44-844-871-7632.  Brand new to  London  is “The Book of Mormon,” which broke West End records with more than 2 million pounds ($3.03 million) of tickets sold in just 14 hours. Critics are split, audiences excited. In case you want to boost box-office totals:  http://www.bookofmormonlondon.com  or +44-844-482-5110.  DINING  Corrigan’s Mayfair celebrates this weekend with an Easter-egg-decorating master class and lunch on Saturday. It’s 50 pounds for adults and 30 pounds for children, who can keep their chocolate creations. The three-course Sunday lunch is 27 pounds.

Chef Alexis Gauthier has just published “ Vegetronic ,” a book that celebrates vegetables as the main ingredients in dishes that might also feature meat or fish. The restaurant offers a  Vegetronic Menu  and lists calories per dish. Information:  http://www.gauthiersoho.co.uk/  or +44-20-7494-3111.  VISUAL ARTS  What’s so modern about modern art? Not much, judging by the 23,000-year-old sculpture of a nude woman that opens the  British Museum ’s “Ice Age Art: The Arrival of the Modern Mind.” Made of mammoth ivory, the tiny, bulbous figure seems a miniature  Henry Moore ; Picasso kept two replicas of it in his atelier. See also the oldest known portrait of a woman -- 26,000 years old, with a dimple in her chin. Through May 26. For information:  http://www.britishmuseum.org.uk  or +44-20-7323-8181.  Ending at Tate Modern is “A Bigger Splash: Painting after Performance,” a survey of action- and performance-based art. It opens with the famous David Hockney picture of a diving board moments after use:  http://www.tate.org.uk  or +44-20-7887-8888.  MUSIC  Bach’s St. John Passion gets its Easter performance at the Barbican, this time by the Academy of Ancient Music. The voices and period-instrument players are directed from the harpsichord by Richard Egarr.  March 29, 3 p.m. at Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2Y 8BS. Information: +44-7638-8891,  http://www.barbican.org.uk .  Suede, one of the most critically lauded groups of the 1990s, is touring to mark its first album in a decade. Brett Anderson’s men will be reprising singles such as “Trash” as well as songs off the new “Bloodsports.”  March 30, Alexandra Palace, N22 7AY.

Cambridge tops the scoreboard so far, with 81 wins against 76 (the year 1877 was a tie). The bridges and riverside pubs will be packed. Will Oxford narrow the gap this year?
