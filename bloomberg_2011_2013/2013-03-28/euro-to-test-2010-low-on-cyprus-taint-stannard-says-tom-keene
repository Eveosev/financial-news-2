The euro will decline to its lowest
level in almost three years as a bailout for Cyprus raises the
threat of further euro-zone contagion, according to Morgan
Stanley’s Ian Stannard.  “What we’re now seeing, with regards to the continued
levels of uncertainty that have been building in the market, is
a case where the euro is going to remain under some pressure in
the near-term,” Stannard, head of European currency strategy at
Morgan Stanley, said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Joe Brusuelas. “The euro is
going to continue to remain under pressure over the coming year
into next year.”  The 17-nation currency will fall to $1.26 in the next year
as investors lose confidence in the market, followed by further
depreciation to the $1.19 area, Stannard said. That would be the
weakest level for the euro since June 2010.  The euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.2819 at 2:18 p.m. New
York time, paring its second weekly loss. It reached $1.2751,
its low for the year, on March 27. The shared currency declined
0.1 percent to 120.52 yen.  Cyprus avoided default and an exit from the 17-nation euro
by bowing to demands by European leaders to shrink its banking
system, including imposing losses on uninsured depositors at the
island’s biggest bank, in exchange for a 10 billion-euro ($12.8
billion) assistance package.  ‘Internal Imbalances’  “What we could see is deposit shifts or capital shifts
taking place within the euro zone if we start to see a move away
from weaker banks into stronger banks,” Stannard said. “That
could create internal imbalances.”  The European Commission forecast in February that the
region’s economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013, marking its
first annual back-to-back contraction since the euro was
introduced in 1999.  “The euro is reacting as much to data shocks as to event
risks,” Stannard said.  The median projection of 62 strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg calls for the euro to reach $1.29 by year-end before
depreciating to $1.27 by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
