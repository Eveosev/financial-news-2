The Bank of  France  boosted
provisions for potential losses by 49 percent after increasing
the size of its balance sheet as part of the  European Central
Bank ’s crisis-fighting measures.  The Bank of France set aside 5.66 billion euros ($7.27
billion) in potential loss provisions in its annual accounts, up
from 3.81 billion euros in 2011, Governor  Christian Noyer  told
journalists in Paris today. Bond purchases under the aegis of
the ECB helped lift net income to 3.15 billion euros from 1.57
billion in 2011.  “Our profit is up but a substantial part of this has been
used to cover our increased risk,” Noyer said. “We need to
have capital adapted to the risks we face.”  Germany’s Bundesbank said earlier this month that it
increased provisions for general risks by 6.7 billion euros to
14.4 billion euros.  Noyer also said that the Bank of France had earned about
450 million euros in interest on its holdings of Greek
 government bonds . Those funds will be transfered to Greece
through the French government under the terms of euro-area
agreements, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
