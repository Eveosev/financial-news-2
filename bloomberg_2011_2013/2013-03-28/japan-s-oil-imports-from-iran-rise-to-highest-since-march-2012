Japan ’s crude imports from Iran
rose 16 percent in February from a year earlier to the highest
level since March 2012, boosting its intake despite sanctions
against the Middle Eastern nation.  Oil purchases last month climbed to 1.43 million
kiloliters, or about 321,000 barrels a day, up from 1.23 million
kiloliters in February 2012, according to data today from the
Ministry of Finance. Imports were up 67 percent from 857,700
kiloliters in January, according to the data. Shipments from
Iran in March 2012 were 1.75 million.  Japan’s total crude purchases dropped 2.7 percent in
February to 18.7 million kiloliters, the  finance ministry   said 
March 21.  Refiners have reduced their imports on a yearly basis so
they probably aren’t concerned that a single month of increased
purchases from  Iran  could jeopardize Japan’s waiver from
sanctions, said Osamu Fujisawa, an independent energy economist
in  Tokyo  who worked for Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Showa Shell
Sekiyu K.K. The U.S. and its allies have banned banks from doing
business with the Persian Gulf nation to entice it to halt its
nuclear program.  “I don’t think the  oil companies  are worrying about
Iranian crude imports,” Fujisawa said. “They take a look at
the annual figures from last year and see they were quite low.”  Japan’s purchases from Iran last year declined 39 percent
to 11.1 million kiloliters from 18.2 million kiloliters in 2011,
according to the finance ministry.  The U.S. extended Japan’s exemption from sanctions for six
months because of the Asian country’s steps to reduce imports,
Secretary of State  John Kerry   said  March 13.  The U.S. and the European Union have said Iran’s nuclear
development is aimed at producing weapons, while the government
in Tehran says the project is for civilian purposes. Along with
the U.S. sanctions, the EU has passed measures prohibiting
insurers from covering vessels carrying Iranian oil cargoes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
