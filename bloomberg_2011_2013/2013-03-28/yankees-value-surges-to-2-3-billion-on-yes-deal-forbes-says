The  New York  Yankees’ value surged
24 percent to $2.3 billion in 2012, making it the most valuable
franchise in Major League Baseball for a 16th straight year,
 Forbes magazine  said in its annual survey of the sport.  Forbes’ valuation of the Yankees rose after  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
Fox unit signed a rights fee agreement with the club as part of
a deal to buy 49 percent of YES Network. Under the contract, the
Yankees will receive $85 million this year, while the annual
payment will rise to $350 million in 2042, the report said.  The Yankees had operating income of $1.4 million in 2012
from revenue of $471 million, Forbes said.  The value of the average team climbed by 23 percent, the
most since Forbes began the survey in 1998, to $744 million.
Revenue rose 7 percent to $227 million on average, while
operating income dropped 9 percent to $13.1 million on average
on higher player costs and stadium expenses.  The  Los Angeles Dodgers  are second on the list with a value
of $1.62 billion, followed by the  Boston Red Sox  at $1.3
billion, the  Chicago Cubs  at $1 billion and the Philadelphia
Phillies at $893 million.  The New York Mets, with revenue at $232 million and an
operating loss of $2.4 million, were sixth on the list of 30
teams with a valuation of $811 million, 13 percent more than a
year ago.  The five teams with the lowest valuations are the Tampa Bay
Rays at $451 million, the Kansas City Royals at $457 million,
the Oakland Athletics at $468 million, the Pittsburgh Pirates at
$479 million and the  Miami Marlins  at $520 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
