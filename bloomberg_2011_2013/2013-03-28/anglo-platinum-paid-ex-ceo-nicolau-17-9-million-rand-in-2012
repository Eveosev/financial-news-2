Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
worldâ€™s biggest producer of the metal, paid former Chief
Executive Officer Neville Nicolau 17.9 million rand ($2 million)
in 2012.  Nicolau, who left the company on July 19, was paid a basic
salary of 4.3 million rand and 12.6 million rand of cash awards
that include termination payments, the Johannesburg-based
company said in its  annual report  on its website. His earnings
compare with the 15.3 million rand he was paid in 2011.  Amplats, as the Anglo American Plc unit is known, reported
a loss in the year through December as sales of refined platinum
dropped and cash operating costs rose. The company in January
proposed shutting four mine shafts to curb costs and stem losses
spurred by a strike last year. The shares declined 16 percent
last year.  Chris Griffith, the former CEO of Anglo unit Kumba Iron
Ore, started on Sept. 1 and was paid 6.79 million rand, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
