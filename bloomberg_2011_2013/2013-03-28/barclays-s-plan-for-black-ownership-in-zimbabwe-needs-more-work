Barclays Plc’s plan to increase
black ownership of its Zimbabwean unit needs further work, said
the country’s Indigenization Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere .  “We’re not unhappy with their plan, but it needs further
work and tidying up,” Kasukuwere said today in a telephone
interview from the capital, Harare.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, has
said its business in in the southern African country is 32
percent-owned by Zimbabweans. George Guvamatanga, managing
director of the unit listed on the  Zimbabwe  Stock Exchange,
didn’t immediately answer phone calls to his office today.  Under the country’s law, foreign and white-owned companies
must sell or cede 51 percent of their shares to black
Zimbabweans or the state-owned National Indigenization and
Economic Empowerment Board. Kasukuwere, a member of the Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front party that pushed the law
through parliament, said  Barclays (BARC) ’s plan needs more discussion.  Police arrested a second official from the Anti-Corruption
Commission after the body attempted to search the offices of the
indigenization board, Zimbabwe’s state-controlled Herald
newspaper reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
