Sinopharm Group Co. (1099) ,  China ’s
biggest drug distributor, posted the largest decline in almost
three years in Hong Kong trading after saying it will sell as
much as HK$4 billion ($515 million) in new shares.  Sinopharm fell 7.2 percent to HK$25.05 at the close in Hong
Kong, the largest drop since May 25, 2010. The stock was the
fourth-biggest decliner on the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan
Index.  The company  will sell as many as 165.7 million shares to
between six and 10 non-retail investors at HK$24.60 each to
raise money for expanding its sales network, Shanghai-based
Sinopharm said in a filing today. That’s 8.9 percent less than
the stock’s closing price yesterday. The number of shares is
equivalent to 16.67 percent and 6.45 percent, respectively, of
Sinopharm’s enlarged H-share and total issued share capital
after the sale, it said.  “The company needed the money to continue growing,” Carol Xiao, a Shanghai-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian Investment Co.
said today. Sinopharm will probably sell additional shares after
this year to fund growth, she said.  Sinopharm said it will use the funds raised “for the
expansion of pharmaceutical distribution and retail network and
replenishment of liquidity after the expansion.”  State-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp. will
retain control of the company after the sale, according to the
statement.  Morgan Stanley, UBS AG and China International Capital
Corp. are the placing agents for the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
