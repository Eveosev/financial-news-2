EON SE, Germany’s biggest utility,
plans to buy as much as 1.56 billion reais ($776 million) in
shares of  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  from billionaire  Eike Batista  making it
the largest shareholder in the Brazilian company.  EON agreed to acquire 25 percent of MPX’s shares from
Batista for as much as 11 reais a share, MPX said in a
statement. The sale will reduce the billionaire’s stake to 24
percent from 54 percent and increase EON’s ownership to 36
percent. Batista and EON will reach a shareholders agreement to
regulate  voting rights  at MPX, it said.  MPX will also offer 1.2 billion reais in shares to other
investors to raise capital, the company said. MPX hired Banco
BTG Pactual SA to carry out the share sale for at least 10 reais
a share.  Shares in Batista’s public companies have declined as much
as 84 percent in the past year after his OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA cut oil output targets, erasing more than $25
billion of his personal fortune.  The deal will give EON a vehicle for growth in Brazil, the
second-biggest emerging market after China. MPX will get
additional financing management support from EON as it expands
power generation plants to meet robust growth in electricity
demand, MPX said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
