Euro banknotes have been supplied
to Cyprus as a precautionary measure and the quantity greatly
exceeds how much is needed, a spokesman for the Bundesbank said.  The notes were part of a stock that the European Central
Bank holds at the German institution, a spokesman for the
Bundesbank in  Frankfurt  said by telephone today. The ECB asked
the German institution to transport banknotes to the Cypriot
central bank before lenders opened today after a closure that
lasted almost two weeks, he said.  The spokesman declined to comment on the amount
transferred. German newspaper Handelsblatt reported earlier
today that the Bundesbank flew 5 billion euros ($7.6 billion) of
its own notes to the Mediterranean island.  The amount of banknotes provided to the Cypriot central
bank is much larger than whatâ€™s needed and is a precautionary
measure to prevent commercial banks from running out of cash and
to avoid panic, the spokesman said.  Cypriot banks closed on March 16 when European finance
ministers proposed a levy on deposits as a condition for a
European Union-led bailout. The government implemented capital
controls to prevent a bank run, which include a 300-euro daily
limit on withdrawals and restrictions on transfers to accounts
outside the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
