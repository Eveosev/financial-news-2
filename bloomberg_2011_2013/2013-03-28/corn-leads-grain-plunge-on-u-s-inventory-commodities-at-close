bushels in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter,
the Department of Agriculture said today. While that’s down 10

billion. Farmers will sow 97.282 million acres, up from 97.155
million in 2012 and the most in 77 years, the USDA said.  Corn futures for May delivery plunged by the exchange’s 40-
