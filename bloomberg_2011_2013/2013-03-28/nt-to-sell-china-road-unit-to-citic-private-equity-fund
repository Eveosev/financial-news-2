TNT Express NV (TNTE)  agreed to sell its
Hoau domestic road operations in China to private equity funds
as the delivery company focuses on European business following
the failure of a takeover by  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)   The sale of Hoau for an undisclosed amount to funds managed
by a Hong Kong-based affiliate of Citic Group Corp. is expected
to close in the second half of the year, Hoofddorp, Netherlands-
based TNT said in today a statement. Settlement of some of the
deal will occur in 2014, it said.  TNT is reorganizing after Atlanta-based UPS, the world’s
biggest package-delivery company, terminated a 5.16 billion-euro
($6.6 billion) bid in January, when European Union regulators
signaled they would block the deal. TNT’s preparations for the
disposal of Brazilian assets have begun as part of the
turnaround plan, which also involves cutting 4,000 jobs.  “TNT Express will focus on offering the broadest range of
international services to and from  China ,” where it maintains
gateways abroad from Beijing,  Shanghai , and Shenzhen, interim
Chief Executive Officer Bernard Bot said in the statement.  Hoau was subject of a 75 million-euro writedown last year
as the unit was marked for disposal. No further writedown is
expected, TNT said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
