Latam Airlines Group SA, the
airline created by the merger of  Chile ’s Lan and Brazil’s Tam,
sank to a 17-month low after its frequent-flier unit canceled a
plan to sell additional shares.  Latam Airlines fell 2.1 percent to 10,189 pesos at 1:57
p.m. in Santiago trading, the lowest price since Oct. 4, 2011.  Multiplus SA (MPLU3) , the Sao Paulo-based frequent-flier unit of
Santiago-based Latam Airlines, canceled a plan to sell as many
as 36.5 million new shares due to unfavorable conditions,
according to a regulatory filing today. At today’s price, the
sale would have raised about 1.08 billion reais ($535 million).  “They may not have this extra cash they were planning to
raise,” Oswaldo Pacheco, an analyst with BCI Corredor de Bolsa,
said in a telephone interview from Santiago.  Multiplus rose 4.4 percent in  Sao Paulo  to 29.61 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
