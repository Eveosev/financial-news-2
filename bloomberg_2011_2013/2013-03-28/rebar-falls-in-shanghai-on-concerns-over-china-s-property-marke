Steel reinforcement-bar futures
declined with  China ’s stocks on concerns that further tightening
measures in the property sector may damp demand.  Futures for delivery in October dropped as much as 1.2
percent to 3,841  yuan  ($618) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange, before trading at 3,847 yuan at 11:08 a.m.
Shanghai time. The most-active contract has lost 11 percent
after climbing to a 10-month high of 4,297 yuan on Feb. 8.  China’s southern city of Shenzhen is likely to raise the
down payment for second home purchases to 70 percent from 60
percent in April, the 21st Century Business Herald reported
today. Cities in China’s central and western provinces may issue
detailed property-curb policies next month, the China Securities
Journal reported. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index sank as
much as 2.6 percent today, the most in three weeks, as the
 Shanghai Property Index (SHPROP)  tumbled 2.7 percent.  “Rebar is affected by the weakening sentiment for China’s
stocks,” said Huang Huiwen, an analyst at Shanghai Cifco
Futures Co. “Investors are worried about the policy
uncertainties as the new leaders take office.”  The average spot  price  of rebar fell 0.1 percent to 3,670
