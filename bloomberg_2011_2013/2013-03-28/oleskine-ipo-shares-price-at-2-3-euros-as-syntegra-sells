Moleskine, the Italian maker of
notebooks once favored by  Ernest Hemingway , priced shares in its
initial public offering at 2.30 euros ($2.94), according to a
term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News.  The shares sold just below the midpoint of the original
range, which was 2.00 euros to 2.65 euros, according to an
earlier term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News on March 4. Owners
Appunti Sarl and Pentavest Sarl are selling a 50 percent stake
in the company, the terms showed.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Mediobanca SpA (MB)  are
managing the sale in Italy, along with BNP Paribas SA, the terms
today showed.  Syntegra Capital, which owned about 68 percent of
Moleskine, is expected to retain a significant stake in the
company after the IPO. Appunti is indirectly controlled by
Syntegra and Pentavest is controlled by Index Ventures Growth I
(Jersey), according to an Italian regulatory  filing .  The shareholders are selling 106 million ordinary shares,
according to Moleskineâ€™s IPO  prospectus . At 2.30 euros per
share, the company is raising 245 million euros, which would
value the notebook maker at 490 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
