Cole Credit Property Trust III said
it would review a $6.7 billion offer from  American Realty (ARCP) 
Capital Properties Inc. and meet with the company to discuss its
proposal.  The Phoenix-based non-traded real estate investment trust
still intends to buy the company that sponsors it, Cole Holdings
Corp., with plans to go public after the merger, according to a
statement today. American Realty yesterday bid $12.50 a share in
cash or 0.80 a share of its common stock for each share of Cole
Credit, raising an earlier offer.  A special committee of Cole’s board of directors “will
carefully review the revised proposal in consultation with its
advisers, and pursue the course of action that it believes is in
the best interests of CCPT III and its stockholders,” according
to the statement.  Cole, the owner of more than 900 mostly single-tenant
office, retail and industrial properties, rejected American
Realty’s initial offer of $12 a share, saying it undervalued the
company.  American Realty revised its bid to include the acquisition
of Cole Holdings and take into account property data suggesting
increased value for Cole Credit, the New York-based company said
yesterday in a letter to Cole Credit’s board. The new bid is
valued at about $9.7 billion, including the assumption of debt.
Under the stock-payment plan, American Realty guaranteed to pay
at least $13.59 for each Cole Credit share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
