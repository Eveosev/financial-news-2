Italian business confidence
unexpectedly rose in March even after inconclusive elections
last month produced a political gridlock in the nation mired in
its fourth recession since 2001.  The manufacturing-sentiment index rose to 88.9 from a
revised 88.6 the previous month, Rome-based national statistics
institute Istat said today. Economists had predicted a reading
of 88, according to the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Italy’s Feb. 24-25 vote failed to produce a clear majority,
raising concerns the next government may fail to address the
country’s economic issues.  Outgoing Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said last week that
gross domestic product will fall 1.3 percent this year as
exports may fail to offset the effect of shrinking domestic
demand. That compares with a 1.8 percent contraction forecast by
 Fitch Ratings  earlier this month.  Industrial output unexpectedly rose in January, led by
increases in production of food and beverages and textiles,
Istat said in a March 19 report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
