The United Nations Security Council
unanimously approved creation of an “intervention brigade”
that can hunt down and open fire on armed rebels in the eastern
region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The 15-member body voted today for a change from
traditional UN peacekeeping forces, which can’t retaliate unless
attacked. Despite the presence of a 20,000-person UN force,
armed groups have thrived in the country’s remote eastern hills
for more than a decade. M23 rebels captured the city of Goma,
the capital of North Kivu province, in November before
withdrawing in December.  African troops will make up the special unit, which will
flank and support the peacekeepers. The resolution makes clear
that the Goma-based intervention brigade -- consisting of three
infantry battalions, one artillery unit and a special forces and
reconnaissance company -- was formed on an exceptional basis and
will have a “clear exit strategy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
