Quebec  Finance Minister Nicolas Marceau today affirmed his earlier forecast that the province
will post a C$1.5 billion ($1.5 billion) deficit in the fiscal
year that ends March 31 and balance its books in fiscal 2014.  Economic growth in  Canada ’s second most populous province
will be 1.3 percent this year, down from a November forecast of
1.5 percent, Marceau told reporters at a televised press
conference in  Quebec City  today. Marceau also cut his forecast
for 2014 to 1.8 percent from 2 percent.  The slower growth will cut revenue by C$250 million in the
2012-13 fiscal year and by C$565 million in 2013-14, Marceau
said. “The fourth quarter was not as good as we expected last
year, particularly the month of December,” he said.  Quebec will make up the C$250 million shortfall this fiscal
year by using C$150 million from an existing contingency
reserve, by paying C$95 million less in debt servicing costs and
by receiving an additional C$5 million in transfer payments from
the federal government, Finance Ministry  documents  show.  For the fiscal year that begins April 1, Quebec expects to
receive C$280 million in additional federal transfers. Quebec
also expects to save C$85 million in debt-servicing costs and
use half of a planned C$400 million reserve to make up the C$565
million shortfall and balance the books.  Quebec’s net debt will be about C$176.6 billion as of March
31, and climb to C$180.7 billion by March 2014, equal to 48.8%
of gross domestic product, government documents show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
