Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) , Brazil’s
second-largest foodmaker, posted a fourth-quarter net loss that
was higher than analysts  expected  after the cost of feeding its
poultry and hogs jumped.  The net loss of 284.2 million reais ($141 million), or 60
centavos a share, compares with net income of 10.4 million
reais, or 3 centavos, in the previous quarter, the Sao Paulo-
based company said in a regulatory filing late yesterday.
Marfrig was expected to post a loss of 63 million reais
excluding one-time items, the average of nine analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Marfrig doubled its processed-food capacity after the
acquisition of plants from  BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3)  last year amid
increasing prices for corn and soybeans used to feed its
livestock. Average corn prices in the quarter rose 18 percent
from a year earlier in  Chicago , while soybeans advanced 26.  It was a “tough year-end” for Marfrig’s food-processing
Seara Foods unit, Alexandre Miguel, a Sao Paulo-based analyst at
 Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , said in a note to clients before
earnings were released. Seara Foods accounts for about 70
percent of total sales.  Brasil Foods  is Brazil’s largest food maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
