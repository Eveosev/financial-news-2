The finance ministers of the 17-
nation euro-area will discuss the aid program for Cyprus at the
Eurogroup meeting in Dublin April 12 and 13, the Dutch Ministry
of Finance said.  “The troika will return to Cyprus to fulfill the
memorandum of understanding,” the ministry said in a statement
today.“In the upcoming period Cyprus will, among others, have
to restore the stability in the financial system, start to
restructure the financial sector and work on the rest of the
program, together with the troika.”  Cyprus on March 25 avoided a disorderly sovereign default
and unprecedented exit from the euro by bowing to demands from
creditors to shrink its banking system in exchange for 10
billion euros ($12.8 billion) of aid.  The Eurogroup discussions will include the loan program for
 Greece , the direct recapitalization of banks out of the European
Stability Mechanism, and the outcome of the latest mission of
the troika to Ireland to review payment of a new tranche out of
the European Financial Stability Facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
