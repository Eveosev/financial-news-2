Free-agent defensive end Osi Umenyiora joined the  Atlanta Falcons , ending a nine-year career
with the  New York  Giants.  The two-time Pro Bowl selection agreed to a two-year
contract, the National Football League team said yesterday in an
e-mailed release. Details of the deal were not announced.  Umenyiora, who was born in London, attended Troy University
in Alabama.  Umenyiora, 31, had 75 sacks and 32 forced fumbles in nine
years with the Giants, winning Super Bowl titles with the team
following the 2007 and 2011 seasons. A second-round pick in the
2003 draft, he started four games in 2012, his fewest total
since his rookie year.  The Falcons had 29 sacks last season, second fewest in the
National Football Conference behind the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers ,
with 27. This offseason Atlanta cut 34-year-old defensive end
John Abraham, who led the team with 10 sacks and six forced
fumbles in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
