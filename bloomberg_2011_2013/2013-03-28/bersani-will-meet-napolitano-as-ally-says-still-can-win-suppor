Pier Luigi Bersani will meet
Italian President Giorgio Napolitano later today as an ally in
his Democratic Party said he still could win the support he
needs to convince the head of state to give him the premiership.  Bersani told reporters in Rome he has finished his
consultations with lawmakers and would take a few hours to
reflect before heading to the presidential palace “by
evening.” The meeting with Napolitano will conclude a week in
which Bersani, 61, sought to overcome a shortfall of support in
parliament and assemble enough lawmakers to form a government.  “We think there’s still room to resolve it in a positive
way,” Luigi Zanda, head of the Democratic Party in the Senate,
said after meeting Bersani today. “As you know, it often
happens that the most delicate affairs are resolved in the last
phase.”  Lawmakers are under pressure to overcome a deadlock and
form a government capable of stimulating the weak economy and
shielding Italy from fallout from the financial  crisis in
Cyprus . Bersani’s proposal of an alliance was rejected yesterday
by Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement. His talks with Silvio Berlusconi’s People of Liberty haven’t produced an agreement so
far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
