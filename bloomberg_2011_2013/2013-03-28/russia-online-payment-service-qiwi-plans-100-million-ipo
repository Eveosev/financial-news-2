Qiwi Plc, a Russian instant-payment
operator backed by billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s  Mail.ru Group
Ltd. (MAIL)  and  Mitsui & Co. (8031) , applied for a $100 million initial public
offering in the U.S.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and
 Renaissance Capital  will manage the sale on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Qiwi said in a  U.S. filing  late yesterday. The Moscow-
based company plans to sell shares in the first half, Alexandra
Vysochkina, a spokeswoman, said by phone.  Qiwi enables merchants to accept cash and electronic
payments from as many as 65 million customers a month, the
company said. It runs 11 million virtual wallets co-branded with
 Visa Inc. (V)  and operates cash-collecting terminals and kiosks.
Revenue last year totaled $293 million, and profit attributable
to shareholders amounted to $30 million, it said.  The IPO proceeds will go to the selling shareholders and
not to the company, Qiwi said, without elaborating who plans to
dispose of stock. The founding shareholders are expected to
retain more than 50 percent of the voting power, it said.  Chief Executive Officer Sergey Solonin owns 25 percent of
Qiwi, part of the almost 60 percent held by the company’s
directors and executives, the Russian company said. Mail.ru
holds 21 percent of Qiwi shares. Solonin will keep about 25
percent voting control after the IPO, Qiwi said.  Mail.ru hasn’t yet decided whether it will sell Qiwi shares
in the IPO, spokeswoman Ksenia Chabanenko said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
