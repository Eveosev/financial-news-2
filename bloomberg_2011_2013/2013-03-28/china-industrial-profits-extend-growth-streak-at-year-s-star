Chinese industrial companies’
profits rose 17.2 percent in the January-February period,
extending a four-month streak of gains and bolstering a rebound
in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Net income increased from a year earlier to 709.2 billion
 yuan  ($114 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics said on
its website today. That compares with a 5.2 percent decline in
the same period last year and a 17.3 percent gain in December.
The bureau doesn’t release separate data for January and
February because of distortions caused by the weeklong Lunar New
Year holiday.  Higher profits will help boost investment and aid new
Premier Li Keqiang in sustaining a recovery after industrial
production and retail sales had the weakest start to a year
since 2009. Manufacturing is expanding at a faster-than-forecast
pace this month, a private survey showed last week.  “Profit growth will continue to recover” partly because
of the economic rebound, Yao Wei, China economist at Societe
Generale SA in  Hong Kong , said before the release. “It will
help boost investment growth although maybe not as significantly
as before because of the existing excess capacity.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
