Former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said he would pay a promised 4 billion-euro ($5.3
billion)  tax refund  out of his own pocket if elected in a Feb.
24-25 vote.  “By May, that sum will be returned to those who paid,”
Berlusconi said today on Rai television. “My signature means
that with that letter, anyone who paid the IMU can go to the
judge and ask me to return the money. If as prime minister I
haven’t done what I promised to do. Beyond that, I’ll take 4
billion euros of my fortune and I’ll give it to Italians. How
can you come up with a proposal more serious than that one.”  Berlusconi’s net worth is at least $6.5 billion, according
to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
