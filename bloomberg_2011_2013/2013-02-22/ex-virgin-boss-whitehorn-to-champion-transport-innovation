Will Whitehorn, former president of
Virgin Galactic Ltd., was appointed to head a U.K. government
transport-innovation center.  Whitehorn, a longtime adviser to Virgin founder  Richard Branson , will become chairman of the Transport Systems Catapult,
a project focusing on efficient and sustainable developments in
road, rail, sea and air.  “An efficient transport system that can move people and
goods in a cost-effective way is vital to the success of the UK
economy,” Science Minister David Willetts said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The Transport Systems Catapult will make sure
that new and emerging ideas to improve transport systems can be
pioneered here and exported across the globe.”  Whitehorn, who will start his new role on March 1, worked
for Virgin from 1987 to 2011 and helped establish Virgin’s first
rail franchise and develop Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., as well
as heading  Virgin Galactic , which plans to provide sub-orbital
spaceflights to space tourists, satellite deployment and space
science services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
