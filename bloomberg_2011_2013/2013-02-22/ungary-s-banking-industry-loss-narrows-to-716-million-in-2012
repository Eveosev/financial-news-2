Hungary’s banking industry remained
unprofitable in 2012 as lending fell, bad loans increased and
the government kept a special bank tax, the country’s financial
regulator said.  The industry’s combined loss narrowed to 159.1 billion
forint ($716 million) from 211.1 billion forint in 2011,
according to data published on the regulator Pszaf’s  website 
today.  Hungarian banks, straddled with the highest bank tax in
 Europe , cut lending as the economy fell into a second  recession 
in four years and investments plunged. Total loans shrank 12
percent in 2012 and bad debt accounted for 13.8 percent of total
lending at the end of last year, according to the survey.  Bad loans accounted for 16.2 percent of lending to
households, rising 50 basis points over the previous year and
are set to increase further this year, the watchdog said.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  is the country’s largest lender, whose main
competitors are Italy’s  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
Austria’s Erste Group Bank AG and  Raiffeisen Bank International
AG. (RBI)   The government is in talks with banks to boost lending in
exchange for lower special tax payments, Gyula Pleschinger,
state secretary at the  Economy Ministry  said Feb. 17. The
country’s commissioner for financial rights Gyorgy Doubravszky
will propose a “breakthrough” solution to lower the ratio of
non-performing foreign-currency mortgages, which won’t rely on
state resources, Doubravszky told news website Origo on Feb. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
