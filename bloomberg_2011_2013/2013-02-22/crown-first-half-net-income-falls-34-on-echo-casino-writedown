Crown Ltd. (CWN) , the casino company
controlled by Australian billionaire James Packer, posted a 34
percent fall in first-half profit as it wrote down the value of
its stake in rival Echo Entertainment Group.  Net income  fell to A$181 million million ($186 million) in
the six months ended December, from A$274 million a year
earlier, the Melbourne-based company said in a regulatory
statement today. That compares with the A$187 million median
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Crown bought 10 percent of Echo, operator of Sydney’s only
casino, last year as it seeks a gambling venue in  Australia ’s
largest city and finishes refurbishment at casinos in Melbourne
and Perth. Packer has announced plans to open a rival project
targeting high-rollers at the Barangaroo development site across
the harbor from  Echo (EGP) ’s Star casino. Excluding one-time items,
profit after tax fell 15 percent to A$233 million as high-
rolling gamblers won more games at its tables.  “The market is effectively pricing Crown’s domestic assets
at a discount to slow-growing U.S. regional casinos,” Mark Bryan, an analyst at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit,
wrote in a Feb. 11 note to clients.  Crown  shares  rose 1.7 percent to A$11.75 at the close of
trade in Sydney. The stock has gained 42 percent over the past
year, compared with a 17 percent advance in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index.  Packer’s proposed Sydney casino wouldn’t be completed until
2018, just before Echo’s exclusive license expires, Larry Gandler, a Melbourne-based analyst for Credit Suisse AG, said in
an Aug. 13 note to clients.  Crown’s licenses to run 4,500 slot machines and 720 gaming
tables at its casinos in the Australian cities of Melbourne and
Perth have made it the country’s largest consumer discretionary
stock by  market value . It also owns about 34 percent of  Melco
Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) , owner of Macau’s City of Dreams
casino, and 10 percent of Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
