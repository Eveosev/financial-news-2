Canada ’s dollar weakened against its
U.S. counterpart for a sixth day in the longest losing streak
since August 2011 before the release of economic data that may
add to concern the world’s 11th-largest economy is slowing.  The loonie fell against 15 of its 16 most-traded peers
before reports forecast to show Canada’s retail sales fell in
December and the  consumer price index  slowed in January to the
lowest in more than three years.  “The next major focal point will be CPI and retail
sales,”  John Curran , senior vice president at Canadianforex
Ltd., an online foreign-exchange dealer, said yesterday by phone
in Toronto. “While the CPI should not be a big driver unless we
get a high posting, a poor retail sales number might give us a
spike higher against the  U.S. dollar .”  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is nicknamed for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.1 percent to
C$1.0195 per U.S. dollar at 7:40 a.m. in Toronto. The currency
last fell for six consecutive days from July 29 to Aug. 8, 2011.
One Canadian dollar buys 98.09 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
