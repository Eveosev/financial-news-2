NBC.com , the primary website for
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC television network, was restored to normal
service after being attacked by hackers.  Network parent NBC Universal is trying to determine how the
attack occurred and how long the site was affected for, Tracy St. Pierre, a spokeswoman for the New York-based network, said
today in a telephone interview. No user data was stolen, St.
Pierre said.  Hackers infected NBC.com with Citadel Trojan, a data-
stealing malware that can spread to the machines of visitors,
according to Tony Perez, chief operating officer of  Sucuri Inc. ,
which monitors websites and can remove malware. The NBC site was
disrupted for several hours, based on Sucuri’s testing, he said.  The incident follows recent attacks on companies including
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and Twitter Inc. Those attacks were
linked to an Eastern European gang of hackers that is trying to
steal company secrets,  Bloomberg News  reported Feb. 20, citing
two people familiar with the matter.  NBC.com offers information about network news, sports and
entertainment programming and streams episodes of entertainment
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
