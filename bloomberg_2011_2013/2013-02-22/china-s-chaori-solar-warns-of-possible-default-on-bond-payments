Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science
& Technology Co. (002506) , a Chinese maker of solar cells, said it may
not be able to pay interest due March 7 to bond investors
because of liquidity difficulties.  The company may post losses of as much as 1.1 billion yuan
($176 million) for last year, the company said in a statement
dated Feb. 21 to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It’s uncertain
that controlling shareholder Ni Kailu and his daughter can reach
a final agreement with Qinghai Muli Coal Development on a stake
transfer, according to the statement.  “At present, the company’s liquidity difficulties haven’t
eased and funding remains relatively tight,” Chaori Solar said
in the statement. Its ability to make timely interest payments
to bondholders is “uncertain,” according to the statement.  Chinese solar companies including Chaori Solar,  LDK Solar
Co. (LDK)  and  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  have reported profit
declines or losses after a global equipment supply glut
depressed prices. Chaori Solar’s long-term credit rating was cut
to AA- from AA by Pengyuan Credit Rating Co. last month.  Chaori Solar has 1 billion  yuan  of outstanding five-year
debt that mature in March 2017. The company is due to make the
first interest payment on March 7.  No company has defaulted on publicly traded debt in  China 
since the central bank began regulating the market in the late
1990s, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
