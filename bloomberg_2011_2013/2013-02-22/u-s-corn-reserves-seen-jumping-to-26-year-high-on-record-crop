U.S. corn inventories before the
2014 harvest will triple to the highest since 1988 as output
jumps to a record following the worst drought in seven decades,
the government said.  Stockpiles before next year’s harvest may rise to 2.177
billion bushels from a 17-year low of 632 million projected this
year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report .
Yields may average 163.6 bushels an acre after dropping to 123.4
bushels last year. Production of the grain, the nation’s biggest
crop, will rise 35 percent to a record 14.53 billion as
consumption increases 16 percent.  “Rising supplies will mean lower feed costs for livestock
producers,” Peter Riley, an economist at the USDA’s Farm Serve
Agency, said at the annual agricultural outlook forum in
Arlington, Virginia.  Corn prices paid to farmers in the 12 months that begins
Sept. 1 will average $4.80 a bushel, down from a record $7.20
forecast this year, the USDA said yesterday. An increase in
exports and use in domestic grain-based ethanol will be
countered by declining gasoline consumption and increasing
output in  Brazil ,  Argentina , Ukraine and  India , Riley said.  “The world market has changed as high U.S. prices have led
to increased exports by other suppliers,” Riley said. “Falling
U.S. gasoline consumption will restrain ethanol production.
Brazil is shipping more to the U.S.”  Corn Futures  Through yesterday, corn futures on the Chicago Board of
Trade dropped 19 percent from a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. The
contract for May delivery rose 0.7 percent to $6.905 a bushel at
10:02 a.m. The U.S. is the world’s biggest producer.  Record U.S. soybean production of 3.405 billion bushels, up
13 percent from 2012, will double stockpiles before the 2014
harvest to 250 million bushels, up from a nine-year low of 125
million this year, the USDA said. Consumption is forecast to
rise 7 percent to 3.295 billion, and yields may increase to 44.5
bushels an acre from 39.6.  “Weather is the key determinate for corn and soybean
supplies this year and will be closely watched” through June,
July and August, Riley said.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.9 percent to $14.84
a bushel in  Chicago . The price headed for the fifth straight
increase, the longest rally since April.  Wheat Outlook  U.S. wheat inventories will fall to 639 million bushels
before the 2014 harvest from 691 million projected as of June 1,
the USDA said. Production may drop 7.4 percent to 2.1 billion
this year as yields decline to 45.2 bushels an acre from 46.3
bushels.  “While wheat ending stocks will be modestly lower this
year, supplies are not forecast to be tight,” Riley said.
“U.S. exports will face increased competition” from Russia,
Ukraine and  Europe , he said.  Wheat futures for May delivery rose 0.9 percent to $7.305 a
bushel. Through yesterday, the price dropped 6.9 percent this
year.  The U.S. is the top exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
