Management of  Turkcell Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,  Turkey ’s biggest mobile operator, may propose a
plan to pay dividends from 2012 profit after a shareholder
dispute blocked payments for the previous two years.  Any proposition from management to the board will also need
to be presented to shareholders, Sureyya Ciliv, chief executive
officer of the company, said in a news conference in Istanbul
late yesterday. There isn’t yet a detailed management proposal
on dividend payments, he said.  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , Altimo of Russia, which is controlled by
billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s  Alfa Group , and Cukurova Holding
AS of Turkey have been fighting a three-cornered battle for
control of the company for almost a decade. While TeliaSonera is
the largest shareholder with 38 percent, Cukurova has sought to
retain control via a complex ownership structure even as its
stake has declined to 13.8 percent.  TeliaSonera and Altimo blocked a decision on dividend
payments for 2010 and 2011, after failing to oust Chairman  Colin Williams  from the board, claiming he hampered Turkcell’s growth
by favoring Cukurova chairman and Turkcell founder Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, Turkey’s second-richest man. Williams denied the
allegations.  “We as management propose to the board how much we can
offer in dividend payments and then the board should take it to
the shareholders in the annual meeting,” Ciliv said.  Independent board members are expected to be appointed to
the board of directors in line with new government regulations,
he said.  Turkcell’s board proposal in 2011 to make a dividend
payment of 75 percent of 2010’s profit of 1.77 billion liras
($988 million) was blocked by TeliaSonera and Altimo. The board
didn’t propose any distribution last year from 2011’s profit of
1.18 billion liras. The company’s 2012 net  income  was 2.08
billion liras.  Ciliv also said the company is considering producing mobile
devices. He didn’t elaborate.  Turkcell shares rose 1.8 percent to 11.55 liras at 10:50
a.m. in Istanbul trade, gaining for the first day in three.  To contact the reporter on this story:
