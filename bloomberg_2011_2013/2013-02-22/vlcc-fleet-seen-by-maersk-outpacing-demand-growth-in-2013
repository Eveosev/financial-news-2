Following are comments by Maersk
Tankers, the oil-shipping unit of the world’s most valuable
shipping company, on the outlook for very large crude carriers
in 2013. Maersk commented in its group annual report today.  “Significant VLCC tonnage will be added to the market in
2013 with demand growth expected to be unchanged. General
overcapacity and weak demand growth affected the product tanker
segments negatively in 2012. Expectations for 2013 remain
unchanged with a relatively flat demand/supply development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
