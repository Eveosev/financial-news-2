Thailand’s baht advanced, halting a
two-week loss, on speculation accelerating growth will attract
investment to Southeast  Asia ’s second-largest economy.  Gross domestic product rose a record 18.9 percent last
quarter, taking 2012’s rate to 6.4 percent, official data showed
Feb. 18. That was more than the 6.1 percent in  Indonesia , the
nation’s bigger neighbor in terms of GDP. Overseas funds bought
$1.9 billion more sovereign notes than they sold in February,
according to the Thai Bond Market Association, while 10-year
debt yields fell three basis points this week to 3.62 percent.  “The economy is very strong and it’s natural to see
appreciation pressure on the baht,” said  Koji Fukaya , president
of Office Fukaya, a currency research and consulting company in
 Tokyo . “From time to time, authorities may have to step in to
the market just to slow the pace of appreciation.”  The baht strengthened 0.1 percent today and this week to
29.84 per dollar as of 8:37 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has climbed 2.5 percent in
2013, the best performance in Asia.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped eight basis
points to 5.25 percent, the lowest level in a month. The measure
fell 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, this week.  The Bank of  Thailand  said it will closely monitor capital
inflows and take action if needed after keeping its policy rate
unchanged at 2.75 percent on Feb. 20.  Government data next week may show exports, which account
for about two-thirds of the nation’s economy, increased 13
percent in January and imports jumped 19 percent, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Overseas sales rose 13.5 percent in December and inbound
shipments gained 4.7 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 was little changed today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Thai debt returned 0.3 percent this year, beating 0.2 percent in
Indonesia, an index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
