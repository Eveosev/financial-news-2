SGX AsiaClear postponed the start of
an iron ore futures contract by six weeks to ensure that
customers are ready, the world’s largest clearer of swaps for
the commodity said.  The Singapore-based clearing house, which had planned to
offer the new product from Feb. 25, will start it on April 8,
the unit of  Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX)  said in a  statement  dated
yesterday. The postponement “will provide member firms
sufficient time to prepare their trading and clearing support,
including conducting necessary systems testing,” it said.  Iron ore  swap  and options contracts reached a record 18.2
million metric tons in January, according to the statement. Open
interest rose to an all-time high of 18.7 million tons on Feb.
20, it said. SGX AsiaClear clears more than 90 percent of the
world’s iron ore swaps, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter for this story:
