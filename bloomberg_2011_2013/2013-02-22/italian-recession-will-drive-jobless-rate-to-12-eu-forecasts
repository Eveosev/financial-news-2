Italy ’s economy will shrink again
this year and unemployment will continue rising in 2014 to reach
12 percent, European Commission forecasts show.  In its fourth recession since 2001, Italy’s gross domestic
product will fall 1 percent this year after a 2.2 percent
decline in 2012, the Brussels-based commission said today in its
latest forecasts. That’s deeper than the 0.5 percent contraction
it predicted in November. The economy may grow 0.8 percent in
2014, the commission said.  Prime Minister Mario Monti’s austerity policies, aimed at
shrinking the euro area’s second-biggest debt load after  Greece 
and spurring competitiveness, have been the focal point of the
election campaign that ends tomorrow. With the economy
shrinking, candidates including Monti have fought over how much
to roll the squeeze back.  The jobless rate will rise to 11.6 percent this year from
10.6 percent last year and will peak next year, according to the
commission. Its forecasts match the Bank of Italy’s projections,
which see the economy shrinking 1 percent this year.  Italy’s central bank has called on whichever government
emerges from the elections to consolidate public finances to
boost competitiveness and economic growth. The euro region’s
third-biggest economy shrank 0.9 percent in the  fourth quarter 
of 2012, the most in almost four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
