Pan Africa Insurance Holdings Ltd. (PAIL) ,
the Kenyan unit of South African insurer  Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , rose to
the highest level in almost 21 months after increasing its
annual dividend payout by 50 percent.  Shares of the Nairobi-based company climbed 2.1 percent to
48 shillings, the highest since May 25, 2011, by the 3 p.m.
close in Nairobi. About 30,100 shares changed hands, or more
than double the three-month daily average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company proposed a dividend of 3 shillings per share
compared with 2 shillings a year earlier. Profit in the 12
months through December rose 57 percent to 698.3 million
shillings (8 million) as net written premiums jumped to 5.13
billion shillings from 3.3 billion shillings a year earlier, it
said yesterday.  “The dividend payout is the major factor contributing to
the rise in share price because investors are rushing to get the
stock,” Augustine Misoka, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Yesterday the stock was recommended buy in new coverage by
Sterling Capital. Standard Investment Bank Ltd. had a similar
recommendation on the company last month.  Sanlam is the largest South African-based life insurer in
 Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
