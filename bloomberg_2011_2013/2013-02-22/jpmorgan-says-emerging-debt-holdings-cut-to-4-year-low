Investors reduced holdings of
emerging-market government debt to the lowest level since
October 2008 as rising U.S. Treasury yields eroded the allure of
the assets, a survey by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  shows.  Clients surveyed also cut their investment in developing-
nation currencies by the most since May 2012, as the Japanese
yen weakened, JPMorgan analysts led by Holly Huffman in  New York 
wrote in a note dated today. The 189 clients in the monthly
survey, who manage a total of $1 trillion in emerging-market
assets, said they have also reduced their positions in interest-
rate markets and corporate debt.  JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Index of emerging-market dollar debt
has lost 1.98 percent since Dec. 31, the worst start of a year
since 1995, as 10-year Treasury yields jumped to a 10-month high
Feb. 14.  South Korea ’s won and Taiwan’s currency have lost about
2 percent this year against the dollar as the 16 percent decline
in the yen over the past six months boosted concern that  Asia 
will act to weaken their currencies to bolster exports.  “Special focus in this month’s survey centered on
reactions to moves in U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen,”
wrote the analysts.  About 25 percent of investors said they have or will reduce
their holdings of Asian currencies, according to the survey.
Investors have deepened their “underweight” positions in
currencies, including the Indian rupee, won, Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso and  Thai baht , the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
