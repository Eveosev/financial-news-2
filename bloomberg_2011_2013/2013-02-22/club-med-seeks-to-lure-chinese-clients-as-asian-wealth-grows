Club Mediterranee SA (CU) , the French
all-inclusive tour operator, plans to more than double the
number of customers it serves in  China  in three years as wealth
in the region increases faster than elsewhere.  “We identified 60 million potential customers for us
worldwide some years ago,” Chief Executive Officer Henri Giscard D’Estaing said at an interview in Frankfurt. “That
number has probably grown since as global wealth increased, and
the part coming from Asia is the one growing fastest.”  Club Med expects to have 200,000 Chinese customers by 2015,
compared with 86,000 last year, making it the company’s second-
largest market. The company will add four resorts in the country
and almost double its presence in travel agencies. Chinese
guests spend as much as 20 percent more compared with Europeans
as they book upscale resorts and the country has a potential 26
million Club Med clients, D’Estaing said.  European tour operators are expanding into faster-growing
 emerging markets  as the region’s credit crisis drains holiday
spending. Club Med plans to raise its share of guests from
emerging markets to one-third by 2015 from one-quarter today.  Rising prices for jet fuel are also hurting operator’s
margins while the Arab Spring has led clients to avoid some
destinations in the  Middle East .  Club Med Peak  Club Med shares reached a record 139.03 euros in July 2000
and traded 90 percent below their peak at 14.04 euros at 4 p.m.
in Paris, giving the company a market value of 447 million euros
($588 million).  Customers from  France , the company’s home market which
contributes 45 percent of revenue, are suffering from rising
unemployment which rose to 10.3 percent in the third quarter of
2012, the highest in more than 13 years. German unemployment
unexpectedly declined in January, adding to signs that a pick-up
in Europe’s largest economy is gathering pace.  A “very famous German family of three´´ last year spent in
excess of 100,000 euros for a two-week trip to Mauritius, Eric
Georges, the company’s manager for  Germany  and central Europe,
said.  ‘‘That’s an extreme example of a new clientel of Club
Med,” D’Estaing said, adding the average customer spends about
160 euros per day, excluding flights. “There’s a big range
here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
