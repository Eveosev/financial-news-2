kicks off with a suds fest at Galapagos Art Space.  There’s a Brewers’ Choice awards ceremony at City Winery
later in the week and a closing party at La Birreria at Eataly
on March 3.  In between, there are more than 300 events across 150

can’t really see them -- their faces are obscured by bursts of
light.  The image is from “Counter Acts,” a black-and-white
photographic transparency in a lightbox created by Poklong
Anading.  See it and the works of 21 other artists and collectives in
the Guggenheim UBS MAP show devoted to exploring from within the 
creative traditions of Asia.  “No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast
Asia” runs through May 22 at the Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth
Ave. Information: +1-212-423-3587;  http://www.guggenheim.org   Saturday Matinee  Ann Richards, the Governor of  Texas  who was also,
remarkably, a Democrat, famously pointed out that George H. W. Bush was born with a “silver foot in his mouth.”  Her swagger and charm -- and big white hair -- are
recreated onstage by Holland Taylor in a one-woman show,
“Ann,” which she also wrote.  Richards was unseated by George W. Bush, and the rest is
history.  In previews at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center,
for a March 7 opening. Information: +1-212-239-6200;
 http://www.lct.org .  Saturday Night  Grace Potter and the Nocturnals bring their big, brash
country-inflected pop-rock sound to the Capitol Theater.  The group is on the “Roar Tour” in support of their
latest album, “The Lion The Beast The Beat.”  Potter’s pitch-perfect voice soars like Joplin’s over the
rowdy sounds of the band.  Singer/songwriter Rayland Baxter opens.  Capitol Theatre, 149 Westchester Ave., Port Chester, NY.
Information: +1-914-937-4126;  http://www.thecapitoltheatre.com .  Sunday  Hoisted into the air suspended from a rope clenched between
her teeth, Miss La La was a famous performer at the Cirque
Fernando.  The aerialist caught the attention of Edgar Degas, who
produced many sketches of her, as well as his famous painting.
You can see all the Degas material, plus photographs and posters
of Miss La La, at the Morgan Library.  Also there: an exhibition celebrating the 100th anniversary
of Marcel Proust’s “Swann’s Way.”  There are notebooks, preliminary drafts and galleys from
the Bibliotheque nationale de  France , as well as postcards and
letters.  Miss La La runs through May 12, while Proust is on until
April 28 at the Morgan Library and Museum, 225 Madison Ave.

“Sleeping Beauty,” choreographed for the  New York  City Ballet
by Peter Martins.  Can the Lilac Fairy defeat the evil Carabosse?  More than 100 dancers take part in this striking
production, with appearances by Little Red Riding Hood, Puss-in-
Boots and the White Cat.  And happily Balanchine’s version of the “Garland Dance”
is presented intact.  At David H. Koch Theatre, Lincoln Center. Information: +1-

Company’s “Myth and Transformation.”  Graham’s 1962 “Phaedra” about forbidden passion is paired
with Richard Move’s 2002 pop culture pastiche “The Show
(Achilles Heels).”  Move’s tour-de-force was originally choreographed for
Baryshnikov and Blondie singer Deborah Harry.  Runs through March 3 at the Joyce Theatre, 175 Eighth Ave.
