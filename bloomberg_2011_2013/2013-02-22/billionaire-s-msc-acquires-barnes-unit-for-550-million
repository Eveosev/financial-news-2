     Feb. 22 (Bloomberg) -- MSC Industrial Direct Co., the
office and industrial equipment supplier that’s made Chairman
Mitchell Jacobson a billionaire, said it will buy  Barnes Group
Inc. (B) ’s North American distribution business for $550 million.  The deal will boost earnings by 15 cents to 20 cents a
share in fiscal 2014, and 30 cents to 40 cents in 2015, MSC said
today in a statement. Melville, New York-based MSC is expanding
as customers buy more power saws, snowblowers and copy paper,
sending the stock up 13 percent this year.  The Barnes unit is “a well-run, high-margin business with
a strong value proposition,” MSC Chief Financial Officer Jeff Kaczka said in the statement. “We are getting a new platform
that provides several growth avenues.”  Jacobson is MSC’s largest shareholder and had a net worth
of $1.3 billion as of Feb. 20, according to the  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index . He owns more than 9.2 million shares, most
of which is  Class B stock  that converts to Class A shares on a
1-for-1 basis, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  MSC is the world’s third-largest office and industrial
equipment provider. Its Feb. 19 close of $86.54 was the highest
since MSC’s 1995 initial public offering. The stock  climbed 
2.6 percent to $85.24 today. Its 2013 advance has outpaced the
8.2 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 Index.  Barnes, based in Bristol,  Connecticut , makes metal parts
and distributes industrial products including aircraft engine
components. The company’s  shares  surged 15 percent today to
$28.10 for their biggest daily gain since April 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
