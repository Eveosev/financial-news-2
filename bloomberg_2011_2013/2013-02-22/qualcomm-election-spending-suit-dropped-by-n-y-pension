Qualcomm Inc. resolved a lawsuit
that the  New York  State Common Retirement fund brought last
month over political spending.  Qualcomm, a maker of communications microchips, will
implement a revised political spending disclosure policy,
according to a joint statement today from New York State
Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli and the company. Each side will
pay its own legal costs and attorney fees, according to court
papers confirming the case’s dismissal.  “Qualcomm’s disclosure policy sets a high standard,”
DiNapoli, the fund’s trustee, said in the statement. “The
company deserves praise for its actions.”  DiNapoli sued San Diego-based Qualcomm Jan. 2 in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington seeking books and records that
might shed light on whether contributions are in shareholders’
best interests.  “Increased transparency for election-related activities by
corporations is very beneficial,” Paul E. Jacobs, chief
executive officer and chairman of Qualcomm, said in the
statement.  The  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  Political Action Committee, based in
Washington, contributed $166,500 to federal candidates in 2012,
53 percent to Democrats and 48 percent to Republicans, according
to OpenSecrets.org.  Qualcomm spent more than $4.5 million on lobbying in 2012,
DiNapoli said when the lawsuit was filed.  The case is New York State Common Retirement Fund v.
Qualcomm Inc., CA8170, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
