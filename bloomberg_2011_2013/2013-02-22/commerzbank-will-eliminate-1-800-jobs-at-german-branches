Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-
largest lender, said it will eliminate 1,800 positions in
branches across the country as part of wider job cuts.  The bank is seeking “mutual agreements” with employees
and won’t fire people protected by German  labor laws  if it can
cut 600 jobs in the country this year, Frankfurt-based
Commerzbank said today in a statement.  Commerzbank is reducing staff and assets as the consumer
bank fails to deliver the profits it anticipated and as shipping
and commercial real estate loans sour. The bank, which employed
about 56,000 people in 2012, said last month that it will cut
4,000 to 6,000 positions by 2016.  The lender, which has about 1,200 German branches, will
discuss the progress of job cuts and other potential measures
with labor officials at the end of 2014, the bank said.  Larger competitor  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  had 1,946 branches in
the country and employed 47,262 people in Germany at the end of
September, according to company filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
