Malaysia’s ringgit headed for its
first weekly loss since the period ended Feb. 1, as concern the
global recovery will falter damped demand for riskier assets.  A report yesterday showed  Europe ’s services and
manufacturing contracted more than economists estimated,
signaling a recession in the region could worsen. The ringgit
lost 0.4 percent yesterday on concern the U.S. will cut asset
purchases that have boosted dollar supply. Malaysia’s  gross
domestic product  rose 6.4 percent last quarter from a year
earlier, beating the median estimate of 5.5 percent in a
Bloomberg survey, official figures showed on Feb. 20.  The ringgit declined 0.8 percent this week to 3.1015 per
dollar as of 4:44 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It fell 0.2 percent today and touched
3.1142, the weakest since Feb. 4.  “The weak economic data from Europe and concern that the
U.S. will cut its bond purchases are reducing demand for riskier
assets,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency strategist at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The Malaysian
currency should continue to trade within the 3.0850 to 3.1150
range in the short term.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was little changed
today and this week at 7.4 percent.  Data from London-based Markit Economics showed yesterday a
composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers in both
industries in the 17-nation euro area decreased to 47.3 this
month from 48.6 in January. That’s less than a reading of 49
predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. Fifty is the
dividing line between expansion and contraction.  Government bonds  in the Southeast Asian nation climbed. The
yield on the 3.418 percent notes due August 2022 decreased two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.46 percent today
and for the week, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
