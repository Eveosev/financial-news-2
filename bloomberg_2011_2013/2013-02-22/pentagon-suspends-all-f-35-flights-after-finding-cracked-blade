The Pentagon said it has suspended
all flights of  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter
after a routine engine inspection revealed a crack on a turbine
blade in a test aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base in
 California .  The suspension is a “precautionary measure” until an
investigation is completed and the cause of the blade crack is
understood, the Pentagon’s F-35 program office said today in an
e-mailed statement. The Defense Department is working with
Lockheed and  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney unit,
which makes the plane’s engine, in its inquiry, according to the
statement.  “Safety is always our first consideration, and the joint
inspection team is focused on ensuring the integrity of the
engines across the entire fleet so the F-35s can safely return
to flight as soon as possible,” Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defense contractor, said in
an e-mailed statement.  The F-35, the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program,
has been plagued by a costly redesign, bulkhead cracks,
excessive weight and delays in software that have helped put it
seven years behind schedule. The cost of the program’s 2,443
aircraft is now estimated at $395.7 billion, a 70 percent
increase since 2001.  The Marine Corps version of the F-35 was grounded last
month after a pilot aborted a takeoff because of a flaw in the
Pratt & Whitney propulsion system. Those planes resumed flying
this month after the problem was traced to an improperly crimped
fluid hose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
