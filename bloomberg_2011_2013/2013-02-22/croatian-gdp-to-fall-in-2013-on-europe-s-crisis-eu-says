Croatia’s economy will shrink for a
second consecutive year in 2013, when it joins the European
Union, as  Europe ’s recession continues to hurt investment and
exports in the Adriatic nation.  Gross domestic product will contract 0.4 percent this year
and return to “subdued” growth in 2014 with a 1 percent
expansion, the  European Commission  said today in its forecast.
The fiscal deficit will widen to 5 percent of GDP this year,
before narrowing to 4.5 percent in 2014, it said.  The forecast risks are “mainly on the downside and
particularly related to the lowering of Croatia’s sovereign-debt
rating to the speculative grade by several rating agencies, the
risk of credit restraint as a result of bank deleveraging, and
the possibility of additional expenditure cuts in public
budgets,” the report said.  As the world’s largest bloc expands in the Balkans,  Croatia 
still needs to increase competitiveness, strengthen its labor
market and boost domestic demand, the report said. EU entry in
July should have a positive effect on private investment, it
said.  The inflation rate will fall to 3 percent in 2013 and to 2
percent in the following year, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
