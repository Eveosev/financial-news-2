Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  and the U.S.
were granted their request to suspend until March 19 the
government’s lawsuit seeking to block the brewer from buying
Grupo Modelo SAB.  A federal judge in Washington agreed to delay the
litigation after the parties told the court this week they’re in
talks that may lead to a settlement of the case.  U.S. District Judge Richard Roberts in Washington said
yesterday that if the case settles “in whole or in part” the
department should quickly file a notice of dismissal. If there’s
no deal, the parties must file a proposed scheduling order for
bringing the case to trial.  AB InBev and the  Justice Department  said the government is
looking at whether a revised plan to sell control of all Modelo
brands in the U.S., and a brewery in Mexico, to  Constellation
Brands Inc. (STZ)  would allay antitrust concerns. A break in the
proceedings “would be beneficial” for a potential resolution,
according to a Feb. 20 filing by the parties.  The revised deal, submitted on Feb. 14, is aimed at
appeasing U.S. authorities, who sued to block AB InBev’s
proposed $20.1 billion purchase of the rest of Mexico City-based
Modelo, arguing the merger would hurt competition and lead to
higher prices. AB InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, controls
almost half the U.S. beer market, while Corona is the country’s
biggest imported brand.  The case is U.S. v. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, 13-cv-00127,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
