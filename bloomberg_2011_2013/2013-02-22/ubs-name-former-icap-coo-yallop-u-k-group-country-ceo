UBS AG (UBSN) , the lender fined $1.5
billion for rigging interest rates, named Mark Yallop to the
newly created post of U.K. group country chief executive
officer, responsible for all the firm’s operations in Britain.  Yallop, a former chief operating officer at  ICAP Plc (IAP)  and
Deutsche Bank AG, will report to COO Ulrich Koerner, the Zurich-
based lender said in an e-mail to employees today that was
confirmed by a spokesman. He takes up the post on Feb. 25.  Yallop also served as COO for BBA Libor Ltd., the company
that manages the London interbank offered rate for the British
Bankers’ Association from May 2010 to Sept. 2011, according to
filings at the U.K.’s Companies House. UBS paid a record $1.5
