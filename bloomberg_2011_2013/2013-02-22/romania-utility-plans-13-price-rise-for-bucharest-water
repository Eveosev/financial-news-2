The Romanian utility  Apa Nova
Bucuresti SA,  a unit of  France ’s  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , plans
to increase water and wastewater-treatment prices in Bucharest
by 13 percent starting in March to fund network improvements.  The company seeks to raise water prices in the Romanian
capital by 0.75 lei per cubic meter from the current 5.86 lei
($1.76) a cubic meter next month pending approval from the
public-utilities regulatory authority, the Bucharest-based
subsidiary said today  in a statement  on its website.  “Apa Nova will adjust the tariffs to fund investments in
water and sewage network upgrades needed to ensure water access
in Bucharest and in flood prevention,” according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
