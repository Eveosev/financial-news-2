Wheat traded near the lowest in
almost eight months and headed for the biggest weekly decline
since Jan. 4 amid optimism that snowfall in  Kansas  may improve
crop conditions in the largest U.S. grower of winter varieties.  While futures rose 0.2 percent to $7.255 a bushel on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade by 9:45 a.m. in Singapore, they are set
for a 3.1 percent slide this week, the fifth such drop. Volume
was 50 percent less than the 100-day average for this time of
day. Prices fell to $7.225 yesterday, matching the low on Feb.
13, which was the cheapest since June 25.  A storm that has already forced shutdowns of government
offices in Kansas, may bring 20 inches of snow by the time it
passes east out of the state, National Weather Service data
show. The snow that’s arriving at a critical time, just before
plants emerge from dormancy, “will help greatly,” Gail Martell, a meteorologist and the president of Martell Crop
Projections in  Milwaukee  said.  “The trade refocused on improving U.S. field conditions,
rather than the recent improvement in trade conditions”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
 Australia , said in a report e-mailed today, referring to the
latest U.S. export sales.  Exporters in the U.S., the world’s largest shipper of
wheat, sold 55,000 metric tons of the soft, red winter variety
for delivery in the year ending May 30, and a further 55,000
tons for delivery in the year starting June 1, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday.  Soybeans for May delivery added 0.1 percent to $14.725 in
Chicago, taking the weekly gain to 4.1 percent. Corn was little
changed at $6.86 a bushel. That puts the price of soybeans at
2.14  times  the price of corn, compared with a 10-year average of
2.43 times. The crops compete for acreage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
