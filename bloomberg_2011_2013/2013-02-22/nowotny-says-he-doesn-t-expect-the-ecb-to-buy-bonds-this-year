European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said he doesn’t expect the ECB to
buy bonds in 2013.  Asked if he sees a risk that the ECB will have to activate
its bond-purchase program this year, Nowotny told reporters in
Riga: “No, I do not see this perspective.” Markets are
normalizing “so I do not see a need for specific additional
activities in the foreseeable time,” he said.  The ECB’s bond-purchase program, dubbed Outright Monetary
Transactions, has restored calm in financial markets by removing
the risk of a euro breakup. Bond yields of debt-strapped nations
have declined since the plan was announced in August, even
though no governments have requested assistance and signed up to
the conditions necessary for the ECB to consider intervening.  The outlook hasn’t changed much since the ECB predicted in
December that the 17-nation euro economy will shrink 0.3 percent
this year, Nowotny said. The euro, which has appreciated more
than 8 percent against the dollar since late July, won’t put an
extra burden on the recovery, he added.  “We are in a corridor that has also been achieved in the
past, so I don’t see a specific danger that it might have
negative effects on growth,” Nowotny said. “The number we have
right now is not something that is out of line in our long-term
experience.”  The euro dropped today and traded at $1.3182 at 3:45 p.m.
