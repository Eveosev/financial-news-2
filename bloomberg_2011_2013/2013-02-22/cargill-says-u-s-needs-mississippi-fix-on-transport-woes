The drought that almost halted barge
traffic on the  Mississippi River  illustrates that the U.S. must
improve inland waterways to remain competitive in export
markets, a Cargill Inc. shipping executive said.  “Our locks and dams are aging, and they’re not aging very
gracefully,” Rick Calhoun, the president of Cargill’s marine
and terminal division, said today in a presentation at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s annual outlook forum in Arlington,
Virginia.  Low water levels on the Mississippi, the busiest U.S.
waterway, threatened to shut down commercial barge traffic in
December and January, giving the public “an understanding of
the importance of waterways to America,” he said.  Companies including AEP River Operations LLC, a unit of
American Electric Power Co. of Columbus,  Ohio , and American
Commercial Lines Inc. of Jeffersonville,  Indiana , idled boats
because of the slowdown, showing the potential for losses to
commerce should infrastructure failures cause more delays,
Calhoun said.  Shippers including  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  of Decatur,
Illinois, use the river to float an estimated $2.8 billion of
cargo, including grain, coal and fertilizer, during a typical
January, according to the American Waterways Operators, which
also is based in Arlington.  Minneapolis-based Cargill, which owns grain elevators,
cocoa processing plants, slaughterhouses, steel-service centers
and ethanol refineries, is the largest closely held company in
the U.S. and one of the world’s biggest agricultural traders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
