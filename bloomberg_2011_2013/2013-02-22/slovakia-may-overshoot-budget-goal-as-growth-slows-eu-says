Slovakia may miss its goal of
squeezing the budget deficit below the European Union’s limit as
early as this year as a slowing economy reduces tax revenue,
according to a European Commission forecast.  The EU’s Brussels-based executive arm projects the  gap  to
reach 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year and 3.4
percent in 2014, it said in a report released today. Public debt
will gradually increase to 57.1 percent of GDP in 2014 from 43.3
percent in 2011, it said.  The fading effect of new production capacities in the car
industry, consumer spending hurt by rising unemployment and
government austerity measures will cause  economic growth  to ease
to 1.1 percent in 2013 from an estimated 2 percent last year,
the commission said. The slowdown makes it more difficult for
the eastern euro-area member to meet its commitment to cut its
deficit below EU limit of 3 percent of GDP.  Private spending will start to recover in 2014, helping
push economic growth to 2.9 percent, according to the forecast.
Inflation is projected at 1.9 percent and 2 percent in 2013 and
2014, respectively, after 3.7 percent last year as elevated
unemployment limits wage growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
