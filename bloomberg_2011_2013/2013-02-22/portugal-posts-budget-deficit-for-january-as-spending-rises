Portugal ’s  Finance Ministry  said the
government posted a deficit in January after spending rose and
tax revenue fell.  Based on comparable figures, the deficit of the central
administration and social security agency was 31.4 million euros
($41.4 million) compared with a surplus of 308.1 million euros
in January 2012, the Finance Ministry’s budget office said in a
report on its  website .  Spending rose 9.9 percent. Tax revenue dropped 0.7 percent,
with revenue from indirect taxes declining 8.1 percent and
revenue from direct taxes rising 12.5 percent.  Portugal may get an additional year to narrow its budget
deficit as the country’s economic outlook worsens, Finance
Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Feb. 20. European Union officials
last year already gave the country more time to narrow its
budget gap after  tax revenue  missed forecasts. Tax revenue
dropped 6.1 percent in 2012.  Gaspar announced an “enormous” increase in taxes on Oct.
3 and the government also plans to cut spending by about 4
billion euros in the two years through 2014. It aims for a
deficit equal to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2013
and will only cut the deficit below the EU’s 3 percent limit in
2014, when it targets a 2.5 percent gap.  The government aimed for a 2012 budget gap of 5 percent to
comply with the terms of the aid package. The Finance Ministry
on Jan. 23 posted a preliminary full-year deficit for the
general government of 5 percent, beating a 5.4 percent target in
the bailout program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
