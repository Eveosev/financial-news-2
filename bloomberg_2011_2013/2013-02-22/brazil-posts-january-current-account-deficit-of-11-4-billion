Brazil ’s  current account deficit 
expanded to a record in January, as exports fell and imports
rose in the world’s second-biggest emerging market.  The deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of
trade in goods and services, widened in January to $11.4 billion
from $7 billion a year earlier, the central bank said in a
report distributed today in Brasilia. The gap was bigger than
estimated by all but two of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg,
whose median estimate was for a deficit of $9.65 billion.  Foreign direct investment  in January fell to $3.7 billion
from $5.4 billion in December, the central bank said. Economists
forecast investments of $4.85 billion, according to the median
estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government has sought to
encourage investment to help spur Brazil’s economy, which
expanded the slowest among major  emerging markets  last year. In
the last month, officials have removed IOF taxes from foreign
investment in certain real estate funds and reiterated
invitations for international companies to participate in local
infrastructure tenders. After exceeding government forecasts
last year, foreign direct investment is expected to hover around
record levels in 2013.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 7.77 percent at 10:44 a.m. local time. The
real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.666 per  U.S. dollar .  Slower Growth  The central bank estimates Brazil’s gross domestic product
expanded 1 percent last year, after growing by 2.7 percent in
2011 and 7.5 percent in 2010. The economy will expand 3 percent
to 4 percent this year, according to Finance Minister  Guido Mantega .  Brazil’s trade deficit in January was $4 billion, compared
with a gap of $1.3 billion a year ago, according to the central
bank. Exports fell 1 percent to $16 billion from a year earlier,
while imports rose 14.6 percent to $20 billion.  This week, Chilean retailer Cencosud said it would invest
$116 million to open 15 supermarkets in Brazil this year as part
of its South American expansion plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
