Vivian Imerman, the former chairman
and chief executive officer of  Del Monte  Royal Foods Corp., paid
his ex-wife Lisa Tchenguiz 15 million pounds ($22.9 million) in
a divorce settlement.  The settlement with Tchenguiz, the sister of property
tycoons Robert and  Vincent Tchenguiz , was approved by a judge
today, ending a four-year divorce dispute, according to the
statement released by Bell Yard Communications, representing
Imerman. The money will be paid in installments.  “Mr. Imerman does not intend to comment further regarding
his short marriage to Ms. Tchenguiz, or their divorce,”
according to the e-mailed statement.  In 2010, a London appeals court found that Robert and
Vincent Tchenguiz had breached Imerman’s confidence by taking
documents from a shared office to use in the divorce case.  Imerman is listed as chairman of private wealth firm Vasari
Global on its website. He retired from Del Monte in 2001, the
year the South African company was purchased by Cirio
Finanziaria SpA. Diana Parker, a lawyer representing Lisa
Tchenguiz, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail requesting
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
