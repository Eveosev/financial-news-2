Vigor Alimentos SA (VIGR3) , the Brazilian
dairy-products maker spun off from  JBS SA (JBSS3)  in June, rose to a
six-month high after buying a 50 percent stake in closely held
Itambe Alimentos SA.  Shares gained 18 percent to 7.99 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the highest since Aug. 8. Trading volume
was 6 times the three-month average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Vigor acquired 50 percent of Itambe, a rival dairy
producer, for 410 million reais ($208 million), the company said
in a regulatory filing today. The purchase will help Vigor
bolster its presence in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and
Rio de Janeiro and in the northeast region, the company said in
the filing.  Vigor has advanced 25 percent in the past year, while the
benchmark  Bovespa (IBOV)  index fell 14 percent in the same period.  Itambe has annual sales of about 2 billion reais, according
to the companyâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
