Indonesia ’s two-year bonds were set
to advance for the third straight week, the longest winning
streak since December, after global funds bought the nation’s
debt. Rupiah forwards fell.  Foreign holdings of the  nation’s securities  are poised to
rise for a sixth month, the longest stretch since July 2011,
with overseas investors adding 6.26 trillion rupiah ($644
million) to their local-currency portfolio this month through
Feb. 20,  finance ministry  data show. The economy  expanded  at the
slowest pace in two years in the fourth quarter and its  current-
account  gap widened to the largest on record since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 1989.  “There is excessive optimism from foreign funds, so there
is still chance a for yields to head lower,” said Rully Nova, a
currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta.
“The inflows may become a concern as they don’t fully reflect
the fundamentals, considering slower growth and the current-
account deficit last quarter, and faster inflation ahead.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent bonds due October
2014 lost five basis points this week, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 4.31 percent as of 8:50 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level
since February 2012, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. Benchmark two-year notes reached a record-low
of 4.18 percent on Feb. 15, 2012. The yield was steady today.  The Finance Ministry’s sale of retail sukuk will end at
midday, and allocations will be announced Feb. 25. The ministry
is seeking to raise a record 15 trillion rupiah with bids
amounting to 19 trillion rupiah so far,  Dahlan Siamat , Islamic
financing director at the debt management office, said by
telephone from Jakarta yesterday.  Non-Deliverable Forwards  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards slid 0.6
percent this week to 9,734 per dollar, the biggest drop since
the five days ended Jan. 11, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
They traded at a 0.2 percent discount to the spot rate, which
weakened 0.5 percent to 9,716, prices from local banks show.  The forwards were steady today as the spot rate declined
0.1 percent. A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative
contracts was set at 9,703 yesterday by the Association of Banks
in  Singapore , compared with 9,681 on Feb. 15.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
