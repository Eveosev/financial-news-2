Electricity for delivery on Saturday
in  Poland  declined to its lowest level in two months as a
similar German contract dropped amid an expected increase in
wind output.  Electricity for tomorrow dropped 11 percent from a week ago
to 147.61 zloty ($46.85) a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That’s the lowest price for Saturday delivery
since Dec. 29.  Day-ahead power for Germany fell 8.4 percent from a week
ago to 38 euros ($50.08) a megawatt-hour. Output from  wind
turbines  in the country may exceed 7,500 megawatts tomorrow,
according to the website of Meteologica SA, the Madrid-based
weather forecaster. That’s above the annual average of 4,807
megawatts and today’s level of 6,190 megawatts at 12:45 p.m. in
Berlin, according to data from European Energy Exchange AG in
Leipzig, Germany.  PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility, will halt 586 megawatts
of power capacity at its Belchatow and Turow plants tomorrow,
the company said.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia fell 2 percent from a week ago to 38.19
euros a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the
countries’ market operators.  Hungarian day-ahead power  settled
6.2 percent higher at 42.11 euros a megawatt-hour from 39.62
euros a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
