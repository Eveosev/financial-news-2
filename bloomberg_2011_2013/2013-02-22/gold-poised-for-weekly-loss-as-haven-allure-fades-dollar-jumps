Gold futures slumped to a seven-
month low as signs of economic optimism eroded demand for the
precious metal as a haven. Silver also declined.  German business confidence increased to a 10-month high in
February, a report showed today. Gold dropped for the third
straight week on speculation the Federal Reserve will wind down
U.S. monetary stimulus.  “The world is not falling apart, and gold is no longer
indispensable,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “The fact that the U.S. is talking about
ending the stimulus program tells us that the economy is doing
relatively better.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to close
at $1,572.80 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
lowest settlement since July 18. The metal, down 2.3 percent
this week, has dropped 11 percent in the past 12 months.  Silver futures for May delivery declined 0.8 percent to
$28.52 an ounce, the lowest closing price since Aug. 17. This
week, the price dropped 4.5 percent, the third straight decline.
The metal has slumped 17 percent in the past 12 months.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery declined 0.8 percent to $1,607.40 an ounce. This
week, the metal dropped 4.2 percent, the most since mid-
December.  Palladium futures for March delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$735.30 an ounce. This week, the price dropped 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
