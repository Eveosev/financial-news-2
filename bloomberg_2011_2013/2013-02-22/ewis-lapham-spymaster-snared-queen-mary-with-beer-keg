Francis Walsingham served  Queen
Elizabeth  I as ambassador, secretary, security chief and
spymaster. Among the biggest threats to the sovereign’s safety
were the recurrent Catholic plots to replace her with Mary,
Queen of Scots.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Walsingham routinely employed agents, torturers,
cryptographers, forgers and men capable of breaking and
repairing seals.  To set up Mary, Walsingham placed her under stricter
custody and had all her mail opened and read. He also arranged
for one seemingly secret conduit, a beer keg, which was also
monitored by his agents.  In 1586, Mary replied encouragingly to Anthony Babington --
via the keg -- about his plans to free her and kill Elizabeth.
Despite a spirited defense at her trial, she was convicted of
treason and executed in February 1587.  I spoke with John Cooper, author of “The Queen’s Agent:
Sir Francis Walsingham and the Rise of Espionage in Elizabethan
England,” on the following topics:  1. Power Player  2. Private Spy Ring  3. Plots Against Elizabeth  4. Setting up Mary  5. Mary’s Execution  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
