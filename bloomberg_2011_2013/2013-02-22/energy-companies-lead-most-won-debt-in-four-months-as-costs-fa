GS Caltex Corp., South Korea’s
second-biggest oil refiner, and gas distributor SK E&S Co. led
the busiest week of corporate bond issuance in four months as
borrowing costs dropped to a record low.  Sales jumped to 1.76 trillion won ($1.62 billion) this week
from 380 billion won in the previous seven-day period, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Average yields on three-year
corporate notes rated at AA- fell to a record low of 3.02
percent yesterday according to data from the Korea Financial
Investment Association going back to 2000. U.S. corporate bonds
rated at AA yield 2.10 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
indexes show.  Companies in Asia’s fourth-largest economy increased
issuance this week as Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said
an improved global outlook boosts the odds of South Korea
exceeding this year’s growth forecast, signaling that further
monetary easing won’t be needed for now. The central bank kept
the benchmark seven-day repurchase rate at 2.75 percent on Feb.
14 after 25-basis-point cuts in July and October.  “Issuers seem to want to get funding in advance while
yields are low,” said Hwang Won Ha, a senior analyst with HMC
Investment Securities Co. “The market consensus is for a
recovery gathering pace in the second half and for overall rates
heading north as a result.”  GS Caltex raised 100 billion won by selling five-year 3.01
percent notes and 200 billion won from 3.19 percent securities
due 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The refiner
plans to use the money for refinancing and funding crude oil
purchases, according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  Bond Sales  SK E&S raised 200 billion won from five-year 3.05 percent
notes and 100 billion won from 3.21 percent bonds due 2020,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  company  plans to
use the proceeds to refinance, buy liquefied natural gas and
fund an investment in a local terminal for the fuel, it said in
an e-mailed response to questions about the funds on Feb. 20.  “The sale was successful because investors appreciated SK
E&S’s handsome earnings last year as well as the company’s
growth potential,” according to the e-mail.  Hanwha Chemical Corp. (009830)  offered 150 billion won of three-year
3.12 percent debt. The chemical maker will use the proceeds for
refinancing, spokesman Kwon Hyuk Bum said Feb. 20.  Economic Growth  South Korea is likely to achieve 2.8 percent growth, Kim
said in an interview in Seoul on Feb. 19. “I bet a little bit
more on the upside than the downside,” Kim said. Gross domestic
product grew 2 percent in 2012, the slowest pace since 2009, as
Europe’s debt crisis and a global slowdown sapped overseas
demand for South Korea’s products.  Three-year sovereign notes yielded 2.68 percent yesterday,
the lowest in Bloomberg-compiled data going back to 2000. The
extra yield investors demand to own Korean company notes over
similar-maturity government debt has narrowed to 34 basis points
from 80 basis points a year ago.  The won fell 0.2 percent to 1,088.36 per dollar at 10:26
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has gained 4.4 percent in the past six months, the
second-best performer in Asia.  Offerings this year have fallen 54 percent to 5.43 trillion
won from 11.68 trillion won in the same period of 2012, the data
show.  Hite Jinro Co. (000080)  and Lotte Himart Co. are among companies
planning to sell won-denominated debt, according to preliminary
data compiled by Bloomberg.  *T Top Five Underwriter Rankings Year to Date  Company                          Market Share    Amount in Won
