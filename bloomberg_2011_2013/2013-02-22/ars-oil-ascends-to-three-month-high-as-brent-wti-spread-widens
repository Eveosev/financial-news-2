Gulf Coast oils strengthened after
the differential between Brent crude and domestic benchmark West
Texas Intermediate widened.  WTI slipped 28 cents to $20.97 a barrel below Brent. Mars
Blend’s premium rose $1.45 to $20.45 over WTI, the highest level
since Nov. 19, extending an $8.20 rise  since Jan. 29 , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “That’s because the Brent-TI spread widened,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  For much of January, Mars sold for less than a $14 premium
to WTI. WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed after the Seaway
pipeline expansion began taking more crude from Cushing,
 Oklahoma , to the Gulf Coast, easing a glut of supply in the U.S.
Midwest.  This month, the gaps widened again as expectations for
Seaway were let down by flow restrictions and a heavy-to-light
mix that its operators say won’t let the line reach its
nameplate capacity of 400,000 barrels a day.  Poseidon, another Gulf sour crude, lost 5 cents from its
premium to WTI, which reached $19.25 a barrel.  Premiums for  both Heavy Louisiana Sweet and Light Louisiana
Sweet over WTI  increased by 25 cents to $23.25 a barrel for HLS
and $23 a barrel for LLS.  “We’re receiving more and more light sweet crude on the
 Gulf Coast  looking for something to blend with,” Lipow said.
“People are looking for HLS to blend with Bakken or Eagle Ford
to turn it into an LLS-type of barrel.”  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, lost $1.10 to a $21.40 premium to WTI.  Bitumen-based heavy crude blend Western Canada Select was
unchanged at a $26-a-barrel discount to WTI, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude, a synthetic light, sweet oil
upgraded from bitumen, was unchanged at a $1 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
