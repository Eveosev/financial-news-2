Gecina SA (GFC) , Paris’s largest publicly
traded office landlord, reported full-year earnings that beat
its own forecast as the company’s rental margin widened.  Profit excluding disposals and asset-value changes rose 0.7
percent to 5.08 euros a share, the Paris-based company said in a
statement today. In July, Gecina forecast a 2 percent decline.
The rental margin widened to 90.8 percent from 90.4 percent even
as divestments contributed to a 5.2 percent drop in net rental
income.  Gecina spent the past two years restructuring its portfolio
to cut its debt. The company reduced its loan-to-value ratio to
39.7 percent from 42.6 percent at the end of 2011 and raised
about 900 million euros from property sales.  “From 2013, Gecina’s sound financial foundations will
enable it to position itself on acquisitions of offices with
value creation potential over the medium  or long term,” the
company said in the statement.  Gecina fell 18 cents to 85.23 euros at 9:57 a.m. in Paris.
Before today, the shares had advanced 15 percent in 12 months
compared with a 16 percent gain for the  FTSE EPRA Nareit index 
of European property stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
