International Finance Corp. invested
$100 million to develop cleaner energy in  Latin America  and the
Caribbean with another World Bank Group fund as the regions seek
to diversify their power supplies away from generation from oil.  The IFC and the $1 billion IFC African, Latin American and
Caribbean Fund will each provide $50 million to InterEnergy
Holdings, a Cayman Islands-based owner of power assets, the
Washington-based funding arm said in a website statement.  InterEnergy will invest in areas such as the power industry
in the Caribbean nation of  Haiti  that has suffered drought, food
shortages and hurricanes since an earthquake hit in 2010 killing
300,000 people. It will also develop wind and solar power in the
Dominican Republic, as well as boosting the country’s ability to
import liquefied natural gas, to curb reliance on  fuel oil .  “We will work together to bring more reliable, cost-
efficient and cleaner energy production to the  Dominican
Republic  and also plan to be directly involved in the
development of power sector solutions for Haiti,” InterEnergy
Chief Executive Officer Rolando Gonzalez Bunster said. It plans
to expand Latin American operations, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
