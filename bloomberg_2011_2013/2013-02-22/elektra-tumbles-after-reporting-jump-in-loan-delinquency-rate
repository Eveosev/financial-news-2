Grupo Elektra SAB (ELEKTRA*) , the retail and
banking company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas ,
dropped the most since April after it reported the highest loan
delinquency rate in three years.  The stock sank 11 percent to 520.91 pesos at the close of
 Mexico  City trading. Mexico’s benchmark  IPC index  slid 0.6
percent.  Elektra’s loan delinquency rate was 7 percent at the end of
the fourth quarter, the highest level since 2009. The banking
unit had 18.4 million active credit accounts at the end of the
quarter, up 46 percent from the previous year.  “The ample number of clients is an important sign of
strength for the bank, since it reduces credit risk even more,”
Elektra said in a report. The company, which doesn’t hold
quarterly conference calls for investors, didn’t say why
delinquency rates increased.  Fourth-quarter profit fell 87 percent from a year earlier
to 1.52 billion pesos ($120 million), the Mexico City-based
company reported. That included a non-cash charge of 14.8
billion pesos to reflect the decline in financial instruments
that Elektra owns.  Elektra named Mario Gordillo as chief executive officer
this week, replacing Carlos Septien.  To contact the reporters on this story:
