Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  and  Wuliangye
Yibin Co. (000858)  led a rally for consumer-staples producers on
speculation their shares will catch up with the broader stock
market’s gains since the end of last year.  Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, climbed 3.1 percent to 185.59  yuan  at the close
in Shanghai, the biggest gain in two weeks. Wuliangye, the
second largest, added 2.6 percent to 25.77 yuan. Luzhou Laojiao
Co. advanced 4.9 percent to 33.18 yuan while  Sichuan Swellfun
Co. (600779) , the Chinese liquor maker that’s a partner of Diageo Plc,
surged 7.3 percent to 18.73 yuan.  A measure tracking consumer-staples stocks in the  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  jumped 1.7 percent, the most among 10 industry groups. The
index climbed 12 percent through yesterday since a three-year
low in Dec. 3, compared with a 24 percent gain for the CSI 300.  “Liquor makers are seeing a technical rebound after
lagging behind in the recent market rally,” Wang Weijun, a
strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai, said by phone
today. “The fundamentals of the liquor industry still remain
bearish with prices of high-end liquor falling recently.”  Consumer staples were the second-worst performing industry
group last year in the CSI 300 with a 4.7 percent loss. The
gauge traded at 15.5 times reported profit on Dec. 3., a record
low according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure is now
valued at 17.6 times profit.  Shares of liquor makers have underperformed on concern
demand will slow as the government cracks down on corruption.
