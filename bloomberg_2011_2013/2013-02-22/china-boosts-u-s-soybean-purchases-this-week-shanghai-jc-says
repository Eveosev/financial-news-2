Crushers in  China , the worldâ€™s
biggest buyer of soybeans, boosted purchases from the U.S. this
week on concern that a possible strike in  Brazil  will disrupt
shipping,  Shanghai  JC Intelligence Co. said.  Buyers may have ordered 400,000 metric tons to 500,000 tons
after they returned from a week-long Lunar New Year festival in
China last week, Monica Tu, a soybean analyst at the Shanghai-
based agricultural researcher, said by phone from Shanghai,
citing talks with traders.  Soybeans for May delivery added as much as 1.2 percent to
$14.88 in Chicago, taking the weekly gain to 5.1 percent, and
traded at 14.865 at 12:37 p.m. Beijing time.  Brazilian dock workers plan a six-hour stoppage today to
protest against a proposed regulation allowing privately owned
terminals to hire workers who are not members of OGMO, an
organization that manages the workforce at public ports.
Government officials and union leaders are set to meet in
Brasilia, Ports Minister Leonidas Cristino said yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
