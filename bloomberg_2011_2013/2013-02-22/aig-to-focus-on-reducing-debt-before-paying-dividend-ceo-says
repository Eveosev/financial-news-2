American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
will focus on lowering its obligations on bonds before returning
capital to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche 
said today.  “Our highest priority is to make sure that we focus on
getting high-cost debt out, reducing our expenses for interest,
and improving our coverage ratio,” Benmosche said in a
conference call today held by New York-based AIG. “As the year
progresses, we will then begin to look at things like ‘could we
add a dividend to the stock and also could we have some kind of
modest stock buyback?’ But we’re going to wait until we’re very,
very sure we’re in great shape.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
