Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad,  Costa Rica ’s state-run utility, awarded contracts
to buy 140 megawatts of power from renewable-energy projects.  Eleven companies will develop 100 megawatts of wind farms
in the northwestern province of Guanacaste and 40 megawatts of
small hydroelectric plants throughout the country, Adriana
Víquez Garita, a spokeswoman for the utility, said yesterday in
an e-mail. They have 12 months to arrange financing and permits
for the projects.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
