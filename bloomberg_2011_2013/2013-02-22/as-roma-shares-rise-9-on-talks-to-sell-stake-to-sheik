AS Roma (ASR)  SpA’s stock rose 9.7 percent
after the soccer team said U.S. investors who own a controlling
stake reached a preliminary agreement to sell some of their
shares to Sheikh Adnan Adel Aref al Qaddumi al Shtewi.  The shares closed at 53.8 euro cents today, their highest
since Sept. 26. Sheikh Adnan, 54, is a part of Jordan’s ruling
family although he has lived in  Italy  for 25 years, Gazzetta
dello Sport newspaper reported yesterday.  Hedge fund manager James Pallotta and other American
investors acquired the three-time Italian champion team in 2011
from the Sensi family. Roma, in a statement last night, didn’t
say how much of the U.S. group’s Neep Roma Holding SpA Sheikh
Adnan may acquire.  Roma, which last won the Italian league title in 2001,
fired coach Zdenek Zeman on Feb. 2 after a five-match winless
run left it eighth in the Serie A standings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
