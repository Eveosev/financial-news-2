Freshman applications to  Harvard
University  for the 2013-2014 academic year climbed 2.1 percent
to a record 35,022 as generous financial aid added to the lure
of the U.S.’s oldest and richest college.  The increase makes admission even more selective at  Harvard
College , the undergraduate division of the university, which
admitted just 5.9 percent of applicants last year. Students will
be notified on March 28, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
school said today in a statement.  Applicants requesting a fee waiver increased 37 percent,
indicating more are coming from low and middle-income families,
said Sarah Donahue, Harvard’s director of financial aid, in the
statement. More than 60 percent of students receive financial
aid, and those students pay an average of $11,500 a year to
attend, according to the statement.  “Financial aid continues to be a major factor in students’
decisions to apply to Harvard,” said  William Fitzsimmons , dean
of admissions and financial aid. Alumni contributions helped the
college provide $172 million this year to meet the financial
needs of undergraduates, he said.  Applications have risen at other selective schools,
including  Tufts University  and the  University of California ,
Berkeley, fueled in part by an interest from international
students. At Harvard, the geographical distribution of
applicants was about the same as last year, except for a decline
from Canadians, the university said.  Harvard, established in 1636, had an endowment valued at
more than $30 billion, as of June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
