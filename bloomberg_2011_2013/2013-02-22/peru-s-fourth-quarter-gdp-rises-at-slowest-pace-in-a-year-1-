Peru ’s economy expanded at the
slowest pace in a year during the fourth quarter as construction
activity decelerated and import growth eased.  Gross domestic product rose 5.9 percent from the same
period a year earlier compared with a revised 6.8 percent
increase in the third quarter, the national statistics agency
said in an e-mailed report today. The median estimate of 11
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for a 6.3 percent rise.  Construction output expanded an annual 12.5 percent in the
three months ending Dec. 31, after a 19.3 percent increase in
the third quarter, the agency said. The central bank left its
overnight rate unchanged for a 21st month at its Feb. 7 meeting,
saying the annual inflation rate will fall to 2 percent this
year, the mid-point of its target range, amid stable economic
growth.  The sol gained 0.3 percent to at 2.5803 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Manufacturing growth moderated in the fourth quarter while
mining and fishing output contracted, the agency said. Imports
rose 13 percent while exports climbed 2.4 percent.  Investment in housing, malls and transport infrastructure
and a consumer boom have shielded Peru’s $200 billion economy
from a slowdown in exports.  Stronger global growth will boost demand for Peru’s copper,
spurring economic growth of at least 6.3 percent this year,
Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Feb. 18.  GDP increased 6.3 percent last year, after a 6.9 percent
rise in 2011, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
