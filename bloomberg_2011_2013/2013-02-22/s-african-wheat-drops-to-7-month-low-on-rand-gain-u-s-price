South African wheat futures declined
to the lowest level in more than seven months as the rand
strengthened against the dollar and as the U.S. price for the
grain dropped yesterday.  Wheat for delivery in March, the most active contract, fell
1.6 percent to 3,411 rand ($384) a metric ton, the lowest since
July 13, by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg.  The rand appreciated for a second day, increasing 0.3
percent to 8.8721 a dollar by 12 p.m., when the market closed.
Wheat for March delivery retreated 2.3 percent to $7.2125 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the lowest since
June 21.  “Our rand has become a bit a strong,” Thys Grobbelaar an
analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by
phone. “In the U.S., the price went down and we follow them.”  South Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia . The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for July delivery declined 2.7 percent to 2,049
rand a ton, while the yellow variety fell 1.9 percent to 2,040
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
