China â€™s feed mills bought at least
120,000 metric tons of corn from the U.S. this week, the first
purchases this year as prices retreat, two industry executives
with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Two cargoes, each weighing 60,000 tons, are for delivery in
September and October, and are priced between $290 a ton and
$300 a ton, said the executives, who asked not to be identified
as the deals are private. More sales may have taken place, the
executives said, citing conversations with other traders.  Corn futures have tumbled 19 percent in  Chicago  since
reaching a record $8.49 a bushel in August on speculation that
global supplies may increase as the U.S. recovers from a
drought. Futures have lost 7.1 percent this month and traded at
$6.8775 a bushel at 4:36 p.m. in Singapore.  China  bought  a record of 5.23 million tons of corn in the
marketing year ended Sept. 30, and shipments this year are
forecast to fall to 2.5 million tons, according to the  U.S.
