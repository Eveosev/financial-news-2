West Texas Intermediate oil rose,
paring the biggest weekly decline since December, after German
business confidence climbed to a 10-month high and the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index advanced.  Futures gained 0.3 percent as the Munich-based Ifo
institute’s  business climate index  increased, signaling that
Europe’s largest economy is gathering strength. Equities also
rallied on the report. Oil tumbled $4.26 a barrel in the
previous two days. The drop accelerated yesterday after the
Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude  supplies  rose
4.14 million barrels last week to 376.4 million.  “The market is refocusing on the economy after the
bloodbath of the last couple days,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .
“The German investor confidence numbers were better than
expected, supporting the market today. The market is going to be
batted back and forth on the latest economic headlines.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose 29 cents to settle at
$93.13 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract ended at $92.84 yesterday, the lowest settlement since
Dec. 31. Futures dropped 2.8 percent this week, the most since
the seven days ended Dec. 7. The volume of all futures traded
was 26 percent below the 100-day average at 3:23 p.m.  Brent Gains  Brent oil for April settlement climbed 57 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $114.10 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Prices fell 3 percent this
week. The volume was 24 percent lower than the 100-day average.  The European benchmark crude grade settled at a $20.97
premium to WTI. The gap expanded to $23.18 on Feb. 8, the widest
level since level Nov. 26.  Ifo’s business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000
executives, climbed to 107.4 from 104.3 in January. Economists
predicted an increase to 104.9, according to the median of 38
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  both rose
0.7 percent. The  S&P 500  rebounded from a two-day, 1.9 percent
slump, its worst since Nov. 8.  The selloff in the oil market brings prices in line with
underlying fundamentals,  Jeffrey Currie , Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.’s head of commodities research in New York, said in a
report dated yesterday.  Gasoline inventories decreased 2.88 million barrels last
week, the EIA said yesterday. They were projected to fall
 900,000 barrels  in a Bloomberg survey. Distillate stockpiles,
including heating oil and diesel, slid 2.28 million barrels,
compared with a predicted 1.8 million decline.  Moving Averages  Futures in New York may decline after breaching support at
the 50-day moving average, according to a technical analysis by
Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in
Chicago. The April contract may move toward the 200-day moving
average around $92.22 a barrel, he said. It settled yesterday
below the 50-day mean for the first time since Dec. 18.  Oil prices  in New York will probably fall next week, a
Bloomberg survey showed. Twenty of 30 analysts and traders, or
67 percent, forecast crude will drop through March 1. Five
respondents, or 17 percent, predicted a gain. Five said there
would be little change.  Pending Cuts  If the  U.S. Congress  doesn’t act before a March 1 deadline,
automatic spending cuts known as sequestration will take effect.
Federal spending will be reduced by $85 billion in the final
seven months of this fiscal year and by $1.2 trillion over the
next nine years. By the end of 2013, inaction would lower the
gross domestic product by 0.6 percent and cost 750,000 jobs,
according to the non-partisan  Congressional Budget Office .  “The selling pressure has stopped at least for the
moment,” McGillian said. “There’s still a chance that some
agreement will be reached to avoid the sequester.”  In Italy, voters head for general elections on Sunday amid
concern the emergence of a populist government will derail the
nation’s austerity program. Caretaker Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
has failed to make headway in opinion polls, even as former
premier  Silvio Berlusconi  and ex-comic Beppe Grillo gained
popularity. Pier Luigi Bersani, the union-backed Democratic
Party candidate, leads the field.  “Attention next week will be focused on whether we’re able
to avoid sequestration here and whether Berlusconi returns to
power in Italy,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts.
“Either event could have a major impact on prices.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 350,491
contracts as of 3:21 p.m. It totaled 588,483 contracts
yesterday, 12 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.65 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
