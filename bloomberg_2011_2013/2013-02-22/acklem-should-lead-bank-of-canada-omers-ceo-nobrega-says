Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System Chief Executive Officer Michael Nobrega said
Tiff Macklem should replace  Mark Carney  as head of the  Bank of
Canada .  Nobrega said he doesn’t know any external candidates who
would  do a better job than Macklem, who as senior deputy
governor is the No. 2 executive at the Bank of Canada. Carney is
leaving the post on June 1 to run the  Bank of England .  “I can’t think of anyone outside of the central banker
right now that would qualify for that position,” said Nobrega,
speaking to reporters today in Toronto. Macklem is “highly
qualified, I listen to him,” said the head of the province’s
second-largest pension fund, known as Omers.  While Macklem, 51, has been the near unanimous choice of
economists and analysts asked about the appointment, the
previous two selections passed over the senior deputies who had
been seen as favorites.  The 12 outside directors on the bank’s board started the
job search last month, placing an advertisement in newspapers.
In a Jan. 17 statement, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he
will be directly involved in the selection of Carney’s
replacement. The directors and government are looking at a broad
pool of candidates beyond internal choices, a person with
knowledge of the process told  Bloomberg News  last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
