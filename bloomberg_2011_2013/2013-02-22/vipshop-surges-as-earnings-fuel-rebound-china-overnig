Chinese stocks rose in New York for
the first time in six days, led by  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  and
 Elong (LONG)  Inc., as companies report better-than-estimated earnings
amid a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese equities in the U.S. climbed 0.7 percent to 93.96 by
12:05 p.m., paring a weekly drop of 2.5 percent. Vipshop surged
11 percent after the online fashion discounter reported its
first quarterly profit and said it will sell more shares. Elong,
China’s second-biggest Internet travel agency, jumped the most
this month, while  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  gained 3.2
percent on higher solar-panel shipments.  The 15 companies on the China-US gauge that have reported
over the past month posted earnings that were on average more
than triple analysts’ estimates, after results fell below
projections by 9.1 percent in the previous quarter,  data 
compiled by Bloomberg show.  China’s economy  emerged from its
seven-quarter slowdown in the three months to Dec. 31, when
Vipshop earned net income more than eight times the mean of two
analysts’ estimates.  “We have pretty healthy expectations for company earnings
growth,” Marc Tommasi, head of global investment strategy at
Manning & Napier Advisors LLC, which manages $45 billion in
assets including Chinese equities, said by phone from Rochester,
New York. “Chinese stocks are not overpriced. The Chinese
economy troughed in the third quarter, a modest expansion is
what’s in store.”  China Valuations  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., was little changed at $38.48
