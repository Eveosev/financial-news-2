Agrium Inc. (AGU) , the largest supplier of
fertilizer and seeds to U.S. farmers, fell the most in three
months after the U.S. government forecast a drop in corn prices
amid expectations for a record crop.  Shares of the Calgary-based company declined 5.2 percent to
C$103.14 in Toronto, the biggest drop since Nov. 7.  Companies reliant on spending by farmers “may be losing
their luster as investors probably realize the near-term top is
in the rear-view mirror,” Robert Winslow, a Toronto-based
analyst at National Bank Financial, said today by e-mail.  The U.S. Agriculture Department yesterday forecast corn
prices paid to farmers in the 12 months that will begin Sept. 1
will average $4.80 a bushel, down 33 percent from a record $7.20
predicted for this year.  Corn stockpiles before next year’s harvest may rise to
2.177 billion bushels from a 17-year low of 632 million
projected this year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
today in a  report .  Through yesterday, corn futures on the Chicago Board of
Trade dropped 19 percent from a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Agrium yesterday reported adjusted fourth-quarter profit
that beat analyst’s expectations. Profit, excluding one-time
items, was $2.16 a share, more than the $2.03 average of 20
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The beat was largely because of a 12-cent-a-share EPS
bump from interest income, which is hardly anything to get
excited about,” Winslow said.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, fell 1 percent to C$39.96
in Toronto.  Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the largest maker of phosphate
fertilizer, dropped 0.5 percent to $57.47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
