Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  plans service
upgrades on some transcontinental U.S. flights from New York as
competition intensifies in the nation’s biggest aviation market.  Amenities will include sparkling wine and newspapers in
business class and an expanded library of movies and on-demand
television, Atlanta-based Delta said in a statement today. The
routes are between New York’s John F. Kennedy International
Airport and San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle.  Delta, the world’s second-largest carrier, is poised to
slide to No. 3 as the planned merger of AMR Corp.’s  American
Airlines (AAMRQ)  and  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  creates a new No. 1. American
also uses Kennedy for transcontinental flights, while United
Continental Holdings Inc., now the biggest airline by traffic,
has a hub at New Jersey’s Newark Liberty International Airport.  Transcontinental routes from New York are among the busiest
in the U.S. industry. Virgin America Inc. and  JetBlue Airways
Corp. (JBLU)  also serve the U.S. West Coast from Kennedy airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
