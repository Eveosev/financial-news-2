A tuberculosis outbreak in Los
Angeles is spurring U.S. health investigators to help local
officials contain the spread of the contagious lung infection.  Federal scientists will be dispatched in the next two weeks
to work with Los Angeles officials, Scott Bryan, a spokesman for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said today in an
e-mail. The Atlanta-based CDC was invited by health officials
from Los Angeles County and the state of California to assist in
an investigation, he said.  Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium that usually attacks
the lungs and can be fatal if not treated. It’s spread through
the air when a person with the active disease of the lungs or
throat coughs or sneezes. Bryan declined to explain in detail
why the CDC’s help was requested, referring additional questions
to local and state health departments.  The Los Angeles Department of Public Health didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment. The Los Angeles Times
reported yesterday that a persistent strain of the disease had
been spreading through the homeless population in a city
neighborhood. More than 4,500 people may have been exposed, the
newspaper reported.  About 10,500 TB cases occurred in the U.S. in 2011, the
lowest since national  reporting  began in 1953, according to the
CDC. There were 529 deaths from the infection in 2009, the most
recent year for which data are available, according to the
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
