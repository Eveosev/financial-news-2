Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) , Colombia’s
largest cement maker, fell the most on the country’s benchmark
stock index this week as the company said it may sell preferred
shares to help fund growth.  The  common shares  fell 5.2 percent during the week to close
at 9,470 pesos in Bogota, the lowest price since Nov. 30. The
shares fell 2.4 percent today. The daily and weekly declines
were both the biggest among the 21 stocks in the benchmark
Colcap index.  Cementos Argos, based in Medellin, will propose a sale of
preferred stock at a shareholder meeting on March 15, according
to a regulatory filing on Feb. 20 that didn’t specify the amount
or timing of the sale.  Investors expect to get more information on the offering
after Cemargos reports earnings next week, according to
Sebastian Gallego, an analyst at Corredores Asociados SA.
Cemargos is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb.
25.  The company is planning to sell shares in both local and
international markets, Cementos Argos said in a Feb. 15 filing.
The sale will “increase financial flexibility to maximize
growth opportunities,” the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
