Lithuania ’s credit rating won’t be
affected by the restructuring of  Ukio Bankas (UKB1L)  AB,  Standard &
Poor’s  said.  The lender’s restructuring probably won’t affect the
financial stability of the Lithuanian banking system, S&P, which
rates the country’s debt BBB, its second-lowest investment
grade, the ratings company said in a statement from London
today.  “As Ukio Bankas was predominantly deposit funded,
accounting for less than 8 percent of total system resident
deposits, we do not expect the likely restructuring of the bank
to affect the financial stability of Lithuania’s banking
system,” Ivan Morozov, an S&P credit analyst in London, wrote
in the report.  Lithuania is lending 800 million litai ($305 million) for
six years to cover the payouts for Ukio’s depositors, which had
its license revoked on Feb. 18, since the lender’s liabilities
exceeded its assets, according to the central bank. The loan
will raise S&P’s forecast for net general government debt to 39
percent of gross domestic product by the end of the year,
Morozov wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
