Commerzbank AG (CBK) ’s debut issue of
European covered bonds backed by loans to small- and medium-
sized companies attracted support from central banks.  Commerzbank said it sold 36 percent of its 500 million
euros ($659 million) of five-year notes to central banks or
agencies, with 28 percent going to asset managers and 27 percent
to other lenders. German buyers accounted for 44 percent of all
purchases, Commerzbank said.  Such a high participation by central banks is “unusual”
for covered bond issues, with other deals this year typically
selling about 5 percent to the public-sector institutions, said
Ralf Burmeister, a Frankfurt-based  fund manager  at Deutsche
Asset & Wealth Management, which oversees 944 billion euros.  Banks are starting to seek alternatives to the real estate
and public-sector debt traditionally used to collateralize the
securities pioneered in 18th century Prussia. They’re running
out of these safer assets to package into covered bonds, a
process hastened by the meltdown of Europe’s property market,
and  Fitch Ratings  said at least two other lenders were preparing
to follow Commerzbank with SME-backed issues.  Commerzbank said its covered bonds were twice subscribed,
in spite of concern from investors including  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ,
which said SME-backed deals risked devaluing the asset class.
Pacific Investment Management Co. said the notes from Germany’s
second-biggest bank may not qualify for benchmark indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
