A drop in cattle supplies and
improved poultry and pork demand will boost meat prices this
year, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Beef production will drop 3 percent to 25.1 billion pounds
on reduced supplies of slaughter-ready cattle, according to
Shayle Shagam, a USDA livestock economist. The domestic cattle
herd shrank for a sixth straight year in 2012, and the beef-cow
herd on Jan. 1 was the lowest since 1962. U.S. beef imports will
rise 16 percent, he said. The average steer price will rise to
$1.295 a pound in 2013 from a record $1.2286 last year.  “The estimated retail-beef price will rise slightly above
the record $5.02 a pound in 2012,” Shagam said today at the
agency’s annual agricultural forum in Arlington, Virginia.
“Improved economic growth and reduced U.S. cow slaughter will
support increased imports” of hamburger meat, he said.  Chicken production will rise 0.7 percent to 37.3 billion
pounds, Shagam said. The breeding flock in December was larger
than a year earlier for the first time in 23 months, and the
number of chickens hatched in the October-to-December period
exceeded the year-earlier amount for the first time since the
first quarter of 2011, Shagam said. Broiler prices will average
a record 95 cents a pound, up from 87 cents last year.  “Despite higher production, tight supplies of beef and
improving economic conditions are likely to support strong
demand for broiler meat,” Shagam said. “Increased demand for
chicken meat is likely to manifest in record retail prices.”  Pork Outlook  Commercial pork production will rise 0.7 percent to 23.4
billion pounds, with hog slaughter increasing 1 percent, Shagam
said. Pork exports may reach 5.46 billion pounds, up from a
record 5.38 billion in 2012.  Hog prices  will average 63 cents a
pound in 2013, up from 60.88 cents in 2012, he said.  “Higher forecast beef and broiler prices and increased
exports may provide support for the hog sector, if consumers
view pork as price competitive,” Shagam said.  Turkey production will increase about 1 percent to 6.03
billion pounds after a 3.1 percent increase in 2012, Shagam
said. The national turkey-hen price will average $1.035 a pound
in 2013, down from $1.06 in 2012.  Exports for 2013 will rise about 4 percent to 830 million
pounds as weaker turkey prices and stronger broiler prices
provide increased export opportunities, Shagam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
