Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , the second-
largest U.S. stock exchange, said it will add data on the depth
of equity markets to its UltraFeed product by including quotes
beyond the best bid and ask.  The feed will include Nasdaq TotalView, which shows the
full order book to clients, according to an e-mail from the New
York-based company today. UltraFeed distributes data to clients
on North American stocks, options, futures, indexes and mutual
funds. The changes will start March 4, Nasdaq said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
