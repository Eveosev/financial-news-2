Assicurazioni Generali SpA (UCG) , Italyâ€™s
biggest insurer, said gross premiums climbed 3.2 percent to 69.6
billion euros ($91.8 billion) last year, driven by growth in
Germany and central and eastern Europe.  Life premiums increased 3.1 percent to 46.8 billion euros,
while non-life business rose 3.3 percent to 22.8 billion euros,
the Trieste, Italy-based company said today in a  statement .  Mario Greco , who took the helm at Generali in August, is
seeking to convince investors he can revive profit and boost
capital by cutting costs, shedding non-strategic assets and
targeting faster-growing emerging markets.  The insurer will release full-year results on March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
