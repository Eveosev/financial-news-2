Romania’s economy  will probably grow
1.6 percent this year and expand 2.5 percent in 2014, driven by
domestic demand, after output growth stagnated last year because
of a drought, the European Commission said.  The Balkan nation will probably narrow its  budget deficit 
to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2013 from 2.9
percent last year under European accounting standards, the
European Union’s executive arm said in a statement today.  “Benefiting from the expected acceleration in economic
activity and based on the customary no-policy-change assumption,
the deficit is expected to decrease further to 2.2 percent of
GDP in 2014,” the commission said.  Romania’s economic rebound is gaining traction as the
nation recovers from its worst recession on record, overcoming
two years of stringent austerity measures. The country is on
track to be among the fastest-growing economies among the EU’s
newest members, trailing the Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania
and  Estonia .  The country’s 2013  inflation rate  is forecast to average
4.6 percent,  Europe ’s fastest, before falling to 3.3 percent on
average in 2014 as gradual government deregulation boosts energy
prices, according to the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
