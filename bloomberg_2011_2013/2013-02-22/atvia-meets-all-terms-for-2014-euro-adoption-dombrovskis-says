Latvia , which is seeking to become
the 18th country to adopt the euro, meets all conditions for the
switch next year, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said.  The Baltic nation is ready to be evaluated on its
preparedness to become part of the common currency, Finance
Minister Andris Vilks said today. The Cabinet will decide March
4 on an application for a convergence report that will deliver
the European Union’s verdict on whether the country meets the
terms, he said. Dombrovskis and Vilks spoke at a conference in
the capital, Riga.  With the euro-region debt crisis abating, the EU’s eastern
members are reviving their bids to join the currency. Latvia’s
Baltic neighbor  Lithuania  plans to start using the euro in 2015
and  Poland  has also reiterated plans to make the switch later.
In the former communist east, Slovenia, Slovakia and Estonia are
already using the euro.  Latvia’s inflation rate will drop to 1.9 percent this year
and climb to 2.2 percent next year, the European Commission said
in its winter forecasts today. Still, the core inflation rate is
rising toward the headline number on higher wages and
employment, the commission said.  The economy will grow 3.8 percent this year and 4.1 percent
in 2014, the commission said. “Robust” economic growth will
cut the  budget deficit  to 1.1 percent of gross domestic product
this year and 0.9 percent in 2014, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
