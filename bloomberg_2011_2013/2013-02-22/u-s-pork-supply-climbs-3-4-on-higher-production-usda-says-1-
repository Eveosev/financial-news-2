Pork inventories in the U.S. rose
3.4 percent at the end of January from a year earlier as
production increased, the government said.  Warehouses held 605.27 million pounds of pork, up from
585.31 million on Jan. 31, 2012, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories climbed 9.7
percent from the end of December.  Commercial pork output last month totaled 2.066 billion
pounds, 4 percent higher than January 2012, government data
show. About 9.96 million hogs were slaughtered in January, up
4.4 percent from a year earlier, according to USDA statistics.
U.S. pork exports to  Japan , the biggest buyer, fell 6.9 percent
last year from a year earlier, the latest government data show.  “We have stocks that were already pretty high,”  Bob Brown , an independent market consultant in Edmond,  Oklahoma ,
said in a telephone interview before the report. “A gain in
pork production from a year ago and a potential reduction in
exports to a major customer like Japan -- all those things
combined probably increase our stocks.”  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.9 percent to close
at 81.65 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. That capped the eighth straight session of declines,
the longest losing streak since October 2008. Prices have
slumped 4.8 percent this year.  As of Jan. 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, fell 32 percent from a year earlier to
36.38 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham rose 9.7 percent from a year ago to 109.27
million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of January were 8.2
percent larger than a year earlier at 657.68 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies fell 0.2 percent to 484 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
