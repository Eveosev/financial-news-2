China’s  yuan  had a fourth weekly
decline on speculation the U.S. will scale back asset purchases
that have spurred inflows to  emerging markets  and after the
central bank reduced the fixing.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the daily  reference  rate
to 6.2871 per dollar, compared with 6.2846 yesterday. It was
0.12 percent weaker than Feb. 8, when markets closed for the
week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Minutes of the Federal
Reserve’s Jan. 29-30 meeting showed several policy makers said
the U.S. central bank should be ready to vary the pace of its
$85 billion of monthly bond buying.  “The weaker fixing does translate into less demand for the
yuan,” said George Kwok, client manager at foreign-exchange
dealing at  Western Union Co. (WU)  in Hong Kong. “There are concerns
the Fed will reduce asset purchases but I don’t see a high
chance as economic data has yet to suggest strong growth.”  The yuan fell 0.04 percent this week to close at 6.2351 per
dollar in Shanghai, prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System show. It reached 6.2454 on Feb. 19, the lowest level
since Dec. 14. Spot prices are allowed to diverge a maximum 1
percent from the reference rate.  The currency advanced 0.09 percent today as yuan funding
was tighter than yesterday and with “good buying flow” from a
local bank, Societe Generale SA’s Hong Kong-based strategist
Wee-Khoon Chong wrote in a research note today.  Potential Curbs  China’s new home prices rose in most cities the government
tracks in January, renewing concerns it will impose further
curbs on real estate. Housing costs climbed in 53 of 70 cities,
compared with 54 in December, according to data today from the
National Bureau of Statistics.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency appreciated
0.11 percent today to 6.2350 per dollar, limiting its weekly
loss to 0.26 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed today
at 6.3235, down 0.17 percent from a week ago. The contracts
traded at a 1.4 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.28
percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
