The Czech fiscal deficit will exceed
the government’s target this year as the economy is set to
stagnate after a contraction in 2012, according to European
Commission forecasts.  The Czech public-finance  deficit , the fiscal yardstick for
assessing a European Union member’s readiness to adopt the euro,
will be 3.1 percent of  economic output  in 2013, after two one-
time operations widened the gap to 5.2 percent last year, the
Brussels-based European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said
in the winter forecasts today. The government’s 2013 deficit
target is 2.9 percent of gross domestic product.  The GDP will stagnate this year, after shrinking 1.1
percent in 2012, the commission said. The economy will expand
1.9 percent in 2014, according to the forecast. Gross debt will
rise to 48 percent of GDP in 2013, from 45.5 percent, while
consumer-price inflation calculated according to the EU
methodology will slow to 2.1 percent, from 3.5 percent in 2012.  “The outlook for 2013 is one of stagnation as the domestic
demand is projected to remain weak, while external demand is set
to pick up and shore up output only in the second half of the
year,” the commission said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
