U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery jumped to the highest level in more than a year as
temperatures fell, boosting demand to a one-month high as
Norwegian flows dropped.  Within-day gas surged as much as 17 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since April, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow was
predicted at 372 million cubic meters, the most since Jan. 24
and above the seasonal normal of 303 million,  National Grid Plc (NG/) 
data show. Flows from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of
imported gas, were at 91 million cubic meters a day versus a 10-
day average of 111 million, Gassco AS data show.  Gas for today gained 12.05 pence to 81 pence a therm, the
most since Feb. 10, 2012, before trading at 74 pence at 4:36
p.m. London time.  Next-month gas  advanced 0.2 percent to 67.05
pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.23 per million British
thermal units and compares with $3.25 per million Btu of front-
month U.S. gas.  The average temperature in the U.K. will be 0.3 degrees
Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) at 6 p.m. London time, according to
MetraWeather data on Bloomberg using the GFS model. The previous
estimate was for 0.8 degrees, the data show.  Statoil ASA (STL)  said Norwegian flows were cut by 14.7 million
cubic meters a day in two separate cases of unplanned
maintenance.  System flows  reached 399 million cubic meters a day, the
most since Feb. 14, grid data show. The delivery system will
contain 350 million cubic meters of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow,
little changed from 24 hours earlier, the data show.  Gas accounted for 36 percent of U.K. power production at
4:35 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 40 percent, nuclear 16
percent and wind 3.2 percent.  Wind generation  will peak at 1,343 megawatts tomorrow after
reaching 2,097 today, Bloomberg calculations show. It reached a
record 5,082 megawatts Feb. 3, grid data show.  Electricity for the next working day rose 5.4 percent to 54
pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
