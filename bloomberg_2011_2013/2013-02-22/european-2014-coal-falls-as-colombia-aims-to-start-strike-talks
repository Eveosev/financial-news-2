European coal for next year fell to
the lowest in a week as the Colombian government tries to
restart talks to end a strike at the countryâ€™s largest mine.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp dropped 35 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $98.75 a metric
ton at 1:20 p.m. London time, according to broker data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Coal from  Colombia  covers more than 20 percent of European
import demand, Andrew Cosgrove, a Princeton, New Jersey-based
analyst at Bloomberg Industries, said in a Feb. 14 note. Workers
at the Cerrejon mine started a strike on Feb. 7 over wages and
benefits.  Union leaders met with the Colombian Labor Ministry in
Bogota yesterday, the  Sintracarbon  union said on its website.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
