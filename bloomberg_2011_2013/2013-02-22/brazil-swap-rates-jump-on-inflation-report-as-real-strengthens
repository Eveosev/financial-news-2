Brazil ’s swap rates extended their
sixth straight week of increases as a report showed consumer
prices rose more than forecast, bolstering speculation that the
central bank will raise borrowing costs this year.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 climbed
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.74 percent at
10:04 a.m. in  Sao Paulo  and have risen 12 basis points since
Feb. 15. The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.9666 per dollar,
leaving it 0.1 percent stronger this week.  Traders increased bets the central bank will lift  interest
rates  from a record low 7.25 percent after the national
statistics agency reported consumer prices as measured by the
IPCA-15 index rose 0.68 percent in the month through mid-
February. The figure surpassed the 0.62 percent median estimate
of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual inflation has
exceeded policy makers’ 4.5 percent target for more than two
years.  “The IPCA figure was not good,”  Newton Rosa , the chief
economist at SulAmerica Investimentos in Sao Paulo, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “This should feed more bets on an
increase in the benchmark rate.”  Central bank president Alexandre Tombini said yesterday in
Urbana, Illinois, that the government is now less concerned
about the “currency war” than previously.  To contact the reporters on this story:
