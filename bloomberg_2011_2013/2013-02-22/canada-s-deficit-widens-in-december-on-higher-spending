Canada ’s  federal budget  deficit
widened in December from a year earlier, as the government
increased spending on programs.  The shortfall widened to C$572 million ($559 million), from
C$538 million the same month a year earlier, the finance
department said in a  monthly report  from Ottawa. The deficit in
the first nine months of the fiscal year that began April 1
narrowed to C$13 billion from C$16.1 billion.  Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who projects a shortfall of
C$26 billion for the fiscal year that ends March 31, is seeking
to balance the country’s books by 2015 through spending cuts as
faltering growth curbs revenue.  Canada’s economy probably had its worst six-month
performance since the end of the 2009 recession in the last half
of 2012 as exports softened.  Flaherty scaled back revenue projections in a November
budget update by an average of about C$7.2 billion over the next
five years, citing lower commodity prices.  Revenue in December rose 2.8 percent on greater receipts
from personal income taxes, while program spending was up 3.8
percent.  Nine-month revenue was up 3 percent, down from a pace of
4.2 percent growth in the first nine months of the last fiscal
year. Program spending rose 2.2 percent from April to December
compared with a year earlier, after contracting over the same
period in the previous two fiscal years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
