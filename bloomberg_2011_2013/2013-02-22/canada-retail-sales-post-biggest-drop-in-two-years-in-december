Canadian retailers in December
recorded the  biggest drop  in sales in almost three years, as car
purchases plunged, suggesting the nation’s economy remained weak
at the end of last year.  Sales fell 2.1 percent to C$38.6 billion ($37.9 billion),
bringing the  value  of retailer receipts to the lowest since
September 2011, after a revised 0.3 percent gain in November,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The monthly decline was
the biggest since April 2010. Economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg
News  forecast a 0.3 percent drop.  Today’s release is the last major piece of data before
Statistics Canada releases fourth-quarter growth figures on
March 1, and adds to evidence the country’s economy probably
didn’t accelerate much in the last three months of 2012.  The  Bank of Canada  projects output increased by a 1 percent
annualized pace in the fourth quarter, up from the 0.6 percent
pace recorded in the third quarter, yielding the slowest six-
month performance since 2009.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said last month an
increase to his 1 percent  policy interest rate  has become “less
imminent” because of a weaker-than-expected economy.  The volume of sales, which excludes the effects of price
changes and more closely reflects the industry’s contribution to
economic growth, fell 1.6 percent in December.  Automobile and parts sales fell 6.4 percent to C$8.54
billion, the agency said. Purchases at retailers excluding  car
dealerships  fell 0.9 percent. On that basis, economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast 0.2 percent growth.  Seven of the 11 retail categories tracked by  Statistics
Canada  recorded declines in December, representing 58 percent of
total retail trade. Electronics and appliance store retailers
reported a 12.1 percent drop in sales. Department stores,
sporting goods retailers and home furnishing outlets also posted
declines.  Sales in December were 0.7 percent lower than a year
earlier, Statistics Canada said. For all of 2012, retail sales
were up 2.5 percent from 2011, the slowest since the 2009
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
