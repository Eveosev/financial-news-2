Datalink Corp. (DTLK) , a provider of data-
storage and cloud-computing services, plans to use acquisitions
to help double sales to $1 billion within three years, Chief
Executive Officer Paul Lidsky said.  The  Eden Prairie , Minnesota-based company is shopping for
smaller competitors with annual sales of $60 million to $125
million to expand in the U.S. and expects to complete one deal
every 12 to 18 months, Lidsky said in an interview yesterday.  With  operations  in 20 states and the  District of Columbia ,
Datalink grew revenue 29 percent to $491.2 million last year as
more customers sought its help using Web-based software and
accessing data on remote servers. Datalink is benefiting from a
surge in cloud-computing, a  market  that will reach $270 billion
worldwide by 2020, according to Market Research Media Ltd.  “We can get to $1 billion with the right acquisitions
within three years,” he said. It would take five years to hit
that sales milestone through organic growth.  In October, Datalink agreed to buy  Midas Medici Group
Holdings Inc. (MMED) ’s StraTech unit for about $20.3 million, gaining
customers in the eastern U.S. Most previous deals have been
around $20 million to $30 million, Lidsky said.  Datalink will probably post sales of $567.5 million this
year, according to the average of analysts’  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. The average prediction for next year is $627.5
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
