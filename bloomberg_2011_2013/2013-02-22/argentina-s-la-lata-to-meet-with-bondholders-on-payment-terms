Central Termica Loma de la Lata SA,
owned by  Argentina ’s biggest electricity company, will meet with
bondholders in an attempt to restructure the terms of its 2015
bonds.  La Lata, as the company owned by  Pampa Energia SA (PAMP)  is known,
will have the meeting on March 1 in Buenos Aires to discuss
changing its interest payments, it said in a note sent to the
Argentine regulator.  On Nov. 23, the company said an electric storm halted its
TurboVapor unit, prompting Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings analysts to say La Lata may struggle to service the
bonds, as the damaged turbine accounts for almost 90 percent of
the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda.  Loma de la Lata has $166 million of 2015 unsecured notes
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The damaged turbine was sent to  Germany  for repairs and
should be back and operating in a matter of days, a company
official who can’t be named according to the company’s internal
policy said. He declined to comment on new terms for the bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
