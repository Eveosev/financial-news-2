India ’s bonds due 2022 completed a
third weekly advance after the government scaled back its debt
sale program by canceling the final auction of this fiscal year.  The finance ministry scrapped a plan to issue 120 billion
rupees ($2.2 billion) of securities scheduled for this week,
according to a statement on Feb. 18. The sale was originally
part of a program to raise a record 5.69 trillion rupees in the
year ending March 31. Expectations that the Reserve Bank of
India will buy sovereign notes using open-market auctions are
also supporting bonds, according to Barclays Plc.  “In addition to no new supply over the next one and a half
months, we think the likelihood of the RBI buying bonds via
open-market operations is high,” Barclays analysts including
Singapore-based Rohit Arora wrote in a research note today.
“These factors are supportive of bonds.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, this week to 7.80
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate fell one basis point today.  The central bank bought 1.3 trillion rupees of government
securities this fiscal year from open-market auctions to boost
cash at banks, up from 336 billion rupees a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point this week to 7.63 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
