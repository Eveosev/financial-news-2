Brazil  isn’t currently lacking in
demand and needs to address its supply-side issues, central bank
President Alexandre Tombini said today.  “Supply side policies take longer to bear fruit than
demand side policies,” Tombini said today in Urbana,  Illinois .
“Brazil is not lacking demand today.”  The central bank president also said that Brazil has low
unemployment due to labor hoarding and that the government is
currently less concerned by the currency war than previously.  “We were concerned then, now we are less concerned” by
the currency war, the bank’s president said. “We have prepared
for that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
