Ethanol snapped the longest streak
of gains against gasoline in five weeks as prices for the motor
fuel rose for the first time in four days and production of the
biofuel increased.  The spread widened 3.01 cents to 71.66 cents a gallon,
based on futures settlement prices, the first expansion since
Feb. 14. Gasoline prices recovered a day after the Energy
Information Administration said  supplies  sank 2.88 million
barrels and ethanol  production  grew for a third week.  “Production has been up a little bit,” said Will Babler,
a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,
 Illinois . “Margins have come off the lows. Some plants have
increased run rates.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery rose 1.3 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.363 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have advanced 7.9 percent this year.  March-delivery gasoline gained 4.31 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $3.0796 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Output’s third weekly gain is the longest since November,
the Energy Department’s analytical arm said in the report
yesterday. Production is down 17 percent from the record 963,000
barrels a day in December 2011 as companies navigate poor
returns for the fuel because of higher corn prices.  Corn for March delivery fell 0.5 cent to $6.9025 a bushel
in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
Corn futures rose to a record $8.49 a bushel in August as
drought in the Midwest cut yields.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 15 cents,
compared with minus 16 cents yesterday and minus 35 cents on
Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production,
which can be fed to livestock.  Under a 2007 energy law, U.S. refiners are required to use
13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this year, up from 13.2 billion
in 2012.  Lower output has lifted the price for Renewable
Identification Numbers, known as RINs, which help the government
track whether refiners are meeting federal biofuel mandates,
Babler said.  RINs for  corn-based ethanol  jumped 32 percent to 45 cents
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while the
worth of the  advanced variety , which includes biodiesel and
sugarcane-based Brazilian grade, climbed 16 percent to 59.5
cents.  RIN Costs  The advanced RINs’ premium over the conventional sort
narrowed to the tightest difference since Jan. 29, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “With these lower run-rates, it will be hard to meet the
mandate,” Babler said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total gasoline pool, up from 89 percent last week, the EIA said.  Stockpiles were little changed at 19.5 million barrels, the
report showed, while imports almost doubled to 21,000 barrels a
day from the previous week.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.38 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, 0.8 percent more
expensive than today’s futures price.  Babler said ethanol would get a boost if refiners and
filling stations implemented higher concentrations of the fuel
in gasoline.  EPA Appeal  The American Petroleum Institute, the American Meat
Institute and other groups said yesterday that they appealed to
the Supreme Court an Environmental Protection Agency decision to
allow gasoline to be sold with as much as 15 percent ethanol for
vehicles made after 2001.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York jumped 2 cents
to $2.48 a gallon, in Chicago the biofuel rose 1.5 cents to
$2.37, in the U.S. Gulf the additive climbed 1.5 cents to $2.42
and prices on the West Coast were unchanged at $2.52 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The West Coast’s premium to the Gulf Coast thinned to 10
cents, the narrowest level since Jan. 22, while ethanol in New
York Harbor was 11 cents more expensive than in Chicago, the
highest level since Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
