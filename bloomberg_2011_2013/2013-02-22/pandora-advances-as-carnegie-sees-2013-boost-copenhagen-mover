Pandora A/S (PNDORA)  rose to the highest
price in 18 months in Copenhagen trading after Carnegie
Investment Bank AB said the Nordic region’s biggest jewelry
maker will return to sales growth in 2013.  Pandora rose as much as 1.8 percent to 146.70 kroner, the
highest since August 2011. The shares gained 1.6 percent to
146.40 kroner at 11:22 a.m. in the Danish capital with trading
volume at 54 percent of the three-month daily average. The stock
has risen the past four days, its longest winning streak in six
weeks.  Pandora was  2012’s best performer  among  Denmark ’s benchmark
stocks after the company succeeded in improving profits at the
expense of revenue growth with a strategy to cut prices and swap
retailers’ old stock for better-selling products. Carnegie today
repeated a buy recommendation on the stock and said 2013 revenue
could rise 18 percent, helped by openings of new stores.  “2013 should be the year when revenue grows again,” Lars Topholm, an analyst at Carnegie in Copenhagen, said in a note.
“Our dealer survey suggests sales-out momentum has strengthened
in the U.S., the U.K. and  Australia .”  Glostrup, Denmark-based Pandora is due to publish 2012
earnings and a 2013 forecast on Feb. 26.  Pandora’s 2012 sales declined 1.8 percent to 6.54 billion
kroner ($1.16 billion), according to the average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the second year in
a row of falling revenue after sales quadrupled in the two years
through 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
