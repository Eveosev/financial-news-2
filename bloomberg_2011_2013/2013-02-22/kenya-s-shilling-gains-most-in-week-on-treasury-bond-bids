Kenya ’s shilling appreciated the
most in more than a week as investors prepared to pay for bids
of treasury bonds.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.3 percent to 87.35 per dollar and traded 0.1 percent
stronger at 87.50 per dollar by 11:28 a.m. in Nairobi, the most
since Feb 11 on a closing basis, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 25.5 billion shillings ($291
million) of two-year and 15-year treasury bonds at an auction on
Feb. 20, more than the 15 billion shillings offered, after
receiving bids of 44.8 billion shillings, the bank said in an e-
mailed statement. Payment is to be made on Feb. 25, according to
the bank website.  “The shilling has received support from investors
preparing to pay for their successful bids of treasury bonds
through increase inflow of dollars,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of
trading at Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said today.
“There is minimal demand for dollars in the market”.  The shilling will trade around 87.30 to 87.80 per dollar,
Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note today.  Kenya will hold its presidential vote on March 4, the first
since a disputed 2007 ballot sparked two months of violence in
which more than 1,100 people died. The currency may decline to
89 a dollar by voting day, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of analysts and traders last month.  Uganda ’s currency snapped a 5-day losing streak, gaining
0.8 percent to 2,688 per dollar, the most since Dec. 24,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Tanzanian shilling
fell for the third day, weakening 0.6 percent to 1,637 per
dollar, the lowest since December 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
