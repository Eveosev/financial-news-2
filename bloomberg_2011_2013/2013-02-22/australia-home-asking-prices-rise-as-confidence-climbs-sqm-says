Price expectations of home sellers
are climbing across  Australia  as confidence of a recovery in the
real estate market grows, according to  SQM Research Pty.   Asking prices rose 0.4 percent for apartments and 1.5
percent for houses in the 90 days to Feb. 19 across the nation’s
eight major cities, the Sydney-based researcher said in an e-
mailed release of its first weekly asking prices index. They’re
2.3 percent higher for houses than a year earlier and 1.6
percent for apartments, it said.  “A rise in asking prices suggests home sellers are
becoming more confident of market conditions,” SQM said in the
release. It also shows “buyers are bidding more aggressively
for real estate.”  Reductions in the  Reserve Bank  of Australia’s  benchmark
interest rate  to 3 percent, a level matching a half-century low,
have helped boost  home prices  across Australia. Prices in the
five biggest cities climbed 1.1 percent yesterday from a year
earlier, the RP Data-Rismark Daily Home Value Index showed.  Online home listings dropped 13 percent in January from a
year earlier to the lowest level in three years, indicating an
increase in purchases, SQM said in a separate report this month.  Darwin apartments had the biggest increase in asking prices,
surging almost 20 percent from a year earlier. Detached housing
in Hobart and Canberra remain favorable to buyers, with asking
prices dropping 3.9 percent and 3.6 percent respectively from a
year ago, SQM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
