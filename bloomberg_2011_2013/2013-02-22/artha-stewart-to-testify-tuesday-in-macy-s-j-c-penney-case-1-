Martha Stewart will testify Feb. 26
in the trial of  Macy’s (M)  Inc.’s lawsuits that seek to block an
agreement she made with  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  to sell her goods in its
department stores.  Macy’s Chief Executive Officer  Terry Lundgren  is scheduled
to testify Feb. 25 in the state-court trial in Manhattan, and
J.C. Penney CEO Ron Johnson is expected to be a witness on March
1, New York Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Oing said at the
conclusion of yesterday’s proceedings. Oing will decide the case
without a jury.  Macy’s, based in Cincinnati, sued  Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia (MSO)  Inc. in January 2012 to stop it from going ahead with
an agreement with J.C. Penney announced the previous month.
Macy’s said it has the exclusive right to sell Stewart’s branded
bedding and cookware.  Oing granted an injunction to Macy’s last year to prevent
the Penney agreement from going forward while the case proceeds.
Macy’s sued J.C. Penney in the same court in August, claiming
tortious interference and unfair competition.  Martha Stewart  Living, based in New York, defended its deal
with J.C. Penney, saying that Macy’s breached their contract by
favoring private-label brands over Stewart’s.  J.C. Penney, based in Plano, Texas, acquired a 17 percent
stake in Martha Stewart Living for $38.5 million in 2011.  The cases are Macy’s Inc. v. Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc., 650197/2012, and Macy’s Inc. v. J.C. Penney
Corp., 652861/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
