Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
city’s benchmark index declining for a second day, amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  is nearing the end of its easing
cycle and after home prices declined in some Chinese cities.  New World Development Co., a Hong Kong-based developer that
gets about half of revenue from China, slipped 0.8 percent.
Belle International Holdings Ltd. declined 3.7 percent,
extending yesterday’s slump, as analysts from Nomura Holdings
Inc. and CCB International Securities Ltd. downgraded shares of
the women’s shoe retailer. Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Ltd.
slid 5.5 percent after the toll-road operator in China reported
lower profit.  The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.5 percent to 22,797.53 as of
10:11 a.m. in Hong Kong. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
dropped 0.5 percent to 11,365. The gauge of mainland companies
yesterday erased gains for the year after Chinese Premier  Wen
Jiabao  called on local authorities to “decisively” curb real
estate speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
