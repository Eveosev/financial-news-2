Taiwan’s government bonds fell, with
10-year yields rising the most since Feb. 4, as speculation the
government will relax restrictions on real estate purchases by
insurers cooled demand for the securities.  The island sold NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion) of 30-year
notes at 1.795 percent today, compared to the 1.75 percent
median estimate of seven fixed-income traders surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Financial Supervisory Commission will lift a ban
on insurance companies buying real estate, the Economic Daily
News reported yesterday, citing minister Chen Yuh-chang.  “Insurers are turning cold on bonds as they might get to
buy real estate again,” said Sam Chang, a fixed-income trader
at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “They became less
aggressive in bidding and got more picky on yields.”  The  yield  on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.222 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It increased one basis
point from Feb. 6.  Taiwan’s stock and debt markets were closed from Feb. 7
through Feb. 15 for the Lunar New Year holiday and will be open
tomorrow to partly compensate for the loss of working days.  Currency Strengthens  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.658 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to prices from Taipei Forex Inc.
It rose 0.3 percent in the past five days. Its one-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, fell 10 basis points today, and four
basis points from the end of last week, to 4.95 percent.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
