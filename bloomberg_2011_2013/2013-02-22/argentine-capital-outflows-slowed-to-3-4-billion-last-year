Argentine capital outflows fell 84.2
percent last year to the lowest since 2006 after President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  tightened currency controls.  The central bank said outflows totaled $3.4 billion in 2012
after $21.5 billion left the country in 2011. The economy
received an inflow of $163 million in the fourth quarter, the
second consecutive quarterly inflow, the bank said yesterday in
an e-mailed report.  “Capital outflows slowed because it’s now forbidden by the
measures imposed,” Marina Dal Poggetto, an economist at Buenos
Aires-based economic research firm Estudio Bein & Asociados,
said in a phone interview. “The slowdown is not a result of a
higher confidence in the local currency.”  Fernandez, 60, has restricted access to foreign currency
and banned purchases of dollars for savings since being re-
elected in October 2011 in a bid to stem capital flight fueled
by a weakening peso. In that period, dollar deposits in
Argentine commercial banks, which are counted as international
reserves, fell 50 percent to $7.6 billion. That has weighed on
central bank funds that the government taps to pay debt,
contributing to a 7 percent drop last year to $42 billion.  Falling Reserves  The government plans to tap $8 billion from reserves this
year for debt payments, according to the budget law.  Argentina ’s
Treasury has used more than $30 billion of reserves since 2010
to pay foreign debt, central bank President Mercedes Marco del Pont told state-run news agency Telam this month. Argentina has
been locked out of international capital markets since its $95
billion default in 2001.  Foreign direct investment was $5.4 billion in the first
half of 2012, compared with $43.2 billion in Brazil, $12.3
billion in  Chile  and $9.6 billion in  Mexico , according to the
United Nations.  South America’s second-largest economy posted a trade
surplus of $12.7 billion last year, a 27 percent increase from
2011.  While the government’s import restrictions and capital
controls have managed to slow outflows and maintain a positive
trade balance, inflation estimated at 26 percent has increased
demand for dollars among Argentines looking to protect savings
and adding to a growing unregulated currency market, Dal
Poggetto said.  Weakening Peso  The peso weakened 13.4 percent in the past 12 months to
5.03 pesos per dollar yesterday, the third-biggest decline among
Latin American currencies after  Brazil  and  Venezuela , which
devalued the bolivar 32 percent on Feb. 8.  In an unregulated market, where investors buy peso-
denominated securities locally and sell them abroad for dollars,
the peso has weakened 39 percent to 7.7953 per dollar in that
period.  “The exchange controls show positive results but the
situation in the exchange rate remains tense,” said Santiago
Massia, economist at Buenos Aires-based Ecolatina research
company. “You can’t control the amount of dollar sales and the
price at the same time, the consequence of that is a weaker
unofficial peso.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
