BP Plc (BP/) , which employs about 40
striking tanker drivers that make deliveries from  Scotland ’s
only oil refinery, said fuel inventories among its clients are
at “good” levels.  BP has been working this week to minimize disruption from
the three days of industrial action, said Mark Salt, a spokesman
in London. The 210,000 barrel-a-day Grangemouth refinery is
operating normally, David East, a spokesman for Ineos Group AG,
which owns the facility through its Petroineos venture with
PetroChina Co., said today by phone.  BP’s drivers went on strike today in a dispute over
pensions and pay, according to Unite, the U.K.’s largest labor
union. The company accounts for about 22 percent of all fuel
deliveries from the refinery, Salt said today by phone. BP is
one of seven tanker operators from the plant, he said.  The Ineos refinery is located west of Edinburgh. The city’s
airport, which receives all its fuel from Grangemouth, expects
to operate normally this weekend, an official at Edinburgh
Airport Ltd. said today by phone, asking not to identified
because of company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
