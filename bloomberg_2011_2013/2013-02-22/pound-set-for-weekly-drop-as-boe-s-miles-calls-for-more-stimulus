The pound fell for a second week
versus the dollar after  Bank of England  policy maker  David Miles 
said the central bank should increase stimulus and look at new
measures to boost Britain’s economy.  Sterling gained for a second day against the euro in a week
after the  European Central Bank  said financial institutions will
repay less of its second round of three-year loans next week
than economists estimated, indicating European banks are wary of
lending to each other. U.K. government bonds were little
changed, after 10-year yields dropped the most since September
yesterday.  “Miles has always been one of the most dovish members of
the Monetary Policy Committee, so in some ways what he was
saying wasn’t new,” said  Paul Robson , a senior currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London .
“However, the underlying theme remains negative for sterling.
We still have a target of $1.5050.”  The pound was little changed at $1.5260 as of 4:53 p.m.
London time after sliding to $1.5132 yesterday, the lowest since
July 2010. It lost 1.7 percent this week after dropping 1.8
percent in the five days through Feb. 15. Sterling added 0.2
percent to 86.31 pence per euro after depreciating to 87.65
pence on Feb. 20, the weakest since October 2011.  “A good case can be made for more expansion,” Miles said
in a speech yesterday in Bath,  England , adding that asset
purchases are not the only possible stimulus. “If there are
monetary-policy tools that are more reliably effective in
boosting demand, they should be used.”  BOE Minutes  Bank of England minutes released Feb. 20 showed Miles,
along with Governor  Mervyn King  and  Paul Fisher , voted to
increase the central bank’s asset-purchase  target , a policy
known as quantitative easing, by 25 billion pounds to 400
billion pounds at the Feb. 7 meeting.  While Miles had been alone in calling for more stimulus in
January, the three were outvoted by the remaining six members of
the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes showed.  The pound gained versus the euro as the ECB said 356 banks
will hand back 61.1 billion euros ($80.4 billion) on Feb. 27,
the first opportunity for early repayment of the second Longer-
Term Refinancing Operation. The median forecast of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey was for 122.5 billion euros.  The pound has depreciated 4.9 percent this year, the
second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 2.1 percent and the euro rose 1.8 percent.  German Confidence  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
 index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4
from 104.3 in January. That’s the fourth consecutive gain and
the highest since April.  The 10-year gilt yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.11 percent after earlier adding as much
as four basis points. The rate has dropped eight basis points
this week, the  biggest decline  since the five-day period ending
Nov. 9. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 fell 0.08, or
80 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.90.  “The gilt market doesn’t know which way to bend in the
wind at the moment,” said  Marc Ostwald , a rates strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “There’s a lot of
volatility but we are just rewinding what happened yesterday.”  U.K. government bonds lost 2.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds dropped 1.2 percent and Treasuries fell 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
