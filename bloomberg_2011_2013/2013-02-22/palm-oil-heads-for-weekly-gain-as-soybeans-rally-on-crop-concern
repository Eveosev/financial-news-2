Palm oil advanced, poised for a
weekly gain, on speculation that demand for the world’s most
used cooking oil may increase after soybeans, crushed to make a
competing product, rallied to a two-week high.  The contract for delivery in May advanced as much as 0.8
percent to 2,555 ringgit ($824) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session at 2,551
ringgit. Futures are set to gain 2.7 percent this week.  Argentina ’s 2012-2013 soybean crop output forecast will be
trimmed to about 49 million tons, or 48 million, from a December
forecast of 53 million by the Rosario Grains Exchange as this
week’s rain didn’t offset damage from the previous month’s
drought, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
situation yesterday. Soybeans in  Chicago  today rallied for a
fifth day to the highest level since Feb. 8.  “The market is focusing on Argentina although it is aware
that it’s going to be a big crop.” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan,
a director at Mumbai-based Commtrendz Risk Management Services
Pvt. “This will be a short-lived rally.”  Soybeans for May delivery climbed as much as 1.2 percent to
$14.88 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
May delivery advanced 0.6 percent to 51.98 cents a pound. The
cooking oil’s  premium  to palm oil was at $322.52 a ton today.
The two are the most consumed edible oils in the world.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September rose 0.5 percent
to 7,078  yuan  ($1,134) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month increased 1.3percent
to 8,738 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
