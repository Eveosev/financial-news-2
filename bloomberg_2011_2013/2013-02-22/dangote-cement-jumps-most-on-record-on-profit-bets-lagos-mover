Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM)  jumped the most
on record as investors speculated  Nigeria ’s biggest company by
market value will increase full-year profit.  The  stock  rose 8.9 percent to 160 naira by 2 p.m. in Lagos,
its biggest advance since at least Oct. 26, 2010. The company is
scheduled to release financial results next month.  “Investors are beginning to take position as they
anticipate wonderful performance in full year, in line with
trend in the third quarter,” Kola Yaqub, a Lagos-based analyst
at Meristem Securities Ltd., said by phone today. “The stock is
trading at fair value and we’ll issue a price target after the
result is released.”  Dangote’s net income for the first nine months of 2012
increased 15 percent to 106.5 billion naira, according to the
company. Revenue advanced to 208.3 billion naira from 173.8
billion naira.  The company said Feb. 1 it reopened its Gboko plant located
in central Nigeria on increasing demand. Dangote had closed the
plant last month because of cheaper imported cement being sold
in the region.  Dangote,  Africa ’s biggest producer of cement and owned by
billionaire Chairman  Aliko Dangote , forecast in August it will
more than double total output to 51 million metric tons by 2015
as it expands production.  The stock has advanced 24.9 percent this year, compared
with the 20 percent rise of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
