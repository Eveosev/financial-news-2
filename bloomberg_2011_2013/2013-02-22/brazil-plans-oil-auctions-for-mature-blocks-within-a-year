The Brazilian government is planning
a special bidding round for mature oil blocks within a year to
help small companies and boost output, the Energy Ministry said.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is still studying
when to start the auction to avoid conflict with a bidding round
for shale gas, to happen in December, the ministry said in an e-
mail.  “We are selecting the areas that would be of interest to
that segment of companies,” the ministry said. “This can help
keep up production in mature blocks and help in regional
development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
