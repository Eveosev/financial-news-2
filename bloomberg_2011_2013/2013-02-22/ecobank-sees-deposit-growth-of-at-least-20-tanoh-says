Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETIT) ’s
deposits will increase by at least 20 percent this year as
 Africa ’s growing economy attracts more customers, Chief
Executive Officer Thierry Tanoh said.  Revenue is expected to climb 15 percent this year and at
the same rate in 2014 and 2015, he told reporters in Abidjan,
Ivory Coast’s commercial capital, today.  “No sector in Africa, maybe except the mobile-phone
sector, has reached a plateau so far, especially not the banking
sector,” he said. “The growth of GDP, the low banking rate and
the need to increase the trade between African countries mean
huge potential growth.”  Sub-Saharan Africa’s economy is forecast to expand 5.8
percent this year, outpacing a global rate of 3.5 percent,
according to the International Monetary Fund. The growth is
enough to keep Ecobank “focusing on Africa,” Tanoh said.  “We don’t plan to open units in northern Africa or in
South Africa, or outside Africa,” he said.  Ecobank’s shares rose less than 0.1 percent to 13.81 naira
by 2:25 p.m. in Lagos. The  stock  was unchanged at 16 pesewas in
the Ghanaian capital, Accra, and was  flat  at 42 CFA francs on
the West African bourse in Abidjan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
