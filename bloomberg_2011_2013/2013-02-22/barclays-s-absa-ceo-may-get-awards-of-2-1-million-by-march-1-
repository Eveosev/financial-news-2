Maria Ramos , the chief executive
officer of Barclays Plc-controlled  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  who gave up
her cash bonus for 2012, may be entitled to about 19 million
rand ($2.1 million) of other payouts by the end of March.  Deferred share incentive awards announced over the past
three years may total about 11 million rand when they vest at
the end of this month and dividends are accrued, according to
Bloomberg calculations using Johannesburg-based Absa’s average
February  stock price  of 166 rand. Ramos may also be paid 8
million rand of cash and shares in March as part of a 2010
program to retain senior managers.  The performance conditions for the deferred incentives have
been met, a spokesman for  Absa  who asked not to be named in line
with company policy said in an e-mailed response to questions on
Feb. 19. The retention awards are subject to approval by the
bank’s compensation committee, which is due to meet on March 14,
the spokesman said.  Ramos, 53, announced she was forsaking her cash bonus after
she described Absa’s 2012 earnings as “disappointing” on Feb.
12. While the bank missed its own targets as home loans soured
and full-year  profit  declined 13 percent to 8.39 billion rand,
part of Ramos’s remit as CEO is to implement the longer-term
strategy of integrating retail and business banking and
combining the bank’s African operations with those of Barclays.  Longer Haul  “There has been a massive shift with boards looking at
longer-term, more sustainable returns,” said John Brodie,
managing director of  Mindcor Group , a Johannesburg-based
executive recruitment and consulting company. “Financial-
services firms have gotten into trouble in the past when they
have rewarded short-term growth.”  Ramos was paid 20.7 million rand for 2011, including
deferred awards of 14 million rand.  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) ’s
Jacko Maree, CEO of  Africa ’s largest bank, received total pay of
27.2 million rand for that period, while  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  CEO
Sizwe Nxasana was paid 22.5 million rand for the 12 months
through June.  Ramos, who joined Absa in 2009, last got a cash bonus in
2010, when she was paid 2.28 million rand as part of her 19.6
million-rand compensation.  Ramos won’t be taking any annual performance incentive
either in cash or a deferred award in 2013 as a consequence of
the 2012 financial results, the Absa spokesman said. Her total
compensation for 2012, including salary, bonus and long-term
incentive, will show a “substantial decline” on  2011 , he said.  Lag Indicator  Investors want to see pay match performance, Adrian Cloete,
an Absa shareholder and equity analyst at Cadiz Asset
Management, said in a phone interview. “That’s a core
principle,” he said.  Absa closed 0.1 percent higher at 162.15 rand in
Johannesburg, giving the stock a gain of 8 percent over the past
12 months.  Standard Bank  has advanced 8.2 percent over that
period, while FirstRand climbed 34 percent, making it the best
performer among  South Africa ’s big four banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
