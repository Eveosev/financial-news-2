German 10-year bunds stayed lower
after the Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives in  Europe ’s largest economy, jumped
to a 10-month high in February.  The 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.59 percent at 9:05 a.m. London time. Two-year notes
were little changed, with the yield at 0.18 percent.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index climbed to 107.4, the most since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
