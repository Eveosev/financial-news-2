The zloty advanced after German
business confidence rose to a 10-month high and Fitch Ratings
revised its outlook on Poland’s A- credit rating to positive.  Fitch’s revision from a stable outlook reflects a narrowing
of the country’s budget deficit and a stabilization of public
debt, the company said in a statement yesterday. German business
confidence advanced more than forecast in February, adding to
signs that Europe’s largest economy and Poland’s biggest trade
partner, is gathering strength.  “We see scope to increase Poland’s rating sometime in the
next two years,” analysts at  ING Bank Slaski SA (ING)  in Warsaw, led
by Rafal Benecki, said in a research note today. “More
stability in the euro region and further fiscal consolidation
are key” for Poland to receive the upgrade, ING wrote.  The Polish currency gained less than 0.1 percent to 4.1602
against the euro, at 4:42 p.m. in Warsaw. The yield on the
government’s benchmark 10-year zloty bond was unchanged at 3.99
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fitch’s announcement won’t be a “game changer” for Polish
debt, Ernest Pytlarczyk, chief economist at BRE Bank SA in
Warsaw, said in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
