Tunisia’s Islamist Ennahda party
nominated Interior Minister Ali Larayedh to take over as prime
minister after Hamadi Jbeli resigned, Al Arabiya television said
without saying where it got the information.  Jbeli, Ennadha’s secretary-general, resigned on Feb. 19,
after failing to form a technocratic government to ease tensions
heightened by the assassination of opposition leader Chukri
Beleid on Feb. 6. He turned down the party’s request to stay as
premier. Ennahda has the largest bloc of seats in parliament.  In a televised address late yesterday, Jbeli apologized for
“disappointing” the people in solving the current political
crisis. He urged Tunisians to unite, be patient and stop
protests “until the revolution wins.”  The impasse has underscored the continued threats to
stability in Tunisia two years after the uprising that ousted
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
