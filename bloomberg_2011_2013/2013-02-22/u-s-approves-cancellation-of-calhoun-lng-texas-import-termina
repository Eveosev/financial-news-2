The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission approved Calhoun LNG’s decision not to proceed with
an import terminal in  Texas .  Calhoun LNG filed a request on Dec. 14 to vacate FERC’s
authorization to construct and operate a 1 billion cubic feet-a-
day receiving terminal for liquefied natural gas at Port Lavaca,
the regulator said yesterday on its  website .  Calhoun LNG officials didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking
comment sent outside office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
