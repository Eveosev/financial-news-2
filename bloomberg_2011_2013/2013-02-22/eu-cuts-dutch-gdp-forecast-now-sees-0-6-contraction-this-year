The European Commission cut its
forecast for the Dutch economy and now projects a second year of
contraction as domestic demand remains depressed.  The commission, the European Union executive in Brussels,
today forecast that gross domestic product in the Netherlands,
the fifth-largest economy in the euro area, will decline 0.6
percent in 2013. That compares with a November forecast for
growth of 0.3 percent.  Consumer spending  and corporate investment should start to
revive in the second half of the year, the commission said in
its latest economic forecasts. Economic growth is seen at 1.1
percent in 2014, while the  budget deficit  is forecast to narrow
to 3.6 percent of GDP this year from 4.1 percent in 2012,
according to the report, exceeding the EU ceiling of 3 percent
of GDP.  “This is largely related to the nationalization of bank-
insurer SNS Reaal,” EU Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told a press conference today in
Brussels. “As to the structural fiscal effort so far, it
appears the Netherlands has taken effective action.”  Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  has pledged to implement an
austerity package worth about 16 billion euros ($21 billion) in
the next four years to bring the deficit to below the EU
ceiling.  The Dutch Central Planning CPB predicted on Dec. 19 that
the deficit will be 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013 and that the
economy will shrink 0.5 percent this year. On Feb. 28, CPB will
disclose its forecasts for the budget deficit for 2013. Dutch
 consumer confidence  dropped in February to the lowest level
since records began in 1986, the national statistics bureau said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
