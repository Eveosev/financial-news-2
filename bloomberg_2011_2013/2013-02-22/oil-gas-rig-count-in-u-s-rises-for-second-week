(Corrects direction in headline.)  The oil and gas rig count in the
U.S. fell by one this week to 1,761, according to data from
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   The  gas count  increased by seven to 428, data posted on
Baker Hughes Inc.’s website show.  Oil rigs  declined by eight to
1,329, the field-services company based in Houston said.  The total energy count has dropped for 10 out of the last
13 weeks as producers become more familiar with unconventional
plays and are able to complete more wells with fewer rigs. More
efficient drilling technologies have helped drive U.S. crude
production to the highest level in more than 20 years, weakening
the country’s dependence on foreign oil.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions will receive two trains of
oil a day at its  refinery  in  Pennsylvania  by the third quarter
of this year, Philip Rinaldi, the company’s chief executive
officer, said during an energy forum in  New York  yesterday. The
company is set to become the world’s single largest consumer of
Bakken crude by the end of the year, he said.  U.S. oil output  climbed  54,000 barrels a day to 7.12
million in the week ended Feb. 15, the highest level since July
1992, the Energy Information Administration, a division of the
Energy Department, said yesterday. Stockpiles rose 1.1 percent
to 376.4 million barrels last week and reached a 22-year high of
387.3 million in June.  Gas stockpiles  fell 127 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Feb. 15 to 2.4 trillion, according to data compiled by the
EIA. They reached a record high of 3.929 trillion cubic feet on
Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
