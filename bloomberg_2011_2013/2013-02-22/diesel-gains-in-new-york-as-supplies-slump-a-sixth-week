Diesel fuel strengthened in the New
York Harbor after an inventory report showed U.S. East Coast
distillate supplies  slumped  for a sixth week, the longest losing
streak since November 2011.  Stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil and diesel
fuel, dropped  1.31 million  barrels to 36.2 million in the week
ended Feb. 15, an Energy Information Administration report
showed. East Coast refineries operated at 72 percent of capacity
during that period, compared with 76 percent a week earlier,
according to EIA data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the  lowest 
since Nov. 23.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel in the New York Harbor region
gained 0.25 cent to trade 10 cents a gallon above heating oil
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:21 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread in New York
was 3.25 cents above diesel on the Gulf Coast. Reformulated, 84-
octane gasoline, or RBOB, was unchanged in New York at 2.25
cents a gallon below futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a measure of refining
profitability based on Brent oil in Europe, gained 83 cents to
$15.43 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
