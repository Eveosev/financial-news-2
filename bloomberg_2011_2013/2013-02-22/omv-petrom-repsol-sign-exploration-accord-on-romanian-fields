Repsol SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
producer and  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s biggest oil company, will
sign an accord today to jointly explore four onshore oil and gas
fields in Romania.  The two companies plan to invest about 50 million euros
($66 million) in the next two years for exploration drilling in
the deep onshore blocks located in the southern Romania, Petrom
said in an e-mailed statement. Repsol will hold a 49 percent
working interest in the fields, according to the statement.  Petrom has been searching for partners to help it boost
output in mature fields in Romania as it seeks to stabilize
declining oil and gas production. The Bucharest-based company
has a joint venture with  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM)  to search for
resources in the Black Sea, where it announced last year a
potentially significant discovery in the Neptun block.  “This partnership with Repsol is an important step for
evaluating the hydrocarbons potential in the four blocks,”
Johann Pleininger, a member of Petrom’s executive board
responsible with exploration and production, said in the
statement. “One of our major objectives is to unlock the deep
onshore exploration potential in Romania.”  Petrom and Repsol will search for resources in areas deeper
than 2,500 meters in the Baicoi V, Targoviste VI, Pitesti XII
and Targu Jiu XIII blocks, according to the statement.  OMV AG (OMV) , Petrom’s majority owner, has already signed
exploration and production partnerships with Repsol in Bulgaria
and  Libya , Petrom said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
