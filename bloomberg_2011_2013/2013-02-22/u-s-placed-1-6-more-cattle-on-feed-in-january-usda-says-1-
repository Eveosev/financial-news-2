U.S. feedlots purchased or placed
1.6 percent more young cattle in January than a year earlier as
persistent dry conditions spurred ranchers to move animals off
pastures.  About 1.876 million head of cattle were taken in by
 feedlots  last month, up from 1.847 million in January 2012, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Eleven
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  forecast a 0.3 percent
increase, on average. The feedlot herd was estimated at 11.073
million as of Feb. 1, down 6.2 percent from a year earlier,
which was the decline that analysts had projected.  About 29 percent of the High Plains was in “exceptional”
 drought  as of Feb. 19, a category that the U.S. Drought Monitor
says indicates the area had widespread crop and pasture losses
and water shortages in reservoirs. A year earlier, less than 0.1
percent got that rating.  Dryness  probably will persist through
the Great Plains from  Nebraska  to Texas, according to a seasonal
outlook released yesterday by the U.S. Climate Prediction Center
in  College Park , Maryland.  “It’s been pretty dry in the  Kansas , Oklahoma, Texas
area,”  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the  University of
Missouri  in Columbia, said in a telephone interview before the
report. In some areas, cattle aren’t able to graze on winter-
wheat fields, so they’re being sold, he said. “The cattle gotta
go someplace else.”  Feedlot Sales  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old animals that weigh
500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The
cattle are fattened on corn for about four to five months until
they weigh about 1,300 pounds, when they are sold to
meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.917 million animals to meatpackers
last month, up 5.6 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 4.6 percent increase, on average. January 2013
had one more weekday than the previous year.  Fattened-cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.3 percent
to settle at $1.28225 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price is down 3.1 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement gained 0.4
percent to $1.4125 a pound, and the commodity has declined 8.4
percent in 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
