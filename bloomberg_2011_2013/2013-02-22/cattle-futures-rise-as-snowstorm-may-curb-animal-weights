Cattle rose for the first time this
week on speculation that a winter storm sweeping across the U.S.
may reduce animal weights, while beef exports jumped. Hogs fell,
capping the longest decline since October 2008.  A weather system may drop more than 12 inches (30
centimeters) of snow in parts of the Great Plains, according to
the  National Weather Service .  Steers  averaged 1,385 pounds (628
kilograms) in the first four days of this week, down 0.3 percent
from a week earlier, government data show. Beef-export sales
tripled in the week ended Feb. 14.  “Storms like this can certainly take weight off of
cattle,”  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial Services,
said in a telephone interview. “That’s been one of the bearish
factors, the heavyweight cattle,” while exports were
“outstanding,” he said.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.3 percent to
settle at $1.28225 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price fell 1.7 percent this week, the biggest loss
since Jan. 18.  In colder weather, cattle use more energy to stay warm,
leading to lower weights. Beef-export sales rose to 22,161
metric tons (48.8 million pounds) from 7,302 tons in the week
ended Feb. 7, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement advanced 0.4
percent to $1.4125 a pound.  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.9 percent to close
at 81.65 cents a pound. That marks the eighth straight drop, the
longest slump since Oct. 6, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
