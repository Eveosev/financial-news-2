Seaport Group , the New York-based
credit-market brokerage, hired David L. Troyer from Lazard
Capital Markets LLC as a managing director to handle high-yield
debt research tied to chemicals and industrial companies.  Troyer, 46, was ranked No. 1 by Institutional Investor
Magazine for 11 consecutive years, according to a statement
today from Seaport. He had worked at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  for
about eight years prior to his stint at Lazard Capital, industry
records show.  Seaport, founded in 2001 as a distressed-debt broker, has
about 200 employees who trade bonds, private placements and
structured products, according to its  website . Analysts such as
Troyer write reports on companies that the brokerage sends to
its investor clients.  Michael Meagher and Stephen Smith started the firm,
according to its website. Its co-head of sales and trading, Drew Doscher, resigned last month after a dispute, a person with
knowledge of the matter said at the time.  Sea Port Group Securities LLC, the companyâ€™s brokerage
unit, earned $2.6 million from $80.1 million of revenue in 2011,
the latest data available, according to a regulatory  filing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
