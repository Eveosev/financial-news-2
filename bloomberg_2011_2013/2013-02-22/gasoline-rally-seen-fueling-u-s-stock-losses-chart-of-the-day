Gasoline prices have risen high
enough to hurt stocks if history is any guide, according to
Barry Knapp, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays Plc’s
securities unit.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the relationship between the
average retail price of unleaded gas and the ratio of price to
estimated earnings for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Knapp
included a similar chart in a note to clients yesterday.  Gas prices  rose every day from Jan. 17 through Feb. 20,
according to data from the American Automobile Association. The
five-week rally lifted the average pump price nationwide by
about 15 percent to $3.778 a gallon, the highest since October.  Stocks fell after unleaded gas peaked in May 2011 and in
April and September of last year, as the chart shows. The first
two declines coincided with slower growth in  consumer spending ,
according to quarterly data from the Commerce Department.  The latest gas-price increase has helped to put stocks “in
a precarious position,” Knapp wrote. Consumers’ cash flow and
sentiment are poised to worsen, the New York-based strategist
wrote, and their expenditures may soon follow.  Any slowing of economic growth that stems from higher gas
prices may prevent companies from meeting earnings projections,
the report said. Sustained expansion, on the other hand, would
increase the risk of inflation and put pressure on the  Federal
Reserve  to scale back bond purchases that have helped bolster
stocks, Knapp wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
