Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , the
fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, rose the most in more than
three years as higher prices helped boost video revenue.  TV-service sales advanced 2.8 percent to $927 million,
topping ISI Group’s estimate of $894 million. Charter lost
36,000 residential video customers in the quarter, an
improvement from 44,000 a year ago.  Charter is reviving attempts to encourage customers to add
Internet and phone service to their TV plans for a so-called
triple-play package,  Vijay Jayant , an analyst at ISI Group in
New York, said in a note to clients.  “The company is in the midst of a transition with new
pricing and packaging that promotes triple-play offerings, which
have started to get a penetration lift,” Jayant said.  Charter rose $7.99, or 10 percent, to $85.02 at the close
in New York, its largest one-day gain since emerging from
bankruptcy in 2009. The shares have gained 12 percent this year,
compared with a 6.3 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Charter connected 36 percent of new video subscribers to a
triple-play package in the quarter, a “significant
improvement,” Chief Executive Officer  Tom Rutledge  said on a
conference call. That rate rose to 50 percent “in the past few
weeks,” he said.  Rutledge’s Changes  Rutledge has retooled management and moved corporate
headquarters from  St. Louis  to  Stamford , Connecticut, since
replacing Mike Lovett last year. He agreed to buy  Cablevision
Systems Corp. (CVC) ’s Optimum West unit for $1.63 billion earlier this
month, a sign he’s committed to increasing Charter’s competitive
position throughout the U.S.  “After a year at Charter, we’re where I expected us to be
at this stage,” Rutledge said. “Our organizational proficiency
continues to improve.”  Charter’s fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $40 million,
or 41 cents a share, from $67 million, or 63 cents, a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. Sales rose 4.3
percent to $1.91 billion, in line with the average analyst
estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company added 54,000 residential broadband subscribers.
Average revenue per customer was $105.78.  To contact the reporter on this story:
