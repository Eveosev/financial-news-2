The euro extended gains versus the
dollar and the yen after an index of German business confidence
improved more this month than economists forecast.  The euro strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.3233 at 9:07 a.m.
London time. The common currency rose 0.7 percent to 123.62 yen.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4
from 104.3 in January. Economists predicted an increase to
104.9, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
