South Korean household income grew
at the slowest pace in six quarters, tracking a decline in
economic expansion as the won strengthened.  Average household monthly income increased 5.4 percent
to 4 million won ($3,682) in the three months ending December
from a year earlier, Statistics Korea said in a report today. It
was the slowest expansion since the second quarter of 2011, when
the figure was 4.7 percent.  Household monthly spending excluding tax and social
security-related payments increased 1.4 percent to 2.4 million
won in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  South Koreaâ€™s economy grew 1.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, the slowest expansion in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
