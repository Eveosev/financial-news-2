SKF AB (SKFB) , the world’s largest maker of
bearings, had its credit rating outlook revised to negative from
stable by Standard & Poor’s, reflecting concern about SKF’s
credit protection improvements.  There is a one-in-three chance that SKF’s credit ratios
won’t improve to levels seen corresponding with the current A-
rating, S&P said today in a statement. The negative outlook
means Gothenburg, Sweden-based SKF could potentially be
downgraded within the next 12 months.  The rating would be lowered if SKF’s operating performance
remained weak or deteriorated, which could happen if European
economic conditions remain relatively depressed or deteriorate,
or if the company made a large debt-funded purchase during a
negative period of the business cycle, S&P said. The outlook
could be revised to stable if SKF’s performance over the next
few quarters is in line with or exceeds S&P’s base-case
assumptions.  “Under current economic conditions, we think improvements
to the group’s credit protection measures will take longer than
we previously expected,” S&P analysts Eve Seiltgens and Michael Andersson said in the statement.  S&P’s base-case scenario, which assumes unchanged revenue
in 2013 after a 2.5 percent decline in 2012, is that SFK will be
able to maintain the current rating, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
