Spain must keep up the pace of
banking reform as risks to the industry and the wider economy
“remain high,” according to the European Commission.  Reforms must be speedily implemented “to enhance the
viability of the Spanish banking sector,” the commission said
in a report on Spain’s compliance with terms of its banking
bailout, which was sent by  Germany ’s Finance Ministry to
lawmakers and obtained by Bloomberg News.  Banks should generate additional capital by adopting
prudent dividend policies, according to the report, which said
there was no reason to think Spain would need more bank bailout
funds for now.  Spain requested a European bailout for its banks last year
as concern mounted that losses at former savings banks including
the  Bankia (BKIA)  group would contaminate government finances. Under
the program, Spain took 41 billion euros ($54 billion) to
recapitalize lenders and help fund a “bad bank” to absorb the
soured property assets of nationalized firms.  The government has complied or is close to complying with
the main terms of the bailout, and has overhauled the governance
of savings banks and reviewed supervisory procedures at the Bank
of Spain, the report said. Coming up with a “sound business
plan” for the bad bank, known as Sareb, is crucial to its
success, the report said.  While the task is continuing, Spanish authorities “have
made very tangible progress towards major and lasting reforms,”
it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
