Severn River Capital Management LLC,
the Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund founded by Scott Roth, is winding down after a “challenging” investing
environment, according to a statement.  “Fundamental equity, market-neutral long/short investing
has been challenging over the past few years and we have decided
to wind down our operations,” Roth said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement. “I would like to thank my present and past
employees and investors for their faith in me and my team over
the past seven years.”  The statement didn’t indicate how much in assets Severn
River Capital has or when investors will receive their money.
The firm currently employs 10 people, Roth said in the
statement.  Roth, who said he has been in the business since 1994 when
he graduated from  Harvard Business School  and joined Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., opened Severn River Capital Fund Ltd. and
Severn River Capital Partners LP in July 2004. In 2006, those
funds shut down after declining 8 percent since inception,
 Bloomberg News  reported at the time.  An estimated 635 hedge funds globally were liquidated in
the first three quarters of 2012, 8.5 percent more than a year
earlier, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
