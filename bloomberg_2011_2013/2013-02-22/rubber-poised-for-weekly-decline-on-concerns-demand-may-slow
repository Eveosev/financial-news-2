Rubber was set for a second weekly
drop on concern that demand may slow as  China , the world’s
biggest user, called for property curbs and as European data
signaled the region’s recession is worsening.  The contract for July delivery lost as much as 1.2 percent
to 294 yen a kilogram ($3,157 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, and was little changed at 297.7 yen at 1
p.m. local time. Futures have retreated 7.4 percent this week,
the most since the week ended May 11.  Asian stocks plunged yesterday amid concern the  Federal
Reserve  may scale back stimulus and as China’s government told
local authorities to curb real estate speculation. Italy’s
parliamentary election starts this weekend after data yesterday
showed the euro-area’s economy contracted more than forecast.  “Funds continue selling rubber on concerns about the slow
economic recovery and weak demand,” Gu Jiong, an analyst at
commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said by phone from Tokyo.  Thailand , the largest exporter, will review a program to
support prices by purchasing from farmers at the end of March,
Deputy Farm Minister Yuttapong Charasathien said Feb. 19. That
may signal an increase in supplies.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 0.4 percent to 25,185  yuan  ($4,034) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 3.2 percent to 91.70 baht ($3.07) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
