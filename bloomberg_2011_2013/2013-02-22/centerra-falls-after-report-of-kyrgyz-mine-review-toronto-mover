Centerra Gold Inc. (CG) , the Canadian
operator of the Kumtor mine in Kyrgyzstan, fell the most in
seven months after saying the government wants to review its
agreement to run the project and that it received a $315 million
claim for alleged environmental damage.  Centerra tumbled 10 percent to C$6.84 at 10:51 a.m. in
Toronto.  The shares  earlier dropped 13 percent, the most
intraday since June 28.  The Toronto-based company said yesterday in a statement it
is trying to get more information about media reports that the
Kyrgyz parliament adopted a decree to begin talks on changes to
project agreements related to Kumtor.  Centerra also said it received the environmental claim from
the Kyrgyz State Agency for Environmental Protection and
Forestry.  Centerra is “studying the claim but believes that the
allegations contained in the claim are exaggerated or without
merit,” the company said in the statement released after the
close of regular trading in Toronto. “Centerra’s Kumtor project
complies with Kyrgyz Republic laws on environmental, safety and
health standards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
