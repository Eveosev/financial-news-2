Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Greece ’s biggest gambling
company, fell the most in four weeks after giving a net income
target for this year that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The stock fell 4.9 percent to 6.75 euros, the  most  since
Jan. 24, taking its weekly loss to 12 percent. The shares have
advanced 25 percent this year, giving the Athens-based company a
market value of 2.15 billion euros ($2.83 billion).  Net income will drop to 116 million euros in 2013 from an
estimated 496 million euros last year, according to a
presentation by Opap management to investors posted on the
company’s website today. That compares with a 151 million-euro
average  estimate  for adjusted net income of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Opap is scheduled to report full-year 2012
results on March 7.  The profit decline is “mainly due to the recently imposed
30 percent taxation on the group’s gaming revenues,” Euroxx
Securities analyst Yiannis Sinapis said by phone today. The
stock dropped because the new management target is 23 percent
below consensus, he said.  The sale of a 33 percent Opap stake held by the Greek state
is one of the key state asset sales planned for this year, one
of the commitments made by the government to the European Union
and  International Monetary Fund  in return for emergency loans.
Greece’s state asset sales fund said Dec. 12 it approved terms
for a second and final phase of the tender.  The company forecast net income will climb by a compound
average rate of 19 percent a year through 2022 to reach 568
million euros, according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
