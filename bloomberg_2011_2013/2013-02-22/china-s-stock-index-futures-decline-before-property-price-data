China’s stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its steepest weekly loss in 20 months, as
higher  home prices  boosted concern the government will adopt
tighter policies to prevent asset bubbles.  SAIC Motor Corp., the biggest automaker, dropped 3.2
percent, adding to a five-day loss of 10 percent. China
Construction Bank Corp., the largest mortgage lender, led
declines for financial companies this week. A gauge of  Shanghai 
property developers posted its worst weekly loss since July. New
home prices rose in most cities the government tracked in
January, government data showed today.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.5 percent to 2,314.16
at the close, adding to a 4.9 percent slump this week, the most
since May 2011. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 0.5 percent to 2,596.60.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  lost 0.7 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  slipped 1.3 percent yesterday.  “The stock market will remain weak and fluctuate for a
while after a big rally last month,” said  Zhang Gang , a
strategist at Central China Securities Holdings Co. in Shanghai.
“There’s still a lot of concern about more tightening measures
in the property industry.”  The Shanghai index has fallen about 6 percent after gaining
as much as 24 percent during a bull-market rally that started on
Dec. 3. Stocks declined amid concern government policies to curb
gains in property prices may damp demand for autos, bank loans
and construction materials.  The Shanghai measure’s valuation of 9.62 times projected
12-month earnings is the lowest in a month. The index is up 2
percent for 2013.  Property Prices  Trading  volumes  in the Shanghai index were 27 percent below
the 30-day average today. Chinese stock accounts containing
funds fell by about 287,000 to 54.4 million in week to Feb. 8,
the biggest drop since the week to Oct. 15, 2010, according to
regulatory data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors opened 83,775
accounts to trade stocks, down from the previous week’s 123,161.  New home prices climbed in 53 of the 70 cities the
government tracks, compared with 54 in December, according to
data from the National Bureau of Statistics today. Prices fell
in 10 cities. Home prices rose in 53 cities from a year earlier,
compared with 40 cities in December.  Prices “are actually going up again, especially in major
cities and some second-tier cities,”  Nicole Wong , a property
analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets told Bloomberg Television
in  Hong Kong  today. “We’ll have some more tightening, but this
time around the tightening will be quite selective,” targeting
a handful of overheating cities, she said.  Automakers Drop  The Shanghai property added less than 0.1 percent today and
was down 6 percent for the week. The measure trades at 10.5
times reported profit, the lowest level in about a month. Poly
Real Estate Group Co., the biggest developer after China Vanke
Co., climbed 0.8 percent to 12.40 yuan, narrowing five-day
losses to 4.8 percent. Vanke, up 0.1 percent today, fell 5.9
percent this week.  “Although property stocks are doing OK today, it’s only
because they tumbled too much this week,” said Zhang. “There’s
still a lot of concerns about more tightening measures in the
property industry.”  China Construction Bank, the second-biggest lender, slid
1.1 percent for a five-day loss of 5.7 percent. Its  mortgage
loans  accounted for 20 percent of the total loan portfolio at
the end of June, according to earnings reports. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the second largest mortgage
lender with a ratio about 14 percent, slumped 1 percent today.  Automakers dragged down a gauge of  consumer-discretionary 
stocks in the CSI 300. The measure slid 1.2 percent, adding to a
6 percent loss for the week. FAW Car Co. lost 4.1 percent to
8.30  yuan  today. SAIC Motor fell 3.2 percent to 16.59 yuan.  Staples Gain  Consumer staples  rose the most among 10 industry gauges on
the CSI 300 with a 1.7 percent gain. Kweichow Moutai, the
biggest maker of baijou liquor, advanced 3.1 percent to 185.59
yuan. Wuliangye Yibin Co., the second-largest maker, jumped 2.6
percent to 25.77 yuan. The consumer gauge climbed 12 percent
through yesterday since Dec. 3, compared with a 24 percent gain
for the CSI 300.  “Liquor makers are seeing a technical rebound after
lagging behind in the recent market rally,” said Wang Weijun, a
strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai, by phone
today. “The fundamentals of liquor industry still remain
bearish with prices of high-end liquor falling recently.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
