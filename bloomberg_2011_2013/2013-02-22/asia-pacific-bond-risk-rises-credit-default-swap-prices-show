The cost of insuring corporate bonds
and sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 2 basis points
to 116 basis points as of 11:04 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark is on track
to increase 2.3 basis points this week and set for its biggest
weekly rise since the five-day period ended Nov. 16, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index increased 0.5 of a basis
point to 125.8 as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark is headed for its first weekly rise since
the week ended Dec. 7, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 109.5 as of 8:24
a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Credit Agricole SA prices. The
measure is set to fall 1.8 basis points this week, its third
straight weekly drop, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
