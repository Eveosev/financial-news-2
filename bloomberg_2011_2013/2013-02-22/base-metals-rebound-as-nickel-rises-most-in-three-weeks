Industrial metals advanced after the
longest losing streak since October, with nickel climbing the
most in three weeks after data showed orders to remove the metal
from warehouses increased.  Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2.3 percent, the most since Jan. 30, to
$17,012 a metric ton, and traded at $16,902 at 11:40 a.m. in
 Shanghai . The  LME Index (LMEX)  of six primary metals fell for the fifth
day yesterday, declining to the lowest level since Dec. 24.  Metals from copper to zinc and tin tumbled 4.9 percent
since Feb. 14 through yesterday.  Canceled warrants  for nickel
jumped 7.6 percent, the most since Feb. 1, to 22,578 tons
yesterday, as stockpiles rose to 154,398 tons, the highest since
April 2010, bourse data showed. In  China , new  home prices  rose
in 53 of the 70 cities the government tracks in January,
compared with 54 in December, and prices are likely to stabilize,
said the National Bureau of Statistics.  “Given the losses in the last few days, people are buying
a bit today,” Ma Jian, an analyst at Orient Futures Co., said
by phone from Shanghai. “Concerns over China’s property sector
and worries over the Fed’s pullback in stimulus will continue to
weigh on sentiment and prices.”  Minutes from the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Jan. 29-30
meeting, released on Feb. 20, showed several policy makers said
the Fed should be ready to vary the pace of the $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases.  Copper for delivery in May on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
traded little changed at 57,610  yuan  ($9,225) a ton, and the May
contract on the Comex in New York rose 0.7 percent to $3.596 per
pound. Copper, aluminum, zinc, tin and lead on the LME climbed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
