Seven cargoes of North Sea Forties
crude were shunted further into the future by a few days each,
reducing the number of February shipments by one, and increasing
Marchâ€™s tally by one, according to two people with direct
knowledge of the schedule.  The revised schedule means that 19 Forties cargoes will
load this month at the Hound Point terminal in  Scotland  and 21
in March, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , the operator of the 200,000 barrel-a-day
Buzzard field, the biggest single contributor to the Forties
blend, confirmed on Feb. 14 that it will shut the field in the
first week of March for maintenance.  The timing and quantity of Forties cargoes are closely
monitored by commodity traders because the grade is one of four
that comprise the Dated Brent benchmark, and as the cheapest,
Forties has historically been the one to set the price. The
other three grades are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  As well as the delays, or deferrals, one March cargo,
consignment F0316 was brought forward, or advanced to March
22-24 from March 24-26, the two people said today. The seven
deferrals delayed each shipment by between one day and 10 days.  The original loading program for March shipments of Forties
was released on Feb. 4.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
