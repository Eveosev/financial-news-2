Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
for a third day in Shanghai, set for the biggest weekly loss in
more than a year, on rising supplies and concern that climbing
 home prices  may prompt curbs on property development.  Rebar for October delivery dropped as much as 0.7 percent
to 4,057  yuan  ($650) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange, and was at 4,063 yuan at the 11:30 a.m. break. Futures
have declined 5 percent this week, the most such loss since
October 2011.  Inventory of steel billet in Tangshang city of northern
China, the benchmark for unfinished steel, rose to a record 1.77
million tons yesterday, according to ITG Futures Co. New home
prices gained in 53 cities in January from the previous month,
the statistics bureau said today. Premier  Wen Jiabao  this week
told cities that have had “excessively fast” price gains to
“promptly” impose home-purchase restrictions.  “The mounting inventory suggests the problem of over-
production has resurfaced and the market has ignored the weak
fundamentals,” Chen Shaoxiong, an analyst at ITG Futures, said
by phone from Xiamen. “Any talks on property curbs are sure to
hurt rebar prices because it’s crucial to usage.”  The average spot  price  for rebar was unchanged at 3,881
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery fell
1.7 percent to $156.20 a ton yesterday, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
