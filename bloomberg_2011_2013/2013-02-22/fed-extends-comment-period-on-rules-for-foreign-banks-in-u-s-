The Federal Reserve Board extended
the comment period on a proposed rule that will shape capital,
leverage, liquidity and risk-management standards for the
largest foreign banks and financial institutions that fall under
its supervision.  The Fed Board’s extension, to April 30 from a previous
March 31 deadline, focuses on sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-
Frank Act.  “The Board has received a request from the public for an
extension of the comment period,” the Fed said in a press
release today. “The Board believes that the additional period
for comment will facilitate public comment on the provisions.”  Fed officials are putting in place a new rule that will
require foreign banking organizations with significant
operations in the U.S. to set up holding companies that will be
supervised by the U.S. central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
