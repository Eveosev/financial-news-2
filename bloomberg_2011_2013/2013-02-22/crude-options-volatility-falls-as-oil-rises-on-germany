Crude oil options volatility fell
for the first time since Feb. 14 as the underlying futures rose
on higher German business confidence.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 21.82 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4:05 p.m., compared with 24.81 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery climbed 29
cents, or 0.3 percent, to $93.13 a barrel on the Nymex  as the
Munich-based Ifo Institute’s business climate  index  increased to
a 10-month high, signaling that  Europe ’s largest economy is
strengthening.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $100 calls, which slid 1 cent to 14 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,958 contracts at 4:07 p.m. in New York. April $90
puts were the second-most active, dropping 43 cents to 90 cents
a barrel with 2,128 lots exchanged.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 51
percent of electronic trading volume. In the previous session,
bearish bets made up 69 percent of the 227,843 contracts traded.  April $85 puts were the most active options yesterday, as
14,054 contracts changed hands. They rose 25 cents to 46 cents a
barrel. April $82 puts gained 14 cents to 24 cents a barrel on
12,757 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
34,763 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,551 and June
$90 puts at 32,557.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
