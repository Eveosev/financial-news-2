Frontline Ltd. (FRO) , the oil-tanker
company led by billionaire  John Fredriksen , dropped to the
lowest level in 15 months in Oslo trading and its bond yields
surged after warning it may miss bond repayments.  Shares in Frontline fell as much as 6.2 percent to 15.10
kroner, the lowest intraday level since Nov. 23, 2011, and
traded 4.4 percent lower as of 3:25 p.m. in Oslo. The yield on
Frontline’s convertible 4.5 percent 2015 bond climbed by 2.5
percentage points to 38.16 percent today from the latest trade
on Feb. 6, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  If the tanker market doesn’t recover before 2015 and “no
additional equity can be raised or assets sold, there is a risk
that Frontline will not have sufficient cash to repay the
existing $225 million convertible bond loan” due in April 2015,
the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today. That might force
a restructuring of the company, including modifications of
charter lease obligations and debt agreements, it said.  Frontline split in two in December 2011 to avoid running
out of cash. Its fleet of VLCCs need $24,200 to break even this
year, the company said.  Supertankers shipping 2 million-barrel cargoes of crude are
earning $7,518 a day, close to the lowest level on record,
according to data stretching back to 1997 from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the
world’s largest shipbroker. Still, supertanker demand will
expand 5.9 percent this year, outpacing fleet capacity growth of
5.3 percent, Clarkson said.  ‘Evaporate Fast’  Crude tankers are going through one of the “worst winters
ever” with VLCC rates close to zero, a limited number of
fixtures and very high availability of  vessels , Frontline said.  Should this continue, it is likely to lead to
“significant” financial problems for the whole tanker
industry, and “the tanker market will not experience sustained
recovery until overcapacity is removed,” the company said.  Benchmark freight swaps that traders use to bet on future
shipping prices show earnings no higher than about $15,000 a day
by 2015, according to data from Marex Spectron Group, a broker.  While Frontline’s fourth-quarter results were better than
expected, “the guidance is very weak and Frontline will see its
cash position evaporate fast in the current market,” Arctic
Securities ASA Erik Nikolai Stavseth said in an e-mailed note.
“While the company might be able to sell its $90 million stake
in Frontline 2012, it will still likely require an equity
injection at some point over the next two years.”  Funding Gap  Frontline posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $16.6
million, narrowing from a loss of $343.7 million a year earlier,
it said in a statement today. That compares with an expected
loss of $24.8 million, according to the average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We perceive the challenging market outlook to be
reflected in the share price, while the shareholding of its
spin-off, Frontline 2012, should bridge the funding gap until
the market recovers,” RS Platou Markets AS analyst Frode Moerkedal said in an e-mail. The broker upgraded its rating on
Frontline to neutral from sell, he wrote.  Shares in Frontline have slumped  49 percent  this year,
giving the company a market value of 1.25 billion kroner ($221
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
