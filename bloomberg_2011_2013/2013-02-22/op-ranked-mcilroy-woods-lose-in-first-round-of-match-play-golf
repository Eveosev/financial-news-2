Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, the
world’s top-ranked golfers, lost in the first round of the World
Golf Championships Match Play Championship.  Top-seeded McIlroy of Northern Ireland lost when Ireland’s
Shane Lowry sank a four-foot par putt on the 18th hole
yesterday. The first round was delayed a day by snow at The Golf
Club on Dove Mountain in Marana,  Arizona .  “It’s definitely a day I’m going to remember,” Lowry told
reporters after he became the third player in the last four
years to topple the No. 1 seed in the opening round.  Woods was defeated on the 17th hole by fellow American
Charles Howell III, who played a bogey-free round.  “I had nothing to lose,” Howell said. “In this format,
match play is crazy. He’s Tiger Woods. I was lucky to hang in
there.”  Carl Pettersson of  Sweden  was 1-up on American Rickie Fowler on the 18th hole when play was suspended last night
before Lowry’s next opponent could be determined. Howell also
didn’t know who he would face in the second round -- Francesco
Molinari of  Italy  and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano of Spain, who
were tied through 15 holes, will finish their first-round match
today.  England ’s Luke Donald eliminated Marcel Siem of  Germany  1-
up and Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa downed Scotland’s Richie
Ramsay 2 and 1. Donald and Oosthuizen are the remaining top
seeds.  Second-round matches will begin today after the completion
of the final two first-round matches. The third round and
quarterfinals will be played tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
