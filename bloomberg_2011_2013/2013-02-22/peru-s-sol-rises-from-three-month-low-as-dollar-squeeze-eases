Peru’s sol rose from a three-month
low after dollar inflows increased, easing a shortage of
greenbacks as local banks met  reserve requirements .  The sol appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.5842 per  U.S. dollar 
at 12:50 p.m. in Lima, the most on a closing basis since Feb.
12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency closed
yesterday at 2.5890, the weakest level since Nov. 23.  Demand for soles rose as exporters paid local taxes and
amid a rally in global stocks after German business confidence
increased to a 10-month high. Inflows alleviated a scarcity of
dollars that occurred as the central bank increased purchases of
U.S. currency and raised reserve requirements this month,
according to Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at the local unit
of  Banco Santander .  “The rebound in international markets and the dollar
flows” prompted local banks to sell some of their U.S. currency
holdings, Navarro said.  The yield on  Peru ’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond due
in August 2020 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 3.76 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price increased 0.06 centimo to 126.22 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
