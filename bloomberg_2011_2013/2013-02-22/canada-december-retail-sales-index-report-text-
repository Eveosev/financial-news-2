The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for December as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Following five consecutive monthly gains, retail sales
declined 2.1% to $38.6 billion in December. Excluding sales at
motor vehicle and parts dealers, retail sales decreased 0.9%.  In volume terms, sales declined 1.6%.  Lower sales were reported in 7 of 11 subsectors,
representing 58% of total retail trade.  Sales declines at new car dealers accounted for most of the
decrease at motor vehicle and parts dealers (-6.4%). The 7.7%
drop in sales at new car dealers more than offset the previous
six months of gains. Lower sales were also reported by
automotive parts, accessories and tire stores (-1.8%) and other
motor vehicle dealers (-1.4%).  Weaker holiday sales  Most store types typically associated with holiday shopping
registered weaker sales in December.  General merchandise store receipts declined 3.7% in
December. Store closures contributed to lower sales at
department stores (-9.6%). Sales at ‘other general merchandise
stores’ rose 1.1%.  Following a double-digit gain in November, sales at
electronics and appliance stores fell 12.1% in December. Sales
in this subsector can be affected by the timing of new product
releases.  Sporting goods, hobby, book and music store sales declined
1.8%, more than offsetting the increase in November.  Furniture and home furnishings store sales decreased 1.3%.
Declines at both furniture stores (-1.0%) and home furnishings
stores (-1.6%) did not offset the gains in November.  Sales at clothing and clothing accessories stores rose 0.4%,
a third increase in four months.  Sales down in all provinces  Retail sales were down in all provinces in December.  Ontario (-2.4%) reported the largest decrease in dollar
terms, with widespread declines across store types. This
decrease more than offset the gains of the previous two months.  Retail sales in  Quebec  (-2.5%) declined for the fourth time
in five months.  Alberta (-2.5%) registered a second consecutive sales
decrease following four months of growth.  Nova Scotia  reported the largest decrease among the
Atlantic provinces, down 1.8%.  Motor vehicles lead retail growth in 2012  On an annual basis, retailers sold $467.8 billion worth of
goods and services in 2012, up 2.5% from 2011. Sales growth in
2012 slowed compared with gains of 4.1% in 2011 and 5.6% in 2010.
Retail sales in volume terms rose 1.6% in 2012.  About half of the growth in retail sales in 2012 came from
a 5.6% advance at motor vehicle and parts dealers. According to
the New Motor Vehicle Sales Survey, most of the growth came from
sales of passenger cars.  Receipts at general merchandise stores increased 3.8% on
the strength of the ‘other general merchandise stores’ category.  Gasoline station sales rose 2.4% in 2012, mainly as a
result of higher prices.  Electronics and appliance stores posted a 5.7% decline in
2012, more than offsetting the sales increase registered in 2011.  Retail sales rose in nine provinces. The largest
contributors to the growth were Alberta and Ontario.  New
Brunswick  was the lone province to register a sales decline in
2012.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
