Serbia , which exported 2.3 million
metric tons of corn in 2011-12, may need to import more of the
grain than usual this year to ensure  food safety  as a fungus
contamination spreads from corn to milk.  Serbia’s corn exports are seen falling 83 percent year-on-
year to 400,000 tons of corn in 2012-13, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture . Its imports are seen rising
to 50,000 tons in 2012-13 from 2,000 tons in the year-earlier
period.  “The harvest left Serbia short of 250,000 tons of corn and
it can either turn to imports or wait until wheat and barley
harvest in June to mix that with corn for new fodder blends,”
Vukosav Sakovic, head of the corn producer association  Zita
Srbije , said by phone in Belgrade today.  Corn production fell by 45 percent to 3.5 million tons due
to drought and contamination by aflatoxins, Sakovic said. The
crop was contaminated by aflatoxins, which are produced by fungi
and considered carcinogenic to humans and animals, he said.
Aflatoxin tends to spread in drought-stressed corn.  The  Agriculture Ministry  ordered six dairies to withdraw 46
varieties of milk on Feb. 20 after reports that aflatoxin
concentrations exceeded the legal cap of 0.05 micrograms per
kilogram (2.2 pounds), according to the ministry’s website. They
also ordered checks yesterday of 160,000 tons of corn kept by
the Belgrade-based Commodity Reserves Agency before it
distributes 500 kilograms of “healthy corn” per cow to farmers
to stop contamination, according to the website.  Test Results  The agency test results should be known on Feb. 25 and if
the corn is good it will be distributed to farmers next week,
Goran Knezevic, the agriculture minister, said in an e-mailed
statement from the ministry today.  Health Minister Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic questioned the
toxicity levels in an interview with the state broadcaster  RTC 
earlier today. “Until two years ago we had a limit of 0.5 and
now we have the limit of 0.05 which means we cannot talk about
toxicity.”  Tina Anicic, the Health Ministry’s spokeswoman, and
Stanislava Nol, the  Agriculture Ministry ’s spokeswoman, were not
immediately available to comment.  A decision to start corn imports “sooner rather than
later” will depend on global prices, Sakovic said. Serbia needs
around 330,000 tons of the grain each month, for human and
animal consumption, or 3.96 million tons over a calendar year,
he said.  Spot corn traded at 22.20 dinars per kilogram, equivalent
to $260 per ton this morning, said Zarko Galetin, the head of
the Serbian  Commodity Exchange  based in the northern city of
Novi Sad, the capital of the Serbian breadbasket, Vojvodina. It
was 2.9 percent lower than last week’s average of 22.87 dinars.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.895 a
bushel by 10:11 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.  “Reports of wheat and milk contamination are damping
demand for corn and I’m afraid that we will be forced to start
imports because the market lacks confidence in the quality of
domestic corn,” Galetin said by phone from Novi Sad.  To contact the reporters on this story:
