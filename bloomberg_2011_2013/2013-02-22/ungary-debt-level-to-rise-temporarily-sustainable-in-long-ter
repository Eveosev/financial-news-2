Hungary’s public debt, Prime
Minister Viktor Orban’s policy focus, is set to decline in the
long term after posting a temporary increase in the middle of
the decade, the central bank said.  Public debt may fall to 66 percent of economic output by
2027 from 79 percent at the end of 2012 while rising temporarily
in the 2015-2017 period, the  Magyar Nemzeti Ban k said in a
survey today. The survey is based on an assumption of unchanged
fiscal policy and is a technical projection, not a forecast, the
bank said.  The survey is “unethical” for predicting a rise in the
debt level and damages the country’s interests, Economy Minister
Gyorgy Matolcsy, a favorite to take over as central bank chief
next month, said yesterday.  Orban teamed up with Matolcsy to focus Hungary’s economic
policy on cutting government debt and keeping the budget
shortfall within 3 percent to end a European Union budget
monitoring process, in place since 2004.  Hungary needs faster growth, lower financing costs or
further fiscal measures to push the debt level below 50 percent
of output, a target enshrined in the Constitution, the survey
said.  Hungary’s primary budget surplus, which strips out debt
financing costs, is set to narrow through 2013 and improve
sustainably afterward to reach 2.1 percent of gross domestic
product by 2027, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
