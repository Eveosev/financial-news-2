  Gerard Depardieu , the French actor
awarded Russian citizenship by President  Vladimir Putin  last
month, is “very pleased” with his new apartment about 600
kilometers east of Moscow, RIA Novosti reported.  Depardieu will tomorrow obtain a permanent residence permit
in Saransk, the capital of Mordovia, a region known during
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin’s reign for its network of labor
camps, the state-run news service said.  The actor chose the location over Moscow because the
Russian capital “has a lot of traffic and is a bit hectic,”
RIA quoted Depardieu as saying. He said he plans to learn the
Russian language to “interact with people,” according to RIA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
