Softbank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese
wireless carrier that agreed to buy a $20 billion stake in
 Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , wants to raise 370 billion yen ($4 billion)
in bonds to help finance the acquisition.  Japan’s third-largest carrier priced 300 billion yen of
1.47 percent four-year notes that will go on sale to retail
investors on Feb. 25, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a statement
today. The company also sold 70 billion yen of similar-maturity
1.467 percent debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Billionaire Masayoshi Son’s Softbank offered in October to
buy a 70 percent stake in Sprint Nextel to enter the U.S. market
and create the world’s third-biggest carrier. The Tokyo-based
company was the first to offer Apple Inc.’s iPhone in  Japan  and
is relying on the popularity of the devices to tap 840 trillion
yen of cash and bank deposits owned by the nation’s households
in helping to pay for the deal.  “This deal is typical of the company that often turns to
individual bond investors for funding,” Hiroaki Hayashi, who
manages 1.5 trillion yen of fixed-income investments at
Fukokushinrai Life Insurance Co. in  Tokyo , said today in a
telephone interview. “There is likely to be a considerable
demand for the notes.”  Softbank last sold bonds in September, when it raised 110
billion yen, including 100 billion yen of 0.74 percent five-year
notes targeting individuals, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The extra yields to own the debt instead of
government bond more than doubled to 142 basis points on Oct. 12
after reports of the deal, and traded at 156 yesterday,
according to JS Price data.  Japanese households owned 1,510 trillion yen of financial
assets, including 840 trillion yen of cash and bank deposits as
of the end of September, according to the  Bank of Japan. (8301)   Rating Review  Softbank has 186.6 billion yen of  bonds  maturing this year,
including a 130 billion-yen retail bond due Sept. 17, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service have put
the Japanese company’s  credit ratings  under review for possible
downgrade on concern the acquisition may undermine its financial
strength. A downgrade of one step would bring the rating to a
speculative, or junk, ranking at Moody’s.  The Sprint announcement came two weeks after Softbank
agreed to acquire a stake in competing Japanese wireless
provider eAccess Ltd. to help meet bandwidth demand from iPhone
users. Sales of Apple phones and tablets have helped Softbank
boost earnings.  Subscriber Boost  The acquisition of  Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint’s
56.4 million subscribers would increase Softbank’s customer base
to 96 million in the U.S. and Japan, the Japanese company said
in October. The company’s biggest Japanese competitor,  NTT
DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , has about 60.8 million subscriptions.  Softbank doubled net income to 65.9 billion yen as sales
gained 7.1 percent to 923.7 billion yen during the  three months 
ended Dec. 31, the company said Jan. 31.  The  carrier  gained 1.4 percent to 3,355 yen as of 1 p.m. in
Tokyo trading, heading for its first gain in four days. The
stock is up 6.9 percent this year, compared with the 9.3 percent
gain by the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
