The U.S. has presented a range of
options for the number of U.S. and allied forces to be left in
 Afghanistan  after 2014, when the bulk of the current force
withdraws, U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  said.  The Pentagon denied a report that the U.S. planned to keep
8,000-12,000 troops in Afghanistan as of 2015.  “A range of 8,000-12,000 troops was discussed as the
possible size of the overall NATO mission, not the U.S.
contribution,” Pentagon spokesman  George Little  said today in
statement after a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
President  Barack Obama  “is still reviewing options and has not
made a decision about the size of a possible U.S. presence after
2014.”  The U.S. currently provides about 66,000 of 100,000 allied
troops in Afghanistan. While that share suggests a future U.S.
force of 5,280 to 7,920 troops, the total may be more because
countries such as France and  Bulgaria  have said they intend to
withdraw all of their troops in coming months.  NATO defense ministers showed “good receptivity” to the
U.S. proposal, Panetta told reporters after the meeting.  “We’ll maintain an enduring presence to be able to fulfill
two key missions: train, assist and support the Afghan army and
in addition conduct counterterrorism activity to make sure that
al-Qaeda and its affiliates never again are able to establish a
safe haven,” Panetta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
