Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  Chief
Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio could receive a 1.4
million-pound ($2.14 million) bonus for 2012 if the U.K. breaks
even on its investment in the lender, according to a person with
knowledge of the plan.  To get the award, the shares will need to rise to the 73.6
pence price at which the government bought its 39 percent stake
in the lender in 2008, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because he isn’t permitted to talk publicly. Lloyds
traded at 54.7 pence at 2:33 p.m. in  London . A final decision on
the award hasn’t been made, the person said.  Horta-Osorio didn’t take a bonus for 2011 after the bank
reported a full-year loss that year and he took a nine-week
absence for exhaustion. He’s contractually entitled to a maximum
payment of as much as 225 percent of his base salary of 1.06
million pounds subject to the bank meeting financial targets.
The government injected about 20 billion pounds into Lloyds
after it acquired HBOS Plc, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender.  Lloyds is scheduled to report full-year results on March 1
at 7 a.m. London time. The bank will post a net loss of 1.14
billion pounds compared with a loss of about 2.8 billion pounds
for 2011, according to the median estimate of 13  analysts  in a
Bloomberg survey.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
government-owned bank, has said CEO  Stephen Hester  won’t take a
bonus for 2012 after a computer failure left some of the
lender’s 17 million customers unable to withdraw cash for days.  Sky News  reported Horta-Osorio’s bonus earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
