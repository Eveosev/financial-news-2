Federal Reserve Governor  Daniel Tarullo  said large banks are vulnerable to runs from non-deposit
liabilities, and regulators need to do more to curb such risk.  “These vulnerabilities involve both large, prudentially
regulated institutions, and thus too-big-to-fail concerns, and
the broader financial system,” Tarullo said today in the text
of remarks to the Cornell International Law Journal Symposium in
 New York . “The liability side of the balance sheets of
financial firms has been barely addressed in the reform
agenda.”  Fed bank supervision and monetary policy is increasingly
focusing on stemming threats to financial market stability.
Tarullo, the Fed governor in charge of financial regulation and
bank oversight, has worked with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  on the
overhaul of the central bank’s risk surveillance and bank
oversight.  To contact the reporters on this story: Craig Torres in
