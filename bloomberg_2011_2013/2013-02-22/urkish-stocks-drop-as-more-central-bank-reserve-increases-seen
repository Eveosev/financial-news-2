Turkish  stocks  slid for a second day
as investors speculated the central bank would continue to raise
reserve requirements in its bid to limit loan expansion.  The  Istanbul Stock Exchange  Main 100 index dropped 1.8
percent to 75,898.69 at the close in Istanbul today, its lowest
level since Dec. 6. Banks led the decline, with  Turkiye Garanti
Bankasi AS (GARAN)  losing 3.8 percent,  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  falling 2.3 percent,
 Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR)  plummeting 4.1 percent and  Turkiye
Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN)  slipping 2.3 percent. The 16-member  banking
index  retreated 3.2 percent.  The central bank in Ankara raised foreign-exchange and lira
reserve requirements for lenders on Feb. 19, citing an increase
in loan growth. The government will continue to take steps to
restrict expansion in loans as it seeks to limit lending growth
to 15 percent this year, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said
in televised comments from Istanbul today.  “It looks like the central bank will continue raising
 reserve requirements ,” Gizem Oztok Altinsac, an economist at
Garanti Securities in Istanbul, said in a phone interview today.
“This limits equity gains, while triggering selling.”  Loan growth was above the government’s target at 19 percent
in the year to Feb. 8, according to data on the state statistics
agency’s website.  The decline extended losses on the Istanbul Stock Exchange
to 3 percent this year, down from a jump of 11 percent over
year-to-Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
