amid speculation yesterday’s decline on the regional benchmark
index was excessive after Japanese exporters pared losses as the
yen fell. Australian equities gained after dropping the most in
nine months yesterday.  Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , the nation’s largest

as European reports added to concern the region’s recession is
deepening.  “In Asia, it’s one of those days when investors sit on the
sidelines and alternatively, if they missed out on a rally, this
is an opportunity to buy stocks at better prices in a pullback
in the market,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
$126 billion under management. “I think it’s a correction. I
don’t think it’s the start of a new slump in the market.”  Fed Stimulus  Asian stocks plunged yesterday, with the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index losing 1.3 percent, amid concern the Federal Reserve may
scale back U.S. stimulus and as  China  called for increased
property curbs. Asia’s benchmark  traded  at 14.7 times estimated

forecast.  Belle International dropped 3.8 percent to HK$14.70 after
its rating was cut at brokerages including  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)
