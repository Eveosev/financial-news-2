The U.S. Justice Department will
join a whistleblower lawsuit against Lance Armstrong, putting
the governmentâ€™s weight behind an action filed by former U.S.
Postal Service cycling teammate Floyd Landis, according to two
people familiar with the decision.  The False Claims Act suit, which remains under seal,
alleges that Armstrong defrauded the U.S. government based on
his years of denying use of performance-enhancing drugs, the
people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
