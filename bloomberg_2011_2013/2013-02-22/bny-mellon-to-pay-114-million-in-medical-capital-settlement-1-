Bank of New York Mellon Corp. 
reached a $114 million settlement with Medical Capital Holdings
Inc. investors who alleged the bank breached its duty as trustee
for notes issued by the company.  Lawyers for the noteholders filed a request for preliminary
approval of the class-action settlement Feb. 21 in federal court
in  Santa Ana ,  California .  The “principal reason for entering into the settlement is
the very substantial cash benefit provided for the class
considered against the significant risk that a smaller recovery
- or, indeed, no recovery - might be achieved after a trial,”
according to the request.  Medical Capital, based in Tustin, California, bought
accounts receivable from health-care providers and raised money
by issuing notes through related entities to investors. The U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the company and its top
executives in 2009, saying they defrauded investors and
misappropriated funds.  The noteholders accused BNY Mellon of disregarding its own
policies and the provisions of the note issuance and securities
agreements that were designed to protect the investors’
interests.  “We are pleased to be putting the matter behind us,”
Kevin Heine, a  BNY Mellon  spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  The case is In re Medical Capital Securities Litigation,
10-ML-02145, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
