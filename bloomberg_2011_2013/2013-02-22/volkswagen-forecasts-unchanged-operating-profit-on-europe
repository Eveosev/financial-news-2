Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
automaker, forecast that 2013 operating profit will match last
year’s level, falling short of analysts’ estimates, as the
shrinking auto market in its home region weighs on earnings.  Earnings before interest and taxes, which rose 2.1 percent
to 11.5 billion euros ($15.2 billion) in 2012, probably won’t
increase this year, Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen said
today in a  statement . The average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg is for 2013 profit of 14 billion euros.
The shares dropped 7.1 percent, the most since Oct. 4, 2011.  The manufacturer is “not completely immune to the intense
competition and the far-reaching crisis in key European
markets,” Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  said in the
statement. “Furthermore, uncertainty in the economic
environment continues.”  VW is counting on growth in  China  and the U.S., along with
gains in the luxury-car segment with the Audi brand, to help
offset declining demand in Europe, where competitors are posting
losses amid a recession. Car registrations in the region last
month were the least for a January since records began in 1990,
following a drop to a 17-year low for all of 2012, according to
the ACEA auto-industry association.  “For sure they are affected by the competitive environment
in Europe, but this is not the case for other markets,” said
 Juergen Pieper , an analyst with Bankhaus Metzler in  Frankfurt 
who has a buy rating on the shares. “I expected them to target
an increase in operating profit this year. It doesn’t sound very
ambitious.”  Forecast Reduced  The carmaker’s forecast today is scaled back from a year-
old prediction made in VW’s annual report for growth in 2013 in
operating profit. Unchanged earnings this year would mark the
first time since 2009 that annual  operating profit  hasn’t risen.  The carmaker plans to increase the  dividend  to 3.56 euros a
preferred share from 3.06 euros. Net income last year  jumped  41
percent to 21.7 billion euros, compared with the 22 billion-euro
average analyst estimate. Profit was pushed up by revaluations
of VW’s options and stake in Porsche. VW last year bought the
50.1 percent of the sports-car maker that it didn’t already own.  Volkswagen  fell  7 percent to 163.80 euros at the close in
Frankfurt in the steepest decline since Oct. 4, 2011. That
pushed the stock to a 4.9 percent drop this year, valuing the
automaker at 74.3 billion euros.  Deliveries Jump  Revenue last year gained 21 percent to 193 billion euros as
group worldwide deliveries, also including the Porsche, Skoda
and Seat brands, jumped 11 percent to a record 9.07 million
cars, sport-utility vehicles and vans. Revenue and vehicle sales
will increase again this year, the automaker said.  Growth was propelled by demand for the U.S. version of the
Passat sedan, which VW began building in 2011 at a new plant in
Chattanooga,  Tennessee , and for Audi’s Q3 SUV, which was
introduced in October 2011.  VW put a revamped model of its best-selling Golf hatchback
on sale in September. The company said in January that it’s
adding shifts at its main plant in Wolfsburg to build more of
the car for the European market, and it will expand its factory
in Puebla,  Mexico , to include production of the Golf’s next
version in 2014.  Targeting Toyota  The manufacturer has a target of overtaking  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  and  General Motors Co. (GM)  to become the world’s biggest
carmaker by 2018. Volkswagen’s market share in Europe rose 1.6
percentage points last year to 24.8 percent as the carmaker’s
1.1 percent drop in sales in the region was less than the
industrywide decline.  Second-ranked European competitor PSA Peugeot Citroen
posted a 13 percent delivery drop in the region in 2012 and its
first operating loss in three years. Detroit-based GM, which
owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe, reported losses in
the region that more than doubled last year, bringing its
cumulative deficit there since 1999 to $18 billion.  VW outlined an investment program for its automotive
division in November totaling 50.2 billion euros through 2015,
shortening the calendar from the usual five years because of
unpredictability in the European car market.  The spending includes 24.7 billion euros to develop new
cars and trucks. VW’s Chinese joint ventures, which aren’t
consolidated, will invest another 9.8 billion euros in the
period.  Pay Rules  The carmaker is revising wage policies for top  executives 
that caps bonuses, which will now be based on VW earning a
minimum operating profit of 5 billion euros, the company said in
a separate statement. Additional long-term incentive payments,
which will depend on VW reaching its targets for 2018, will be
limited to 50 percent of the bonus, it said.  The management board’s total 2012 compensation will amount
to about 56 million euros, a drop from 70 million euros for
2011, with Winterkorn earning 14.5 million euros, a 17 percent
reduction, VW said.  Cash flow  from operating activities fell 5.1 percent to
16.2 billion euros, and net liquidity as of Dec. 31 was 38
percent lower than a year earlier at 10.6 billion euros,
Volkswagen said.  The carmaker is  scheduled  to publish quarterly earnings,
including figures by brand, on March 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
