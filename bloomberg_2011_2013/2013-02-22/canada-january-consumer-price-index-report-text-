The following is the text of
 Canada ’s consumer  price index  report for January released
by  Statistics Canada .  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5% in the 12 months
to January, following a 0.8% gain in December. The main factor
in the smaller increase in the CPI was gasoline prices, which
fell 1.8% year-over-year in January after rising 1.0% in
December.  Provincially, the largest year-over-year decreases in
gasoline prices occurred in Saskatchewan (-8.8%) and Alberta (-
7.3%), while Prince  Edward Island  (+1.5%) was the lone province
to record an increase.  Excluding gasoline, the CPI increased 0.6% in the 12 months
to January after rising 0.8% in December. This slower increase
was led by year-over-year price declines for clothing and
smaller price gains for food purchased from stores.  12-month change in the major components  Consumer prices rose in six of the eight major components
in the 12 months to January. The exceptions were transportation
as well as clothing and footwear.  Food prices increased 1.1% on a year-over-year basis in
January following a 1.5% advance in December. This slower rise
was mainly attributable to easing price increases for food
purchased from stores, notably meat. January’s 0.6% year-over-
year advance in the food purchased from stores component was the
smallest since July 2010.  Shelter costs rose 0.6% in the 12 months to January,
matching the increase in December. Rent and homeowners’
replacement cost was up on a year-over-year basis. Conversely,
mortgage interest cost decreased 4.2%.  Prices for transportation declined 0.5% in the 12 months to
January, after increasing 0.5% in December. In addition to a
year-over-year price decrease for gasoline, prices for the
purchase of passenger vehicles fell 0.8%.  Prices for clothing and footwear fell 1.6% on a year-over-
year basis in January following a 0.1% increase the previous
month. The decline in clothing and footwear prices was
attributable to more sale prices in January 2013 compared with
January 2012.  12-month change in the provinces  Consumer prices rose in all provinces in the 12 months to
January, except in  Alberta .  Consumer prices in Alberta fell 0.5% in the 12 months to
January following no price change the previous month. This
decline was led by electricity prices, which were 29.5% below
the historical highs recorded in January 2012.  In  Nova Scotia , consumer prices rose 1.4% on a year-over-
year basis in January, the largest increase among the provinces.
The province also had the largest year-over-year price advance
for homeowners’ home and mortgage insurance.  Prices in Prince Edward Island rose 1.3% in the 12 months
to January following a 1.2% increase the previous month. Prince
Edward Island was the only province where the All-items CPI
increased at a faster rate in January than in December, led by a
year-over-year advance in  fuel oil  prices.  In  Quebec , consumer prices rose 0.6% on a year-over-year
basis in January, after increasing 1.5% in December. The slower
rise was led by gasoline prices, which fell 1.5% in the 12
months to January after advancing 1.8% in December. The year-
over-year decrease in the purchase of passenger vehicles index
was also a factor.  Seasonally adjusted monthly CPI decreases  On a seasonally adjusted

monthly basis, the CPI decreased 0.1% in January after posting
no change in December.  The seasonally adjusted index for transportation declined
0.2% in January following a 0.5% decrease in December. The
clothing and footwear index decreased 0.8% in January and the
food index fell 0.1%. Conversely, the indexes for shelter,
household operations, furnishings and equipment as well as
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products increased.  Bank of Canada’s core index  The Bank of Canada’s core index

following a 1.1% gain in December.  On a monthly basis, the seasonally adjusted core index rose
0.1% in January, matching the increase in December.  Note to readers  On March 27, 2013, with the release of the February

bmdi/document/2301_D52_T9_V1-eng.htm)  The Bank of Canada’s core index excludes eight of the CPI’s
most volatile components (fruit, fruit preparations and nuts;
vegetables and vegetable preparations; mortgage interest cost;
natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; inter-city
transportation; and tobacco products and smokers’ supplies) as
well as the effects of changes in indirect taxes on the
remaining components.  A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal
movements have been eliminated. Users employing CPI data for
indexation purposes are advised to use the unadjusted indexes.
