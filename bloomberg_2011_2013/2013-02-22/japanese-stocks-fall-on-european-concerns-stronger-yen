Japanese shares  rose, pushing the
 Nikkei 225  Stock Average to a second week of advances, as
domestically-oriented shares including food and services
climbed. Exporters and banks slid on concern they have risen too
far, too fast.  Secom Co., a which provides security services, gained 3
percent. Kirin Holdings Co. advanced 4 percent to its highest
since 2010. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest
bank, lost 1.4 percent. Sony Corp. lost 2.4 percent after  Fitch
Ratings  said its PlayStation 4 is unlikely to generate enough
 cash flow  to turn the company’s credit profile around.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 percent to 11,385.94 at the close
in Tokyo, advancing 1.9 percent on the week. The broader Topix
Index climbed less than 0.1 percent to 963.48.  “Some domestic stocks are rebounding because they had
fallen behind the broader market rally,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, portfolio investment group manager at Tokio Marine &
Nichido Fire Insurance Co., which manages 8.67 trillion yen
($92.9 billion) in assets. “Investors are taking profit on
other stocks like exporters and banks after their big gains.”  The Topix has surged 32 percent since Nov. 14, when
national elections were announced, amid optimism Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and the central bank will lead the country out of
deflation. The measure is trading at 1.1 times book value,
compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent today. The gauge
declined 0.6 percent in  New York  yesterday, following the
biggest drop since November, as concern grew that the U.S.
Federal Reserve may slow the pace of stimulus.  James Bullard ,
president of the bank’s  St. Louis  branch, said falling U.S.
unemployment next year may prompt the Fed to raise its key rate.  Market Correction  “The markets were too euphoric about the economic recovery
overseas, so we’re now facing some correction,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd.,
which has 33 trillion yen ($353 billion) in assets. “Investors
are using this as an opportunity to take profits.”  The Topix’s banking group, which has jumped 16 percent this
year compared with the broader Topix’s 12 percent advance, lost
0.6 percent today. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which has
risen about 11 percent this year, fell 1.4 percent to 513 yen.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. slid 0.7 percent to 3,695
yen, paring this year’s gains to 19 percent.  Exporters also declined.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
top automaker, lost 0.7 percent to 4,730 yen. Panasonic Corp., a
maker of home electronics, declined 0.3 percent to 671 yen.  Paper makers, service providers and food companies rose the
most among the Topix’s 33 industry groups today. Secom rose 3
percent to 4,740 yen, reversing yesterday’s decline. Paper-maker
Oji Holdings Corp. gained 2.8 percent, paring yesterday’s 3.5
percent loss. Kirin Holdings, a beverage maker, jumped 4 percent
to 1,313 yen.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index gained 1.4
percent to 27.44 indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.9
percent of the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
