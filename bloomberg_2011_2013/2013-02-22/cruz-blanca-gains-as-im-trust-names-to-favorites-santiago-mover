Cruz Blanca Salud SA (CRUZBLAN) , Chile’s
second-largest health provider and insurer, gained the most in
seven weeks after brokerage firm IM Trust SA added it to a
portfolio of favorite local stocks.  Cruz Blanca  advanced  1.5 percent to 590 pesos at the close
in Santiago, the biggest gain since Dec. 14. The country’s
benchmark  Ipsa stock index  rose 0.6 percent.  The company, which operates private clinics in Chile and
 Peru  and provides health insurance, was included yesterday in a
portfolio of Santiago-based IM Trust’s top five stocks. Cruz
Blanca has “strong fundamentals,” with increased liquidity in
the stock after it was added this year to the Ipsa, IM Trust
said in an e-mailed note to clients dated yesterday.  “Cruz Blanca’s correction of the last few weeks is
unjustified,” analysts led by Francisca Manuschevich said in
the report.  Health spending in  Chile  may grow at 1.6 times the growth
rate of gross domestic product, as the percentage of Chileans
older than 60 grows to 22 percent by 2030 from 13 percent in
2010, IM Trust said in its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
