Brent crude  advanced, paring a
second weekly decline, after German business confidence rose
more than economists forecast to a 10-month high.  Futures gained as much as 1.1 percent in  London  as the
Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate index climbed for
a fourth month, adding to signs that Europe’s largest economy is
gathering strength. West Texas Intermediate may fall next week
as slowing demand boosts inventories, according to Bloomberg
News survey.  “We are seeing the market correct after the sharp drop
yesterday,” Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AG, said
by phone today from Oslo. “There have been some better macro-
indicators from the U.S. and the  euro zone  too.”  Brent for April settlement gained as much as $1.26 to
$114.79 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
and was at $114.40 as of 1:22 p.m London time. Prices are headed
for a 2.8 percent decline this week after slipping 1 percent
last week. The volume was 14 percent lower than the 100-day
average.  WTI for April delivery rose as much as 64 cents to $93.48 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract fell to $92.84 yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Dec. 31. The volume of all futures traded was 5
percent above the 100-day average. The European benchmark grade
was at a premium of $21.28 to WTI after expanding to $23.18 on
Feb. 8, the widest since Nov. 26.  Italy Vote  Ifo’s business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000
executives, climbed to 107.4 from 104.3 in January. Economists
predicted an increase to 104.9, according to the median of 38
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Investors are awaiting the results of Italy’s general
elections on Feb. 24 and Feb. 25, according to Saltvedt.
Caretaker Prime Minister  Mario Monti  has pushed for cuts to
reduce national  debt  of $2.6 trillion.  “The risk is that Italy will end up with a party that
could increase the risk of a new economic downturn,” she said.
“Investors will typically pull out of this market when
uncertainty and risk version is increasing which in turn may
lead to a drop in  oil prices .”  WTI may fall next week as inventories rise, according to
the Bloomberg survey. Twenty of 30 analysts and traders, or 67
percent, forecast crude will drop through March 1. Five
respondents, or 17 percent, predicted a gain. Five said there
would be little change. Last week, 48 percent of those surveyed
projected a decrease.  Rising Inventories  U.S. crude stockpiles increased a fifth week, the longest
stretch of gains since May, the  Department of Energy  said
yesterday.  Inventories rose to 376.4 million barrels, the highest
since July, according to the Energy Department. Supplies at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI, were up 417,000
barrels to 50.7 million.  Futures in  New York  may decline after breaching support at
the 50-day moving average, according to a technical analysis by
Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in
 Chicago . The April contract may move toward the 200-day moving
average around $92.22 a barrel, he said. It settled yesterday
below the 50-day mean for the first time since Dec. 18.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase shipments into next month as refiners in the U.S. and
 Europe  prepare to start operating after seasonal maintenance,
tanker tracker Oil Movements said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
