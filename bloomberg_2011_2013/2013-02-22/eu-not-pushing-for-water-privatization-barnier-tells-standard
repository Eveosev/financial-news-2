The European Union’s financial
services chief,  Michel Barnier , said the EU isn’t pushing for
water privatization, according to the transcript of an interview
in Vienna’s Der Standard newspaper.  Municipalities need to be more transparent about costs of
providing water services, the paper cited Barnier as saying.
Municipalities have the “autonomy” to decide on different models
of water supplies, the executive said.  Barnier told the paper he supports a European citizen
petition to enshrine the right to water. Austria’s  Social
Democratic Party  has been waging a campaign ahead of local
elections pledging to protect water supplies from privatization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
