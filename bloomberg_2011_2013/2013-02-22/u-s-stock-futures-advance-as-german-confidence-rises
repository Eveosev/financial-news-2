His firm oversees $5 billion. “I haven’t seen a market like this in a long time where you can absorb a week of not-so-good news and rally at the end.”  In  Germany , the Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4 in February from a revised 104.3 in January.

The largest personal-computer maker forecast fiscal second-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates, helped by cost-cutting measures and a smaller-than- projected drop in service sales.
