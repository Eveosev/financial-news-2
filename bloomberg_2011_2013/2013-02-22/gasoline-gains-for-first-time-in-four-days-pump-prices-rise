Gasoline rose for the first time in
four days and pump prices edged closer to last year’s highs.
Crack spreads and the April contract’s premium to later months
increased.  March futures advanced as much as 1.6 percent. The Energy
Information Administration said yesterday  supplies  sank 2.88
million barrels last week as refinery rates and imports declined
while demand increased. Average retail prices have jumped 15
percent this year to within 15.5 cents of last year’s high of
$3.936, according to AAA data.  “Gasoline has been rallying since the EIA showed a bigger-
than-expected draw in gasoline inventories and refinery
utilization dropped as we’re in the midst of the refinery
maintenance season,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “But higher pump prices will
definitely put a damper on consumer spending.”  March-delivery gasoline rose 2.89 cents to $3.0654 a gallon
at 9:54 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange on volume that
was 25 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  The fuel is up 9 percent this year, the second-best
performer on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 commodities,
after cotton.  The April  crack spread , or premium of gasoline over West
Texas Intermediate crude on Nymex, widened 80 cents to a record
$43.79 a barrel. Against Brent oil on ICE Futures  Europe , the
 spread  gained 23 cents to $22.53 a barrel. The April-September
gap widened 1.3 cents to 28.25 cents a gallon.  Stopped Decline  “We stopped the decline,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior
vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “But
fundamentals are about the change for gasoline. Production is
set to rise fairly dramatically over the next couple of months
and these high pump prices are not going to be encouraging for
demand.”  U.S. refinery seasonal maintenance typically peaks in March
and April.  Retail gasoline, averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to
$3.781 a gallon, AAA, the largest U.S. motoring club, said today
on its website. It was the smallest gain since Jan. 27. Pump
prices are up every day since Jan. 17, advancing 48.8 cents.  Refineries used 82.9 percent of capacity last week, down
0.9 percentage point from the prior week and the lowest level in
11 months. Gasoline imports slipped to a four-week low.  Demand, measured by  deliveries to wholesalers , rose 0.4
percent to 8.44 million barrels a day. Demand over four weeks
was 2.8 percent above a year earlier.  Heating oil for March delivery gained 0.67 cent to $3.1024
a gallon on volume that was 28 percent below the 100-day
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
