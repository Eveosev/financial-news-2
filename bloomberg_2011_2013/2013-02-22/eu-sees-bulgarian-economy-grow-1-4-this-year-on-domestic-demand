Bulgaria ’s economy will expand 1.4
percent this year, and 2 percent in 2014 after an estimated
growth of 0.8 percent in 2012, as rising domestic demand offsets
declining exports, the European Commission said in a forecast.  A recovery in private consumption was the main driver of
growth, along with public projects and investment in the  energy
industry , the executive arm of the European Union in Brussels
said today. The “growth pattern is forecast to continue,” the
commission said. EU-harmonized inflation will rise to 2.6
percent this year and 2.7 percent in 2014, from 2.4 percent in
2012, it said.  Bulgaria’s fiscal deficit is set to widen to 1.3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2013 after 1 percent of GDP in 2012 on
increased social spending including a planned 9.3 percent
pensions increase from April 1, according to the commission. The
deficit is forecast to revert to 1 percent of GDP in 2014.  Bulgaria, which survived the global crisis without
borrowing from international lenders, is moving toward early
elections after the government of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov
resigned amid protests two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
