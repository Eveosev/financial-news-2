Allergan Inc. (AGN)  Chief Executive
Officer David Pyott’s compensation jumped 51 percent last year
after the maker of the Botox wrinkle treatment awarded him $9.39
million in stock, according to a company filing.  Pyott, CEO since 1998, made $21.2 million last year,
including the stock award, $1.3 million in salary, a $1.65
million cash bonus and $7.01 million in options awards, Irvine,
California-based Allergan said in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing today. Pyott, who also is chairman and
president, was paid total compensation of $13.9 million in 2011.  The company’s board said the award was part of a plan to
keep Pyott with the company for at least five more years. Under
his tenure, the board said, Allergan’s  market value  has grown to
$33.1 billion from about $2 billion.  “Mr. Pyott has delivered exceptional value to our
shareholders,” the board said in the filing.  Allergan shares rose 24 percent in the past 12 months. The
company last month agreed to buy  Map Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MAPP)  for
$958 million to boost its offerings of migraine treatments.  The company didn’t make a significant change to a provision
in Pyott’s employment agreement that would pay him $10.1 million
in salary and bonus if the company is sold and he leaves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
