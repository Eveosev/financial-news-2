Board member Joerg Asmussen said the Group of 20 must change the
way it operates to enhance international cooperation.  “The G-20 lacks clear leadership” and “suffers from a
lack of legitimacy,” Asmussen said in a speech in Berlin today.
“The G-20’s promising start has unfortunately been followed by
more mixed results.”  The G-20 took on greater prominence in 2008 when leaders
began to attend meetings in response to the global financial
crisis. With a broader membership encompassing emerging
economies, it challenged the Group of Seven, which was set up in
the 1970s after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, as the
preeminent global decision-making forum.  At a G-20 summit in Pittsburgh in September 2009, leaders
committed to a global framework for economic growth, as well as
to overhauling financial regulation to prevent future banking
crises.  “The G-20’s promising start has unfortunately been
followed by more mixed results,” Asmussen said. “This loss of
momentum is to an important extent due to a waning sense of
urgency.”  Asmussen said the group should increase the accountability
and transparency of its decision-making process, adopt a “more
focused and concise and operational agenda” and enhance its
legitimacy by involving international financial institutions and
current non-members in discussions about individual issues.  “Despite its limitations, the G-20 remains an essential
instrument for global economic cooperation,” he said. “There
is no viable or obvious alternative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
