Canadian stocks advanced, erasing a
weekly drop in the benchmark index, as weaker-than-forecast
reports on retail sales and consumer prices were overshadowed by
a rise in German business confidence.  Energy and raw-material producers advanced as  Osisko Mining
Corp. (OSK)  jumped 6.9 percent after beating earnings estimates.
Agrium Inc. fell 4.9 percent as fertilizer companies were
downgraded by Dahlman Rose & Co.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 51.08
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,691.05 at 10:22 a.m. in Toronto.
The S&P/TSX is up 0.1 percent for the week.  German business confidence increased to a 10-month high in
February, indicating that Europe’s largest economy may be
gathering strength. Ifo institute’s business climate index,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4 in
February from a revised 104.3 in January.  Canada’s inflation rate fell in January to its lowest since
2009 and retail sales plunged in December, adding to evidence
the country’s economy is struggling to accelerate from its
slowest pace since the 2009 recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
