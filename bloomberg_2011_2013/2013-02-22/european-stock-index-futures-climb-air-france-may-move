European (SXXP)  stocks rose the most in
seven weeks, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index completing its
first weekly gain this month, as German business confidence
surged to a 10-month high.  Elan Corp. advanced 4.2 percent after announcing a share
buyback. Valeo SA rallied to an 11-month high after reporting
earnings that beat estimates. Volkswagen AG slumped the most
since October 2011 after its operating-profit forecast for this
year fell short of analyst estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 1.3 percent to 288.57 in
 London , for a weekly increase of 0.4 percent. The gauge has
jumped 3.2 percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on
a compromise budget.  “ Germany  is the anchor of  Europe ,” Tobias Britsch, who
helps manage about 26 billion euros ($34 billion) as European
equities asset manager at Meriten Investment Management GmbH,
said by phone from Dusseldorf, Germany. “After yesterday when
you saw investors getting more nervous and all blame was on
Italian elections and on the suggestion the Fed may stop asset
purchases, any pullback is definitely an opportunity to buy.”  The Ifo institute’s German  business climate index , based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4 in February from
a revised 104.3 in January. The median of 38 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey had called for an increase to 104.9. The
latest reading was the highest since April.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
Stoxx 600 was 17 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Italian Polls  In  Italy , voters head for general elections on Sunday amid
concern the emergence of a populist government will derail the
nation’s austerity program. Caretaker Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
has failed to make headway in opinion polls, even as former
premier  Silvio Berlusconi  and ex-comic Beppe Grillo gained
popularity. Pier Luigi Bersani, the union-backed Democratic
Party candidate, leads the table. Bersani and Monti have said
they will form a coalition if necessary.  The European Commission predicted the euro-area economy
will shrink in 2013, abandoning its earlier forecast for growth.
Gross domestic product will drop 0.3 percent this year, the
commission said. In November, it had projected a growth of 0.1
percent, which itself was lower than its estimate in May for 1
percent GDP growth.  National benchmark indexes rose in all of the 18 western
European markets except Iceland. Germany’s DAX added 1 percent,
while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.7 percent and  France ’s CAC
40 rallied 2.3 percent.  Elan Buyback  Elan Corp. gained 32 cents to 7.97 euros in Dublin. The
drugmaker plans to buy back $1 billion of stock -- equal to
about 16 percent of its market value based on yesterday’s close
-- after selling its stake in the Tysabri multiple-sclerosis
drug to Biogen Idec Inc.  Valeo (FR)  gained 2.3 percent to 41.46 euros. France’s second-
biggest car-parts maker said earnings before interest, taxes and
one-time changes increased to 725 million euros in 2012 from 704
million euros the previous year. That beat the 686 million-euro
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Fuchs Petrolub AG rose 5.9 percent to 60.38 euros, its
highest price since at least October 1998. The maker of
automotive lubricants reported 2012 net income that beat
projections, while proposing a  dividend  of 1.28 euros per
ordinary share and 1.30 euros per preferred share.  Tenaris SA, a producer of steel pipes for the oil and
natural gas industry, jumped 3.8 percent to 15.70 euros. Chief
Executive Officer Paolo Rocca said revenue will increase in the
second quarter as weakness in  North America  is offset by sales
in the rest of the world.  Volkswagen Outlook  Preferred shares of Volkswagen dropped 7 percent to 163.80
euros. Europe’s largest automaker is targeting earnings before
interest and taxes this year at the same level as the 11.5
billion euros earned in 2012. The average estimate of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg calls for 2013 profit of 14
billion euros.  G4S Plc (GFS) , a U.K. security provider, slipped 0.9 percent to
287.1 pence after HSBC Holdings Plc cut its rating on the stock
to underweight, similar to a sell recommendation, from neutral.  “Manned security pricing is very weak in many developed
markets, which makes cost recovery difficult and squeezes gross
margins,” HSBC analyst Alex Magni wrote.  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  fell 4.1 percent to 3.83 euros, the lowest
price in three months, as Italy’s biggest defense contractor
said its annual earnings report,  due March 12 , may be delayed
until April amid a bribery probe on the sale of 12 AW101
helicopters to  India . The company also replaced executives
including Bruno Spagnolini, the head of the AugustaWestland unit
at the center of the investigation.  Drax Group Plc, the operator of the U.K.’s largest coal-
fired power station, retreated 1.9 percent to 632 pence. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. downgraded its rating on the shares to sell
from neutral, with analyst Andrew Mead saying the stock’s price
doesn’t reflect risks from increasing carbon costs and biomass
conversion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
