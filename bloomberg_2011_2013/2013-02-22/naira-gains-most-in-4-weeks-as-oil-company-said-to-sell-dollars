The naira appreciated the most in
four weeks as an oil producer was said to sell dollars to
lenders, boosting supply.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer climbed 0.2
percent to 157.25 per dollar as of 12:57 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira gained for a second week by less
than 0.1 percent.  Dealers attributed the gains to inflows of $100 million
from an oil producer, Kunle Ezun, a Lagos-based analyst at
Ecobank Transnational Inc., said by phone today.  The naira is being buoyed in part by oil company inflows,
central bank Governor, Lamido Sanusi said last month. Oil
producing companies periodically sell dollars to lenders to meet
local spending needs and are the second-biggest source of
foreign currency after the Central Bank of Nigeria, which sells
dollars at auctions on Mondays and Wednesday to stabilize the
naira. The bank sold $120 million on both days this week.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose eight basis points to 10.48 percent, according
to yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Ghana ’s cedi declined 0.2 percent to 1.9115 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
