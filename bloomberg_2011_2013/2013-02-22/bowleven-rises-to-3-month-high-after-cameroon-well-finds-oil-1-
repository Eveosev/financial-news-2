BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a U.K. oil explorer in
 Cameroon , jumped to a three-month high in London trading after
finding petroleum off the West African country.  BowLeven rose 5.9 percent to 80.5 pence, the highest
closing price since Nov. 13. The shares are up about 23 percent
this year, valuing the Edinburgh-based company at 237.3 million
pounds ($362 million).  The IM-5 well, in the  Etinde permit  off Cameroon, “has
encountered liquids-rich hydrocarbon-bearing pay,” BowLeven
said today in a statement. It reached a target depth of 3,430
meters (11,250 feet), drilling through two reservoirs.  The well is located in the MLHP-7 block, where the Scottish
explorer is also working with London-based  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  on
plans to supply gas to Ferrostaal AG from 2016 to make
fertilizers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
