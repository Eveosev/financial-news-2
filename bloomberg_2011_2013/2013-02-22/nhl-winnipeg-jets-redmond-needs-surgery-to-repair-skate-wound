Winnipeg Jets defenseman Zach
Redmond had surgery to repair his femoral artery after it was
cut when a teammate accidentally stepped on him during practice,
the National Hockey League team said.  Redmond, 24, underwent three hours of surgery in Raleigh,
 North Carolina , to repair the damage to his right femoral artery
and vein. The Jets won 4-3 last night at the  Carolina
Hurricanes .  Redmond tripped and fell onto his back before a teammate’s
skate caused the mid-thigh wound, the team said in an e-mailed
release, adding that he would be out indefinitely.  Redmond has one goal, three assists and 12 penalty minutes
in eight games this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
