Indian stocks fell for the fourth
week. Consumer companies and lenders led the decline.  The S&P BSE Sensex index, or Sensex, dropped less than 0.1
percent to 19,317.01 at the close, with volumes 3 percent below
the 30-day average. The gauge lost 0.8 percent this week, the
longest stretch since the period ended May 18.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the
country’s largest cigarette maker, slid 1.6 percent. Mortgage
lender  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC)  fell 1.9 percent after
 Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc. cut its recommendation on the stock.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, who presents the
 federal budget  next week, faces pressure to curb spending after
vowing to pare India’s budget deficit to 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ending March 2014, from a goal of
5.3 percent this fiscal year. The economy will grow 5 percent
this year, the least since the 4 percent increase in the 2002 to
2003 period, the statistics office said Feb. 7. Data last week
showed factory output fell for a second month in December.  “The market is delicately poised before next week’s big
event,” Jitendra Panda, head of broking at  Capital First Ltd. (CAFL) ,
said in a phone interview today. “It will be a deficit budget,
which may raise taxes and revenue. If subsidies rise, it will
pressure inflation and limit the scope for more interest-rate
cuts this year. Rate-sensitive stocks such as banks are under
pressure due to that concern.”  The Sensex has fallen 3.9 percent from a two-year high set
on Jan. 25 as net incomes at the biggest companies disappointed
investors. Earnings at 43 percent of the 30 index firms trailed
estimates in the three months ended December, compared with 40
percent in the previous two quarters, Bloomberg data show.  ITC, Unilever  ITC fell 1.6 percent to 292 rupees.  Hindustan Unilever
Ltd. (HUVR) , India’s biggest household products maker, tumbled 2.7
percent to 455.4 rupees.  Housing Development Finance dropped 1.9 percent to 799.85
rupees, the steepest drop since Jan. 11. Goldman Sachs cut the
stock to sell from neutral and lowered the price estimate by 6.3
percent to 740 rupees citing increasing competition.  HDFC Bank
Ltd., (HDFCB)  the top lender by value, lost 1 percent to 659.3 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar & Land Rover, slid
1.6 percent to 292.9 rupees, the lowest level since Feb. 21.
 Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s biggest mobile services company,
surged 4.5 percent to 309.65 rupees, the most since Jan. 15,
after the New Delhi High Court reserved an order on renewal of
licenses held by the company and Vodafone.  Overseas funds bought a net $212 million of  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks
yesterday, after the first net outflow this year on Feb. 19,
taking this year’s net purchases to $8.2 billion, a record for
the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Warning Sign’  Foreign buying during the past 12 months as percentage of
India’s stock market value has crossed 2 percent, a “warning
sign” historically for future returns,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said in a
report dated Feb. 20. Credit Suisse Group AG said Feb. 4 that
Indian equities were the “most overbought” by foreigners, at
1.7 percent of the market capitalization.  The Sensex has retreated 0.6 percent this year, the worst-
performing benchmark gauge in  Asia  after Malaysia. The index
rose 26 percent in 2012, its  biggest annual gain  since 2009, as
the government took measures to revive the economy.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index of the National Stock Exchange of India
Ltd. declined less than 0.1 percent to 5,850.30. India VIX,
which measures the cost of protection against declines in the
Nifty, fell 0.9 percent to 16.79.  To contact the reporter on this story:
