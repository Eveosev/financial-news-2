Russian shares rallied after falling
to a two-month low yesterday as crude oil rebounded, stoking
appetite for stocks in the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The Micex Index added 0.3 percent to 1,498.08 by 5:12 p.m.
in Moscow, paring its weekly drop to 0.6 percent, with 15 shares
down and 35 rising. The Moscow-traded unit of Polyus Gold
International Ltd. surged as much as 8 percent. OAO MRSK Holding
gained 4.3 percent. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  climbed 0.4
percent to 1,554.67.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, increased 0.3 percent to
$93.12 a barrel in  New York , the first advance in three days.
Billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s Onexim Holdings Ltd. sold a 37.8
percent stake in Polyus Gold to Zelimkhan Mutsoev and Gavriil
Yushvaev for $3.62 billion after the deal was approved by the
U.K. Takeover Panel, Onexim said in a statement. The Micex
tumbled 1.2 percent yesterday to the lowest since Dec. 28.  “Traders are looking to sweeten the end of an otherwise
bitter week,” analysts at UralSib Capital wrote in a report.  The Ifo institute’s German business climate index, based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4 in February from
a revised 104.3 in January.  Germany  is Russia’s biggest trade
partner, a relationship underpinned by rising German gas and oil
imports.  “Crude oil and commodities bounced up after German
business confidence beat expectations,” Anton Shelogurov, who
manages about $6.3 million in  Russian (INDEXCF)  equities at Petrocommerce
Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail.  Price Swings  Ten-day price swings  on the Micex spiked to 15.648, the
highest since Jan. 18, while the number of shares traded on the
gauge was 56 percent below the measure’s 10-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The ruble strengthened 0.4 percent
against the dollar to 30.36.  The Micex trades at about 5.6 times  estimated earnings  and
has added 1.5 percent this year. That compares with a multiple
of 10 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which has lost
0.2 percent over the same period.  OAO  Mostotrest (MSTT)  dropped 1.5 percent, poised for the biggest
weekly decline on the Micex at 10 percent. OAO Alrosa gained 0.9
percent, headed for an 11 percent increase in the week, the
biggest on the Micex.  Russia  selected Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
to handle the government’s 7 percent stake sale in the diamond
miner.  Preferred shares of OAO Rostelecom dropped as much as 3.4
percent. The company will probably miss a fall 2013 deadline to
merge with the state holding company Svyazinvest, Vedomosti
reported today, citing unidentified Rostelecom board members and
a person close to the company shareholders.  Buyout Delayed  Russia’s Federal Agency for State Property Management said
Rostelecom’s price valuation by Ernst & Young is too high and
wants to hire another consulting agency, the paper reported.  “For the preferred stock, we think the news is negative as
the buy-out for those who abstain from voting or vote against is
delayed,” VTB Capital analysts said in an e-mailed note today.
“There is much more uncertainty now over the buy-out price than
before, although we still think it might provide upside for
prefs.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, declined 1 percent to $29.20
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in futures, fell 4.7 percent to 19.94 points today. The
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
stocks in the U.S. lost 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
