Chile’s peso appreciated, ending its
longest losing streak since May, after a report showed German
business confidence rose to a 10-month high, brightening the
global economic outlook.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 472.75 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:40 a.m. in Santiago after falling 0.6 percent over the
previous six sessions.  “European stocks are moving up today on positive data from
 Germany , which helps dispel part of the depressing mood in
global markets,” Sergio Tricio, the head of research at
ForexChile in Santiago, said in a phone interview.  Chile’s currency was headed for a 0.3 percent weekly loss,
compared with 0.6 percent declines in the Colombian peso and the
Peruvian sol, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s
real was the best performer among major Latin America
currencies, poised for 0.1 percent gain.  The Ifo institute in Munich reported today that its index
of Germany’s business confidence climbed to 107.4 in February
from 104.3 in the previous month, adding to signs that  Europe ’s
largest economy is gaining strength. The Stoxx Europe 600 index
advanced 1.3 percent. Copper, Chile’s main export, rose 0.2
percent in  New York  after earlier gaining 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
