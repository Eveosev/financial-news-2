  U.K. stocks  rose, rebounding from
the biggest decline in almost seven months, as a report showed
that German business confidence improved more than forecast.  CRH Plc (CRH)  led construction shares higher, climbing 4.3
percent. Elan Corp. surged 4.2 percent in Dublin after saying it
will buy back $1 billion of shares.  G4S Plc (GFS)  fell after the
provider of security guards was downgraded by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  advanced 44.16 points, or 0.7 percent,
to 6,335.7 at the close of trading in London, for a weekly gain
of 0.1 percent. The gauge has rallied 7.4 percent this year
after U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise  federal budget . The
broader FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.7 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index surged 1.9 percent.  “We’re seeing a bit of a rebound today, with selling
pressure abating,” said Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55
billion as senior strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 5.4 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In  Germany , the Ifo institute’s  business-climate index ,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 107.4 in
February from 104.3 in January. That exceeded the median
economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 104.9.  European Outlook  U.K. stocks briefly pared their advance as the European
Commission forecast that the  combined economy  of the 17 nations
in the euro area will contract in 2013. The  commission  predicted
gross domestic product will shrink 0.3 percent. In November, it
had projected growth of 0.1 percent.  The European Central Bank said financial institutions will
repay 61.1 billion euros ($80 billion) of its three-year loans
next week, half the amount that economists had forecast. The
lenders will return the money on Feb. 27, which is their first
opportunity to do so under the central bank’s second Longer Term
Refinancing Operation.  CRH, the world’s second-biggest maker of construction
materials, added 4.3 percent to 1,394 pence in  London . A gauge
of construction-related shares posted the biggest gain of the 19
industry groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, gaining 2.2
percent. Balfour Beatty Plc, the U.K.’s largest housebuilder,
advanced 1.9 percent to 282.8 pence.  Elan Rises  Elan rose 32 cents to 7.97 euros. The drugmaker said it
will buy back shares equivalent to 16 percent of its market
value. Elan agreed on Feb. 6 to sell its stake in the Tysabri
multiple-sclerosis drug to Biogen Idec Inc.  Antofagasta Plc, the metals producer owned by  Chile ’s
Luksic family, climbed 1.6 percent to 1,084 pence. The stock was
raised to outperform from underperform at RBC Capital Markets.
Evraz Plc, the Russian steelmaker partly owned by Roman
Abramovich, added 1.3 percent to 270.1 pence.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  increased 2.1 percent to 345 pence,
advancing for a third day. The U.K.’s third-largest supermarket
group was raised to buy from neutral at Citigroup Inc. The
brokerage said that the retailer will probably maintain its
dividend yield of more than 4 percent.  BowLeven Plc (BLVN)  surged 5.9 percent to 80.5 pence, a three-
month high. The oil explorer said it found liquid hydrocarbons
off the coast of Cameroon in West Africa.  G4S fell 0.9 percent to 287.1 pence, paring an earlier loss
of as much as 4.9 percent. The world’s largest private-security
business was downgraded to underweight, meaning investors should
sell the shares, from neutral at HSBC. The brokerage said that
the company’s margins have come under increasing pressure,
especially in its domestic market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
