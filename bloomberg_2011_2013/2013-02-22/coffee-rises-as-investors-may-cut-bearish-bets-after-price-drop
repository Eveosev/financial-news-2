Sugar rose, capping the first weekly
gain in three, on concern that a record backlog at  Brazil ’s Port
of Santos will cut supply from the world’s top producer and
exporter. Coffee and orange juice also gained.  Brazil ports have 192 ships waiting to load 10.8 million
metric tons of soybeans, corn, wheat and rice, compared with 90
ships waiting to load 4.1 million tons a year earlier,
researcher SA Commodities said today. More time spent loading
the extra grain supplies may delay sugar shipments. Exports may
also be disrupted if dock workers in the country decide to go on
a strike in a protest over  job security .  “There’s a 12-kilometer line into Santos,”  Michael McDougall , the head of the Brazil desk at Newedge Group in New
York, said in a telephone interview. “The terminals are
concentrating on grain deliveries. It’s keeping Brazilian sugar
away from delivery.”  Raw sugar for delivery in May rose 1.4 percent to settle at
18.15 cents a pound at 1:42 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. The price gained 2.3 percent gain for the week.  “Most of the sugar goes through Santos,” McDougall said.
“The only thing shipped out now would be last week’s sugar.”  Prices have slumped 27 percent in the past 12 months on
forecasts that supply will exceed demand for the third straight
year.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery rose 1.4 percent to
$1.438 a pound on ICE. Orange-juice futures for May delivery
added 0.3 percent to $1.2925 a pound. Brazil is also the top
producer of coffee and orange juice.  Also in  New York , cocoa for delivery in May advanced 0.3
percent to $2,139 a ton. Cotton futures fell 0.1 percent to
83.14 cents a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
