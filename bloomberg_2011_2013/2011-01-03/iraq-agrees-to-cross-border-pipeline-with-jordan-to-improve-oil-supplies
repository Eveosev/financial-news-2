Delta Petroleum Co. ,  Turkey ’s
largest independent oil-storage company, plans to expand
capacity and construct a jetty at the port of Ceyhan, where
flows are set to double in the coming two years.  Delta will add 400,000 cubic meters to its current capacity
of about 650,000 cubic meters and build a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-
mile) long jetty, said Sami Habbab, a member of Delta’s
executive board, today at the European Oil Storage conference
hosted by Platts in Amsterdam.  Flows through Ceyhan are likely to rise to 200 million
metric tons in the coming two years from 80 million to 100
million now, as pipeline supplies from  Russia ,  Iraq  and the
Caspian Sea region increase, according to Habbab.  The new jetty, which will supplement Delta’s storage
business by facilitating vessel aggregation and throughput, will
cost more than the storage expansion, he said, without providing
more financial details.  “Jetties are costly,” Habbab said. “But they provide
long-term value.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
