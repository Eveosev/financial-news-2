Saudi Arabian shares slid for the
first time in three trading sessions, led by petrochemical
companies and banks following U.S. markets after lower-than-
expected employment data.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, known as Sabic, dropped the most since
March 31, while  Jabal Omar Development Co. (JOMAR) , a property developer
in Mecca, declined the most since June 2012.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the
largest Saudi lender by market value, fell the most in more than
three weeks.  The  Tadawul All-Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 0.9 percent, the
steepest drop since Jan. 21, to 7113.74 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in Riyadh. The Arab world’s biggest bourse has gained 4.6
percent this year.  “The decline in today’s trading is attributed to the drop
witnessed in international capital markets but mainly U.S.
markets that tumbled over the Saudi weekend,” Mohammed Al- Omran, a financial analyst and president of the Gulf Center for
Financial Consultancy in Riyadh, said by e-mail.  U.S. stocks fell, capping the biggest weekly decline of the
year for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after data showed the
nation added less than half the number of jobs economists
forecast in March.  Sabic lost 0.3 percent to 97.25 riyals, while Jabal Omar
Development Co. slipped 4.5 percent to 25.5 riyals.  Al Rajhi 
dropped 1.1 percent to 65 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
