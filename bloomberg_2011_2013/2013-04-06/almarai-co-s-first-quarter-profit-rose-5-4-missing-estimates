Almarai Co. (ALMARAI) , the largest Saudi
Arabian food producer by market value, said first-quarter profit
increased 5.4 percent as its poultry revenue grew.  Net income rose to 255.1 million riyals ($68 million) from
242.1 million riyals a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  on the Saudi stock exchange website today. That was
less than the 292.9 million-riyal average estimate of ten
analysts compiled by  Bloomberg News .  In May, Almarai, which operates a joint venture with
 PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , approved a 15.7 billion-riyal, five-year
investment program to boost output and develop products. The
company raised 1.3 billion riyals this month from an Islamic
bond sale, which is part of a 2.3 billion-riyal sukuk program
set up in 2012.  “Almarai has a solid long-term growth outlook with poultry
and bakery expected to play an increasing important role,” NCB
Capital said in an e-mailed report today. “However, its
exposure to food inflation we believe poses a key threat on
margins.”  Almarai slid 1.5 percent to 65.5 riyals. The shares have
risen 3.2 percent this year.  First-quarter operating profit increased 2.9 percent to
300.8 million riyals, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
