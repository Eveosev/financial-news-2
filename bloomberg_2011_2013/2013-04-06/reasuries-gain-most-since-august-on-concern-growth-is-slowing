Treasuries soared the most since
August after U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast,
adding to speculation that the growth rate of the world’s
biggest economy is slowing.  Ten-year note yields fell for a fourth week after payrolls
grew by 88,000 workers last month, the smallest in nine months,
even as the  unemployment rate  declined, the Labor Department
said. Gauges of company hiring and U.S. services industries also
trailed forecasts. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may
assess the jobs growth and the duration of the central bank’s
bond-buying plan in an April 8 speech in Atlanta.  “The labor market is still weak and, until that changes,
Treasuries will continue to benefit” said  Christopher Sullivan ,
who oversees $2.1 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in  New York . “It’s too early to
tell whether we have downshifted from what was a fairly
ebullient growth in the first quarter, but a slowdown certainly
remains a concern.”  Ten-year note  yields  fell 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 1.71 percent this week in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They touched 1.68
percent, the lowest level since Dec. 12. The price of the 2
percent note maturing in February 2023 rose 1 7/32, or $12.19
per $1,000 face value, to 102 18/32.  Moving Averages  The 10-year yield traded below its  200-day moving average 
of 1.74 percent yesterday for the first time since Jan. 2 after
closing below its 100-day moving average of 1.83 percent on
April 3 for the first time since Dec. 11. Moving averages are
indicators of momentum.  Treasury  30-year bond yields  fell 22 basis points, the most
since June, to 2.88 percent after touching 2.84 percent, the
lowest since December. It traded below its 200-day moving
average of 2.9 percent for the first time this year.  Speculative long positions in the five-year note, or bets
prices will rise, outnumbered short positions by 157,564
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade in the week ending April
2, rising 24 percent from a week earlier, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That’s the highest
since Sept. 21.  Yields on  five-year debt  fell seven basis point to 0.7
percent.  Net-long positions in 10-year  note futures  also rose,
outnumbering short positions by 110,692 contracts, the most
since the week ending March 1.  ‘Worst Trades’  The growth in payrolls followed a revised 268,000 gain in
February that was higher than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed. The median forecast of 87 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected an advance of 190,000. The  jobless rate  fell
to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008,
reflecting a 496,000 decline in the size of the  labor force .  “Without sustained job growth, there will not be a
material change in economic conditions, and that means
Treasuries will continue to be strong,” said  James Camp ,
managing director of fixed income in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , at
Eagle Asset Management Inc., which oversees $21.5 billion.
“There has been a cry to short Treasuries, and those have been
the worst trades in the  capital markets .” A short position is a
bet that an asset’s value will decline.  The economy added an average of 179,000 people a month to
nonfarm payrolls in 2011 and 2012, Labor Department data show.
The  jobless rate  had stayed above 8 percent since February 2009
until it broke the trend in September.  Treasury Auctions  U.S. government securities rose to the costliest level this
year. The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, was at
negative 0.82 percent yesterday, the most expensive level since
Dec. 14. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  “You can’t put lipstick on this pig and call it pretty,
but one month of bad jobs data doesn’t mean we are headed back
into recession,” said Dan Heckman, a fixed-income strategist at
U.S. Bank Wealth Management, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, which
manages $110 billion. “Treasuries are expensive, and the market
is getting a little bit ahead of itself, especially with supply
coming next week.”  The Treasury will auction $66 billion of notes and bonds
next week, selling $32 billion in three-year notes on April 9,
$21 billion in 10-year debt the next day and $13 billion in 30-
year bonds on April 11.  Japan, Europe  The yield on Treasury 10-year notes fell earlier this week
as investors sought  U.S. debt  after policy makers in  Japan  and
the  euro zone  promised more easing.  New  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central
bank would double its monthly asset purchases in a bid to
encourage inflation, while European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said the ECB stands ready to cut interest rates and
consider additional measures to boost growth as the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis enters its fourth year.  The U.S. central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds
each month since the start of the year, $45 billion in
Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage debt, in an effort to
hold down borrowing costs and encourage economic growth. It has
kept its benchmark  interest-rate  target for overnight lending
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
support the economy.  ‘Aggressive Easing’  “We are reminded that the global theme in monetary policy
is aggressive easing,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
The “decision by the Bank of Japan to double its monetary base
is further evidence of this trend.”  Fed policy makers reiterated March 20 the rate will stay
 near zero  as long as unemployment is above 6.5 percent and
inflation is projected to be no more than 2.5 percent. They said
the purchases will continue until employment improves. Bernanke
is giving the keynote address to the Fed Bank of Atlanta 2013
Financial Markets Conference on April 8.  Swaps traders pushed back expectations for the Fed’s first
interest-rate increase since 2006 to about November 2015 after
yesterday’s employment report. On April 4, OIS showed July 2015
as the likely date for a rate increase.  The central bank’s next policy meeting is scheduled for
April 30-May 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
