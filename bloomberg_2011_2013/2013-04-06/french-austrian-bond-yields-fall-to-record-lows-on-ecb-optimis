Europe ’s government bonds rose this
week, with French, Austrian and Belgian yields falling to
records, as the European Central Bank said it would keep policy
accommodative and the Bank of  Japan  boosted asset purchases.  French  10-year yields  dropped the most since July this week
after ECB president Mario Draghi said policy makers “stand ready
to act” to bolster the region’s flagging economy. Italian and
Spanish bonds led gains in so-called peripheral securities as
the BOJ announced 7.5 trillion yen ($77.4 billion) of monthly
asset purchases. German bunds advanced as a U.S. report showed
employers hired fewer workers than economists predicted in
March, underpinning demand for the region’s safer assets.  “The ECB reinforced the impression that we are looking at
ultra-low interest rates for a while,” said Orlando Green, a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in  London . “Investors are looking to get as
much yield as they possibly can without compromising too much in
terms of risk. The BOJ made their move too, which is why you are
seeing a number of rates fall.”  France ’s 10-year yield dropped 27 basis points, or 0.27
percentage point, this week to 1.75 percent after falling to
1.716 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Bloomberg began
compiling data on the securities in 1990. The 2.25 percent bond
due in October 2022 rose 2.385, or 23.85 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,302) face amount, to 104.315.  ‘Remains Accomodative’  The ECB left its key  refinancing rate  at a record-low 0.75
percent at its monthly meeting on April 4, with Draghi saying at
a press conference after the announcement that monetary policy
“will remain accommodative for as long as needed.”  Austria’s 10-year yield declined 21 basis points this week
to 1.48 percent after dropping to an all-time low 1.474 percent.
Similar-maturity Belgian yields fell 27 basis points to 1.97
percent after touching 1.925 percent.  The BOJ said on April 4 it would double the monetary base
by the end of 2014 by buying government bonds in the country’s
biggest-ever round of asset purchases. The announcement pushed
down bond yields in the nation to records, increasing the
attractiveness of European bonds to Japanese investors.  Italy’s 10-year yield declined 39 basis points this week to
4.38 percent, while similar-maturity Spanish rates dropped 31
basis points to 4.75 percent.  Germany ’s  10-year bund yield  fell to the lowest since July
as the U.S. Labor Department said yesterday that payrolls
increased by 88,000 workers in March, the last in nine months.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bund dropped eight basis
points this week to 1.21 percent after falling to 1.20 percent,
the lowest level since July 24.  French government bonds returned 8.6 percent in the year
through April 4, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds gained 4.9 percent and Spanish bonds earned 11 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
