Bayern Munich defeated Eintracht
 Frankfurt  1-0 to win its 23rd German soccer championship.  Bastian Schweinsteiger scored the only goal in the 52nd
minute in Frankfurt as Bayern won its 11st straight game and set
the record for the earliest Bundesliga title clinching.  Bayern claimed the crown after 28 matches, two quicker than
its own mark of 30 games set in the 1972-73 and 2002-03 seasons.
Bayern leads Borussia Dortmund, the champion the past two
seasons, by 20 points with six games left.  It’s Bayern’s record-extending 22nd title since the
Bundesliga began in the 1963. The club won its other German
championship in 1932.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
