A storm packing winds as
high as 83 kilometers (52 miles) per hour disrupted
train operations and may cancel flights in
southwestern Japan before moving northeast toward the
nation’s largest urban centers.  Kyushu Railway Co., based in the southwestern
city of Fukuoka, is delaying and canceling some routes,
the company said on its  website . Some express trains
departing Kyoto will be canceled from around 3 p.m.
today while other lines will have fewer trains running,
the Osaka-based  West Japan Railway (9021)  Co. said on its
 website .  Flights to and from the southern cities of
Kagoshima, Miyazaki, Tokushima, as well as the central
city of Nagoya, may be delayed or canceled,  Japan
Airlines Co. (9201)  said on its  website . Flights to and from
Nagoya, Osaka and Tokyo also may be affected,  ANA
Holdings Inc. (9202)  said on its  website .  As much as 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain per
hour is expected in southwestern and central Japan,
and the storm center is forecast to cross Osaka, the
nation’s second-largest city, later today as it moves
northeast toward Tokyo, according to projections on
