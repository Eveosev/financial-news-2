Kazakhstan beat the defending
champion  Czech Republic  in doubles today to avoid elimination
from the Davis Cup tennis quarterfinals.  Yuriy Schukin and Andrey Golubev defeated Radek Stepanek
and Jan Hajek 7-6, (7-2), 6-4, 6-3 in Astana, Kazakhstan, to
leave the host trailing 2-1 in the best-of-five matchup.  The Czech Republic won both of yesterday’s singles matches
and can adavance to the semifinals of the top team event in
men’s tennis by taking either of tomorrow’s reverse singles.  The remaining three quarterfinals -- U.S. versus Serbia,
Canada versus Italy and Argentina versus  France  -- are all tied
1-1 heading to their doubles matches later today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
