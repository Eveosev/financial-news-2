Carmelo Anthony scored 41 points and
J.R. Smith added 30 points to help the  New York  Knicks win their
11th straight game, 101-83 against the Milwaukee Bucks in a
National Basketball Association contest.  In the past three games, Anthony has scored 50 points
against the  Miami Heat , 40 against the Atlanta Hawks and 41
points last night as the Knicks (49-26) pulled 1 1/2 games ahead
of Indiana in the race for the second seed in the Eastern
Conference after the Pacers lost 97-75 at home to the Oklahoma
City Thunder. New York trails the Miami Heat by 10 games.  The Knicks trailed 45-36 at the half and rallied in the
third with 42 points on their home court at Madison Square
Garden.  “We were a little dead in the first half,” Anthony told
reporters.  Anthony had 14 rebounds and Smith recorded 10 rebounds
while  Raymond Felton  added nine points for the Knicks, who last
lost to the Clippers on March 17 in Los Angeles.  Brandon Jennings  had 25 points and J.J. Redick contributed
18 for the Bucks (36-39), who hold the eighth and final playoff
spot in the Eastern Conference, 23 games behind the Heat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
