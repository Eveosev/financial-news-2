Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev and China National Petroleum Corp. President Zhou Jiping discussed a program that would boost investment in the
Central Asian nation’s energy sector in exchange for resources.  The program would provide “access to resources in exchange
for investments in oil service and processing projects,”
according to  statement  on on Kazakhstan’s presidential website.
The countries share “dynamic relations” in the oil and gas
sector, Nazarbayev said during a visit to China, in which he
also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Kazakh state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. and CNPC also
signed an agreement on principles of cooperation to expand oil
pipelines from Kazakhstan to China, according to the statement.
The partners in Kashagan oilfield had been in “active
commercial talks” to send crude from the Kazakhstan’s biggest
oil venture to China, national pipeline operator KazTranOil said
Oct. 2.  Kazakhstan is considering whether to use its right of first
refusal to buy  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s Kashagan stake or let India’s
 Oil & Natural Gas (ONGC)  Corp. enter the project.  -- Editor: Jonathan Tirone  To contact the reporter on this story:
