Former South African President
 Nelson Mandela  left a hospital today after 10 days of treatment
for pneumonia, the country’s presidency said.  The discharge of Mandela, 94, follows “sustained and
gradual improvement in his general condition,” according to the
 statement  on the website of President  Jacob Zuma ’s office. “The
former president will now receive home-based high care.”  Mandela’s hospitalization was his third in four months,
including a scheduled checkup. During his treatment, doctors
drained fluid surrounding his lungs.  Mandela served as South Africa’s president for five years,
the first black to hold the post, after his  African National
Congress  won the all-race elections that ended apartheid in
1994. He spent 27 years in prison, most of it on Robben Island,
where he contracted tuberculosis.  Also known by his clan name, Madiba, Mandela won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
