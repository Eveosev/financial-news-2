The European Union’s deal to provide
Spain with 100 billion euros ($125 billion) of aid is a positive
step and will help calm financial markets, Sweden’s Finance
Minister  Anders Borg  said in an interview with newswire TT.  The funds will help create a firewall that considerably
diminishes the risk of contagion from Greece, Stockholm-based TT
quoted Borg as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
