What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade at 6 a.m. Singapore time.  -- Corn futures may open 4 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT as demand remains strong, while hot weather threatens
to parch the crop in the U.S., the worldâ€™s largest grower and
exporter of the grain, according to an e-mail from Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents to 3 cents a
bushel higher in Chicago as parts of the Midwest, the largest
U.S. growing region, are forecast to face hotter weather,
potentially hurting yields, Ker said. Prices may also rise on
speculation  China  may introduce more economic stimulus,
improving investor risk appetite, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents lower as global
stockpiles are high enough to offset forecast crop damage in
 Russia , Ker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
