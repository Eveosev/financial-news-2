Police arrested 14 soccer fans in
Poznan, western  Poland , after disturbances near the city’s main
square.  Ten Poles, three Irish supporters and a Croat were held for
questioning over the incident that took place at about 1:20
a.m., regional police spokesman Andrzej Borowiak said in a phone
interview from Poznan. Ireland and  Croatia  play their opening
Euro 2012 match at 8:45 p.m. in Poznan today.  Police moved in after two groups of fans began hurling
bottles and chairs from outdoor restaurants in an incident that
lasted a few minutes, according to Borowiak. He said he didn’t
know whether the fans had been released yet.  “They were all very drunk and are probably sobering up
now,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
