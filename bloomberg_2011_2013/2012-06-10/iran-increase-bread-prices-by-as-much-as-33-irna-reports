Iranian authorities increased the
price of traditional breads by as much as 33 percent in the
capital, Tehran, the official  Islamic Republic News Agency 
reported, citing a Tehran province official.  A Sangak loaf will now cost 6,000 rials (49 cents), said
Nematollah Torki Tehranâ€™s governor deputy for planning. Barbari,
Taftoun and Lavash loaves will cost 5,000, 3,000 and 1,600 rials
respectively, he said in the report published late yesterday.  The new prices will apply in Tehran bakeries from today, he
said, according to the report.  The government previously increased bread prices in April
2011 when the price of a Sangak loaf was fixed at 5,000 rials,
Barbari at 3,750 rials and Taftoun and Lavash loaves at 2,500
and 1,250 rials respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
