     June 10 (Bloomberg) -- Aldar Properties PJSC and  Sorouh (SOROUH) 
Real Estate Co., Abu Dhabi’s biggest developers, said the due
diligence process for a potential merger will “take a number of
months.”  “A steering committee including representatives from Aldar
and Sorouh has been formed to evaluate a potential merger,” the
companies said in a joint statement to the Abu Dhabi bourse
today. “A due diligence process is now under way to assess in
detail the implications for all stakeholders and this process
will take a number of months.”  Credit Suisse Group AG and  Allen & Overy  are advising
Aldar, while Sorouh’s advisers are Morgan Stanley and Clifford
Chance LLP. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and National Bank of Abu
Dhabi are advising the steering committee. Ernst & Young is
providing accounting advise to the committee and Jones Lang
LaSalle the valuation.  The two builders, part of  Abu Dhabi ’s drive to become a
tourism and business hub, set up a team to study a possible
merger with the “blessing” of the emirate’s government, which
owns stakes in both, they said on March 11. The team was to
present a plan in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
