South Korean producer inflation
moderated to a 29-month low as meat and fish prices and some
service fees declined, according to a report released after
central bankers held rates unchanged for a 12th month.  Prices rose 1.9 percent in May from a year earlier, the
smallest gain since December 2009, after a 2.4 percent increase
in April, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement today. They fell
0.6 percent from April.  The Bank of  Korea  held off from altering borrowing costs
last week as easing consumer inflation gave policy makers time
to gauge how Europe’s debt crisis and China’s slowdown will
affect the economy. Consumer inflation remained at a 21-month
low of 2.5 percent in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
