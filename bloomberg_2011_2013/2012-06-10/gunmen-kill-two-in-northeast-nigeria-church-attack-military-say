Gunmen suspected to be members of an
Islamist sect shot and killed two worshippers in an attack on a
church in northeastern  Nigeria , the military said.  The two were killed and an unspecified number of people
injured when the gunmen attacked the church in Biu, 180
kilometers from the Borno State capital of Maiduguri, Victor
Ebhaleme, a spokesman for Joint Task Force said by telephone.
The worshippers belonged to the Church of the Brethren in
Nigeria, he said.  The area has been cordoned off while “a serious manhunt
for the terrorists is taking place,” Ebhaleme said.  The military prevented a separate attack by the sect and
recovered arms and bomb-making material, he said.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer,
blame Boko Haram, an movement that wants to impose strict
Islamic law in the country, for attacks in the mainly Muslim
north and the capital Abuja that have killed hundreds of people
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
