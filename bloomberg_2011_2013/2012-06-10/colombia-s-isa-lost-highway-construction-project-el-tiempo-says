Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  said the project to build a highway system won’t be
awarded to  Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA) , a Colombian energy and
roadway company,  El Tiempo reported .  The project will be assigned through a public auction
because the company, known as ISA, didn’t meet the necessary
legal requirements, Santos said June 8, the Bogota-based
newspaper said.  The project will cost about 17 billion pesos ($10 million)
and will be directed by Federico Restrepo, former chief
executive officer of Empresas Publicas de Medellin SA, El Tiempo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
