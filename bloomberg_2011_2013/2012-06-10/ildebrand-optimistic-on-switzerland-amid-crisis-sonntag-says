Philipp Hildebrand, the former head
of the Swiss central bank, is optimistic about  Switzerland ’s
economic prospects and sees the country best positioned to
survive Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, Der Sonntag reported,
citing an interview.  Prosperity in Switzerland is now greater than it has ever
been and the country could live on its reserves if things get
tougher, the newspaper cited Hildebrand as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
