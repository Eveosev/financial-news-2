Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  has dropped
plans to sell its 50 percent stake in transportation group
Transdev after failing to find a buyer, the newspaper  Journal du
Dimanche  said, without saying where it got the information.  Cube, an investment fund belonging to French bank  Natixis (KN) ,
might still buy part of Veolia’s stake, the newspaper said. Cube
had offered to buy Transdev but wanted to sell off its holdings
outside France, an idea that was vetoed by state-owned bank
Caisse des Depots et Consignations, which owns the other 50
percent of the mass-transit unit, according to Journal du
Dimanche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
