European soccer’s ruling body UEFA
opened disciplinary proceedings against  Russia  over some fans’
behavior during the Euro 2012 soccer game against the Czech
Republic two days ago.  UEFA said in a statement last night that it’s looking into
crowd disturbances at the game. It’s also working with the
Football Against Racism in  Europe  (FARE) organization on reports
of alleged abuse of Czech Republic players, it said.  Anti-racism campaigners said Czech defender Theodor Gebre
Selassie was the target of “monkey chants” during the game in
Wroclaw,  Poland , the U.K.’s Sunday Times reported.  “Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the
Football Union of Russia for the improper conduct of its
supporters (crowd disturbances), the setting off and throwing of
fireworks and the display of illicit banners,” UEFA said  in the
statement . “Regarding reports of alleged abuse directed at
 Czech Republic  players from Russia fans, UEFA is investigating
this further and is working with FARE to collect more
evidence.”  UEFA’s control and disciplinary body will review the case
June 13. Russia won the Group A match 4-1.  UEFA said today it opened disciplinary cases against the
German and Portuguese soccer associations after their teams’
opening match in Lviv, Ukraine, yesterday. Germany won 1-0.  “The German Football Association is charged with the
throwing of missiles by their supporters, while the Portuguese
Football Federation faces proceedings for a delayed kick-
off to the second half,” UEFA said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
