Russia  is mobilizing 70,000 police
officers and more than 9,000 soldiers for the June 12 holiday
when opposition groups plan rallies in central Moscow and around
the country, according to the Interior Ministry.  About 1.35 million people are expected to attend 1,550
“political, cultural and other mass” events around the country
on the Russia Day holiday, the Interior Ministry said today in a
 statement  on its website.  Vladimir Putin , who returned to the presidency for a third
term last month, on June 8 signed a bill that increases fines
150-fold for protesters who break the law. Putin has faced the
biggest challenge to his authority since he came to power in
2000 as tens of thousands of Russians have taken part in
demonstrations since parliamentary elections in December.  “Participants in masks, for example, will be immediately
detained by the police,” the  Interior Ministry  said, citing the
new law, which took effect yesterday. “Organizers will be held
liable for violations involving harm to civilians, illegally
blocking traffic, damaging roads and property.”  The maximum fine for protesters found to have broken the
law was raised to 300,000 rubles ($9,280) from 2,000 rubles, and
to as much as 600,000 rubles for organizers.  The opposition, which received permission to hold its
planned “march of millions” in Moscow the same day that Putin
signed the law into effect, condemned the initiative as an
attempt to stifle the constitutional right to free assembly.  The holiday celebrates parliament’s declaration of Russian
sovereignty on June 12, 1990, as the  Soviet Union  crumbled.  “There is quite a bit of tension, maybe apprehension is a
better word, ahead of Tuesday,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist
at Troika Dialog in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed note on June 8.
“Many in what remains a core part of the protest movement are
openly saying that peaceful protest has not worked so it is now
time for a more forceful approach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
