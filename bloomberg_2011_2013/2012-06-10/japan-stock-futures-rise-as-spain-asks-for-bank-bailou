Japanese  stock futures  rose after
Spain asked for a bailout of as much as 100 billion euros ($126
billion) to help shore up its banks, boosting optimism that
Europe’s credit crisis may ease.  American depositary receipts of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a Japanese
electronics maker that gets more than 15 percent of its sales in
Europe, gained 1.4 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that gets 14
percent of its sales from China, rose 0.8 percent after China’s
exports climbed in May.  Chugoku Electric Power Co. (9504)  may be active
after its equity rating was raised to “neutral” by Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.  “Concerns about the effect of a credit crunch on Spain’s
economy are easing,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant manager
of investment strategy at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. “One
hundred billion Euro is probably enough to take care of the
problem in the banking system.”  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,515 in Chicago on June 8, up from 8,430 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,630 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australian markets are closed today for
a national holiday. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.5 percent
in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.9
percent today. The gauge advanced 0.8 percent on June 8 on
optimism that weekend discussions among European finance
officials may result in a bailout for Spain to shore up its
lenders.  Spain’s Bailout  Spain’s Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , who as recently as
May 28 said he wouldn’t seek a bailout, characterized the deal
as a  credit line  for banks and an endorsement of his policies.
He spoke to reporters on June 10 in Madrid before flying to
Gdansk, Poland, for a Euro 2012 soccer match between the
national team and Italy.  Spain is the fourth euro member to seek a bailout since the
start of the region’s debt crisis more than two years ago.  The European currency rose against the yen on speculation
Spain may receive aid to ensure access to  capital markets  and
amid indications the shared currency’s decline was too rapid.  The euro strengthened to as high as 100.95 yen today in
 Tokyo , compared with 99.16 yen on June 8. The dollar appreciated
to 79.83 yen from 79.23 yen, boosting the value of some overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  China Boost  Japanese companies with businesses in China may also gain
after China’s May imports increased at more than double the pace
analysts estimated. Imports rose 12.7 percent compared with
estimates for a 5.5 percent gain, the Beijing-based customs
bureau said on June 10.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S last week gained 3.5 percent to 90.27 in New
York last week, snapping a five-seek slump, after the People’s
Bank of China on June 7 reduced benchmark  interest rates  for the
first time since 2008 to bolster growth in the world’s second-
largest economy.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  dropped 2.1 percent this year
through June 8, compared with a 5.4 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and a 1.1 percent drop by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.2 times book value,
compared with 2.1 times for the S&P 500 and 1.3 times for the
Stoxx 600, according to Bloomberg data. A number below 1 means
companies can be bought for less than value of their assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
