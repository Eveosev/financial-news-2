U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  this week is likely to support ranking depositors
ahead of corporate creditors and bondholders in any future
banking collapse, the Sunday Times said, without saying where it
got the information.  Osborne will unveil a white paper on banking reform before
his annual Mansion House speech scheduled for Thursday, June 14,
the paper said. The proposal for depositor preference, which the
industry opposes because it will increase borrowing costs, is
among those put forward by the Independent Commission on
Banking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
