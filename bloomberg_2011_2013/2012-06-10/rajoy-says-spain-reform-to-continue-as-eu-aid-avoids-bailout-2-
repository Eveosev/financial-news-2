Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said the “credibility of the euro won” in yesterday’s request
by his government for as much as 100 billion euros ($125
billion) in European Union aid to restructure the nation’s
banks.  “Yesterday, the credibility of the euro won, yesterday the
future won,” Rajoy said today at a press conference in  Madrid .
“Yesterday, the European Union won,” he said.  Without planned reforms and deficit reduction what happened
“last night would have been an intervention” instead of “the
opening of a  credit line ,” Rajoy said. The government will
continue with its economic and financial reform program, he
said.  Rajoy said the bank aid will allow the nation to avoid a
full bailout.  The government asked euro-area finance ministers to provide
aid beyond the the amount the  International Monetary Fund 
estimated Spain’s banking sector required for restructuring in
order to supply an additional buffer, Rajoy said.  “This gives us a cushion, it gives us security, and
logically the message it sends to the market is much clearer and
more forceful,” Rajoy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
