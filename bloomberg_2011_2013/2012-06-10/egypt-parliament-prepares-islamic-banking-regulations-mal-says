Egypt ’s parliament is drafting
amendments to the country’s central bank law, including the
creation of an  interbank market  for Islamic banks,  Al Mal
reported , citing Mohamed Gouda, a member of the Freedom and
Justice Party’s economic committee.  The regulations will aim at increasing the market share of
Islamic banks to 35 percent in five years, compared with 4
percent now, the Cairo-based newspaper cited Gouda as saying.
The law under discussion also stipulates raising the minimum
capital for banks to 2 billion Egyptian pounds ($331 million)
