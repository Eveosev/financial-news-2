Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB)  said patients
taking its Victoza diabetes drug had greater  weight loss  than
those using  Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMLN) ’s Byetta or a class of
drug known as DPP-4 inhibitors.  Novo is presenting the data at the American Diabetes
Association’s annual meeting in Philadelphia today. The company,
which is  studying  Victoza as a possible obesity treatment,
commented in an e-mailed statement.  Patients taking Victoza lost 3.9 kilograms (8.6 pounds) on
average, compared with 0.8 kilogram for those on DPP-4 drugs and 
2.9 kilograms for those taking Byetta, Novo Nordisk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
