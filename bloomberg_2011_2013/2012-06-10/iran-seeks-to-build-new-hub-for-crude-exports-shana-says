Iran will build a $5.2 billion
export terminal in the southern port city of Jask and turn it
into the new “hub” for crude exports, the Oil Ministry’s
website,  Shana , reported.  Some 20 million barrels of crude will be kept at the
storage terminal, which will be located on the  Gulf of Oman ,
east of the  Strait of Hormuz , Pirouz Mousavi, head of the
Iranian Oil Terminals Co. said in the report published today.  Iran also plans to build a pipeline from the northern port
of Neka on the  Caspian Sea  to Jask, that will be have the
capacity to transfer a million oil barrels a day, Mousavi said
without giving a timeline for the project’s completion.  Iran’s largest oil terminal is located on Kharg Island.
Iran is under a series of international financial and trade
sanctions over its nuclear program which have delayed its energy
projects. A European Union embargo on Iranian oil is set to come
into force on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
