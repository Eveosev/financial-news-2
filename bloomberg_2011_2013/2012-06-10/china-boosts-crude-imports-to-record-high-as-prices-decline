China , the world’s second-biggest
oil consumer, increased  crude imports  in May to a record high as
refineries raised processing rates and oil prices declined.  The country bought a net 25.3 million metric tons, or 5.98
million barrels a day, more than it exported last month,
according to data  published  today on the website of the Beijing-
based General Administration of Customs. That compares with the
previous high of 5.87 million barrels a day in February.  The jump in oil purchases helped spur a 12.7 percent gain
for the nation’s imports last month, exceeding economists’
estimates. Refineries boosted processing rates last month as
some facilities resumed operations after scheduled maintenance
while Brent oil in  London  entered a so-called  bear market  on
June 1 after sliding more than 20 percent from this year’s peak.  “International crude  oil prices  have been falling in the
past two months, so more crude was probably shipped in to fill
commercial and state emergency stockpiles” as prices could rise
again, Gong Jinshuang, a Beijing-based senior engineer at China
National Petroleum Corp., the nation’s biggest oil company, said
by telephone.  Purchases cost an average $120 a barrel, compared with
about $123 in April, Bloomberg calculations from the customs
data showed. China’s imports of crude were 25.48 million tons in
May, while exports were 180,000 tons.  Utilization rates at the nation’s biggest refineries
rebounded to the highest level in 16 weeks at 86.3 percent of
capacity as of May 24, according to Oilchem.net, a Shandong-
based industry website.  China’s net fuel imports including gasoline and diesel were
1.39 million tons in May, compared with 1.36 million in April,
today’s data also showed. The country bought 3.47 million tons
and exported 2.08 million.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
