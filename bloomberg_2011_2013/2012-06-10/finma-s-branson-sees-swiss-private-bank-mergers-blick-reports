Mark Branson, head of banking
supervision at the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority,
expects consolidation among the country’s private banks,
SonntagsBlick reported, citing an interview.  Switzerland  will probably end up with fewer small banks as
rules become stricter about accepting new funds and checking
clients’ tax compliance, the newspaper cited Branson as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
