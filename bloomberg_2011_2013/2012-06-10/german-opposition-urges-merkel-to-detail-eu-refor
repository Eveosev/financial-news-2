Germany’s political opposition said
it wants Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to give details of her plans
to reform the European Union’s institutions before an EU summit
at the end of this month.  Merkel needs to give Germans more information on
“seemingly imminent far-reaching changes to the EU’s
institutional design,” said Carsten Schneider, the budget
spokesman for the  Social Democratic Party , the biggest
opposition group in parliament. Merkel must address parliament
“this week,” Schneider said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
