U.K. investor confidence has fallen
while the Olympics fails to boost investment opportunities,
according to a survey conducted by Capital Spreads Ltd.  The survey found that 19 percent of investors polled in the
second quarter in  London  expect the economy to weaken, Capital
Spreads, a spread betting company, said in an e-mailed statement
today. That’s up from 9 percent after a survey conducted in the
first quarter.  “Sentiment amongst investors has deteriorated in the last
few months,”  Angus Campbell , head of market analysis at Capital
Spreads in London said in the statement. “The U.K. economy is
in dire need of some good news and it seems that the Olympics
are not going to be the answer.”  The survey, which polled 200 of the largest investment
firms, found that a lack of transport options during the
Olympics may produce a further drag on the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
