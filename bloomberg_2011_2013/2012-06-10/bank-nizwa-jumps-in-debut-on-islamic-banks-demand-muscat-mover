Bank Nizwa surged as much as 17
percent as Oman’s first Islamic lender started trading in Muscat
on investor speculation demand for Shariah-compliant services
will grow.  The shares, which have a nominal value of 0.100 rial,
jumped to as high as 0.119 rial before trimming gains to close
at 0.115 rial. Oman’s benchmark  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  declined 0.5
percent, the most in a week.  Until Bank Nizwa’s formation, Oman was the only country in
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council without dedicated
Islamic banks. Bank Nizwa will start operations in the third
quarter,  according to its website.   “We expect Oman Islamic banking sector growth to follow a
similar trend as in the GCC region and grow at a faster pace in
the initial years of operations,” said Kanaga Sundar, head of
research at Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC in Muscat. Growth
will be “led by substantial unfulfilled demand for the Shariah
products,” he said.  Islamic law bans the payment and receipt of interest as
well as investments in businesses such as those involving
tobacco, alcohol, pork and gambling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
