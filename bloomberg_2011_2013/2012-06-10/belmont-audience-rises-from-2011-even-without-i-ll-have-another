The Belmont Stakes attracted more
television viewers than last year, even after Triple Crown
chance I’ll Have Another was scratched the day before the race.  The race portion of NBC’s June 9 broadcast gained an
overnight rating of 5.4 and a share of 13, an increase of 13
percent from 2011, according to the Nielsen Company.  It was the biggest television audience in a non-Triple
Crown year since 2005, NBC said in a news release.  I’ll Have Another, the winner of the  Kentucky Derby  and
Preakness, the first two events in thoroughbred racing’s Triple
Crown, was retired June 8 when doctors found the beginnings of
tendinitis in his left front leg.  Union Rags won the 1 1/2-mile (2.4 kilometer) Belmont in
two minutes, 30.42 seconds in a photo finish over Paynter to
claim the $600,000 winner’s purse. Bodemeister, who finished
second to I’ll Have Another in the Derby and Preakness, also
didn’t run the Belmont.  A crowd of 85,811, 28 percent less than the 120,000 that
the  New York  Racing Association had expected before I’ll Have
Another’s retirement, showed up two days ago at the track in
Elmont, New York. It was a record for a Belmont Stakes day in
which a Triple Crown couldn’t be won, and 72 percent higher than
the 50,000-person average the previous four times a Triple Crown
was not on the line, the NYRA said in an e-mailed release.  The last horse to win the Triple Crown was Affirmed in
1978. Since then, 11 horses have won the first two legs  before
losing at Belmont, most recently Big Brown in 2008. That year,
the television broadcast had a 9.5 overnight rating and 21
share.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC has the rights to show the Belmont,
Kentucky Derby and Preakness through 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
