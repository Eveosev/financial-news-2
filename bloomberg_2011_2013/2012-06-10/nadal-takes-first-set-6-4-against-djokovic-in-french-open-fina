Defending champion  Rafael Nadal  has
a two-set lead over  Serbia ’s Novak Djokovic in the French Open
men’s final as the Spaniard tries for a record seventh title on
the clay courts of  Roland Garros .  The second set started with Djokovic winning a 21-shot
rally to save a break point, but then he lost the game with a
double fault. The pair each held to make it 2-1 and then
Djokovic broke Nadal with a lob to even the set. After breaking
his racket by throwing it down onto the red clay in frustration,
the Serb held serve and took a 3-2 lead.  Nadal took the next three games, and then the set was
delayed about 40 minutes by rain. After play resumed, Nadal
broke Djokovic to take the second set.  In the first set, Nadal jumped out to a 3-love lead in 13
minutes, breaking the Serb twice. He had a chance to go 4 games
up but hit an inside out forehand wide. Djokovic came back to
break him, making it 3-1. He held his serve, and broke the
Spaniard again to even the set as rain began to fall.  Nadal took advantage of Djokovic’s service troubles and
broke his opponent when the Serb double faulted. Djokovic was
getting less than 50 percent of his first serves in. The pair
stayed on serve and Nadal won the set in 58 minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
