BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  is preparing a new
bid to supply  India  with fighter jets as it competes with
Dassault Aviation SA for the order, the Mail on Sunday reported.  The London-based defense company may reduce the price of
its Eurofighter typhoon aircraft after India rejected an earlier
proposal, the  newspaper reported , without saying where it got
its information.  Dassault and India are in final talks to conclude details
of a contract, after its Rafale was given preference over the
Eurofighter in February, the French companyâ€™s Chief Executive
Officer Charles Edelstenne said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
