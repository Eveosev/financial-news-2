Approval of Argentine President
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government has dropped 22
percentage points since October,  Clarin  reported, citing Buenos
Aires-based pollster Management & Fit.  Approval of Fernandez’s government dropped to 42.1 percent
from 64.1 percent eight months ago, while disapproval rose to
50.4 percent in that period from 29.4 percent, the newspaper
said.  Fernandez also is losing support as 38.9 percent this month
said they had a “good” image of her, down from 64.1 percent in
September, according to Clarin, citing Management & Fit. The
drop in support for Fernandez and her government is related to
an increasing perception that the economy is deteriorating,
Clarin said.  Management & Fit polled 1,626 people from June 1 to June 6
in Buenos Aires, and in the north and south of the country,
Clarin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
