Triton Partners, an investment firm
managing more than $3 billion, is bidding for Findus Group Ltd.,
the frozen-food company owned by  Lion Capital LLP , the Sunday
Times  reported , without saying where it got the information.  Lion, a private-equity firm that has bought some of
Findus’s subordinated debt, has teamed up with two U.S. hedge
funds that also own the notes in a bid to prevent senior
lenders, including  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , taking over
the business, the newspaper said.  Triton’s 240 million-pound ($371 million) offer would repay
senior lenders in full while wiping out the junior debt holders,
the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
