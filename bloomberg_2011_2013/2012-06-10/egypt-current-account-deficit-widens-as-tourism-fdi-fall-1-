Egypt ’s nine-month current account
deficit widened to $6.4 billion from $4.7 billion in the same
period last year as foreign direct investment and tourism
receipts declined because of unrest, the central bank said.  Foreign direct investment fell to $218 million in the
period that ended in March compared with $2.1 billion a year
earlier, the regulator said in an e-mailed statement. Tourism
revenue, one of the country’s main sources of foreign currency,
slumped 18 percent to $7.1 billion. Egypt’s fiscal year ends
June 30.  The economic crash following the end of  Hosni Mubarak ’s
three decades of rule last year has drained foreign reserves by
almost half and slashed investment. Portfolio-investment
outflows widened to $4.6 billion from $969 million a year
earlier, the central bank said.  Still, remittances from Egyptians working abroad surged by
44 percent in the period to $12.8 billion. That helped limit the
increase in the overall balance of payments deficit to $11.2
billion compared with $5.5 billion a year earlier, according to
the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
