OAO Gazprom plans to bid for a U.K.
power plant put up for sale by EDF Energy Plc, a purchase that
may be controversial because of the companyâ€™s links to the
Kremlin, the Sunday Times  reported , without saying where it got
the information.  The plant, which supplies 800,000 homes, is at Sutton
Bridge in Lincolnshire, the paper said. EDF hired N.M.
Rothschild & Sons Ltd. to run the auction, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
