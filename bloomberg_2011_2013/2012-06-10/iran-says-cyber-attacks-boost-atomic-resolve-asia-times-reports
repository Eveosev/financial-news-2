Cyber attacks will only increase
 Iran ’s resolve to pursue its nuclear work, Ali Asghar Soltanieh,
the country’s envoy to the  International Atomic Energy Agency ,
said according to the  Asia Times .  Attacks by the Stuxnet or Flame viruses and the
assassination of Iranian atomic scientists will boost Iran’s
“determination to pursue its nuclear rights,” Soltanieh told
the Hong-Kong based newspaper when asked about reports that
President  Barack Obama  had authorized attacks on his country’s
computer systems.  Soltanieh also said Iran will only consider ratifying the
so-called Additional Protocol, which includes more intrusive
inspections of its nuclear facilities, if its dossier is pulled
from the UN Security Council.  Reports that Iran has cleansed its Parchin military complex
to destroy evidence of nuclear weaponization, are “baseless
noise based on lousy intelligence,” Soltanieh said according to
the report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
