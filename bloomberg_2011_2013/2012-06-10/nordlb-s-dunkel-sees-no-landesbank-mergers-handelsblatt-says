Germany ’s state-owned lenders, the
so-called Landesbanken, are unlikely to merge,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing Gunter Dunkel, the head of Norddeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale.  There are “no valid merger scenarios” at the moment, the
newspaper cited him as saying in a preview of an article to be
published tomorrow.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
