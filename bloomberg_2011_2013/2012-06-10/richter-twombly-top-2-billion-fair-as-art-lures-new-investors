A  Gerhard Richter  abstract is the
lead item of $2 billion of art for sale at the world’s oldest
and biggest fair devoted to modern and contemporary works.  The Richter oil painting priced at more than $20 million is
being offered at  Art Basel  in Switzerland this week by  New
York ’s Pace Gallery. The VIP preview has been extended to two
days this year -- tomorrow and June 13 -- as demand grows from
established collectors and new investors looking for bankable
names as alternatives to unsettled financial markets.  The UBS-sponsored event, now in its 43rd edition, features
300 galleries from 36 countries and remains the must-see fair
for curators, advisers and collectors in an increasingly crowded
calendar. Art Basel, which has offshoots in  Miami Beach  (Dec. 6-
9) and  Hong Kong  (May 23-26 2013), tops about 190 fairs held
annually worldwide, up from about 70 in 2005.  “There’s been a lot of talk about art as an alternative
investment over the last five years,” said Robert Read, fine
art expert at specialist art insurer  Hiscox Ltd. (HSX)  “It does
resonate. The world’s mega-rich have piles of cash at the
moment, and there’s nothing for them in the bond markets or
equities.” The value of works for sale has increased by at
least 10 percent from last year’s $1.75 billion, he said.  Pace  is selling Richter’s monumental 1986 red, blue and
yellow abstract “A.B. Courbet.” The German artist is on a bull
run at auctions, with a record $21.8 million paid at Christie’s
International on May 8 for the 1993 painting “Abstraktes Bild
(798-3).” Pace also has the 1961 Alexander Calder mobile
“Sumac,” priced at $8 million to $10 million.  Gagosian’s Hirst  This year  Gagosian  is bringing an estimated $250 million of
works by  Damien Hirst  and other artists from the gallery’s
stable, said dealers. Gagosian doesn’t comment on sales figures.
It sold $45 million of art in the first quarter of an hour of
the preview last year as the fair attracted a record 65,000
visitors.  New buyers are entering the market, said  Thomas Dane , whose
London-based dealership is one of eight to debut in the Main
Galleries sector of the fair.  “What people don’t tend to see is that the market is in
constant flux with some prices going down for certain artists
while others are in great demand,” Dane said. “Overall my
perception is one of less risk and more interest in artists with
a history behind them.” He will be offering a 2007-2008
“Travel Picture Rose” diptych by the Los Angeles-based
photographer  Walead Beshty  marked at $55,000.  Greve’s Twombly  The Swiss dealership Galerie Karsten Greve has the 1966
blackboard painting “Hill (Rome)” by  Cy Twombly  with a price tag
of more than $12 million.  New York-based  McCaffrey Fine Art  will be holding a curated
show devoted to the Japanese collective “Gutai,” which
exhibited from 1954-1972, in the project-based Art Feature
sector. Works on its booth are priced from $50,000 to $1.7
million.  Sprueth Magers  will be bringing the unsettling 2012  Barbara
Kruger  digital print “Tears,” marked at $275,000. Hauser &
Wirth will be offering an untitled 2012 bronze head by  Thomas
Houseago  for $175,000.  Art Basel runs at the Messe Basel through June 17. The
fair’s specialist offshoot Design Miami/Basel runs concurrently
nearby, as do the satellite contemporary-art shows Liste, Volta
and Scope at other venues in the Swiss city.  Information:  http://www.artbasel.com/go/id/ss/lang/eng/   (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
