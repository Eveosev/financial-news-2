Tahiti beat New Caledonia 1-0 in the
Oceania Nations Cup soccer final to become the first Pacific
Island nation to secure a spot at FIFA’s Confederations Cup.  Steevy Chong Hue got the only goal in Honiara,  Solomon
Islands  for Tahiti, which is 179th in FIFA’s world rankings.
Tahiti will now take its place at the Confederations Cup, which
takes place next year in Brazil.   It is the first time in the Oceania Nations Cup’s nine
editions that a team other than  New Zealand  or Australia has won
the title. Australia is no longer involved, having quit Oceania
in 2006 to join the Asian Football Confederation.  New Caledonia upset New Zealand 2-0 in the semifinals. The
All Whites won 4-3 against Solomon Islands in today’s third-
place playoff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
