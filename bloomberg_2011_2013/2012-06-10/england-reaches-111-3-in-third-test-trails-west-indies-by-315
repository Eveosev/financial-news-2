England recovered after losing three
early wickets to reach 221-5 at the close of day four in the
third cricket Test. West Indies, boosted by a record-breaking
performance from Tino Best, lead by 205 runs.  England’s  Kevin Pietersen  was caught for 78 after putting
on 137 with  Ian Bell , who now has 76 at Edgbaston, Birmingham.
Nightwatchman  Steve Finn  has yet to score. Andrew Strauss and
Jonathan Trott each scored 17, while Alastair Cook made 4 as
England stumbled on 49-3.  After Pietersen’s dismissal, Jonny Bairstow was bowled by
Best for 18.  England has already clinched the three-match series by
winning the first two Tests, so keeping its place atop the world
rankings. The first two days of the match were washed out and it
appears to be heading for a draw.  Earlier, Best made the highest score by a number 11 in Test
history as he and Denesh Ramdin put together a stand of 143, the
highest final-wicket partnership in West Indies history, to
reach 426 all out. Ramdin finished on 107 not out.  Best scored 95, surpassing the 75 made by India’s  Zaheer
Khan  against Bangladesh in December 2004. Best’s previous
highest Test score was 27.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
