Vodafone Plc (VOD)  paid no corporation tax
in the U.K. last year after earning “several hundred million
pounds” from its 19 million customers, the Sunday Times
reported, citing its own investigation.  The company used a network of offshore companies,
principally in Luxembourg, to erase its tax liability and claim
a refund of 4 million pounds ($6.2 million), according to the
Sunday Times.  Simon Gordon, a company spokesman, said in reply to an e-
mail seeking comment that Vodafone pays tax in every country
where it operates. The mobile-phone company, based in Newbury,
U.K., pays 1 pound in corporate tax worldwide for every 4 pounds
of profit, he said. “There are tax reliefs for  capital
investment  and interest costs in the U.K., which applied in this
case,” Gordon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
