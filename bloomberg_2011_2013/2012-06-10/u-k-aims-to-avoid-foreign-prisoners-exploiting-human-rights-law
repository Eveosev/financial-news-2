The U.K. government plans to set
guidance for judges to keep foreign prisoners from using human
rights laws to avoid deportation and will introduce stricter
family immigration rules, Home Secretary Theresa May said.  Parliament will vote on guidance on how courts should apply
article 8 of the Human Rights Act, the right to family life, May
said on the British Broadcasting Corp.’s Andrew Marr Show.  The vote “will set out clearly what constitutes the right
to a family life and how you balance the interest of the public
against the interests of the individual,” May said today. “We
have seen cases going through our courts where people who are
criminals whom we want to deport have been able to stay in the
U.K. because the courts have said, ‘No, you have this right to
family life.’”  Family life “is not an absolute right,” May said.  May is also proposing new curbs to immigration rules such
as setting a minimum salary of 18,600 pounds ($28,700) for
people who wish to bring in a foreign spouse from outside the
European Union, with the amount rising for each child a parent
wishes to bring into the U.K.  “We think it right the required income should be increased
for each child,” May said. The new rules are about “being able
to support yourselves and not being  reliant  on the state.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
