Egypt ’s state-run television
channels stopped running a widely-criticized advertisement that
warned citizens against discussing internal affairs with
foreigners, government-owned  Al-Ahram  newspaper reported today.  The 40-second  ad , which was also aired on private channels
last week under the title “A Word Saves a Nation,” showed a
foreigner walking into a cafe and sitting with three Egyptian
youths who start discussing local politics. Their English-
speaking companion starts typing on his mobile phone to an
unknown party as the voices of the three speakers mingle in the
background with sinister music.  The ad “disrespects Egyptians’ minds and uses deception to
intimidate them with conspiracies,” Ahmed Maher, one of the
founders of the April 6 youth movement, said in an e-mailed
statement today. “These naive adverts harm the national economy
and help hurt tourism,” and could be interpreted as “advice to
violently handle foreign tourists,” Maher said. April 6 helped
orchestrate last year’s mass protests that toppled former
President  Hosni Mubarak .  Maher called for the information minister to be brought
before parliament to reveal who was behind the ad, as well as
another that warned people against sharing information online.  Mubarak’s regime, in its waning days, used media outlets to
accuse unidentified foreign powers of inciting the 18-day
protests against him. Anti-foreign sentiments have grown since
then in the country where tourism is one of the main sources of
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
