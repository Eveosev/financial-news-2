The $1 trillion erased from U.S.
equities in May has left bulls from  Byron Wien  to Laszlo Birinyi
and  Jonathan Golub  unbowed in their predictions that the rally
in shares will continue.  Blackstone Group LP’s Wien, who foresaw the bear market’s
end in 2009, said the  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index’s biggest
monthly retreat since September lowered investment sentiment so
much that it’s safe to buy. Birinyi, president of Birinyi
Associates Inc., and Golub, the chief U.S. market strategist at
UBS AG, say the largest first-quarter rally in 14 years left
shares due for a decline and that gains will resume.  For a third straight year,  losses in May  have heightened
concern that the slowest U.S. recovery from any recession in
seven decades is fizzling out. While the 6.3 percent decrease in
the  S&P 500  was enough for Birinyi to say he’s “tempering” his
enthusiasm, Wien said declining forecasts for economic growth
have aligned investor expectations with reality and more
disappointments are unlikely.  “The best time to buy stocks is when people hate them and
they sure hate them now,” said Wien, the New York-based vice
chairman of the advisory services unit at Blackstone whose
forecast that the S&P 500 would exceed 1,400 in 2012 came true
on March 15. Blackstone has $190 billion under management. “Who
would’ve thought that 2 percent growth would be impressive? But
that’s what we have. Everybody’s bearish.”  Outlook Worsens  Stocks rose last week, with the S&P 500 climbing 3.7
percent to 1,325.66, after China cut  interest rates  and European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials stand ready
to act should the region’s growth outlook worsen. The increase
trimmed the loss since the U.S. equity index reached its 2012
peak on April 2 to 6.6 percent. The gauge is up 5.4 percent for
the year and 96 percent since reaching a 12-year low of 676.53
in March 2009.  The S&P 500 declined 1.3 percent to 1,308.93 today. The
MSCI All-Country World Index dropped 0.2 percent to 299.77.  Economists have pared  2012 forecasts  for expansion in U.S.
gross domestic product since last year. The world’s largest
economy will grow 2.2 percent, down from an estimate of 3.3
percent in February 2011, according to the median estimate of 93
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Wien, a senior strategist for Morgan Stanley and hedge fund
Pequot Capital Management Inc. before coming to the world’s
biggest private equity firm, said the May selloff left investors
with cash that will eventually come back to stocks.  Fund Withdrawals  Investors withdrew $7.2 billion from American equity mutual
funds during the five days ended May 23 after $178 billion of
outflows in the previous 12 months, data from the  Investment
Company Institute  in Washington show.  Birinyi, an equities trader at Salomon Brothers Inc. in the
1980s, recommended buying shares at the beginning of May, saying
rising bearishness was a sign they’d go higher. The 6.3 percent
loss in the S&P 500 last month was the  biggest decrease  since
September. He said in December 2008 that a  bull market  was
beginning. An investor who bought the S&P 500 at the March 2009
low turned $10,000 into $20,984, including dividends.  “It ain’t over,” Birinyi said in a phone interview on
June 7 from Westport,  Connecticut . “Historically, in the last
stage of the bull market it’s a very strong rally. The last
stage is the one where everyone is in the pool. This is still a
market where even in the first quarter of this year, there was a
lot of skepticism and reluctance and that hasn’t changed.”  Whirlpool, Nike  Birinyi added  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) , the world’s largest
appliance maker, to his recommendations last month. The  Benton
Harbor , Michigan-based company is up 28 percent so far in 2012,
even after dropping 17 percent in April, and analysts project
earnings excluding some items will more than triple this year.
 Nike Inc. (NKE)  and  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , which have
outperformed the S&P 500 in 2012, are among his picks.  First-quarter profit that  topped forecasts  failed to help
shares of  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  The Findlay, Ohio-based oil
refiner declined 13 percent in May, the biggest monthly loss
since September, even after reporting quarterly earnings that
exceeded estimates by 29 percent on May 1.  UBS’s Golub expects the S&P 500 to reach 1,475 by the end
of the year as earnings climb to $105 a share. His price
estimate for the S&P 500 is tied for second-highest among 13
Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg. While a default in
 Europe  would force him to lower his forecasts, Golub said
economic conditions in the U.S. are strong and European leaders
will stem the crisis.  Worst Case  “The question is whether policy officials are going to
watch the euro crumble or whether they’re going to take some
type of action to avoid the worst-case outcome,” Golub said in
a June 4 interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New York . “If
there’s anything we’ve learned over the last three years, it’s
that policy makers are much more able and creative at being able
to avoid worst-case outcomes.”  Spain became the fourth euro member to seek a bailout since
the start of the region’s debt crisis more than two years ago
with a request for as much as 100 billion euros ($125 billion)
to rescue its banks.  Both Golub and Tony Dwyer at Canaccord Genuity Securities
LLC recommend technology and consumer discretionary companies.
 Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) , a maker of chips that help mobile devices
connect to the Internet, has lost 13 percent from its high this
year of $39.30, sending the  Irvine , California-based company’s
price-earnings ratio 63 percent below its  five-year average .  Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL)  tumbled 14 percent last month even after
the retailer reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates.
Analysts  project earnings  will climb 16 percent in fiscal 2013.
The stock is down 2.5 percent in June.  ‘Only Natural’  “Corrections are only natural, normal and healthy until
they happen,” said Dwyer, the chief equity strategist at
Canaccord, who predicts the S&P 500 will reach 1,575. “The
fundamental backdrop is still constructive, albeit slower.”  Dwyer sees record  S&P 500 earnings  of $105 a share in 2012
and a price-earnings ratio of 15,  compared with  13.4 now. With
producer prices excluding food and energy rising an average of
2.9 percent this year, expenses are unlikely to curb profits and
the ratio may expand more than that, he said. Dwyer predicted in
July 2009 the S&P 500 would be above 1,060 by the end of the
year. The measure closed at 1,115.10 in 2009.  “Given the sub-3 percent core inflation environment, a 15
multiple is the minimum not even the average,” Dwyer said from
New York. “As long as you don’t go into a recession, $105 is
very doable.”  Start Buying  The 9.9 percent slide from April 2 through June 1 is
probably ending, according to Birinyi, who said the increased
bearishness is “encouraging” and recommends investors stay in
equities or start buying them before the last phase of the bull
market starts around September. Of the 108 S&P 500 companies
that had analyst changes in the past week, 64 percent had their
ratings lowered, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Financial markets have been battered by elections in Greece
and France, concerns over Spanish banking, weakening emerging
market economies such as China, India and Brazil and the 29
percent plunge in  Facebook Inc. (FB)  stock following the biggest
technology initial public offering, according to Birinyi. That
the S&P 500 has fallen just 10 percent is encouraging, he said.  “I did not anticipate that all the wheels would come off
the bus,” Birinyi said. “Even now, it’s not the thickest ice
I’ve ever seen. But we’re not giving up on the market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
