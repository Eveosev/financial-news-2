Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ,
the world’s largest fertilizer producer by market value, dropped
its bid  to increase its holding in  Israel  Chemicals Ltd. to as
much as 25 percent from 13.9 percent, a Potash spokesman said.  “The application was taking a long time so we withdrew
it,”  Bill Johnson , a spokesman for the Canadian company, said
today in an interview. The Saskatoon, Canada-based fertilizer
company applied in December to Israel’s Ministry of Finance to
raise its stake.  Israeli Finance Ministry spokesman Boaz Stembler declined
to comment. A spokeswoman for the Antitrust Authority, Noa Zvi,
declined to comment.  Potash will “evaluate options going forward,” Johnson
said, regarding the company’s future acquisition strategy.  Israeli newspaper Ma’ariv reported the decision earlier
today without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
