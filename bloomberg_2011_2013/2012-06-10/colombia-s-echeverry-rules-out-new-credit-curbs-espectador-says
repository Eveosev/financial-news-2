Colombia ’s Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said the government isn’t considering
additional measures to curb credit growth, newspaper  El
Espectador  reported, citing an interview.  Officials are waiting to see the effects of measures taken
last month to limit credit by banks, Echeverry told El
Espectador.  Echeverry asked the country’s central bank to be “more
active and aggressive” in avoiding volatility in the exchange
rate, El Espectador said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
