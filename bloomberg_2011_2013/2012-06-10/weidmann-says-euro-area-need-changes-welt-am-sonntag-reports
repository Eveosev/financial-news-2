Changes need to be made to the euro
area if it is to become sustainable, European Central Bank
council member Jens Weidmann was quoted by Germany’s  Welt am
Sonntag  as saying.  “The currency union can’t function sustainably the way it
is at the moment,” Weidmann, who’s also Bundesbank president,
was cited by the Berlin-based paper as saying. “We need more
clarity if we want to go down the route to a fiscal union, or if
we want to keep relying on self-responsible national budget
policies. In the latter case, the common liabilities need to be
narrowly limited.”  Germany should stay in the single-currency zone because of
the high costs and risks linked to leaving, Weidmann was quoted
as saying.  “A disintegration of the currency union would be linked to
extremely high costs and risks,” he said. “That’s why such a
scenario can’t be the goal of politicians.”  This “should not mean that  Germany  becomes open to
blackmail and promises guarantees without control,” Weidmann
was quoted as saying. “That would erode the stability basis of
the currency union.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
