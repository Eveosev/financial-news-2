Evonik Industries AG,  Europe ’s
biggest unlisted specialty chemical maker, will hold talks with
investors this week to determine whether to attempt or cancel
 Germany ’s biggest initial public offering in more than a decade.  While investors have shown a “very high interest” in the
IPO planned for  Frankfurt , “the development on the financial
markets since the end of May is sparking growing uncertainty
whether proceeds can be achieved that justify Evonik’s value,”
RAG-Stiftung, the company’s majority owner, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  If the success of the transaction can’t be guaranteed, then
the IPO will be canceled, RAG said. “The investor talks in the
coming days are to provide clarity to enable a short-term well-
founded decision.”  Evonik has twice attempted to list its shares since 2007
before postponing the plan as market conditions deteriorated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
