Israel ’s  government bonds  dropped,
pushing yields to the highest level in more than two weeks,
after investor optimism about a bailout for Spain tempered
demand for safer assets.  The yield on the 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit notes due January 2022
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.45
percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, matching the level
on May 24. The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds
increased 0.2 percent to 265.69, the highest since May 6. The
 TA-25 Index (TA-25)  of stocks rose 0.5 percent.  Euro-area finance ministers were asked to support the
rescue of Spain’s banking system with a request for as much as
100 billion euros ($125 billion). European officials have
struggled to control a debt crisis that started in  Greece  at the
end of 2009 and has now spread to the euro region’s fourth-
largest economy. About 40 percent of Israel’s gross domestic
product is made up of exports, with  Europe  and the U.S. the
largest markets.  “Investors are selling government bonds and are buying
stocks as optimism that European decision-makers are taking
steps is bolstering risk demand,” said Dror Waserman, a bond
trader at Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. in  Tel Aviv . “Demand for
local government debt is also reduced as investors await the
bond auction tomorrow.”  Bond Sale  Israel’s  Finance Ministry  is planning to sell a combined
2.05 billion shekels ($529 million) at a bond auction tomorrow,
including 300 million shekels of the benchmark notes.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, rose six basis points to 246. That implies an
average annual inflation rate of 2.46 percent.  Israel must maintain budgetary discipline and is aiming for
a “reasonable” deficit, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said
today. The country is in a “war” to protect its economy in the
face of a global crisis and if it found itself in the same
position as  Spain , “there would be no organization or country
to give it 100 billion euro in aid,” Steinitz said.  Foreign direct investment in Israel via domestic banks
totaled about $550 million in April, most of which was invested
in technology and banking, the  Bank of Israel  said today. Non-
residents’ net investments in Tel Aviv-traded shares in April
was $60 million, the central bank said.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell four basis points
to 2.21 percent on June 8. The shekel weakened 0.2 percent to
3.8753 a dollar on June 8, trimming the monthly gain to 0.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
