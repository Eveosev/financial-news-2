  Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS) , an Israeli food
producer, headed for its largest gain in six months on investor
bets last month’s drop was overdone.  Osem Investments Ltd. (OSEM)  was
poised for its highest close in two weeks.  Strauss  advanced  2.8 percent, the most since Nov. 27, to
42.29 shekels at 2:14 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Osem, another food
producer, added 2.1 percent to 55.03 shekels. Strauss tumbled 8
percent in May and Osem lost 6.2 percent as a government panel
prepared recommendations for the industry. The benchmark TA-25
index gained 0.2 percent.  “The shares are correcting off recent lows,” Gil Dattner,
an analyst at Tel Aviv-based  Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  said
today by phone. “They declined last month on concern about the
recommendations and as the general market declined. The
recommendations were indeed negative for the sector, but they
were not as extensive as feared.”  Protests that started in July against rising prices, from
housing to cottage cheese, have spurred Israeli policy makers to
propose measures to reduce the cost of living. The panel on food
prices recommended on June 4 steps, including easing tariffs on
food imports and reducing barriers for additional players, to
spur competition in the food-supply sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
