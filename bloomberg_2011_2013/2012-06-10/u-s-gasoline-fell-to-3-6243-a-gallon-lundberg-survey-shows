The average price of regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations declined 15.9 cents in the
past three weeks to $3.6243 a gallon, according to Lundberg
Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended June 8 and is based on
information received from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The price is down 11.62 cents from a
year earlier. The highest average this year was $3.9671 during
the two weeks ended April 6.  “Europeans’ misfortunes are American fuel consumers
gain,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said
today in a telephone interview. “Our dollar looks strong
against the weaker euro, which has reduced the price of crude.”  Prices at the pump fell as West Texas Intermediate crude
for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  slid
$7.38, or 8.1 percent, in three weeks to $84.10 a barrel on June
8. Futures have declined 23 percent since reaching a year-to-
date high of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  Gasoline futures for June delivery on the Nymex sank 20.43
cents, or 7.1 percent, during the period to $2.6852. Gasoline
has lost 21 percent since reaching a 2012 high of $3.4166 on
March 26.  Futures have fallen on concern that growth is slowing in
the U.S. and  China  and that the European debt crisis is
worsening and will reduce fuel demand. Economists at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in New York reduced their forecast for third-quarter
U.S. economic growth to 2 percent from a previous estimate of 3
percent, citing the slowdown in hiring and the global economy.  China Rates  China last week cut  interest rates  for the first time since
2008 and lowered fuel prices to combat slower growth in the
world’s second-largest economy.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  at a June 6
press conference left the door open to a rate cut, while
highlighting the limitations of the ECB’s tools in countering
the region’s financial turmoil.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress
on June 7 that the Fed is poised to act if Europe’s financial
crisis threatens the U.S. recovery, while giving no clear signal
of further easing in the near term. Bernanke on June 19-20 will
lead the  Federal Open Market Committee  in a policy-setting
meeting.  OPEC Meeting  Oil may rise this week as OPEC ministers gather to discuss
the group’s output, U.S. crude supplies drop and countries take
steps to bolster slowing economies, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Nine of 25 analysts, or 36 percent, forecast crude will
advance through June 15. Eight respondents, or 32 percent,
predicted that futures will decline and eight said there will be
little change.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline was $3.76 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$4.11.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in Seattle, where the average was $4.22 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Jackson,
 Mississippi , where customers paid an average of $3.18 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
