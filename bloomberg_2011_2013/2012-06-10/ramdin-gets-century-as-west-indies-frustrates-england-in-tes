Denesh Ramdin scored 107 not out as
West Indies frustrated England by reaching 426 all out at lunch
on the fourth day of the third cricket Test. Tail-ender Tino
Best was dismissed on 95 just before the break.  Ramdin and Best put together a final-wicket stand of 143 in
the rain-disrupted match at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Bestâ€™s
previous highest Test score was 27.  West Indies resumed today on 280-8 after several dropped
catches yesterday allowed the visitors to bat out the day.
Marlon Samuels made 76, and  Ravi Rampaul  was out early today for
2. Best was caught by  Andrew Strauss  off Graham Onions.  The first two days were washed out. England has already
clinched the three-match series by winning the first two Tests,
so keeping its place atop the world rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
