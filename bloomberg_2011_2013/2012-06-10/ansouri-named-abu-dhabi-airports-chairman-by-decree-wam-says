Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince issued a
decree appointing Majid al-Mansouri as Abu Dhabi Airports Co.’s
chairman, the Emirates News Agency  reported  today.  The appointment, issued by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed  Al Nahyan , who is also Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab
Emirates Armed Forces, is valid for three years, WAM said.
Mansouri replaces Khalifa Al Mazrouie, who appears as the
company’s chairman on its  website .  Abu Dhabi Airports, home to  Etihad Airways , is building a
new terminal to cater for growing passenger numbers as the
airline expands. It competes with neighbouring Dubai, where the
world’s largest international carrier Emirates is based.  To contact the reporter on this story:
