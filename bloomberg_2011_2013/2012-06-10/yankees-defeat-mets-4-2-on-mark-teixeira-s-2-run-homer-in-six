Mark Teixeira hit a two-run home run
in the sixth inning to give the  New York Yankees  the lead in
their second consecutive win over the  New York  Mets in a Major
League Baseball interleague game.  The Yankees, who routed the Mets 9-1 two nights ago,
defeated the Mets 4-2 last night in the second game of the
three-game series.  “Right now we’re on a nice little run,” Teixeira told
reporters. “Starting pitching has been the key.”  Phil Hughes (6-5) allowed two runs on six hits in 6 1/3
innings while striking out six to get the win. Dillon Gee (4-4)
surrendered three runs on five hits and struck out five in seven
innings for the loss. Rafael Soriano got his ninth save.  “I didn’t think he was quite as sharp as he was in
Detroit, but I thought he battled,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi 
said of Hughes. “Made some big pitches when he had to. I
thought he did a really good job for us.”  Derek Jeter  scored on  Alex Rodriguez ’s single in the first
inning to give the Yankees a 1-0 lead at Yankee Stadium. Jeter,
who was 0-17 before his first-inning single to centerfield,
scored his 1,800th career run, breaking a tie with Ted Williams
for sole possession of 17th place on baseball’s all-time list.  Omar Quintanilla and  David Wright  each hit home runs for
the Mets, who took a 2-1 lead in the sixth before Teixeira’s
hit.  Curtis Granderson  sealed the victory in the eighth inning
with his 18th home run of the season.  The Yankees (33-25) are in second place in the American
League East, one-half game behind the  Tampa Bay Rays . The Mets
(32-28) are in third place, 3 1/2 games behind the Washington
Nationals in the National League East.  At Fenway Park where the Washington Nationals defeated the
Red Sox 4-2, Boston’s pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka made his first
major league appearance since May 16, 2001, after undergoing
elbow surgery. He took the loss, allowing four runs on five hits
in five innings while striking out eight.  In other games, it was Minnesota 11, the Chicago Cubs 3;
Baltimore 6, Philadelphia 4 (12 innings); Atlanta 5, Toronto 2;
San Francisco 5, Texas 2; the Chicago White Sox 10, Houston 1;
Tampa Bay 13, Miami 4; San Diego 5, Milwaukee 2;  Detroit  3,
Cincinnati 2; the Los Angeles Angels 11, Colorado 5; the Los
Angeles Dodgers 8, Seattle 3; Pittsburgh 5, Kansas City 3; St.
Louis 2, Cleveland 0; and Arizona 8, Oakland 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
