Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is discussing
the possibility of exploring for shale-gas deposits in Algeria
and  Tunisia  with the governments of those north African
countries, The National reported, citing a company official.  Shell is “discussing very seriously with countries in
North Africa” the regulatory framework and fiscal regimes that
would make developing natural gas trapped in rock formations
attractive to produce, Mounir Bouaziz, the company’s regional
vice president for exploration and production, told the United
Arab Emirates-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
