The  Bank of England , which will
operate the countryâ€™s planned Prudential Regulation Authority,
will have greater powers to decide how to regulate the banking
industry, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The new authority will help decide how retail and
investment activities in banks can be separated, the newspaper
said, citing a speech that  George Osborne , Chancellor of the
Exchequer, will make in  London  on June 14. He will say that
prescriptive regulation on banks is not the best way to improve
the sector, according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
