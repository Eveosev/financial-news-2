U.K. dentist chain Oasis Dental Care
Ltd. has appointed DC Advisory to help raise money to fund an
expansion of the business, The Sunday Telegraph reported.  Oasis runs 205 dental practices in the country and says it
can double that number as tighter regulations may force private
dentists out of business, the newspaper reported, citing an
interview with Justin Ash, its chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
