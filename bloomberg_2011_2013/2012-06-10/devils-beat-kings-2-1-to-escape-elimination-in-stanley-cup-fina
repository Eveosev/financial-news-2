Bryce Salvador scored his fourth
goal of the playoffs as the  New Jersey Devils  avoided
elimination from the Stanley Cup Final with a 2-1 victory over
the  Los Angeles Kings .  The Devils, who trail the best-of-seven series 3-2, travel
to Los Angeles for Game 6 tomorrow.  New Jersey  has won the last
two games.  Zach Parise got a power-play goal 12 minutes, 45 seconds
into the first period last night to give the Devils a 1-0 lead
on their home ice at the Prudential Center in Newark, New
Jersey.  “We’re still down 3-2 but it’s nice to get this one,”
Parise said in a televised interview. “Now we’re going back to
L.A. We’ve got to be much better with the puck.”  Justin Williams scored on a 19-foot wrist shot to tie the
game at 1-1 at 3:26 of the second period before Salvador scored
six minutes later.  Martin Brodeur  had 26 saves for the Devils. Jonathan Quick
tallied 19 saves for the Kings, who are seeking their first
Stanley Cup championship.  “When we weren’t playing well, he bailed us out so many
times,” Parise said of Brodeur. “When you hear about goalies
winning a game, that was tonight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
