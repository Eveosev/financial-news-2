Management of the Swiss industry
association SGV is urging the Swiss central bank to give up the
franc ceiling of 1.20 versus the euro, NZZ am Sonntag reported,
citing the association’s internal paper from this month.  The currency peg is “not lastingly positive for the
economy,” the paper, prepared by the head of economic policy at
the association, said according to NZZ am Sonntag. Starting an
exit strategy early is important for the economy, the newspaper
said, citing the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
