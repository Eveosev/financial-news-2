Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP) , an Egyptian
private equity firm, is poised for the biggest advance in five
weeks after signing a renewal agreement for a $2.6 billion loan
for an oil refinery.  Shares of the Cairo-based company climbed 3.1 percent to
2.65 Egyptian pounds at 2:10 p.m. in Cairo, heading for the
biggest daily increase since May 6. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30
Index (EGX30)  fell 0.3 percent.  Citadel Capital met with lenders and Egyptian Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri on June 7 to discuss the project, it
said today in a filing to the Egyptian bourse. Financing for the
$3.7 billion refinery is expected to close “soon,” Citadel
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
