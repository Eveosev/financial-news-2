Greece may post the lowest increase
in wind-powered electricity capacity since 2004 this year as
companies cut investments amid restrictive government policies,
the  Hellenic Wind Energy Association  said.  Installed capacity rose by 45.05 megawatts in the first
five months of the year to 1,793.4 megawatts, putting it on
track for the lowest growth rate since 2004, the Athens-based
association said today in an e-mailed statement. Capacity grew 7
percent in all of 2012 and by 24 percent in the previous year,
the association said in January.  Wind investors have been hit by the Greek government’s
decision to impose an extraordinary levy on company revenue, to
require guarantees, to impose a fee on operating licenses and to
exclude wind energy investments from capital subsidies from
2014, the trade body said.  Electricite de France  SA was the biggest producer of wind
energy in Greece in the January-to-May period, accounting for
298.8 megawatts or almost 17 percent of total production,
according to the statement. Iberdrola Renovables SA’s Greek
unit, Rokas Renewables, was the second-largest producer with
250.7 megawatts and Terna Energy SA was third with 241.5
megawatts.  Enel Green Power SpA and Ellaktor SA made up the rest of
the top five producers.  Vestas Wind Systems  A/S accounted for 49
percent of wind turbines installed in Greece in the period and
Enercon GmbH for 22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
