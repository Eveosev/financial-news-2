Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  dropped the
most since April after its Indian joint venture received notice
of a 86 billion-rupee ($1.5 billion) fine for violating foreign
exchange rules.  The shares fell 1.7 percent to 5.79 dirhams at the close in
Dubai, trimming this year’s advance to 54 percent. Over 39
million shares were traded, more than twice the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emaar
has the highest weighting on  Dubai’s benchmark index , which
gained 0.2 percent.  Emaar MGF Land Ltd. (EMGF) , a joint venture with MGF Land
Development Ltd and builder of Delhi’s Commonwealth Games
Village, has been served with a show-cause notice by the
country’s Enforcement Directorate, according to Times of  India .
The Delhi-based company could face a total penalty in excess of
250 billion rupees for allegedly violating the Foreign Exchange
Management Act by diverting foreign direct investment to buy
agricultural land, the paper said.  “What we once expected to be a strong growth driver for
Emaar has turned out to be a problem,” Montasser Khelifi, a
senior manager of global markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd
in Dubai, said by phone today.  “Most analysts already factored
in bad will on the Indian operation’s book value.”  Ten analysts have a  buy rating  on Emaar stock, five say
hold and one recommends selling, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  A phone message left for an Emaar spokesman was not
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
