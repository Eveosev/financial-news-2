President  Barack Obama  named United Nations Ambassador  Susan Rice  as his national security adviser and Samantha Power, his former human rights adviser, to succeed Rice at the UN, filling out his national security team for his second term.  The choice elevates two long-time Obama advisers who share the president’s inclination to respond to foreign crisis through international coalitions as the U.S. confronts a sectarian civil war in Syria,  Iran’s nuclear program , and provocations from  North Korea .  Rice is “fearless,” Obama said today at a White House ceremony, and “understands that there’s no substitute for American leadership.” Power “knows that we have to stand up for the things that we believe in,” he said.  Republican critics’ successful efforts in December to block Rice from being nominated as Secretary of State are now answered by placing her in a potentially more influential role. In her new post, she will meet with the president daily.  Rice, 48, doesn’t need confirmation by the Senate. Obama called on the Senate to confirm Power, 42, “without delay.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Roger Runningen in Washington at  rrunningen@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Komarow at  skomarow1@bloomberg.net
