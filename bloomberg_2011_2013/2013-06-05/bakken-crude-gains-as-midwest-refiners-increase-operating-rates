Crude from the Bakken shale formation
strengthened against domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate
after a report that refinery activity in the Midwest jumped
during the last week of May.  Bakken strengthened 75 cents to a discount of $3.75 a
barrel against WTI at 1:58 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Inputs of crude and other feedstocks to refineries in PADD
2, the Midwest, rose by 175,000 barrels a day in the week ended
May 31 to 2.97 million, the biggest increase since March 15, the
Energy Information Administration said today.  Refiners in the region restarted units coming back from
maintenance in that week, including  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) ,
which restarted a crude unit at its Catlettsburg, Kentucky
refinery, and Citgo Petroleum Corp., which brought a compressor
back online at an Illinois refinery after work.  Oils produced in the Gulf Coast strengthened against WTI.
Light Louisiana Sweet gained 30 cents a barrel to a premium of
$9.60 to WTI and Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 10 cents
a barrel to $9.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon gained 95 cents a barrel to a $3.25
