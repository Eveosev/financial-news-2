President  Barack Obama  announced a
series of actions aimed at protecting technology, finance and
retail companies from lawsuits and demands for fees by
businesses that abuse the patent system.  The crackdown on what critics have called “patent trolls”
includes five executive actions and seven recommendations that
require congressional action. A White House commission report
said more than 100,000 companies were threatened with
infringement last year by patent-assertion entities -- companies
whose sole business is to obtain patents and use them to obtain
royalties from businesses that make or use products and
services.  The announcement formalizes changes that have been
considered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including
making patent owners and applicants identify who benefits
financially from the patent and improving application
examinations. It also backs some legislation sponsored by
members of both parties in Congress.  Abusive patent lawsuits are a growing drain on companies
and the court system, though not all businesses that own patents
without making products are “trolls,” according to a report
released yesterday by the White House Council of Economic
Advisers, the National Economic Council and the Office of
Science and Technology Policy.  Key provisions seek to help businesses receiving letters
demanding royalties for the use of products, such as scanning
documents so they can be sent via e-mail, providing Wi-Fi
services to customers and tracking customer shipments. The
National Retail Federation has reported a number of lawsuits
designed to get companies to either pay the patent owner or
spend large amounts of money in litigation.  The patent office plans to educate retailers and end users
of technology about their rights. Among the legislative
proposals are ones that would provide better legal protection
against liability for users of common products, make royalty
demand letters public and give courts more discretion to
sanction those who file abusive suits.  With many of the lawsuits being over software, the
president directed the patent office to monitor applications
more closely to ensure they don’t claim a broad use of
technology. One proposal backed by the White House also would
expand a new review program for finance-related business methods
to also include computer-implemented technology.  “When responsible actors increasingly find themselves at
the mercy of those abusing the patent system, decisive steps
must be taken to protect small business innovation,” said
Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for
Competitive Technology, a lobbying group for application
developers.  Sage Electrochromics’ Patent Suit Sent Out for Mediation  Sage Electrochromics Inc.’s patent lawsuit against
Milpitas, California-based View Inc. was referred for mediation,
according to a May 29 court filing.  Sage, based in Faribault,  Minnesota , sued in federal court
in San Francisco in December claiming its patents 5,724,177 and
7,372,610 were infringed. The two patents are related to
electrochromic devices and methods.  Both companies are glass manufacturers. The disputed
technology involves the use of electric charges to alter the
optical qualities of glass.  The deadline for completing mediation is Oct. 15, according
to the case docket. The court previously set a hearing on the
reach of the patents for January.  The case is Sage Electronics v. View Inc., 12-cv-06441,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco).  Apple Faces U.S. Import Ban on Some Devices After Samsung Win  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  faces a ban on imports of some devices including
the iPhone 4 and iPhone 3G made for AT&T Inc. after a U.S. trade
agency said they infringe a patent owned by Samsung Electronics
Co., its biggest competitor in the global market for
smartphones.  Samsung’s patent 7,706,348, was issued in April 2010. It
covers an information-transmitting apparatus and method used in
a communications system that meets the International Mobile
Telecommunications-2000 standards, also known as the 3G
standards.  The U.S. International Trade Commission announced its
decision in a  notice  posted on its website. The import ban is
subject to review by President Barack Obama, who can overturn
the decision on public-policy grounds.  The commission found that Apple didn’t violate three other
Samsung patents.  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  Louboutin Sues Charles Jourdan Over Red-Sole Shoe Trademark  Christian Louboutin Sarl sued Charles Jourdan Fashion
Footwear LLC claiming it infringed a trademark for red-soled
women’s shoes.  Jourdan supplied and shipped counterfeit shoes to retailers
in New York, Louboutin said in a filing yesterday in federal
court in  Manhattan .  “Defendants were and are aware that the counterfeit
products they sell are not genuine Louboutin products,” Paris-based Louboutin said in its complaint.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled in September
that Louboutin has the right to trademark protection for women’s
shoes with red soles when the remainder of the shoe has a
different color. The decision came in a case brought against
Yves Saint Laurent America Inc.  Louboutin said in the complaint that the counterfeit shoes
were sold on the website of  DSW , or Designer Shoe Warehouse, and
at stores in Manhattan and  Brooklyn . It seeks $2 million in
damages for each mark that is infringed.  The case is Christian Louboutin SAS v. Charles Jourdan
Fashion Footwear LLC, 13-cv-3776, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  Kansas Coffee Shop Told Name Infringed Twisted Sister Trademarks  A coffee shop in Mission,  Kansas , received a cease-and-desist letter from legal counsel representing a founder of the
1980s heavy-metal band Twisted Sister,  according to  the KCTV
News website.  Twisted Sisters coffee shop was named after its two owners,
who are sisters and were called “twisted sisters” in the
1960s, KCTS reported.  In the letter, the  Twisted Sister  band is described as
world famous, a claim disputed by some of the coffee shop’s
customers, according to the news website.  Tilaknagar to Produce Brandy Under Two Mohan Brewery Brands  Tilaknagar Industries Ltd. (TLNGR) , a liquor company based in

appeals court to overrule a district judge and halt  Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) ’s AutoHop ad-skipping service that it says threatens
television’s advertising system.  Lawyers for Fox claim Dish’s PrimeTime Anytime and AutoHop
services, which allow subscribers to record all four networks’
entire primetime schedule and watch the shows commercial-free
the next day, infringe Fox’s copyrights and breach Dish’s
license agreement with Fox.  Fox alleges the AutoHop service threatens the ad-supported
television model because it diminishes the value of commercials,
which are the main source of financing for primetime
programming. The ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox affiliate associations,
as well as the National Association of Broadcasters, filed
arguments in support of Fox’s appeal.  Fox, Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal and  CBS Corp. (CBS)  separately
sued Dish, the No. 2 U.S. satellite-television provider, in May
2012, claiming the service will destroy the “advertising
supported ecosystem” that provides free, over-the-air primetime
television. Dish sued the networks in New York, seeking a court
ruling that it isn’t infringing copyrights.  Dish, based in Englewood,  Colorado , introduced its Hopper
digital video recorder in March of last year. It can record all
the major networks’ primetime shows and store them for eight
days after their initial broadcast. AutoHop, introduced in May
2012, allows viewers, with the touch of a button, to skip all
the commercials on recorded shows automatically.  The case is Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network LLC, 12-57048, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth District ( Pasadena ,
 California ).  Lawyers Who Chased Pirates Involved in Piracy, Defendant Claims  A defendant in a copyright case alleging unauthorized
downloading of an adult film through the BitTorrent file-sharing
protocol filed an affidavit accusing lawyers involved with these
cases of piracy themselves.  In his June 3 filing in federal court in Orlando,  Florida ,
Paul Oppold said that some of the lawyers were simultaneously
acting as pirates by distributing the film through BitTorrent
and “pirate catcher” by recording the Internet protocol
addresses of those who downloaded the film. This was done for
the “monetization of infringement” and was “both evil and
ingenious” according to the affidavit.  One of the lawyers he named, John Steele of Prenda Law,
didn’t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment.
Although Steele isn’t listed as counsel in the case, Oppold
claim Prenda Law is the actual manager of the litigation.  The underlying case was dismissed in December upon the
request of the plaintiffs. Oppold is seeking attorney fees.
Courts around the nation have dismissed many of these cases.  The case is First Time Videos LLC v. Oppold, 12-cv-01493,
U.S. District Court, Central District of Florida (Orlando).  For more copyright news, click here.  To contact the reporter on this story:
