Co-Operative Group Ltd., whose assets
range from supermarkets to funeral homes, appointed Richard Pennycook as group finance director and Richard Pym as chairman
of its banking unit.  Pennycook, 49, joins Co-Op after eight years at  William
Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW)  and will take up his new role from
July initially on an interim basis, Manchester, England-based
Co-Operative Group said in a statement today. Pym, 63, will
replace Paul Flowers as chairman of Co-Operative Banking Group.  “They bring significant and valuable experience,” Co-Op
Group Chairman Len Wardle said in the statement. Both “will be
great assets as we reposition our bank and take the wider group
to the next phase of its development.”  Co-Op Bank, which traces its roots to Britain’s 19th-century industrial north, last month was cut six steps to junk
by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited a capital shortfall
for its decision. Co-Operative Bank’s core Tier 1 capital ratio
under the latest round of Basel rules was 6.7 percent in
January, less than the 7 percent target set by U.K. regulators,
Moody’s said.  Pennycook replaces Steve Humes as group finance director,
who left last week, said spokesman Russ Brady. Pym is currently
chairman of U.K. Asset  Resolution Ltd. (RSL)  and will retain that
position, Co-Op said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
