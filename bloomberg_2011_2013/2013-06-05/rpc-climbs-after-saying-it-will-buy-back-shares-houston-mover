RPC Inc. (RES) , a provider of hydraulic
fracturing services, rose the most in more than eight months
after announcing plans to buy back more of its stock.  The shares gained 4.6 percent to $13.10 at the close in New
York, the most since Sept. 13.  The provider of pressure pumping that helps drillers unlock
oil and gas trapped in shale rock will buy back an additional 5
million shares, Atlanta-based RPC said today in a statement. The
buyback program doesn’t have an expiration date, RPC said.  “In this industry, if you’re not adding equipment, you’ve
got limited uses of your cash,” Trey Stolz, an analyst at
Iberia Capital Partners LLC in New Orleans said today in a phone
interview. He rates the shares at outperform, which means
investors should buy the stock, and owns none. “Some of these
companies feel strongly about the long-term potential and
inherent value.”  RPC had 1.2 million shares left to purchase under its
buyback program at the end of the first quarter, Jim Landers,
vice president of corporate finance, said today in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
