The home of Cleveland Indians All-Star relief pitcher  Chris Perez  was raided yesterday by law-enforcement authorities investigating a drug delivery, police
said. Perez wasn’t charged.  U.S. Postal Service investigative services, the Rocky
River, Ohio, Police Department and the Westshore Enforcement
Bureau Narcotics Unit searched the home, Rocky River Police
Chief Kelly Stillman said today in a news conference, according
to spokeswoman Julie Morron. The investigation continues and no
arrests or charges have been made.  Indians General Manager  Chris Antonetti  said today in an e-mailed statement that the team was aware of a situation
involving Perez, a 27-year-old right-hander. He didn’t give
specifics.  “We have talked with Chris and are currently in the
process of gathering additional information,” Antonetti said.  Nez Balelo, Perez’s agent, didn’t immediately return a
voice message seeking comment on the case.  Stillman said today that evidence was obtained from the
house that Perez and his wife are renting. He wasn’t specific on
the types of drugs involved.  An All-Star each of the past two seasons, Perez is 2-1 this
year with six saves and a career-high 4.32 earned-run average.
He has been on the disabled list since May 27 with a sore
pitching shoulder.  To contact the reporters on this story:
