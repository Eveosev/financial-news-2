Soybeans rose to the highest in seven
months on speculation that rising demand for soy-based  animal
feed  will deplete U.S. supplies before the harvest. Grains
declined on improving weather for world crops.  Since Oct. 1, U.S. sales of soybean meal, which accounts
for about 48 pounds (22 kilograms) of a 60-pound bushel of
soybeans, rose 34 percent to 9.065 million metric tons as of May
23, Department of Agriculture  data  show. Production last year
fell to the lowest since 2008 after the worst drought since the
1930s.  “Soybean meal is leading the rally in soybeans because
demand is reducing U.S. inventories,”  Roy Huckabay , an
executive vice president for the Linn Group in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “With rain-delayed U.S. planting, it
will take longer to get to the harvest. That means tighter
supplies ahead of the harvest to make soybean meal.”  Soybean futures for July delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
close at $15.32 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after earlier touching $15.49, the highest since Nov. 2.
July soybean-meal futures jumped 0.8 percent to $455.90 for
2,000 pounds. Earlier the price touched $462, the highest since
Nov. 9.  Corn Drops  Corn futures for delivery after the harvest fell for the
most in a month in  Chicago  on speculation that global supplies
following the next Northern Hemisphere harvest will be ample,
even after excess rain cut sowing in the U.S., the world’s
biggest grower and exporter.  U.S. farmers had yet to  plant  9 percent of corn crops in
the main growing areas as of June 2, the USDA said. Last year,
planting was complete by that time. The area sown may be 93.5
million acres, 3.9 percent less than the government’s forecast
in March, Morgan Stanley said June 3. That still would leave
production at a record 13.3 billion bushels, 23 percent larger
than last year’s drought-reduced crop, the bank said.  Corn futures for delivery in December retreated 1.9 percent
to $5.4225 a bushel, the biggest decline for a most-active
contract since May 6.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1.1 percent to $7.015
a bushel in Chicago, the first drop in four sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
