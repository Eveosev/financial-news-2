U.S.  ethanol production  rose 2.6
percent to 885,000 barrels a day last week, the highest level in
more than 11 months, according to Energy Information
Administration data.  Output rose to the most since June 15.  Stockpiles  increased
2.3 percent to 16.4 million barrels, rebounding from the lowest
level in 31 months in the biggest gain since Jan. 25, a report
from the Energy Departmentâ€™s analytical arm showed.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended May 31, down from 96
percent in the previous period, the least since Feb. 22. It was
the biggest weekly decline since Dec. 31, 2010.  The U.S. made no  foreign purchases  of the biofuel last
week, compared with 27,000 barrels a day during the prior seven
days, the report showed.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery slipped 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.665 a gallon at 10:52 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 33 percent in the
past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
