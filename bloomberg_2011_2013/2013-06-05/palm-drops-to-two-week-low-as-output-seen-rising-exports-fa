Palm oil  fell to the lowest in almost
two weeks after a survey showed that output in  Malaysia , the
world’s second-largest producer, climbed for a third straight
month in May and exports declined.  The contract for August delivery dropped as much as 0.5
percent to 2,364 ringgit ($768) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the lowest price for the most-active
futures since May 23, and ended the morning session at 2,368
ringgit. Palm for  physical  delivery in June was at 2,355 ringgit
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Output increased 4.6 percent to 1.43 million tons last
month, while  exports  declined 2 percent to 1.42 million tons,
the median of estimates from two plantation companies and three
analysts in a Bloomberg survey showed. Stockpiles dropped 3.5
percent to 1.86 million tons, the least since June 2012, the
survey showed. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board is scheduled to
release official data on June 10.  “The higher production in the coming months is of concern
to the market,” said Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and
commodities at RHB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The
uncertainty over demand may also worry the market.”  Output in Malaysia may advance to a record 19.4 million
tons this year after plantations in the main growing state of
Sabah received ample rain, Oil World said. Exports may be as
much as 18.8 million tons, up from 17.6 million tons last year,
the Hamburg-based researcher said yesterday.  Soybean oil  for July dropped 0.4 percent to 48.42 cents a
pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans fell 0.2
percent to $15.255 a bushel. Refined palm oil for September
delivery retreated 0.4 percent to 6,080 yuan ($992) a ton on the
 Dalian Commodity Exchange , while soybean oil was little changed
at 7,418  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
