Pitcher  Stephen Strasburg  was placed
on the 15-day disabled list with a back strain by the  Washington
Nationals , who lost 10-1 to the  New York Mets .  Marlon Byrd hit two home runs for the Mets and  David Wright 
added a third last night at Nationals Park.  Dillon Gee (4-6) allowed one run on nine hits and struck
out seven in seven innings for the Mets (23-33). Dan Haren (4-7)
surrendered five runs on seven hits in four innings for the
Nationals (29-30).  Strasburg sustained the injury at the  Atlanta Braves  on May
31, when he threw 37 pitches in two innings, the shortest outing
of his Major League Baseball career.  Strasburg is eligible to return on June 16. He was placed
on the disabled list, retroactive to June 1, after being unable
to pitch a bullpen session yesterday, the Nationals said on
their website.  Strasburg, who was due to start June 8 at home against the
 Minnesota Twins , is 3-5 with a 2.54 earned run average and 73
strikeouts in 74 1/3 innings this season.  The pitcher, who signed a record $15 million, four-year
contract in 2009, set a major league record with 41 strikeouts
in his first four starts in the 2010 season and went 5-3 with a
2.91 ERA and 92 strikeouts in 68 innings.  His career was interrupted by surgery on Sept. 4, 2010, to
replace a ligament in his throwing arm. He spent most of the
2011 season recovering from the surgery. Last year, he went 15-6
with a 3.16 ERA.  The Nationals are in third place in the National League
East, eight games behind the division-leading Braves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
