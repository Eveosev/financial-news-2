Counter-terrorism police are
investigating a fire at a Somali community center in north
London after graffiti naming the anti-Islamic English Defence
League was found on the building.  Emergency services were called to the fire, in the Muswell
Hill district of the city, at 3:23 a.m. today, the capital’s
Metropolitan Police said. The blaze caused “extensive damage”
to the center, which is used by Somali refugees.  “The cause of the fire is currently under investigation
and is being treated as suspicious at this stage,” the Met said
in an e-mailed statement. “Graffiti reading EDL has been found
on the building and police are investigating any potential
connection between the graffiti and the fire.”  The local police commander, Chief Superintendent Adrian
Usher, told reporters at the scene this afternoon that the
building was not in use as a mosque, contrary to earlier
descriptions. He said there was no indication of any explosion.
Television pictures showed the building’s roof had collapsed.  A woman was treated for minor injuries, which were not
caused by the fire, police said, without giving further details.  London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said he was shocked to learn of
the blaze. “There is no place in an open, tolerant and diverse
city like London for hate, for prejudice, for violence,” he
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
