Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT) , the  third-worst performing  Canadian oil and gas producer in the past year,
said Murray Nunns will step down as chief executive officer as
the company cuts costs and considers asset sales.  David Roberts , former chief operating officer of  Marathon
Oil Corp. (MRO) , will replace Nunns on June 19, Calgary-based Penn
West said late yesterday in a statement.  Penn West will seek to reduce expenses significantly,
considering asset sales and financing alternatives as part of a
review that should be completed by the end of the year,
according to the statement. It plans to start cutting staff
numbers by 10 percent in the next few weeks and will reduce its
dividend for the third quarter to 14 cents a share from 27 cents
a share.  “We will be looking for a huge step change in both where
capital is spent as well as the efficiency of each dollar
invested,” Chairman Rick George said in the statement.  Penn West kept its full-year production forecast unchanged.
Nunns will retire on July 1 and also resign from the board of
directors, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
