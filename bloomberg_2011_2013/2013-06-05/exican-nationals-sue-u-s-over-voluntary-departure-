Mexican nationals living in Southern
 California  are routinely pressured into “voluntary departure”
agreements denying them their right to an immigration hearing,
the American Civil Liberties Union said in a federal lawsuit.  The ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties sued U.S.
immigration authorities in federal court in Los Angeles
yesterday on behalf of seven Mexican nationals, seeking to
represent others in a class action, or group lawsuit. The ACLU
seeks a court order declaring the deportations of the seven
individuals and others were unlawful and allowing them to return
to the U.S.  “The policy and practice of misrepresenting an
individual’s legal rights to summarily deport them from this
country is inconsistent with the fundamental notions of fairness
and due process under our Constitution,” Anthony Stiegler, a
lawyer with Cooley LLP who also represents the plaintiffs, said
in an e-mailed statement.  The seven who sued, none of whom had a criminal background,
were given false information by immigration officers and
pressured into signing their own expulsion documents, according
to the complaint. The individuals thereby forfeited their right
to a hearing before an immigration judge who might have allowed
them to remain in the U.S.  Representatives of the Homeland Security Department’s media
office didn’t immediately respond yesterday to a call seeking
comment on the allegations.  The case is Lopez Venegas v. Napolitano, 13-3972, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
