The 6-bedroom, 8-bath duplex spans three apartment units and boasts views of Central Park South and Fifth Avenue, but Madonna had her eye on something bigger and better. She  put the apartment on the market in late 2012  after she chose to make a $32 million Georgian townhome her Manhattan home base. The duplex, a home she first bought as a single apartment in 1985 with ex-husband Sean Penn, was listed for $23.5 million and,  according to the Wall Street Journal , just sold for $19 million to a hedge-fund manager. During Madonna's time at the apartment, she wasn't the most beloved of neighbors. Other building residents complained of the Material Girl's  tendency to play music and dance too loudly , and one even filed a lawsuit, which Madonna settled. Clearly her time at the home was soured, and she moved out a year later. Her new townhome is likely a better soundproof option for the diva's dance parties. Madonna's former co-op, located at 41 Central Park West in the Harperley Hall building, measures a total of 6,000 square feet and was decorated by her brother, Christopher G. Ciccone. The apartment was described as Madonna's "low-key" New York hideout in a 2007 feature in  Architectural Digest . Low-key may not be the most accurate word for Madonna's former hangout — high-end may be a better fit. The house has "endless closet space," five wood-burning fireplaces, an elegant formal dining room overlooking the park and a chef's eat-in kitchen with windowed dining area. The home was listed by  Brown Harris Stevens agent Arabella Greene Buckworth . Madonna is also currently selling another property  — an enormous estate in Beverly Hills proper — listed at $22.5 million.
