Sales of gold and silver  coins  by the
 U.S. Mint  may rise to a record this year if demand continues to
remain at the current pace, according to Richard Peterson,
acting director of the mint.  “The demand remains at an unprecedented level,” Peterson
said today during an interview at the mint in  West Point , New
York. “People at the mint had to work overtime and sometimes
over the weekends to meet the increase in demand.”  Demand surged at mints from Australia to the U.K. and the
U.S. after gold futures in New York slumped 13 percent in two
days through April 15. Prices tumbled 7.8 percent in April and
dropped into a  bear market  as some investors lost faith in the
metal as a store of value. The U.S. mint suspended sales of
10th-of-an-ounce coin in April after sales more than doubled
from a year earlier.  The mint sold 209,500 ounces of gold in April, the most
since December 2009, and in May sold 70,000 ounces, according to
data on the website. Sales for silver coins reached an all-time
high in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
