IGPS Co., a renter of pallets
equipped with tracking technology, agreed to sell itself to a
group of funds and sought bankruptcy protection in  Delaware .  Balmoral Funds LLC, One Equity Partners and Jeff and Robert
Liebesman agreed to buy Orlando, Florida-based iGPS through a
joint venture called iGPS Logistics LLC, the company said
yesterday in a statement on Business Wire. IGPS Co. listed
assets and liabilities of as much as $500 million each in the
Chapter 11 filing in Wilmington, Delaware.  The sale is subject to higher and better bids and to court
approval, iGPS said. IGPS will continue operating without
interruption during the sale period, the company said in its
statement. Crystal Financial LLC agreed to provide interim
financing to allow the company to operate, iGPS said, without
elaborating on the amount.  “We determined that this sale of the company to iGPS
Logistics is the most advantageous option for iGPS’s customers,
employees, suppliers and other stakeholders,” Dick DiStasio,
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  The case is In re IPGS Company LLC. 13-11459. U.S.
Bankruptcy Court District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
