Germany 's government chose to receive
at least part of its dividend from  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  in cash 
this year, rather than shares, reducing money available for 
the phone company’s efforts to upgrade its network.  Germany’s  finance ministry , which holds 17 percent of
Deutsche Telekom shares, will take cash and not stock, it said
in an e-mailed statement today. The ministry said it couldn’t
say which option would be chosen by state-owned lender KfW,
which holds an additional 15 percent on behalf of the ministry.  Deutsche Telekom, which operates much of the backbone of
Germany’s phone and Internet grid, has budgeted 6 billion euros
($7.8 billion) to upgrade its German fixed-line Internet
connections while also joining  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and Telefonica
Deutschland Holding AG in rolling out the fast long term
evolution, or LTE, wireless technology.  The company, heir to Germany’s former federal postal
service, was mostly privatized in the 1990s yet Germany’s
government has opted not to reduce its stake further as the
 shares have lost  about a third of their value in the last 10
years. The operator had announced it would offer dividends in
kind during a strategy presentation in December.  Deutsche Telekom spokesman Andreas Fuchs said the company
plans to publish the aggregate outcome of the decision, which
stood open to all shareholders, early next week. The company’s
network investments are covered even without a cash retention,
he said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
