U.S. stock-index futures remained
lower after a private report showed employers added fewer jobs
than forecast in May.  Companies in the U.S. boosted employment by 135,000 workers
in May, figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research
Institute showed today. The median forecast of 40 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 165,000.
Estimates ranged from gains of 110,000 to 200,000.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring this month
lost 0.4 percent to 1,624.5 at 8:17 a.m. in New York.  The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent yesterday as economists at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG predicted the
Federal Reserve may begin to reduce its stimulus efforts as soon
as September.  The benchmark gauge has lost 2.3 percent from a record on
May 21 as investors weigh prospects for the central bank’s bond
purchases, which helped fuel a rally of as much as 147 percent
from the bear-market low in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
