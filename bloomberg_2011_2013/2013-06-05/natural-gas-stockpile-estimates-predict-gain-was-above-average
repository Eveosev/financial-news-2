Natural gas inventories rose by more
than the seasonal norm last week as mild weather limited fuel
use, according to  analyst forecasts  compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. stockpiles increased 99 billion cubic feet to 2.24
trillion in the seven days ended May 31, based on the median of
15  analyst estimates . The five-year average increase for the
period is 92 billion, Energy Information Administration data
show. Supplies expanded by 63 billion a year earlier.  The estimates range from increases of 87 billion to 110
billion cubic feet. The EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy
Department, is scheduled to release its weekly gas inventory
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  Mild weather covered most of the U.S. last week even as
temperatures rose to 90 and above in parts of the Northeast and
mid-Atlantic regions. Gas has stalled near $4 this week amid
milder weather.  “The bearish tint to the market is stemming from analyst
expectations that this injection will be the first triple-digit
injection of the season,”  Aaron Calder , senior market analyst
at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said in a note to clients
today. “If we do get another strong injection, it would be the
impetus the market needs to move lower after consolidating at
this level the last four days.”  Natural gas futures rose 1.4 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$4.012 per million British thermal units at 1:07 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 20 percent this year.  Gas supplies in the week ended May 24 were 3.9 percent
 below  the five-year average, unchanged from the previous week,
according to the EIA. A  deficit  versus year-earlier levels
narrowed for a seventh week to 23.7 percent from 24.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
