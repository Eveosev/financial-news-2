Royal Dutch Shell Plc  Chief Executive
Officer  Peter Voser  said Europe needs to extend its targets for
curbing greenhouse gases and promoting renewable energy by a
decade through 2030.  “To actually change things you need time and we are a
little bit concerned if you have a short-term target,” Voser
told reporters today in London. “We favor one target, which
sets action with greenhouse gas.”  The European Union has a binding target to cut greenhouse
gases by 20 percent compared with 1990 levels, increase the
share of renewable energy to an average of 20 percent and a goal
of boosting energy efficiency by one-fifth in 2020. The European
Commission said in March a framework for the decade after 2020
is needed to give investors legal certainty, spur innovation and
prepare for a global climate deal.  “We are favoring one target versus three targets,” Voser
said. Europe needs “to take a longer term view and have one
goal.”  Voser expects energy suppliers and consumers to develop
“the right energy mix” where carbon sequestration, renewables
and gas will all play a “major role.”  The EU’s regulatory arm in March began a debate to
establish a framework for renewables, energy efficiency and
greenhouse-gas curtailment targets for 2030.  Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, is working on carbon
capture and storage and biofuel projects in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
