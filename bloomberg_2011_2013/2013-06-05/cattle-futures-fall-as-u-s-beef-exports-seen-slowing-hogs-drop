Cattle futures declined for the
second time this week on speculation that export demand for U.S.
beef is slowing. Hog prices fell from a 11-month high.  Wholesale beef  dropped yesterday to a three-week low of
$2.0529 a pound, down 2.9 percent since May 23, when prices
reached the highest on record going back to January 2004, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Exports this year probably
will drop 2 percent to 2.4 billion pounds, the USDA said last
month.  “The big difference in the last six months is exports have
pretty much been non-existent or a lot slower pace than a year
ago,”  Dick Quiter , an account executive at McFarland
Commodities LLC, said in a telephone interview from Chicago.  Cattle futures for August delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$1.19425 a pound at 10:39 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices through yesterday were down 9.2 percent this
year.  Hog futures for July settlement fell 0.3 percent to 94.425
cents a pound on the CME, after reaching 95 cents, the highest
for a most-active contract since July 3.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 0.3
percent to $1.45125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
