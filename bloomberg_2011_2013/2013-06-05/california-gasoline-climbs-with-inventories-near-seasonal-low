Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  gained
as inventories hovered near a 10-year seasonal low and after
 Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  announced flaring for the next week at its Carson
refinery, which was said to be planning a coker shutdown.  Total gasoline inventories in the U.S. West rose 176,000
barrels last week to 27 million, 7.7 percent below the seasonal
average, data released today by the Energy Information
Administration show.  Tesoro announced flaring in the coming week at the 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson plant, the second largest in  California ,
where the company planned to repair the coker and the mid-barrel
unit in the first week of June, according to two people with
knowledge of the schedule. Cokers use thermal processing to
convert heavy streams into products such as naphtha and heating
oil.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles gained
2.5 cents to 6.75 cents a gallon above Nymex gasoline futures,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 4:07 p.m. New York
time. Carbob in  San Francisco  strengthened 2.75 cents to a
premium of 8.5 cents a gallon.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco gained 3
cents to a 1 cent-a-gallon premium against ultra-low-sulfur
diesel futures. The fuel in Los Angeles rose 0.5 cent to a
premium of 3 cents a gallon.  Conventional gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , was unchanged at
parity versus futures. Low-sulfur diesel  there  gained 1 cent
against ULSD futures to a discount of 8 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened, gained 34
cents to $20.54 a barrel at 4:09 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
