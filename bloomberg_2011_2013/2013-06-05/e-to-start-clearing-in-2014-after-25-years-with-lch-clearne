The London Metal Exchange, the
world’s largest metals marketplace, will move to its own
clearing platform on Sept. 22, 2014, after 25 years with
LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd.,  Europe ’s biggest clearinghouse.  The LME and LCH.Clearnet agreed on a plan to make the
switch, the two companies said in a joint statement today. The
LME is building its own clearinghouse to boost revenue and
introduce new products.  “LME Clear and LCH.Clearnet have worked together to plan a
controlled, efficient migration of services to the LME’s new
clearing service,” said Trevor Spanner, managing director of
post trade services at LME Clear. “Ensuring continued market
stability and minimizing disruption for members were driving
principles behind our planning.”  Clearinghouses stand between buyers and sellers to reduce
the risk of default and have become more valuable as regulators
seek to increase central clearing of derivatives. Hong Kong
Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which bought the LME last year for
1.39 billion pounds ($2.1 billion), is helping to build the
clearinghouse. The LME handled $14.5 trillion of metals
contracts from aluminum to tin last year.  LCH.Clearnet this month tripled a fee levied on LME
contracts. The registration fee rose to 15 pence (23 U.S. cents)
a contract from 5 pence as of June 1 for clearing members of the
LME, London-based LCH.Clearnet said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
