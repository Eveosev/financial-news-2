Russian stocks declined as OAO
Russian Grids, the nation’s largest electricity distribution
company, and its unit Federal Grid Co. dropped on concern a plan
to boost investments will curb free cash flows.  Federal Grid,  Russia ’s monopoly for high-voltage power
transmission, declined 6.1 percent to 10.476 kopeks, the lowest
since April 24. The power company is seeking to raise its
investment program to 200 billion rubles ($6.2 billion) a year,
Chief Executive Officer Oleg Budargin said yesterday. He also
proposed increasing Russian Grids’ program to 250 billion rubles
a year. The stock sank 4.5 percent to 1.085 rubles.  “The market is reacting negatively to Budargin’s
comments,” Sergey Beiden, an analyst at Otkritie Financial
Corp. in Moscow, said by phone. “We’re very likely to see much
lower tariff growth. An increase in the investment program and a
drop in tariffs will lead to the lack of balance in the
investment plan,” and the companies would probably have to tap
the bond markets, increasing their debt burdens, Beiden said.  The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  decreased 1 percent to 1,328.35
by 2:42 p.m. in Moscow. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$) 
retreated 1.6 percent to 1,301.83, 20 percent lower than this
year’s high. Utilities lost 2.2 percent on average, the biggest
decline among sector group on the benchmark. The Russian May
Services PMI index fell to 51.4 from 53 in April, missing
estimates, data from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
show.  Federal Grid’s investment plans may lead to a 50 percent
increase in  debt  between 2014 and 2016, cutting its free cash
flow, VTB Capital said in an e-mailed note today.  Inflation Accelerates  Inflation accelerated for a second month in May to the
fastest pace in 21 months, limiting the central bank’s scope to
cut interest rates, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow
said yesterday.  Russia’s economy will probably expand 2.3 percent in the
second quarter, according to the median estimate of 9 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. That’s less than the 2.5 percent forecast
a month earlier.  The nation’s economy grew at the weakest pace since 2009 in
the first quarter as the euro area’s longest recession hurt the
demand for commodity exports, federal data showed on May 17.
Russia’s central bank kept its refinancing  rate  on hold for an
eighth month in May.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest coking coal producer, fell for
the sixth day, dropping 6.7 percent to 90.9 rubles, the lowest
intraday level since January 2009.  Crude Rises  Crude oil increased 0.3 percent to $93.62 in New York as an
industry report showed U.S. inventories dropped the most since
December. Brent oil advanced 0.1 percent to $103.34 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Urals crude ,
Russia’s major export blend, climbed 0.1 percent to $102.97.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 5.2 percent
below the gauge’s 30-day average, while 10-day price swings
plunged to 18.1, the weakest since May 21.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has dropped 9.9
percent this year, compared with a multiple of 10.3 for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index, which has retreated 5.5 percent.  The Russian Volatility Index rose 4.8 percent to 28.45
today. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. fell 1 percent to 87.17 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
