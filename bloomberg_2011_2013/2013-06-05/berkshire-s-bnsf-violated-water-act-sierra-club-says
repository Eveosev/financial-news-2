Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s BNSF
Railway Co. and five other coal shippers were sued by the Sierra
Club over claims they discharge coal into Puget Sound and other
waterways in violation of the U.S. Clean Water Act.  The Sierra Club said in the complaint filed in federal
court in Seattle that coal chunks, coal dust and other
byproducts of coal are emitted into water around the city and
throughout  Washington  state.  BNSF, acquired by billionaire  Warren Buffett ’s Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire in 2010, crosses waterways while
transporting coal in rail cars from the Powder River Basin
through central and southern Washington to locations in
Washington and sometimes into  Canada , the Sierra Club and other
groups said in the complaint filed yesterday.  “Sierra Club’s lawsuit is meritless and nothing more than
a publicity stunt meant to stop the permitting of multicommodity
export terminals in the Pacific Northwest,” Suann Lundsberg, a
BNSF spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “BNSF has safely hauled
coal in Washington for decades and is committed to preventing
coal dust from escaping while in transit.”  The groups seek a court order prohibiting the company from
using uncovered rail cars to carry coal and asked that it pay
civil penalties and remediation costs and other damages.  The case is Sierra Club Inc. v. BNSF Railway Co., 13-cv-00967, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington
( Seattle ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
