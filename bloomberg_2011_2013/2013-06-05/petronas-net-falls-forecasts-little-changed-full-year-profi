Petroliam Nasional Bhd.,  Malaysia ’s
state oil company, said first-quarter profit declined 2.7
percent and full-year earnings will probably be little changed
from the previous 12 months.  Net income fell to 20.37 billion ringgit ($6.6 billion) in
the three months ended March 31 from 20.94 billion ringgit a
year earlier, the company known as  Petronas  said in a statement
in Kuala Lumpur, where it is based. Revenue rose 1.9 percent to
76.68 billion ringgit.  “We expect earnings this year to be almost the same number
as in 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Shamsul Azhar Abbas told
reporters today in Kuala Lumpur.  Oil futures in New York averaged 8.4 percent lower at
$94.36 in the first quarter, compared with $103.03 a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Crude oil
closed yesterday 4.7 percent below this year’s highest
settlement of $97.94 a barrel. Prices will probably range from
$95 to $100 per barrel by the end of this year, Shamsul said.  “Global economic uncertainties are expected to lead to
continued volatility in oil prices and global oil demand, which
may affect Petronas Group’s performance,” the company said
today in a statement.  Brazil Blocks  Petronas agreed last month to buy a 40 percent stake in two
blocks in the offshore Tubarao Martelo field, located in the
Campos Basin, from Brazilian oil producer OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA. The $850 million acquisition marked its first
entry into exploration and production in the South American
nation and followed a C$5.2 billion ($5 billion) deal last year
to take over Canada’s Progress Energy Resources Corp.  In June 2011, Petronas announced plans to spend a record
300 billion ringgit over five years to replenish Malaysia’s
maturing reserves and counter mounting exploration costs. It has
stepped up offshore drilling with local and overseas partners,
including  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)   Petronas will consider acquisitions in  Africa  as it’s
always on the lookout for opportunities, Shamsul said.  Malaysia, Southeast Asia’s biggest oil and gas producer
after  Indonesia , saw total production for the quarter rise to
2.16 million barrels of oil equivalent a day from 2.11 million a
day a year earlier, Petronas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
