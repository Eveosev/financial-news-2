Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors LP told employees it plans to stay open for outside investors after significant client redemptions, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  SAC President Tom Conheeney, in a June 4 e-mail to employees, said the firm doesn’t plan to release a number for the redemptions, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the communication is private. SAC doesn’t plan significant staff reductions, Conheeney wrote, according to the people.  SAC employees had expected that clients, who faced a June 3 deadline to put in withdrawal notices for the second quarter, would take back most of the $4 billion they haven’t already marked for redemptions by early next year, according to people familiar with the firm. Investors are exiting as the U.S. government intensifies its probe of insider trading at the  Stamford , Connecticut-based firm, once one of the best in the industry, with returns averaging 25 percent since 1992.  “Cohen is taking a defiant stance that will make the government more determined to pursue charges and more difficult for Cohen to settle if the heats get too high,” said  Erik Gordon , a business and law professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  SAC oversaw $6 billion for outsiders at the start of this year. Founder Cohen has about $7.5 billion in SAC’s funds and employees account for $1.5 billion of assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cohen’s Personality  Despite the redemptions, SAC still has a stable capital base and has been performing well this year, Conheeney wrote, according to the people. Some key investors have told the firm they may reconsider their redemption requests once they have greater clarity of legal issues surrounding the firm, Conheeney told employees. If the firm were to end the year near the asset level of four years ago, it would still be a good-sized hedge fund, according to the letter.  A spokesman for SAC declined to comment on the e-mail.  The mood at the red-brick headquarters has darkened in recent weeks after Cohen and the other employees were subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury. Some workers have started putting out feelers for new jobs, and Cohen has reduced his own trading to the lower end of his normal $2 billion to $3 billion range to spend time with lawyers, said people with knowledge of the firm.  While it would be a logical step for Cohen to focus on managing his own wealth, two people who know Cohen said his decision not to throw in the towel is in keeping with his personality. Cohen doesn’t want to let the government get the best of him and is seeking to defend a reputation as one of the most successful hedge-fund managers ever, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private.  Reinsurance Money  Cohen’s desire to continue as clients flee isn’t completely unrealistic. A few investors have called SAC asking to put money into its funds, according to two people familiar with the situation. In addition, SAC raised $500 million last year for a reinsurance company that can invest in its hedge funds.  Cohen has previously discussed closing his firm to outside clients as part of a deal he was willing to offer the government. Under a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, the firm would admit to wrongdoing, close down and pay a fine in order to avoid prosecution, a person familiar with his thinking said last month.  The scrutiny on Cohen and his firm grew in November when former portfolio manager Mathew Martoma was charged in what U.S. prosecutors called the biggest insider-trading scheme in history. It was the first time the SAC founder was directly linked to trades that allegedly used inside information.  Facing Deadlines  The five-year statute of limitations covering the 2008 trades, in which SAC netted $276 million in profits and averted losses from alleged inside information concerning a drug trial, expires in late July. Cohen hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing. Martoma has pleaded not guilty and awaits trial.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which won a record $602 million civil settlement with SAC over the trades in March, also must move by July if it decides to sue Cohen personally.  After Cohen was subpoenaed, SAC told clients in a May 17 letter that it was no longer cooperating unconditionally with the government, news that prompted many clients who had supported the firm through the government’s multiyear investigation to put in withdrawal notices.
