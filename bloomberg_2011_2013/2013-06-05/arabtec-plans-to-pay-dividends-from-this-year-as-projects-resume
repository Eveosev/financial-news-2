Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  plans to pay
dividend from this year after skipping it in 2012 as the
company, which helped build the world’s tallest tower in Dubai,
starts work on projects in the  Middle East .  Arabtec will pay at least a 10 percent  dividend  a year from
2013, the Dubai-based the company said in a statement to the
local stock market today. The shares have a par value of 1
dirham and a 10 percent payout would equal 10 fils a share,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are now starting work on several major projects, so
the company should see a positive impact on earnings toward the
end of the year,” Chief Executive Office Hasan Ismaik said in
the statement. “The company is in a very strong position to
leverage an extended period of increased activity across the
region.”  Construction work in  Abu Dhabi  and Dubai, whose economy is
underpinned by property, transport and trade industries, is
reviving after the global credit crisis led to the suspension of
real-estate projects. Arabtec today said it won the main
construction contract of an 810 million-dirham ($221 million)
hotel and apartment project in Dubai.  Arabtec’s board  recommended  no dividend for 2012. The
 shares  have gained 11 percent this year, compared with a surge
of 47 percent for the benchmark DFM General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
