CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
U.S. television network, promoted Chief Financial Officer Joe Ianniello to the newly created post of chief operating officer,
elevating Les Moonves’s top lieutenant.  Ianniello, 45, will continue to manage the company’s
financial operations while taking on new responsibilities as its
COO. He joined CBS when it split off from parent company  Viacom
Inc. (VIAB)  in 2006 and was named CFO three years later.  “Joe’s role in CBS’s success these past several years has
been extraordinary,” Moonves, the company’s 63-year-old chief
executive officer, said in a statement today announcing the
appointment. “I am proud to promote Joe to this new position,
which not only recognizes the many contributions he has already
made, but sets him up for all the great work yet to be done.”  Ianniello has had a big hand in helping to expand CBS’s
revenue through higher licensing fees for its programming from
pay-TV operators. Those payments, called retransmission revenue,
rose 62 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  The network has also benefited from licensing older seasons
of current shows such as “The Good Wife” to streaming-video
outlets like Amazon.com and Hulu LLC. Advertising in the most
recent quarter rose 8 percent, fueled by the Super Bowl.  According to company filings, Moonves’s employment
agreement ends in the middle of 2017, when he will be 67.  CBS fell 1.8 percent to $48.22 at the close in New York.
The shares have gained 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
