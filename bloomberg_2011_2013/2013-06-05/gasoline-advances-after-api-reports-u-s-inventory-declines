Gasoline futures maintained gains
after the Energy Information Administration reported that
inventories fell and imports declined last week. Crack spreads
widened.  Futures rose as gasoline  supplies  dropped 366,000 barrels
to 218.8 million in the week ended May 31. Inventories in PADD
1, which includes New York Harbor, delivery point for the Nymex
contract, slid 1.83 million barrels to a six-week low. Imports
fell 17 percent.  “PADD 1 is definitely supportive of gasoline and there is
lower imports,” said  Amrita Sen , chief oil market strategist at
Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in London.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 2.76 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.8458 a gallon at 12:49 p.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume for all contracts was 36 percent below
the 100-day average for the time of day.  July gasoline’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
widened 67 cents to $25.72 a barrel. Gasoline’s  premium  over
Brent gained 68 cents to $15.80.  Inventories of the motor fuel in PADD 3, or the Gulf Coast
region, home to 45 percent of U.S. operable refining capacity,
rose 1 million barrels to 77 million, the highest level since
the week ended Feb. 15.  Refinery inputs  and  production of
gasoline  jumped to the highest levels this year.  “Going forward you will see short bursts of price
support,” Sen said. “But there are troubling signs for the
future. Runs are very high in the U.S. and look at PADD 3
gasoline supplies.”  Gasoline Demand  Demand , measured as wholesale deliveries, fell 134,000
barrels to 8.82 million barrels a day. Demand over the past four
weeks was 0.8 percent lower than a year earlier. The EIA
estimated that  gasoline exports  were 308,000 barrels a day, down
from 411,000 a year earlier.  “Demand is showing some signs of life,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New
York. “For the market to sustain the upside, it’s going to have
to be demand-led. Runs and gasoline production are going to be
high. You will need good export demand to keep inventory levels
from getting sloppy.”  Distillate stockpiles , including diesel and heating oil,
rose 2.61 million barrels to 123.3 million, the highest level
since Feb. 22. Demand fell 1.7 percent to an average 3.75
million barrels a day. Measured over four weeks,  demand  was 6
percent above a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for July delivery rose 1.01 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.875 a gallon on trading volume that was
7.4 percent below the 100-day average.  The July ULSD contract’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude oil narrowed 11 cents to $26.91 a barrel,
while the  premium over Brent  slipped 10 cents to $16.99.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2 cent to
$3.617 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices
are 4.7 cents above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
