Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., the
worldâ€™s largest solar-panel manufacturer, signed a $100 million
supply and power plant agreement with  DuPont Co. (DD)   The largest U.S. chemical company by market value will sell
metalization paste that increases solar-cell performance and
polyvinyl fluoride film to protect panels, Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont said today in a statement.  The deal includes plans for Yingli to build a solar power
plant at a DuPont facility in China, with the potential for
other projects. It expands on a $100 million agreement signed in
February 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
