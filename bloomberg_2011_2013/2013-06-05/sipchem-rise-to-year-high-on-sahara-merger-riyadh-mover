Saudi International Petrochemical Co. 
advanced the most in more than a year as it studies a merger
with  Sahara Petrochemical Co .  Sipchem, as Saudi International is known, gained 2.7
percent to 23.1 riyals, the highest since April 2012, at the
3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The stock was the  fourth-biggest
gainer  on the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index, which advanced
0.5 percent. Sahara advanced 2 percent, the most since May 14,
to 15.3 riyals. The shares have increased 13 percent this year,
while Sipchem has climbed 21 percent.  The company said yesterday it will start a five-month
feasibility study on a merger. With a market value of 8.47
billion riyals ($2.26 billion) and Sahara’s 6.7 billion riyals,
the combination would be the nation’s largest deal in two years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There are cost and integration efficiencies that can be
achieved by the merger,”  Muhammad Faisal Potrik , an analyst at
Riyad Capital, said in an e-mail. “It remains to be seen how
the value created will be distributed among the existing
shareholders of both companies.”  Seven  analysts  have a buy rating on Sipchem while four
recommend investors hold the shares. One analyst advises
investors buy Sahara shares, six  recommend  hold and one
recommends sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
