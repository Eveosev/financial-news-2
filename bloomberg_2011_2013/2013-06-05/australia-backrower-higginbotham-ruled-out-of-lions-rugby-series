Australia back-row forward  Scott
Higginbotham  will miss the three-Test series against the British
and Irish Lions after being ruled out of rugby for the rest of
the year, the Wallabies said.  Higginbotham, who has played 23 Tests since his debut
against France in 2010, dislocated his right shoulder four days
ago making a tackle during his Melbourne Rebels team’s Super
Rugby loss to the  Queensland Reds .  Scans revealed extensive ligament damage that requires a
full shoulder reconstruction, the Wallabies said today in an e-mailed statement. The rehabilitation timeframe is such that
Higginbotham isn’t expected to be fit to return to play until
the start of Super Rugby next year, the team added.  Higginbotham had scored six tries for the Rebels in this
year’s competition, the most by a forward.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
