Poland ’s currency remained weaker
after the country’s central bank lowered  interest rates  by 25
basis points to boost a slowing economy, matching expectations
of a majority of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The zloty depreciated 0.2 percent to 4.2439 against the
euro at 3:18 p.m. in Warsaw. The currency rallied in the
previous three days from an almost one-year low. The  yield  on
Poland’s two-year note rose one basis point to 2.68 percent, 18
basis points above a record-low reached on May 14.  The Monetary Policy Council has cut  rates  by 200 basis
points in seven months as the European Union’s largest eastern
economy is set for the slowest growth in more than a decade and
inflation slowed to a seven-year low. The quarter-point
reduction was forecast by 38 out of 40 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. A press conference on the rate panel’s decision is
scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. local time.  The central bank’s move “reinforces concerns about the
sluggish pace of economic growth” and “below-target inflation
means that there is scope for further rate cuts over the coming
months,”  William Jackson , a London-based  emerging markets 
economist at  Capital Economics , wrote in a note today after the
decision was announced.  Overnight index swaps show there is an 82 percent chance
Poland’s central bank will cut rates by another 25 basis points
at its next meeting on July 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
