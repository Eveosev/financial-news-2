The era of corporate excess is over. Client dining is not.  This isn’t about frugality; it’s more about restraint. So if your company’s paying, consider the following venues for more judicious ways to wine and dine. (For a closer look into more New York venues, visit this  slideshow .)  1. Ai Fiori: 400 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-613-8660;  http://www.aifiorinyc.com .  What: French-Italian.  Why: Because Michael White, one of our leading Italian chefs, can crank out some solid truffled-lobster bisque and other Southern French hotel dishes.  Where: The Setai Fifth Avenue.  When: You need a quiet place near the Empire State Building. Four courses are $92; the tasting menu is $130. Sunday pasta menus are $72.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: Around 12-32 people.

Why: Chef  Eric Ripert  has turned his once-stodgy dining room into one of New York’s most attractive and comfortable places to eat seafood.  Where: Midtown West.  When: You’re with clients who have astute palates;  Le Bernardin ’s fare can be so subtle you sometimes need to close your eyes to appreciate it. Smart diners will splurge for the $45 osetra caviar supplement as Ripert’s roe, firm and coral-hued, is among New York’s tops. Dinner menus run $130-$195.  Bar: Yes, full menu served.  Private Room: Will accommodate up to 200 after expansion.  Sound level: Hushed but convivial.  3. Blanca: 261 Moore St., Bushwick. Information: +1-347-799-2807 or  http://www.blancanyc.com/ .  What: 25-plus courses of American, Italian, Japanese fare.  Why: Chef Carlo Mirarchi is a master at concentrating and economizing flavors. Nduja raviolo, a spicy one-bite course, explodes on the palate like a firecracker.  Where: In a converted garage, for $180 per person.  When: You want a tasting menu that doesn’t leave you painfully full.  Bar: The restaurant is a bar, with cushy captain’s chairs.  Private Room: No, but Blanca is available for buyouts.  Sound Level: Pleasant.  4. Briskettown: 359 Bedford Ave, Williamsburg. Information: +1-718-701-8909 or  http://delaneybbq.com   What: Beef barbecue: Low, smoky and slow.  Why: Daniel Delaney serves solid brisket and rocking beef ribs ($21), with as much flavor as dry-aged meat.  Where: South Williamsburg, near Peter Luger.  When: You want to show an out-of-town client that New York’s barbecue renaissance is going strong.  Private Room: No.  Sound Level: Just people eating meat.  5. Brushstroke: 30 Hudson St. Information: +1-212-791-3771;  http://www.davidbouley.com .  What: Japanese  kaiseki , via  David Bouley  and company.  Why: You want multi-course odes to the pristine cuisine of Kyoto, with occasional hat tips to Germany and France.  Where: Tribeca.  When: You need (relatively) affordable kaiseki. The tastings start at $85 and can exceed $300 with supplements.  Bar: Sushi bar; omakase starts around $150-$160.  Private Room: No, but larger groups can be accommodated.  Sound level: Lively.  6. Corton: 239 West Broadway. Information: +1-212-219-2777;  http://www.cortonnyc.com .  What: Fancy, fussy,  four-star  French fare.  Why: Paul Liebrandt has turned his tasting-menu spot into one of New York’s first-rate restaurants, doling out whimsical creations like striped jack with cotton candy. Sure, Eleven Madison Park is great. But Corton is better.  Sommelier Orr Reches can put together personalized by-the-glass pours to meet your budget.  Where: Tribeca.  When: You want four-star fare at non-Per Se prices. Corton charges $125-$155 for its tasting menus.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound level: Reverent.  7. Costata: 206 Spring St. Information: +1-212-334-3320 or  http://costatanyc.com/ .  What: Michael White’s first steakhouse.  Why: Because you want a chef with multiple Michelin stars overseeing your $116 porterhouse. White, New York’s foremost pasta chef, also serves his fine carbo-creations here, all for $21 or less each. Try the linguine with clams. Eben Freeman stirs a frosty Martini.  Where: The old Fiamma space in Soho.  When: Whenever you want a mind-altering ribeye, a dry-aged hunk of meat with notes of liver and blue cheese ($55). Refined carnivores should skip the bland, bone-in strip.  Bar: Yes, full menu.  Private Room: Yes, up to 60 guests.  Sound Level: Just right for conversation.  8. Craft: 43 E. 19th St. Information: +1-212-780-0880;  http://www.craftrestaurant.com .  What: Haute-barnyard American.  Why:  Tom Colicchio ’s flagship is still one of New York’s finest (and most attractive) American restaurants. Expect simple, straightforward preparations like pork trotter topped with a farm egg ($18) and simply roasted maitake mushrooms ($16).  Where: Gramercy Park.  When: You want to take the fuss out of fine dining.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: A secluded space has a separate entrance. Seats up to 40 or so.  Sound level: Bustling.  9. Dovetail: 103 W. 77th St. Information: +1-212-362-3800;  http://dovetailnyc.com .  What: An emphasis on vegetables, without being entirely vegetarian. Sunchokes might be your main course, but they’ll be fortified with bone marrow. Don’t worry, there’s steak too.  Why: Chef John Fraser’s Michelin-starred fare is often overlooked by the city’s culinary cognoscenti.  Where: Upper West Side.  When: You need ambitious, affordable menus ($52-$132). If only the mediocre service kept pace with the ambitious food.  Private Room: Semi-private, up to 21 seated.  Sound level: A bit noisy when full.  10. Empellon Cocina: 105 First Ave. Information: +1-212-780-0999 or  http://empellon.com/ .  What: Mexican small plates and tacos.  Why: Alex Stupak, previously one of this country’s most ambitious pastry chefs ( Alinea ,  WD-50 ), has transformed himself into one of New York’s primary Mexican chefs. Barman Matt Resler will make sure you drink well; the yuzu margarita cools when things get too spicy.  When: You’re hungry for umami-rich chicken confit and spinach tacos ($12), or heady sea urchin guacamole ($24).  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound Level: Quite tolerable due to sound-proofing.  11. 15 East: 15 E. 15th St. Information: +1-212-647-0015;  http://www.15eastrestaurant.com .  What: Sashimi, sushi, sake.  Why: Because there are no second-string chefs for omakase, like at other sushi spots. If you sit at the bar, Chef Masato Shimizu will serve you himself. His fish is never too cold; rice, never too warm. The warm bluefin tuna neck is perfect.  When: You don’t want a $1,000-plus experience like at Masa or Kuruma Zushi. Meals rarely exceeds $200 for one before tip.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound level: Buzzy.  12. Kin Shop: 469 Sixth Ave. Information: +1-212-675-4295;  http://www.kinshopnyc.com .  What: Thai, through a French-American-Long Island lens.  Why: Pok Pok is more of a true Southeast-Asian experience, but that Red Hook joint doesn’t take American Express. At Kin Shop,  Harold Dieterle ’s fried chicken and red-curry duck make an equally delicious case for Thai, in a Manhattan-friendly way.  Where: Greenwich Village.  When: You want to subject a first-year associate to some spicy culinary hazing. The duck-larb salad, a mix of ground meat, mint, fish sauce, lime and chilies, is incendiary.  Bar: Chef’s counter plus bar, full menu.  Private Room: No.  Sound level: Shouty when full.  13. Mission Chinese: 154 Orchard St. Information: +1-212-529-8800 or  http://missionchinesefood.com/ .  What: “ Americanized Oriental food .” All dishes under $20.  Why: Chef Danny Bowien donates a portion of his sales to the Food Bank for New York (so far, $41,550).  When: You’re prepared for the Novocain-strength numbing power of Chongqing chicken wings, fried tripe and mapo tofu. Waits are long but limited reservations are  available online .  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound Level: Just right for conversation.  14. North End Grill: 104 North End Ave. Information: +1-646-747-1600 or  http://northendgrillnyc.com/ .  What: American with French-Indian influences.  Why: Chef Floyd Cardoz (late of Tabla) serves a mean clam pizza, loaded with fragrant cilantro and briny bivalves ($21).  When: You’re finishing up a visit to Goldman Sachs next door and are craving a perfect omelet with heady lobster jus.  Bar: Yes, with more than 100 Scotches by the glass.  Private Room: Yes, up to 12 people with $1,200 minimum.  Sound Level: Noisy in the lounge, quieter in back.  15. Perla: 24 Minetta Lane. Information: +1-212-933-1824 or  http://perlanyc.com .  What: Italian, sometimes with offal.  Why: Because owner Gabe Stulman is a master of service. And Michael Toscano ranks near  Mario Batali  and Michael White as one of our unrivaled pasta chefs.  When: You’re in the mood for stellar tomato-tripe bucatini ($19), ribeye for two ($95) or veal head for three ($85).  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound Level: Jay-Z on the jukebox but never too noisy.  16. Prime Meats: 465 Court Street, Brooklyn. Information: +1-718-254-0327 or  http://www.frankspm.com/ .  What: American steaks at an Austro-Germanic brasserie.  Why: Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo’s bastion of beef has improved over the years, with musky dry-aged steak sausage ($16) and a solid Wagyu frites ($30).  When: You’re entertaining clients in Brooklyn.  Bar: Standing-only. That’s how to eat bratwurst.  Private Room: Private space next door at Frankies 457.  Sound Level: Always respectable.  17. Riverpark: 450 E. 29th St. Information: +1-212-729-9790 or  http://www.riverparknyc.com/ .  What: American fine dining in between Bellevue and New York University hospitals.  Why: Tom Colicchio and Sisha Ortuzar continue to wow us with elegant mushroom consomme and casual fish tacos.  When: You’re craving lamb ragu after meeting with ImClone’s biotech professionals (in the same building).  Bar: Yes, full menu.  Private Room: Yes, can seat up to 160.  Sound Level: Very quiet.  18. Tulsi: 211 E. 46th St. Information: +1-212-888-0820 or  http://tulsinyc.com/ .  What: One of our city’s unrivaled Indian restaurants.  Why:  Tulsi’s  tasting menus are absurdly affordable, $65 for seven courses (vegetarian or with meat).  Where: Midtown East, across from Sparks.  When: You’re craving goat rogan josh, redolent of cinnamon, cardamom and Kashmiri chilies.  Private Room: No.  Sound Level: Quiet.  19. Tertulia: 359 Sixth Ave. Information: +1-646-559-9909 or  http://tertulianyc.com/ .  What: Spanish meats, sherry and Iberico ham.  Why: Seamus Mullen serves one of the city’s choicest steaks ($92), packed with charcoal-grilled, dry-aged flavor. He also serves a fine paella ($38).  This is all meant to be paired with one of the city’s finest selection of sherries, which range from $8 for a La Guita Manzanilla to $29 for a powerfully complex La Bota de Palo Cortado.  Where: Greenwich Village.  When: You want to splurge on a $36 jamon Iberico starter, loaded with silky fat and the aroma of sweet coconuts.  Private Room: No, but large parties accommodated.  Sound Level: Bustling like a brasserie.  20. Torrisi Italian Specialties: 250 Mulberry St. Information: +1-212-254-3000;  http://www.torrisinyc.com/ . Carbone: 181 Thompson St. Information:  http://carbonenewyork.com/ .  What: The city’s greatest Italian-American fare.  Torrisi  serves a creative, forward-looking tasting menu ($75), while  Carbone  gets nostalgic with spicy rigatoni a la vodka and other expensive ($14-$140) a la carte dishes.  Why: Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone have elevated Italian-American fare from an ethnic cuisine to a fine-dining cuisine, on par with the best French and Italian fare.  Where: Nolita and Greenwich Village.  When: Torrisi is for closers. Carbone, with its 1950s rock music and killer cocktails, is for a more raucous night out.  Bar: Yes at Carbone, but standing-only.  Private Room: Not at Torrisi, where buyouts range from $8,000-$10,000 at dinner, or $3,000 at lunch. Private to semi-private events at Carbone run around $250 per person.  Sound level: Convivial at Torrisi, louder at Carbone.  ( Ryan Sutton  reviews restaurants for Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed are his own.)
