Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest airline, raised its estimate for potential
 earnings  from its efficiency program by 300 million euro ($393
million).  The company’s combined 2,500 projects under a program
dubbed “Score” have the potential to contribute 2.71 billion
euros to operating profit over three years, up from 2.41 billion
euros a month ago, the company said in a  presentation  today on
its website.  Lufthansa plans to increase operating profit by 1.5 billion
euros by 2015 through the program in an effort to generate
enough funds to buy more fuel-efficient planes and new seats as
it competes with Gulf carriers boasting fleets with about half
the average age of Lufthansa’s.  The plan targets 740 million euros in gross earnings
contribution this year, while Lufthansa at the end of April had
identified projects that may be able to provide 954 million
euros. That compares with an estimate for 900 million euros on
May 14.  Costs for the various projects will amount to a “low-three- digit million euro amount” to be realized in the fourth
quarter this year, and to a “mid-three-digit million euro
amount”  next year , according to the presentation. 2015 will
also see project costs, which will be lower than in the previous
year.  Having identified projects with an earnings potential of
2.71 billion euros means leeway to compensate for headwinds and
“melt-down effects,” according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
