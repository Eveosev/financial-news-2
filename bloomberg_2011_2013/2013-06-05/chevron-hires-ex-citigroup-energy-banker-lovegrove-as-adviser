Chevron Corp. (CVX)  hired former  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  oil and gas banker Martin Lovegrove in an advisory role as
the energy group looks to expand production.  Chevron “has contracted Martin Lovegrove to an advisory
position within the company,” Gareth Johnstone, a Chevron
spokesman, said in an e-mail. He will assist with “business
development activities.”  Lovegrove was Citigroup’s chairman for global energy until
departing the New York-based bank earlier this year. He advised
on transactions including Cnooc Ltd.’s $15.1 billion acquisition
of Canada’s Nexen Inc., the largest-ever foreign takeover by a
Chinese company.  San Ramon, California-based Chevron is spending $36.7
billion this year on exploration, export terminals and refinery
upgrades after oil and gas output hit a four-year low in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
