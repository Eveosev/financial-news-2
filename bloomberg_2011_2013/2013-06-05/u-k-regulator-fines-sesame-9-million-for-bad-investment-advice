The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
fined Sesame Ltd., an investment firm, 6 million pounds ($9
million) for failing to ensure customers got suitable advice.  Sesame advised 426 customers over four years to invest 6.1
million pounds with Keydata Investment Services Ltd., which
later collapsed, the regulator said in a statement today. The
sales were flawed because Sesame didn’t match customers’ risk
appetite with appropriate investments, and gave incorrect advice
on how safe the Keydata products were, the FCA said.  The investment firm, based in Dorking,  England , also didn’t
have controls in place to oversee the product and fund sales,
the regulator said. Sesame received the FCA’s standard 30
percent discount for cooperating.  “We regret these past issues and, in cooperation with the
FCA, we have undertaken an immediate past business review to
ensure that any customers who received unsuitable advice on
Keydata products have been compensated,” George Higginson,
chief executive officer of  Sesame Bankhall Group , the firm’s
parent company, said in a statement. “We are working hard to
ensure lessons are learned and corrective actions implemented.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
