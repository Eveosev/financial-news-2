Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  were little changed as investors reduced the number of
contracts they hold before the closure of markets in  China  for a
three-day festival next week.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 3,482  yuan  ($568) a metric ton at
10:15 a.m. local time after swinging between 3,472 and 3,490
yuan. Futures fell for a fourth month in May.  Bourse data showed open interest on the most actively
traded contract declining for a second day yesterday. China’s
financial markets are closed for the Dragon Boat Festival Monday
through Wednesday before resuming trading on Thursday.  “Investors will continue to reduce their positions before
the holiday because the exchange usually raises the margin
requirements as a risk precaution before long holidays,” Ren Xinlei, analyst at Luzheng Futures Co., said from Jinan today.
“Rebar prices will probably fluctuate in a tight range.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at the Tianjin port in
China rose for the second day yesterday, advancing 4.2 percent
to $116.60 a dry ton, according to the Steel Index Ltd. The
steelmaking ingredient fell to $110.40 a dry ton on May 31, the
lowest since October.  The  average spot price  for rebar gained 0.2 percent to
3,449 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
