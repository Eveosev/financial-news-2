U.S. domestic crude-oil production
 exceeded  imports last week for the first time in 16 years, a
government report showed.  Output was 32,000 barrels a day higher than imports in the
seven days ended May 31, according to weekly data today from
the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm. Production had been lower than international
purchases since January 1997.  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale
formations in states including  North Dakota ,  Oklahoma  and Texas.
The surge in oil and gas production helped the U.S. meet 88
percent of its own energy needs in February, the highest monthly
rate since April 1986, EIA data show. Crude  inventories  climbed
to the highest level in 82 years in the week ended May 24.  “It will help U.S. energy independence and help our  trade
balance  quite a bit,” said  Michael Lynch , president of
Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts . “You have to wonder if you are going to see
downward pressure on prices.”  The U.S. pumped 7.3 million barrels a day of oil last week,
up 8,000 barrels from the prior week, the EIA said in its Weekly
Petroleum Status Report. Imports fell 549,000 barrels a day last
week to 7.27 million.  Stockpiles slid 1.6 percent to 391.3 million barrels last
week as imports dropped and refineries used more crude to
produce fuels. Supplies reached 397.6 million barrels in the
week ended May 24, the highest level since 1931.  Trend Extension  “This is an extension of trends that have been well
established over the last few years,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in  New York . “The U.S.
market is much more comfortably supplied than a few years ago.
We have a reduced need for imports.”  Production climbed 42 percent over the past five years and
reached a 21-year high of 7.37 million barrels a day in the week
ended May 3. Imports have tumbled 26 percent since May 2008.  Crude futures for July delivery gained 43 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $93.74 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have slumped 35 percent since settling at an
all-time high of $145.29 on July 3, 2008.  U.S. petroleum imports fell to $29.6 billion in April, the
lowest level since November 2010, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.  OPEC Unease  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled
growing unease with the U.S. oil boom and started a study into
shale at a ministerial meeting last week in Vienna at which it
also left supply targets unchanged.  The committee will consider the effect of shale oil on the
global market for OPEC crude “in the not-too-distant future,”
Nigerian Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said on May
31 after the ministers met. “It is a concern.”  Increased U.S. production has particularly affected imports
from  Africa , which typically produce lighter grades of oil
similar to the North American blends. Imports to the U.S. from
 Nigeria  tumbled to a record low in February, based on  EIA data 
going back to 1995.  Shipments  from Angola dropped to the lowest
level since 1993 in March.  Saudi Arabian deliveries fell to a three-year low in
January and Venezuelan imports slid to the lowest level in 10
years in February.  “It’s a bit worrisome for the outlook in the  Middle East 
and countries like Venezuela which highly rely on energy
exports,” Lynch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
