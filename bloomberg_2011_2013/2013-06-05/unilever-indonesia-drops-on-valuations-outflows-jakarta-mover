PT Unilever  Indonesia , a unit of the
world’s second-largest consumer goods company, led declines for
Indonesian companies as foreign funds sold the nation’s equities
on speculation this year’s rally has been excessive.  Unilever Indonesia dropped 4.8 percent to 29,800 rupiah as
of 10:53 a.m. local time, trimming this year’s gain to 43
percent. It accounted for almost a third of the losses of the
Jakarta Composite Index, which slid 0.9 percent. Indonesia’s
benchmark stocks measure has risen 15 percent this year.  “The stock has become too expensive and the overall market
is under pressure right now,” John Rachmat, head of equities
research at PT Mandiri Sekuritas, said by phone. “But there has
been nothing negative from its business fundamentals.”  Unilever Indonesia traded at 45.5 times 12-month projected
earnings on May 28, the highest since at least 2005, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock’s  14-day relative
strength index was above 70 for 19 days through May 30, the
longest streak since at least June 2008, data showed. A reading
of 70 or higher suggests to some investors that shares are
poised to fall.  The company is considered to be a proxy for the Indonesian
equities market, which has been under  pressure  as foreign
investors trimmed their holdings of emerging-market equities,
Rachmat said. Foreign institutional investors sold a net $171.2
million of Indonesian equities on June 3, the highest since
August 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
