New South Wales beat Queensland 14-6
in the opening game of Australian rugby league’s State of Origin
last night as it seeks to end a run of seven straight series
defeats.  Jarryd Hayne and Michael Jennings scored tries and James
Maloney kicked six points for New South Wales, which led 14-0 at
halftime. It was the Blues’ third straight win against the
Maroons at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium.  Queensland, which has won 15 of the 22 matches since
starting its unprecedented streak of series victories in 2006,
got a try from Darius Boyd, which was converted by Cameron
Smith.  The crowd of 80,380 was a record for the opening game of
the series, eclipsing the mark of 72,773 set in 2006.  Queensland hosts Game 2 on June 26 at Suncorp Stadium in
Brisbane before the best-of-three Australian interstate contest
concludes July 17 in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
