Guy Hands, chairman and founder of
private-equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., said
economic growth in Europe will remain sluggish and volatility
may persist for as long as two decades unless it undergoes a
labor-market overhaul.  The continent should make changes to labor and market
practices similar to those made under former German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, Hands said today at a conference in  Boston .
Schroeder a decade ago unveiled a flexible labor-market and
welfare plan that economists credit with reinvigorating the
German economy.  Hands said private-equity firms can find opportunities in
Europe despite the slow economic growth by investing in “zombie
companies that have banks breathing down their necks” and
businesses that could benefit from a strategic or management
overhaul. Many European banks are also gradually starting to
sell distressed assets, Hands said.  London-based Terra Firma, started by Hands in 1994 as
Nomura International’s Principal Finance Group, has invested
more than 16 billion euros ($21 billion) in 33 businesses since
then, according to the firm’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
