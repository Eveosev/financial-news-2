China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell after touching a 15-month high as maturing repurchase
contracts and government bills added funds to the banking
system.  The seven-day repurchase rate declined after 110 billion
 yuan  ($17.9 billion) of notes sold by the People’s Bank of China
became due. Another 92 billion yuan of repurchase contracts will
mature this week, including 37 billion yuan tomorrow, according
to an estimate by Societe Generale SA.  “The PBOC will adopt a prudent monetary stance and will
likely add liquidity this month,” said Yan Ling, an analyst in
Shenzhen at China Merchant Securities Co. The maturing contracts
“will also decrease the pressure on short-term financing
rates,” she said.  The seven-day  repo rate  dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.71 percent as of 10:45 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It earlier jumped to 5.31 percent, the
highest level since February 2012.  The central bank asked lenders to submit orders for 28-day
repurchase contracts and 14-day reverse repurchase agreements
this morning, according to a trader at a primary dealer required
to bid at the auctions. It also gauged demand for sales of 91-day bills tomorrow, the trader said.  The cost of one-year onshore  interest-rate swaps , the fixed
payment needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate,
increased for a fifth day, adding four basis points to 3.42
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ten-year bonds declined before the government auctions 30
billion yuan of 2020 notes today. The yield on the 3.38 percent
government bonds due May 2023 rose two basis points to 3.48
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
