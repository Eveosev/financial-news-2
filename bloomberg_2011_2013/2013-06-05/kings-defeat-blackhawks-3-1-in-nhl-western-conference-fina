Justin Williams scored on the Los
Angeles Kings’ first shot to help his team to a 3-1 victory over
the  Chicago Blackhawks  in the National Hockey League’s Western
Conference finals.  The top-seeded Blackhawks have a two-games-to-one lead over
the defending champion Kings in the best-of-seven series. The
winner will play the  Pittsburgh Penguins  or  Boston Bruins  in the
Stanley Cup Finals.  The Bruins have a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference
championship, which continues today with Game 3 in Boston.  Williams scored three minutes, 21 seconds into the first
period and Slava Voynov added another goal in the second period
last night at Staples Center in Los Angeles. Bryan Bickell
scored with 34 seconds left in second for the Blackhawks, who
had their five-game postseason winning streak ended.  Dwight King scored an empty-net goal with 28 seconds left
in the game for the Kings, who recorded their 15th straight home
win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
