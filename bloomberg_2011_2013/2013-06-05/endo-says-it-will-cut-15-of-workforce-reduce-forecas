Endo Health Solutions Inc. (ENDP) , the maker
of the painkillers Percocet and Lidoderm, reduced its profit and
revenue forecasts for 2013 while saying it will cut 15 percent
of its global workforce.  Endo also will explore strategic alternatives for its
HealthTronics business, which provides urological services and
products, and its branded drug discovery platform, the  Chadds
Ford , Pennsylvania-based company said today in a statement. The
job cuts and other reductions in expenses may save $325 million
through the middle of 2014, the company said.  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  decided May 10 that
generic copies of Endo’s Opana ER may remain on the market
without abuse-deterrent technology. The competition may reduce
sales by as much as $120 million and cut profit by 55 cents a
share, Endo said then.  “We believe these actions will leave Endo with the right
cost structure, leadership and execution capabilities to drive
sustainable cash flow and earnings growth over time, Rajiv De Silva, Endo’s chief executive officer, said today in the
statement.   Endo reduced its 2013 revenue  forecast  to $2.65 billion to
$2.8 billion from $2.8 billion to $2.95 billion and cut its
projected profit excluding some items to $4.10 to $4.40 a share
from $4.40 to $4.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
