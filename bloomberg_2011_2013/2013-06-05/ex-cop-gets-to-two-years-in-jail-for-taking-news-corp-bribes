A U.K. police officer who accepted
bribes in exchange for information on public figures including
 Kate Middleton  was sentenced to two years in jail as part of a
probe into wrongdoing at a  News Corp . tabloid.  Paul Flattley, a former police officer, contacted the Sun
tabloid 39 times and was paid 7,600 pounds ($11,700) from 2008
to 2011, U.K. police said in a statement today. At a hearing in
March prosecutors said he also gave the newspaper information on
soccer player Paul Gascoigne and politician  Ann Widdecombe .  “Flattley abused his privileged position as a police
officer and the stories he sold had nothing to do with whistle-blowing or the public interest,” Gordon Briggs, a detective
chief superintendent in the Metropolitan Police Service, said in
a statement today.  The jail term, which was handed down in March, was reported
today as prosecutors dropped charges of bribing a public
official in the same case against Virginia Wheeler, the defense
editor at the Sun, on medical grounds. Wheeler would have
challenged the allegations had they gone to trial, her lawyers
said at a hearing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
