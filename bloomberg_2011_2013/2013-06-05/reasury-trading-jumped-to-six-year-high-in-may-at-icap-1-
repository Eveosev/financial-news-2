ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, said Treasury-trading volume rose
58 percent in May to the most in almost six years amid bets the
 Federal Reserve  will begin tapering its bond-purchase program.  The average daily volume of the securities on the company’s
fixed-income electronic platform increased to $189.9 billion
last month, the most since August 2007, and up from $120.5
billion in April, ICAP said in an e-mailed statement. Volumes
rose 67 percent from the same month in 2012, according to the
statement.  Treasuries handed investors a loss of 2.02 percent in May,
the most since December 2009, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes, as concern the Fed will start reducing
its $85 billion of monthly asset purchases sapped demand for the
securities. The dollar strengthened above 100 yen on May 9 for
the first time since 2009 after the  Bank of Japan  unveiled its
own quantitative-easing plan in April.  “There was quite a lot of Treasury activity in May, there
were comments on the potential tapering of QE and we saw dollar-yen break through 100,” Serra Balls, a spokeswomen for ICAP in
London, said in a telephone interview. “All of this resulted in
the benchmarks moving through symbolic levels. Big shifts in
benchmarks result in a major spike in volatility, which then
effects our broking volumes.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.11 percent at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The
dollar weakened 0.6 percent to 99.47 yen after climbing to
103.74 on May 22, the strongest since October 2008.  The average daily volume of  currency trading  fell 2 percent
in May to $126 billion from the previous month, ICAP said. Total
electronic trading on the company’s platform increased 9 percent
to $788.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
