GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
largest maker of materials used in solar panels, rose to the
highest level in more than two weeks as investors bet that  China 
will impose anti-dumping duties on European rivals.  GCL-Poly, which makes polysilicon,  rose  as much as 6
percent to HK$1.92 in Hong Kong, the highest level since May 21.
The stock was at HK$1.88 as of 11:07 a.m. Dumping is a term used
when companies are said to have sold products below costs.  The European Union imposed tariffs of as high as 67.9
percent on solar panels from China yesterday, spurring concern
that the world’s biggest maker of the devices will retaliate.
China is preparing to set anti-dumping duties on polysilicon
imports after determining that the U.S. and European Union are
subsidizing producers, two people with direct knowledge of the
matter said on May 16.  “Once the EU puts up their duties, China will retaliate
and put up duties on polysilicon,” Nitin Kumar, a Singapore-based analyst for Nomura Holdings, said by phone today. “Now
that the EU has played the first card, China will respond with
anti-dumping duties.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
