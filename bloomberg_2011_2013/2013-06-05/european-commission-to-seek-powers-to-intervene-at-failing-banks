The European Union will seek powers
to intervene at failing euro-area banks as part of a central
resolution authority, an EU official said.  The European Commission’s college, its highest decision
making body, discussed the measures at a meeting today in
Brussels, said the EU official, who can’t be identified because
the talks are private. The plans also include the creation of a
bank-financed cross-border fund to help cover the costs of
winding up failed lenders, as well as a new EU agency with
national representatives, the official said.  This new agency would do the preparatory work for bank
resolution decisions, and in practice the commission is likely
to follow its guidance, the official said. The bloc’s current
treaties would prevent the agency from making final decisions on
some issues, the official said.  The Commission’s proposed powers are part of a blueprint
for a handling future bank crises in the 17-nation euro area. EU
leaders called in December for the creation of a single
resolution mechanism to operate alongside the European Central
Bank’s supervision of euro-area banks.  National authorities would remain responsible for
confirming that a bank is in crisis, permitting regulators to
take emergency measures such as forcing creditor writedowns, the
official said. Today’s debate is a step towards the Commission
formally publishing detailed proposals this summer to discuss
with nations and EU lawmakers, the official said, declining to
give a more specific timing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
