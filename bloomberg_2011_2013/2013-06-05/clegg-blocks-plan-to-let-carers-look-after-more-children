U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
blocked a proposal by his Tory coalition partners aimed at
cutting child-care costs for working parents by allowing
individual carers to supervise more children.  Child-Care Minister Liz Truss from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative Party  suggested letting adults look after
four babies under 24 months of age rather than three, as now,
and six two-year-olds rather than the current four. Clegg, who
heads the Liberal Democrats, wrote to Truss yesterday saying he
is vetoing the plans, in the latest fissure between the two
coalition parties.  “The proposals to increase ratios were put out to
consultation and were roundly criticized by parents, providers
and experts alike,” Clegg will say today, according to extracts
of a statement released by his office. “Most importantly, there
is no real evidence that increasing ratios will reduce the cost
of child care for families. I cannot ask parents to accept such
a controversial change with no real guarantee it will save them
money. In fact it could cost them more.”  The dispute between the Tories and Liberal Democrats over
child-care ratios has been played out in public in recent weeks,
with Clegg making his opposition to the policy clear. Tory
Education Secretary Michael Gove, Truss’s boss, retaliated by
saying last month that Clegg was being forced to “show a bit of
leg” to his own party as his leadership was under threat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
