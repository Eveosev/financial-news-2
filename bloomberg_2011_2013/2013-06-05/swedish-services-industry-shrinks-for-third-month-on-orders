Sweden ’s  services  output contracted
for a third month in May as an order declined accelerated,
adding to signs the largest Nordic economy is struggling to
recover.  An index based on responses from about 200  purchasing
managers  in the services sector fell to a seasonally adjusted
47.7 in May from 48.6 the previous month, Stockholm-based
 Swedbank (SWEDA) , which compiles the index, said today. A reading below
50 signals a contraction. The  median estimate  of five economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg was a reading of 49.3.  “All in all a weak number that indicates that Sweden is
still struggling to find traction in the domestic economy,”
said Mikael Sarwe, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB, in
Stockholm, in a note to clients.  Swedish growth is being held back by the debt crisis in
Europe, which is eroding demand for exports.  Sales abroad 
account for about half of the Nordic country’s $500 billion
output.  The business volumes sub-index rose to 50.9 from 49.5, the
order index decreased to 47.2 from 49.2 and the employment index
fell to 43.9 from 46.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
