Crown Ltd. (CWN) ’s  Melbourne  casino isn’t
liable for losses incurred by a gambler who wagered almost A$1.5
billion ($1.4 billion) on baccarat in just over a year,
 Australia ’s top court ruled.  Harry Kakavas, one of Crown Melbourne’s first  patrons  when
it opened in 1994, claimed the gaming company exploited his
pathological urge to bet. He sued the casino in 2007 seeking to
recover A$20.5 million of losses he incurred between June 2005
and August 2006.  Kakavas claimed the casino knew he was a pathological
gambler, a diagnosis accepted by the trial judge, because he
bounced a A$47,500 check within five months of enrolling as a
patron.  The High Court of Australia today rejected the contention
Kakavas’s pathological interest in gambling made him susceptible
to exploitation by Crown, according to a summary of the court’s
ruling posted on its  website .  “He was able to make rational decisions in his own
interests,” according to the summary. “Crown did not knowingly
victimize the appellant by allowing him to gamble.”  Baccarat is a card game where the objective is to beat the
bank with a card score  closest  to nine.  The case is Kakavas v. Crown Melbourne Ltd. 2013HCA-25.
