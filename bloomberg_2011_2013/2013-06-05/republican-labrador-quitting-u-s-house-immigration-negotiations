Representative Raul Labrador said he
is quitting U.S. House negotiations over immigration legislation
because of a dispute over providing health care benefits for
immigrants seeking legal status.  Labrador, an Idaho Republican, is one of a bipartisan House
group that has been working on an immigration proposal. He said
he will present his own bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
