Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Co.
is severing illegal water connections that cost Kenya’s utility
at least 250 million shillings ($2.9 million) every month in
lost revenue, the Star newspaper said.  Those found guilty of involvement in illegal connections to
the city’s piped water supply will face prosecution, the
Nairobi-based paper reported on its website without saying how
it got the information.  About one in five people in Kenya’s urban areas and half of
rural dwellers  lack  access to clean drinking water, according to
2010 data from the United Nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
