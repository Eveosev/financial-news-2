West  Texas  Intermediate oil advanced
to a one-week high after a government report showed that U.S.
crude inventories tumbled as refineries increased production.  Futures rose 0.5 percent. The Energy Information
Administration said  supplies  fell 6.27 million barrels to 391.3
million last week. An 800,000-barrel drop was projected in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Refineries operated  at 88.4
percent of capacity, up 2 percentage points from the prior week.
 Crude imports  slipped 7 percent to 7.27 million barrels a day.  “The crude number was huge and impossible to ignore,”
said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic
Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The rise in refinery
utilization rates and the fall in imports explain most of the
big drop, which is tempering the rise in prices.”  WTI crude for July delivery increased 43 cents to $93.74 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since May 28. The volume of all futures traded was
0.3 percent above the 100-day average at 3:14 p.m.  Brent oil for July settlement slipped 20 cents to end the
session at $103.04 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume for all contracts was 12 percent below
the 100-day average. The European benchmark grade traded at a
$9.30 premium to WTI. The spread was $9.93 yesterday, the widest
based on closing prices since April.  Sizable Decrease  It was the biggest decline in crude stockpiles since Dec.
28, EIA figures show. Supplies surged to 397.6 million barrels
in the week ended May 24, the most since 1931.  “A one-week decline doesn’t change the fundamental
picture, but the bulls are definitely in charge of the market
for the moment,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Crude production increased 0.1 percent to 7.3 million
barrels a day last week, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical unit. Production exceeded imports by
32,000 barrels a day, the first time output surpassed output
since 1997.  U.S. crude grades have traded at a discount to Brent as
rising output bolstered supplies. Production reached 7.37
million barrels a day in the week ended May 3, the most since
February 1992. Output has surged as the combination of
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
unlocks supplies trapped in shale formations including the
Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in Texas.  ‘Great Advantages’  “We should continue to see high refinery runs through the
summer because U.S. refiners have great advantages,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities research at IAF Advisors in
Houston. “They have cheap natural gas and access to Bakken and
other low-priced grades. Crude supplies should continue to draw
down through the summer months as a result.”  Gasoline  inventories  declined 366,000 barrels to 218.8
million. Supplies were forecast to rise 1 million barrels,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. Output of the fuel climbed 332,000 barrels a day to 9.34
million, the highest level since December, the report showed.  July gasoline futures rose 0.48 cent to $2.823 a gallon on
the Nymex, the highest settlement since May 28.  The peak-demand summer driving season when Americans
usually take vacations began with the May 27 Memorial Day
holiday and ends in early September with Labor Day. Consumption
slipped 1.5 percent to 8.82 million barrels a day last week.  “Gasoline demand isn’t that great last week, especially
when you consider that the report covered Memorial Day,” Lynch
said. “This should keep prices from rising too far.”  More Distillates  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, rose 2.61 million barrels to 123.3
million, the highest level since February.  Crude retreated from the day’s highs after equities
declined. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  both declined 1.3 percent.  The U.S. will extend waivers from sanctions for nine
nations that import Iranian oil, an American official said.
Sanctions exemptions for China, India,  Malaysia ,  South Korea ,
Singapore,  South Africa ,  Sri Lanka ,  Turkey  and  Taiwan  will
continue, according to the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the decision hasn’t been made public.  A December 2011 law cuts off access to the U.S. banking
system for any foreign financial institutions that handle oil
trading with  Iran , unless their home countries have earned a
waiver by significantly reducing imports. The measures are
intended to pressure the Persian Gulf nation to abandon aspects
of its nuclear program that the U.S. and  Israel  say are aimed at
developing atomic weapons.  Bollinger Band  WTI’s rebound may stall along its middle Bollinger Band, at
about $94.40 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures yesterday halted an intraday advance near
this indicator for a fourth day, signaling where sell orders may
be clustered.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 22.8 percent, compared with 23.7 percent yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 512,155
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. It totaled 708,400 contracts
yesterday, 20 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.74 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
