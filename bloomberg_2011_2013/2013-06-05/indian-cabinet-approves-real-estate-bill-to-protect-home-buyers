Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh’s cabinet approved a bill seeking to regulate the
residential housing industry to protect home buyers.  The cabinet endorsed the  Real Estate (Regulation and
Development) Bill  yesterday, Housing Minister  Ajay Maken  said in
a briefing in New Delhi today. The plan needs the approval of
lawmakers and will be presented at the next session of
parliament, he said.  India’s housing sector is largely unregulated and opaque
and consumers are often unable to access sufficient information
or hold builders accountable, according to the government.
Regulations will enable the industry to access capital markets
for growth, the administration said.  “In the near term, the bill, once enacted, could lead to
some delay in new launches,” said  Harvesp Mehta , director at
Motilal Oswal Private Equity Advisors Pvt. Ltd., which manages a
property fund. “It proposes several stringent norms against
developers in case of non-compliance.”  At the same time, the planned legislation is a step in the
right direction, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
