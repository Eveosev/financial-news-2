Cap SA (CAP) ,  Chile ’s largest iron-ore
producer, rose to a two-week high as prices for the steel-making
ingredient rebounded from the lowest level since October.  Cap gained 2.3 percent to 12,999 pesos at the close of
trading in Santiago. The benchmark Ipsa index fell 0.2 percent.  “We’ve seen a recovery in iron prices and Cap is
benefiting from that,” Arturo Curtze, an analyst at Vantrust
Capital, said in a phone interview from Santiago. “Cap also
took a hammering in May and some investors are buying the stock
betting on a short term gain.”  The price of  iron  at the Chinese port of Tianjin has risen
5.6 percent this week after tumbling to an eight-month low of
$110 per ton on May 31, according to prices compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  Sales of  iron ore  accounted for 47 percent of Cap’s  revenue 
in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Cap’s shares  slumped  17 percent last month to 12,429 pesos, its
lowest price since May 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
