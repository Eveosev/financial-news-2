Siemens AG , Europe’s biggest
engineering company, said Germany can cut the cost of its switch
to renewable energy from nuclear power by 150 billion euros
($196 billion) by focusing on gas and sea-based wind generators.  Germany can reduce spending in part by raising energy-efficiency efforts and reforming the power market to favor
natural gas over more heavily polluting coal, Siemens Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  said today.  “We want more environmental protection at less cost,”
Loescher told reporters in Berlin. “A misguided energy policy
may not immediately lead to a mass exodus of the German
industry, but may result in a creeping loss of economic
strength. And that can cost jobs.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is attempting to lead the
biggest transition to renewables of any developed country in
history, seeking to more than triple the share of renewable
power by 2050 to 80 percent of the nation’s consumption. Even
so, Germany’s carbon-dioxide emissions rose 2 percent last year
as more coal was burned to generate power, the Environment
Ministry said in February.  Excessive subsidies for solar power, paid for through
surcharges, are weighing on consumer electricity bills, and
German greenhouse-gas emissions are rising as the current
regulatory and economic environment leads to dirtier coal-fired
power stations replacing gas units, Loescher said.  Germany should overhaul its clean-energy subsidy system,
and rely on natural-gas plants as well as offshore wind farms to
produce “reliable” electricity and reduce costs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
