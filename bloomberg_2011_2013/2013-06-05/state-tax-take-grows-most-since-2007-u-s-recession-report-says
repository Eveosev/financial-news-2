State income-tax collections in the
first quarter were the strongest since the start of the
recession in 2007, according to a report by the Nelson A.
Rockefeller Institute of Government.  Personal income-tax collections grew 17.6 percent in the
first quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, the
report released today said, citing data from 47 states. The 9.3
percent increase in all revenue was also buoyed by a growing
economy, and higher income levies that  California  voters
approved in November.  “State tax revenues have been continuously recovering for
three years,” the Albany, New York-based nonpartisan research
group said in an e-mailed statement. “However, state revenue
recovery has been much slower and more prolonged than in
previous recoveries and is still far from full recovery.”  The growth may slow in the second half of the year as
states lose out on revenue from taxpayers who shifted income and
dividends into 2012 to avoid higher federal taxes imposed as
part of deficit negotiations in Washington, according to the the
report. Those taxes were mostly collected in the first and
second quarters of 2013.  Voters in California approved higher tax rates on incomes
starting at $250,000. Those making $1 million or more pay 13.3
percent under the new law, the most of any state.  The increases were expected to raise an estimated $6
billion annually and expire by 2018. When California is excluded
from the first quarter calculations, income tax collections in
the rest of the states grew a collective 9 percent, Rockefeller
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
