Commerzbank AG , Germany’s second-largest lender, said it is willing to take losses when selling
assets as part of a plan to boost capital levels.  Commerzbank would be ready to take such losses if the sales
released sufficient capital or helped the bank lower the funds
it has to set aside for soured loans,  Martin Blessing , the
lender’s chief executive officer, said today in a speech to
investors at a conference in New York.  Commerzbank is in “intense and advanced” talks to sell a
portfolio of commercial real estate loans in the U.K., Blessing
said without identifying potential buyers.  The lender is ready to take “a little bit more of a price
hit” if it can sell whole portfolios in countries such as the
U.K. to avoid the cost of firing the staff, Blessing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
