Copper swung between gains and losses
in London as investors weighed prospects for reduced economic
stimulus in the U.S. against concern about supply as the world’s
second-biggest mine stayed closed.  The presidents of two regional Federal Reserve banks called
for a reduction in the central bank’s $85 billion of monthly
bond-buying as the economy improves in the U.S., the world’s
second-biggest copper consumer. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc.’s Grasberg mine in  Indonesia  may remain shut for as long as
three months for an investigation of deadly accidents.  “Quantitative-easing expectations have been somewhat
reduced by fairly hawkish comments from Fed members recently,”
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, said by
e-mail, referring to central-bank stimulus.  Copper for delivery in three months was unchanged at $7,455
a metric ton by 10:11 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange after
falling as much as 0.8 percent and climbing as much as 0.3
percent. Copper for delivery in July added 0.2 percent to $3.375
a pound on the Comex in  New York .  Figures today will show U.S. factory orders rose 1.5
percent in April after the prior month’s drop, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Employers in the country added
167,000 workers last month, compared with 165,000 in April,
according to a separate survey before figures due June 7.  “Most will be waiting for the U.S. jobs report,”
Kryuchenkov said.  A tunnel collapse at  Grasberg  on May 14 killed 28 people
and another worker died June 1 in a separate incident. Closing
the mine for three months would remove about 140,000 tons of
supply, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  “Supply concerns continue to offer support,” Cailey Barker, an analyst at Numis Securities Ltd., wrote in a report.  Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the LME fell for an eighth
session in nine to 612,300 tons, daily exchange figures showed.
They’re still up 91 percent this year. Orders to remove the
metal from warehouses gained 0.3 percent to 226,050 tons.  Aluminum, lead and zinc reached the highest levels since
March 15 in London. Nickel and tin rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
