U.K. stocks  declined to their lowest
level in six weeks as investors’ concern grew that the Federal
Reserve will reduce its stimulus measures as early as September.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc contributed the
most to a retreat in mining shares. Tesco Plc dropped the most
in almost 17 months after reporting same-store sales that missed
analysts’ estimates. Man Group Plc tumbled the most in 20 months
after UBS AG lowered its recommendation on the shares.  The  FTSE 100 Index  fell 139.27 points, or 2.1 percent, to
6,419.31 at the close in London, the lowest level since April
23. The equity benchmark has lost 6.2 percent since Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke said May 22 the central bank may scale back
stimulus if the U.S. economy improves. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also slid 2.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index slipped 1.1 percent.  “What we’re seeing is a lot of short-term traders
repositioning themselves in fear of the unknown,”  John Haynes ,
head of research at Investec Wealth & Investment in London, said
in a phone interview. “The tapering option is very much
available to the Fed and it will only do so if the economy
improves, which in the long term is a good thing. Eventually,
we’ll concentrate on fundamentals.”  Four FTSE 100 companies including National Grid Plc and WPP
Plc are trading without the right to their latest dividends
today, shaving off 4.9 points from the FTSE 100.  Rollback Calls  Fed Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher , who opposed
the beginning of the current round of bond-buying in September
as well as the expansion of the program to Treasuries in
December, reiterated his backing for reducing stimulus.  Separately, Fed Bank of Kansas City President  Esther George 
supported slowing purchases “as an appropriate next step for
monetary policy,” according to the text of a speech. She didn’t
deliver the speech due to illness.  The central bank’s policy makers will start tapering
quantitative easing in September, Deutsche Bank AG said in a
report yesterday.  Companies in the U.S. increased employment by 135,000
workers in May, figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Research Institute showed. The median forecast of 40 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 165,000.  A  gauge of mining shares  in the FTSE 350 Index retreated
2.7 percent, its lowest level since April 22. BHP Billiton, the
world’s biggest commodity producer, slid 2.7 percent to 1,843
pence. Anglo American Plc dropped 4.3 percent to 1,454 pence.  Tesco Sales  Tesco  tumbled 5.2 percent to 345.6 pence, the most since
Jan. 12, 2012. Britain’s biggest retailer said today U.K. same-store sales, excluding gasoline and value-added tax, fell 1
percent in the 13 weeks ended May 25. The decrease was more than
the 0.7 percent drop forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  A  gauge of retailers  in the FTSE 350 lost 3.1 percent, its
biggest slump in more than four months. J Sainsbury Plc slipped
1.8 percent to 365.1 pence, while Marks & Spencer Group Plc
declined 2.8 percent to 453.4 pence. Wm Morrison Supermarkets
Plc slipped 3.5 percent to 262.8 pence.  Man Group plunged 17 percent to 97.05 pence, its largest
retreat since September 2011. UBS AG lowered its rating on the
world’s biggest publicly traded hedge-fund manager to neutral
from buy, citing weak performance at its $16.3 billion AHL fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
