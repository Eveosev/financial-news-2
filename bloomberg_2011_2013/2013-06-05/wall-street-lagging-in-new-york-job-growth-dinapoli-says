Wall Street has contributed less than
2 percent of New York City’s job growth since the recession
ended as cost-cutting efforts have led banks to replace fewer
positions than other businesses.  The securities industry has recovered about one-fifth of
jobs lost during the slump, New York State Comptroller  Thomas P. DiNapoli  said in a statement today laying out his analysis of
the city’s budget. The industry had $6.6 billion in profits in
the first quarter, almost half of the city’s estimate for the
full year.  The biggest U.S. banks, including New York-based  Citigroup
Inc.  and Morgan Stanley, are leaning on expense savings from job
cuts to improve profits as merger and trading activity remains
below pre-financial crisis levels. New York City’s total private
workforce has increased more than 10 percent from its low point
during the recession and has surpassed its 2007 high, according
to state Labor Department data.  Job reductions on Wall Street will be a “continued slow
bleed” after the industry trimmed hundreds of thousands of
positions in recent years,  Meredith Whitney , a banking analyst
and chief executive officer of Meredith Whitney Advisory Group,
said in an April 30 Bloomberg Television interview. Boston
Consulting Group said that month that banks will have to
continue to cut costs as new regulations crimp profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
