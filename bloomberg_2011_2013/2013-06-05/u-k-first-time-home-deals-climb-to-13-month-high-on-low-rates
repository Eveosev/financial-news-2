Home purchases by first-time buyers
in the U.K. climbed to a 13-month high in April as  mortgage
rates  stayed close to record lows, according to data compiled by
 LSL Property Services Plc. (LSL)   Transactions rose 15 percent from the previous month to
22,000, the highest since March 2012, the broker said in a
report published today. The average mortgage rate climbed to
4.31 percent from a record low of 4.29 percent in March, the
company said.  “An improvement in the availability of high loan-to-value
mortgages allowed more first-time buyers to realize their dreams
of home ownership,” LSL Director David Newnes said in a
statement. “Increased lender confidence has led to lower rates
and a wider range of first-time buyer mortgages.”  U.K. house prices had their biggest annual increase in 18
months in May as the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending
Scheme gave more people access to mortgages,  Nationwide Building
Society  said last week. The program has allowed banks on average
to grant loans of more than 80 percent of the value of homes,
LSL said.  The average price of homes bought by first-time buyers rose
2 percent to 138,632 pounds ($213,264) and 36 percent of buyers
needed direct funding from family members to pay their deposit,
according to the report.  Nearly half of all would-be first-time buyers said their
inability to save for a deposit was the barrier to buying a
property, LSL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
