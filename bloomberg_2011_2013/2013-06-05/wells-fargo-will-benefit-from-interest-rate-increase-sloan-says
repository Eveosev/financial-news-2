Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, is well-positioned for rising  interest rates 
because the firm will benefit from higher returns, said Chief
Financial Officer Timothy Sloan.  “The current backup in rates we think is attractive and
will allow us to invest,” Sloan, 53, said today at a  New York 
investor conference in response to a question about rising
Treasury note yields. One drawback is that “it makes some
consumers who were thinking about refinancing their mortgage
probably think twice.”  Managing through a rise in interest rates is the biggest
challenge facing bankers today, Sloan’s boss, Chief Executive
Officer  John Stumpf , said last week. While the San Francisco-based firm erred by prematurely keeping money on the sidelines
in anticipation of rising rates, the shift may finally be
coming, he said.  Analysts and investors have expressed concern that banks
will be stuck with loans and other assets that will lose value
because they were created when rates were near record lows.  “We’re very well-poised for an increase in interest
rates,” Sloan said. “If rates go up, we can operate
successfully.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
