Slovenian benchmark bond yields rose
to a six-week high, testing the euro-area nation’s government as
it seeks to persuade investors it has no need for a bailout.  The yield on the country’s dollar-denominated notes
maturing in 2022 advanced six basis points to 6.03 percent at
12:27 p.m. in Ljubljana, the highest since April 19, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek’s government presented a
plan last month to boost capital in the largest banks by 900
million euros ($1.2 billion), create a bank asset management
company and push ahead with a state-asset sale program to
reassure investors the nation can pull itself out of the
financial crisis without aid.  “Investors are looking for the Cabinet’s reform and
privatization promises to become more tangible and that could
lead to further underperformance of Slovenian bonds in case risk
markets turn more volatile,” analysts at Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank
d.d. in Zagreb,  Croatia , including Hrvoje Stojic said in a note
to clients today.  The European Commission on May 29 extended a deadline for
Slovenia to reduce its budget gap to 2015 and said the
government must be ready to provide more capital for its ailing
banks. The Adriatic nation must also hire an outside adviser by
the end of June to assess bank assets and produce its own
estimate by year’s end.  The 900 million-euro estimate for bank recapitalization
comes from the nation’s central bank. The Governor Marko Kranjec
said yesterday the amount should be enough to stabilize the
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
