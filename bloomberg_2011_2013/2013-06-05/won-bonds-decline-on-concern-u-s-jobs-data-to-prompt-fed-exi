South Korea’s won rose the most in
more than six weeks on speculation exporters converted overseas
earnings ahead a holiday tomorrow and before U.S. data that may
provide clues on whether the Federal Reserve will cut stimulus.  “The won erased its earlier loss as exporters may have
repatriated income,” said Jeon Seung Ji, an analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “Investors may reduce their long
positions on the dollar a bit ahead of the holiday,” she said,
referring to a position that favors the greenback.  The dollar fell against 10 Asian currencies before a report
today from ADP Research Institute that may show U.S. companies
hired 165,000 workers last month, more than the 119,000 in
April, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. South
Korean bonds fell after Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok and
central bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said in a joint statement
yesterday that uncertainties are increasing amid a possible Fed
exit from debt purchases.  The won rose 0.6 percent to 1,115.89 per dollar in Seoul,
the biggest gain since April 19, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier declined as much as 0.3 percent to
1,125.23. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 47 basis
points, or 0.47 percentage point, to 8.59 percent.  Bond Market Volatility  The yield on the 2.75 percent notes due March 2018 rose six
basis points to 2.97 percent, prices from Korea Exchange Inc.
show. That’s the highest level for a benchmark five-year
 security  since Jan. 2.  The government is “closely analyzing” volatility in
foreign purchases of government bond futures and preparing a
contingency plan should overseas investors pull money from the
market, Gwak Bum Gook, director general of the finance
ministry’s treasury bureau, said in an interview in Sejong
yesterday.  “Stimulus policies of the U.S. and  Japan  are likely to
cause higher volatility in the second half in the bond market,
and we will closely monitor and respond to such a case,” Gwak
said.  The nation’s foreign-exchange reserves fell to $328.1
billion in May from $328.8 billion in April, Bank of Korea said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Asian currencies have dropped over the past month after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said May 22 the central bank could
reduce the pace of its monthly bond purchases if there are signs
of sustained improvement in the world’s largest economy. The
monetary easing has driven demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  A U.S. Labor Department report on June 7 is projected to
show firms increased hiring by 167,000 in May, more than 165,000
in April, according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
