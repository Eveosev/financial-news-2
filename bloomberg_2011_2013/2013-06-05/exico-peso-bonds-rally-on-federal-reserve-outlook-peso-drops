Mexico’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down for a third day, as a disappointing U.S. employment
report spurred speculation the Federal Reserve will maintain a
stimulus program that has buoyed developing-nation debt.  Yields on peso bonds due in December 2024 fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.23 percent at 11:09 a.m.
in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price rose 0.21 centavo to 141.26 centavos per peso. The peso
dropped 0.8 percent to 12.8270 per U.S. dollar, paring its
advance this year to 0.2 percent.  U.S. companies added 135,000 positions in May after a
revised 113,000 increase in April that was smaller than
initially estimated, the ADP Research Institute reported today.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a 165,000
increase last month. Mexico’s northern neighbor is its biggest
trading partner.  “The important thing at this time is to analyze if the
indicators for this sector could temper the optimism shown by
some members of the Fed,”  Alejandro Padilla,  a strategist at
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in an e-mailed research note
“Mexican yields are reacting positively to the report.”  Yields soared 0.69 percentage point through last week,
reaching a four-month high, after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said May 22 that policy makers may consider reducing monetary
stimulus if they saw sustained economic improvement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
