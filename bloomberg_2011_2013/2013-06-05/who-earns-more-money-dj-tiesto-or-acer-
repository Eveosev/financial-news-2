It's a trick question, of course.  Acer hasn't turned a profit in two years, posting back-to-back annual losses amid numerous missteps and a foundering PC market. DJ Tiesto, on the other hand, is the world's highest-paid electronic dance musician and rakes in $22 million annually, according to  Forbes  magazine. Of course, while DJs don't have much overhead, Tiesto has said before that he reinvests in himself to build his career, and his private jet couldn't have been cheap. The two came together last night at a dance party for Acer and its partners as part of the annual Computex trade show in Taipei (with generous help from Intel to pay for the event).  It's not unheard of for hip music types and straight-laced corporates to mix -- Intel itself managed to lure Will.i.am to front its attempts at appearing creative and cool. The difference is that Intel is hugely profitable and can afford an indulgence or two, like a billionaire splashing out on a 100-foot yacht.  "We've done a thoughtful evaluation of our campaign to build our brand image," said Henry Wang, a spokesman for Acer. "Who makes more money is irrelevant." Acer's hookup with Tiesto comes after similar deals with actors Megan Fox and Kiefer Sutherland, and are part of its ongoing strategy to spend big bucks on famous names in the hope that consumers will be so starstruck that they'll actually go and buy a PC.  So far it hasn't worked, with revenue falling precipitously since the end of 2011. That's not Tiesto's fault. His one-hour set at a makeshift nightclub in downtown Taipei did exactly what he's paid big money to do: make audiences forget their troubles as they revel in the electronic beats of a skilled mixmaster.  It's when the music stops and the harsh light of dawn breaks that the only thing left behind is the head-thumping, ear-ringing memories of a party long since ended.
