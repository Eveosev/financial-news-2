The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which operates the only oil export link in  Russia  with foreign
shareholders, will reduce daily crude exports from the Black Sea
in June by 2 percent from May, a final loading program obtained
by Bloomberg News showed.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 2.699 million metric
tons, compared with 2.845 million tons in May, according to the
schedule. That’s equal to 699,041 barrels a day, down from
713,085 barrels last month.  This compares with 2.67 million tons in the preliminary
schedule released on May 14.  The final program comprises nine cargoes of 134,000 to
135,500 tons each and 17 consignments of 85,000 to 93,000 tons.  The CPC pipeline, in which  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31 percent and
Kazakhstan 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a
joint venture between OAO Rosneft and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are
among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
