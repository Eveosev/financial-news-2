Japan’s yen, weakened by
unprecedented monetary easing, damped a benchmark revenue gauge
at  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and threatens to curb fares and capacity
on  United Airlines (UAL)  flights to the island nation.  Delta’s passenger revenue for each seat flown a mile last
month rose 0.5 percent after accounting for 1 percentage point
of “negative impact” from the yen, the carrier said in a
statement yesterday. Atlanta-based Delta said trans-Pacific
traffic climbed 0.5 percent, the least of any non-U.S. region.  United also felt the effect of a devalued yen to a lesser,
unspecified degree, Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Smisek  told
reporters after a speech yesterday in Chicago, where the world’s
biggest airline is based.  The Bank of Japan has been working to weaken the currency
under the policy dubbed Abenomics, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, to revive the third-biggest economy after more than a
decade of deflation. The yen fell 13 percent against the dollar
this year through yesterday, paring the value of revenue
converted back into the U.S. currency.  United parent United Continental Holdings Inc. has yet to
report operating results for May.  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines,
the third-biggest U.S. carrier after United and Delta, also
hasn’t disclosed details about its performance last month.  While tickets bought before the yen’s decline blunted the
fallout, a sustained devaluation poses risks for United’s
pricing and flights to  Japan , Smisek said after the speech,
according to Reuters and the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
