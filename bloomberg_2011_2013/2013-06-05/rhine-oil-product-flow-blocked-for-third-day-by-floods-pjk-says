Oil product barge trading is stalled
for at least a third day along parts of the Rhine River as
floods and high waters prevent barges from traveling to the
upper stretches, according to PJK International BV.  “Oil majors and importers are not pressed to do any
business,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of the Netherlands-based
researcher, said today by phone from Breda. “There is demand
for next week to  Switzerland  and  France , but nobody is offering.
It will take until at least Friday to normalize.”  The river isn’t navigable upstream from Koblenz in  Germany ,
which means Frankfurt, Mannheim, Strasbourg in France and  Basel 
in Switzerland can’t receive oil product shipments, Joachim
Hessler, operations manager at  Maintank Schiffahrtsgesellschaft
mbH , a barge-owner based in Woerth near Frankfurt, said
yesterday in an e-mail.  The water level at Kaub, Germany, which is about 200
kilometers (124 miles) south of Dusseldorf, rose to 7.19 meters
(24 feet) today, the highest since at least 2006, data from the
German Federal Institute of Hydrology show. Barge freight rates
haven’t been affected by the halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
