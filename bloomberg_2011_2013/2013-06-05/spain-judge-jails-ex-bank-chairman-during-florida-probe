A Spanish judge ordered  Miguel Blesa ,
the former chairman of Caja Madrid, back to jail as legal probes
into losses at the country’s banks intensified.  Judge Elpidio-Jose Silva ordered Blesa, 65, be detained
without bail, a spokesman for a regional court in Madrid said by
telephone today. Silva has been investigating the cost of Caja
Madrid’s purchase of City National Bank of Florida in 2008, a
deal that may have caused losses of 500 million euros ($655
million), he said in a ruling last month.  Caja Madrid was merged with Bancaja and five other savings
banks in 2010 to form  Bankia . The banking group needed a 22
billion-euro rescue last year that forced Spain to seek bailout
funds from Europe to salvage the industry.  Blesa spent a night in Madrid’s 1,008-cell Soto del Real
jail in May before he was freed on 2.5 million euros bail.  Carlos Aguilar, a lawyer for Blesa, wasn’t immediately
available to comment on his detention when contacted by
Bloomberg News today.  Bankia agreed to sell City National to Chile’s Banco de
Credito e Inversiones for $882.8 million last month. It had
bought 83 percent of the bank for $927 million five years ago
before buying more shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
