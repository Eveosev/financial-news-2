The  Federal Reserve  will probably
trim its monthly asset purchases by almost a third in September
if the labor market continues to strengthen, according to  Joseph LaVorgna , Deutsche Bank AG’s chief U.S. economist.  The first reduction will be $25 billion, consisting of $10
billion fewer mortgages and $15 billion of Treasuries. This will
bring monthly purchases down to $60 billion from the current
level of $85 billion, LaVorgna wrote yesterday in note to
clients.  “Policy makers are still on track to taper at the
September meeting,” according to the New York-based LaVorgna.
“This assumes the downtrend in jobless claims persists and that
we will see a step-up in hiring this summer.”  The Fed may complete the reductions by the end of the year,
with two successive $30 billion cuts during meetings in October
and December, according to Deutsche Bank, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade directly with the central bank.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said May 22 that policy makers
could consider slowing the bond-buying program within “the next
few meetings” if officials are confident that improvement in
the economy will be sustained.  Weekly applications for  jobless benefits  have fallen to
354,000 from 382,000 12 months ago and from 418,000 two years
ago, Labor Department figures showed on May 30.  The Fed may raise its benchmark  interest rate  by late 2014,
according to Deutsche Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
