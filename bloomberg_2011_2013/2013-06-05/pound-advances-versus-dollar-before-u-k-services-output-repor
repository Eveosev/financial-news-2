The pound rose to a three-week high
against the dollar as an industry report showed U.K. services
output expanded more than analysts forecast, adding to signs the
economy is gathering momentum.  Sterling climbed to the strongest level in two weeks versus
the euro as the survey of purchasing managers supported the case
for the Bank of England to refrain from further monetary
stimulus that tends to devalue a currency. The central bank
started a two-day meeting today amid speculation policy makers
will leave the asset-purchase target unchanged. U.K. gilts rose,
with the 10-year yield falling from near a  12-week high .  “The pound strengthened on the back of the stronger-than-expected service PMI survey, which is consistent with the pace
of economic recovery accelerating further in the second
quarter,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “That’s helping to support
the pound in the near term and will push back expectations that
the Bank of England may ease monetary policy further.”  The pound gained 0.5 percent to $1.5392 at 4:54 p.m. London
time after climbing to $1.5403, the highest level since May 10.
Sterling rose 0.5 percent to 85.03 pence per euro after
appreciating to 84.97 pence, the strongest since May 21.  The U.K. currency will trade at around $1.50 and be
“stable” against the euro at 85 pence during the next three
months, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi’s Hardman said. Sterling will
weaken to $1.49 by year-end, according to the median of 57
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Services Expand  Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply said their index of  service industries  rose to 54.9
in May from 52.9 the previous month. That’s higher than the
forecast of 53.1 in a Bloomberg News  survey  of economists and
the most since March 2012. A reading above 50 shows expansion.  Separate Markit reports this week on manufacturing and
construction both showed growth. The British Retail Consortium
said yesterday that like-for-like retail sales increased an
annual 1.8 percent last month, while Nationwide Building Society
said on May 30 that U.K. house prices rose the most in 18 months
on an annual basis.  “Recent U.K. growth, retail and housing data, coupled with
today’s PMI services figures will attract further inwards and
homegrown investment relative to the euro zone,”  Neil Jones ,
head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.
in London, wrote in an e-mailed comment. “The pound is and
should continue to outperform going forward.”  Best Performer  The pound has gained 3.9 percent in the past three months,
the best performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 2
percent and the euro strengthened 2.3 percent.  The Bank of England will leave its bond-purchase  target  at
375 billion pounds at this week’s meeting, according to all but
one of 43 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
meeting is the last chaired by Governor  Mervyn King  before his
successor  Mark Carney  takes over on July 1. Policy makers will
keep the main interest rate at a  record-low  0.5 percent, a
separate Bloomberg survey shows.  The 10-year gilt yield dropped two basis point, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.01 percent after climbing to 2.06 percent
on June 3, the highest level since March 8. The 1.75 percent
bond due in September 2022 rose 0.2, or 2 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 97.795.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this year
through yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg U.K. Sovereign
Bond Index . German bonds dropped 0.9 percent and U.S. Treasuries
declined 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
