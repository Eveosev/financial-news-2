Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the metals and
oil producer controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, halted
plans to cut 2,000 jobs at its copper mines in  Zambia .  “We are not going ahead with this redundancy program,”
Joy Sata, a spokeswoman for Kitwe-based Konkola Copper Mines
Plc, said by mobile phone. The company, which is 79.4 percent
owned by Vedanta, reversed its plans after talks with the
government and labor unions, she said.  Mining companies including  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  and
Rio Tinto Group have announced job cuts this year as they seek
to cut costs and protect profits amid falling metal prices.
Konkola had previously announced its intention to fire 24
percent of its workforce last month.  Copper prices have slumped 6 percent since the start of the
year, with prices for three-month delivery closing at $7,455 a
metric ton yesterday on the London Metal Exchange.  “Significant progress has been made in identifying
measures that will mitigate the company’s financial and business
challenges,” KCM, as the company is known, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
