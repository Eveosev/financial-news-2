MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s challenge at the
European Union’s highest court seeking to overturn an EU
decision that the company’s cross-border card fees breach
antitrust rules will be heard next month.  The EU Court of Justice set July 4 as the date for the oral
hearing in the case, according to a filing on the court’s
website today. The case at the Luxembourg-based court may affect
the future of card-payment systems in  Europe . MasterCard lost a
first court appeal and in August took its fight to the top EU
court.  The EU General Court, the bloc’s second-highest, last year
backed the European Commission’s 2007 decision that MasterCard’s
levies unfairly inflated the transaction fees paid by retailers
for processing payments. The second-biggest card network,
supported by banks including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc , previously argued that the so-called
multilateral  interchange fees  are crucial for sharing the costs
of debit and credit card payments.  The Brussels-based commission started a new probe into
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard this year, looking at bank
fees on foreign card payments such as when tourists go shopping
in the 27-nation bloc. The levies -- and other possible
practices including higher fees for traders accepting so-called
premium cards aimed at affluent customers -- may be anti-competitive, slowing down cross-border business and harming
customers through higher prices, the commission said in April.  The case is: C-382/12 P MasterCard and Others v.
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
