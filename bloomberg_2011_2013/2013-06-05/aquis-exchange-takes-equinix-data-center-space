Aquis Exchange Ltd. leased space in
the  Equinix Inc. (EQIX)   data center  as the pan-European trading venue
founded by former Chi-X Europe Ltd. Chief Executive Officer
Alasdair Haynes prepares to open.  Aquis will locate its main data center at Equinix’s Slough
campus, west of London, Equinix said in a statement today. The
venue offers access to more than 30 European markets and 80
exchanges and trading systems, according to Equinix.  “LD4 is the best-connected financial hub in the U.K.,”
Haynes, who announced in October that he would set up in
competition with his former employer, said in the statement.  The European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive in 2007 allowed alternative trading systems to compete
with traditional exchanges such as Deutsche Boerse AG and  NYSE
Euronext (NYX) , sparking a fight for market share.  Aquis will offer so-called co-location services, enabling
customers to place servers near an exchange’s systems. The setup
allows firms to reduce the time it takes to receive an execution
or confirm that an order was canceled. London-based Aquis will
give traders a choice of who provides clearing services for
their transactions.  Before Chi-X, Haynes was the CEO of New-York based
Investment Technology Group Inc.’s international business in
London. He left ITG in 2009 after a decade. Haynes has traded
stocks and derivatives over 30 years, including stints at Morgan
Grenfell,  Bankers Trust  and UBS AG, where he was responsible for
European listed derivatives.  To contact the reporters on this story:
