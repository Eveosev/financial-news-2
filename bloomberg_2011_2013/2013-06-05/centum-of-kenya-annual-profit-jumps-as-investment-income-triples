Centum Investment Co. said full-year
profit more than doubled as investment income at the Kenyan
company surged.  Net income at  Kenya â€™s largest publicly traded investment
group jumped to 2.51 billion shillings ($29 million) in the 12
months through March from 1.19 billion shillings a year earlier,
the Nairobi-based company said in a statement published in the
Daily Nation newspaper today. Investment income more than
tripled to 3.91 billion shillings, it said.  Kenyan stocks were the best performers in sub-Saharan
 Africa  last year as the central bank cut  interest rates , reined
in inflation and spurred a rally in the shilling. The Nairobi
Securities Exchange All-Share Index surged 39 percent in 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of Centum, which invests in banks, breweries and
 food processing , have leapt 90 percent this year, making it the
third-best performer on the  All-Share Index (NSEASI) , which gained 34
percent in the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock may begin falling after a recent rally pushed its
14-day relative strength index to 70.4 on June 3, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading above 70 signals that a
stock is overbought.  Centum said June 3 it received regulatory approval to
create an asset-management unit, Centum Asset Managers Ltd.,
headed by Pius Muchiri, who was previously investment manager in
charge of quoted equities at the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
