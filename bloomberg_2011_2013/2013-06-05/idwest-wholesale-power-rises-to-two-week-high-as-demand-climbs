Spot wholesale electricity more than
doubled to two-week highs across the Midwest as demand exceeded
forecasts.  Power usage  on the grid stretching from  Michigan  to North
Dakota jumped to 60,820 megawatts at 2:40 p.m. Central time, 2.4
percent higher than yesterday’s outlook, according to the
Midwest Independent System Operator Inc. The high in
Indianapolis will be 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 1 above
normal, said AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Spot on-peak power at the region’s benchmark  Indiana hub 
jumped $33.67 to $59.50 a megawatt-hour at 4:13 p.m. New York
time from yesterday’s full-day average, the highest price since
May 21, grid data compiled by Bloomberg show. Illinois gained
$36.26 to $58.57 and Michigan surged $35.01 to $64.95, also the
highest since May 21.  The unplanned shutdown of a coal unit and lower-than-forecast wind generation reduced supplies while demand
increased, said Lauren Seliga, a Boston-based analyst for
Genscape Inc., which tracks real-time power data.  “We were looking under-committed already today so the loss
of generation on top of that stretched them thin,” Seliga said.  Wind turbines  produced 1,213 megawatts of electricity
during the hour ended at 2 p.m., 43 percent less than the
forecast of 2,126 megawatts for the hour, MISO’s website showed.  Wind Power  Much of the region’s wind generation is concentrated in the
grid’s western states. Spot on-peak power at the  Minnesota hub 
reached a six-week high of $63.67 a megawatt-hour, more than
double yesterday’s full-day average.  Spot power prices gained for the first time in three days

LLC and ISO New England Inc. as demand exceeded forecasts.  On-peak electricity at PJM’s benchmark  Western hub  rose
$6.12, or 16 percent, to $44.73 a megawatt-hour at 4:12 p.m.,
the first gain in three days. The PJM grid stretches from  New
Jersey  to  North Carolina .  Boston prices rose $5.59, or 17 percent, to $37.60 a
megawatt-hour from yesterday’s average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. showed. On-peak hours run from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.  New York  City and California prices were little changed
