China ’s gold imports from  Hong Kong 
slumped in April from a record as banks failed to get quotas
fast enough to meet surging demand from mainland buyers keen to
purchase bullion as prices fell into a  bear market .  Mainland buyers purchased 126,135 kilograms, including
scrap, compared with 223,519 kilograms in March, according to
Hong Kong government  data  yesterday. Net imports, after
deducting flows from China into Hong Kong, were 75,891
kilograms, from 130,038 kilograms a month earlier, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  Gold slid into a bear market in April and had its biggest
drop in 33 years in the two days through April 15 on concern
that the U.S. Federal Reserve may rein in stimulus that helped
bullion cap a 12-year bull run in 2012 and as investors dumped
holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the metal. Quotas
were in short supply after imports reached a record in March.
Only qualified banks that secure quotas from the Chinese central
bank can import gold to the mainland.  “Some qualified banks used up their gold import quota in
the first three months and weren’t able to get the paperwork
done fast enough to bring in bullion in April,” said Tian Rui,
vice president of the precious metals division at INTL FCStone
Trading Co. “We might see higher imports in May because demand
surged after the rout.”  Bullion of 99.99  percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange dropped 7.4 percent in April, and was at 278.55  yuan  a
gram ($1,414 an ounce) at 9:22 a.m. local time.  Spot Gold  Spot gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,399.20 an
ounce at 9:22 a.m. Shanghai time today and has declined 17
percent this year.  China’s purchases in April were 22 percent higher than the
103,644.5 kilograms in the same month last year, according to
the data from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department.
Mainland China doesn’t publish such data.  Exports of gold to Hong Kong from China were 50,244
kilograms in April, according to a separate Statistics
Department statement, down from 93,481 kilograms in March, and
compared with 37,316 kilograms in April 2012.  Volumes for the  spot contract  on the  Shanghai  Gold
Exchange, China’s biggest cash bullion market, topped 323 tons
between April 16 and May 3, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The trading volume exceeded 20 tons every day from
April 16 to May 3, when prices fell to the lowest since August
2010. That’s more than four times the daily average in 2012.
Volumes reached a record 43,272 kilograms on April 22.  China Premium  The  premium  gold buyers in China pay to take immediate
delivery of bullion jumped four-fold as consumers swarmed
jewelry shops after prices plunged by the most in three decades.  In the 12 months through April 12, before the rout, gold
for immediate delivery in China traded at an average premium of
$7.22 an ounce to the prevailing global counterpart, according
to the Shanghai Gold Exchange data. The premium has averaged $31
an ounce since mid-April, as physical demand surged, and was at
$14.07 at 9:23 a.m. today in Shanghai.  Still, gold demand in China, the world’s largest consumer
after  India , may slow after surging in April, said Zhang
Bingnan, secretary-general of the China Gold Association.  “The kind of frenzied buying in late April and early May
won’t be repeated,” Zhang said on May 28, adding that some of
the jewelry demand earmarked for festivals or weddings later
this year may have been brought forward to April and May after
prices fell.  China’s domestic consumption totaled 776.1 tons in 2012,
down from 779.8 tons the previous year, according to the
producer-funded World Gold Council. China and India account for
more than half of global demand.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
