Impax Laboratories Inc. , a maker of
generic drugs, will fire about 10 percent of its workforce, as
the company moves production to a manufacturing plant in Taiwan.  Most of the 110 jobs lost will be at a facility in Hayward,
California, the company said in a statement today. Impax had
1,125 employees at the end of 2012, when the Hayward-based
company generated $582 million in annual sales.  Use of the more cost-efficient Taiwan plant led to less
need for the U.S. facility, Impax said. In addition to
manufacturing jobs, two dozen salespeople and managers will be
fired because of a delay in regulatory approval for the
Parkinson’s disease drug Rytary. The manufacturing job cuts will
lead to about $15 million in annual cost savings, and the
company may hire more employees if the medicine is approved.  “This reduction in our workforce was a difficult decision,
but necessary to position Impax for a brighter future,” Chief
Executive Officer  Larry Hsu  said in the statement. “We remain
committed to advancing our generic and brand business pipelines
and growth strategy.”  The cuts don’t affect Impax’s financial  outlook  for 2013,
the company said.  Impax rose 1 percent to $18.95 at 9:45 a.m. New York time.
The stock had  fallen 8 percent  in the 12 months through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
