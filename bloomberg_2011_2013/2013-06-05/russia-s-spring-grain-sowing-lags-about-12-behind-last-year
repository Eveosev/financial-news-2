Russia planted 20.9 million hectares
(51.6 million acres) with spring grains and legumes as of May
24, or about 12 percent less than a year earlier, the Federal
State Statistics Service said.  Corn sowing exceeded last year’s area by about 26 percent
and reached 2.2 million hectares, while sunflower seeds planting
was 5.2 percent up from last year at about 6 million hectares,
the service, known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
