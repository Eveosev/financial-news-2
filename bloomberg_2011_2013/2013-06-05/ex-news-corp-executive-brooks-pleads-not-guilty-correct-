(Corrects to remove information from sixth paragraph of
story published yesterday.)  Rebekah Brooks, the former chief
executive officer of  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. unit, pleaded not guilty
to charges she conspired to hack into phone messages.  Brooks, 45, also pleaded not guilty to charges she
conspired to pervert the course of justice and charges that she
conspired to commit misconduct in public office. Brooks and nine
others entered not guilty pleas at a hearing in London today.  Brooks, a past editor of both the News of the World and
News Corp.’s Sun daily newspaper, was also charged over claims
she perverted the course of justice along with her husband,
Charlie Brooks, and six other people. The defendants, including
a former News Corp. security official, pleaded not guilty to the
perversion of justice charges today.  Along with Brooks, former News of the World Managing Editor
Stuart Kuttner and Assistant News Editor James Weatherup pleaded
not guilty to phone-hacking charges.  Clive Goodman , a former
reporter at the paper, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to
commit misconduct in public office.  A three-month trial is tentatively scheduled to start in
September.  Other defendants in the obstruction case include  Cheryl
Carter , Brooks’s longtime former personal assistant; Mark Hanna,
the former head of security at News International;  Paul Edwards ,
Brooks’s chauffeur; and Lee Sandell, a former security-staff
