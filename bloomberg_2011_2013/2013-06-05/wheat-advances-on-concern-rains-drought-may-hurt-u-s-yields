Corn fell for a third day in  Chicago 
on speculation global supplies following the next Northern
Hemisphere harvest will be ample even after excess rain cut
sowing in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  U.S. farmers had yet to  plant  9 percent of corn crops in
the main growing areas as of June 2, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said. Last year, planting was complete by that time.
The area sown to corn may be 93.5 million acres, 3.9 percent
less than the USDA’s forecast in March, Morgan Stanley said June
3. That still would leave production at a record 13.3 billion
bushels, 23 percent larger than last year’s drought-reduced
crop, the bank said.  “Maybe there will be less corn than expected, but it’s
still going to be a record crop,” Dave Norris, an independent
grain broker in Harrogate,  England , said by telephone today.
“With potential increases in production in Ukraine and  Russia 
and other Black Sea countries, it’s difficult to paint it too
bullish, even if the U.S. does lose 3 or 4 million acres of corn
this year.”  Corn for delivery in December dropped 0.7 percent to $5.49
a bushel at 5:15 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
declining 2.5 percent in the previous two days.  Russia’s total grain harvest may climb to 95 million metric
tons this season from 70.9 million tons a year earlier, Interfax
reported, citing Deputy Agriculture Minister Ilya Shestakov. The
USDA expects corn grown in a 12-country bloc of former Soviet
Union nations to gain 23 percent from a year earlier and wheat
output to rebound 39 percent as crops recover from dry weather.  Soybeans for delivery in July rose 0.1 percent to $15.3025
a bushel and wheat for the same delivery month added 0.1 percent
to $7.0975 a bushel. In Paris, milling wheat for delivery in
November fell 0.2 percent to 207 euros ($270) a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
