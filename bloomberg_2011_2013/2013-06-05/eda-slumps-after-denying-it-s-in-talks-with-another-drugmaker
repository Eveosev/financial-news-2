Meda AB (MEDAA)  had the biggest drop in more
than a year after the maker of the Dymista allergy medicine said
it’s not in talks to merge with another pharmaceutical company.  The stock fell 6.9 percent to 81.25 Swedish kronor at 9:16
a.m. in  Stockholm , after declining as much as 9.1 percent, the
steepest drop since Feb. 17, 2012. Meda had the biggest intraday
gain in a year on May 31 after the Wall Street Journal reported
the Solna, Sweden-based company was in talks to be acquired by
 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP)  for almost $5 billion.  “There are currently no such discussions,” the drugmaker
said in the statement today. “Meda’s policy is not to comment
on speculation and will not do so in the future. This
announcement is an exception to our policy.”  Sun, India’s biggest drugmaker by market value, is looking
to expand in the U.S. and  Europe  and last year considered a
purchase of German generic-drug maker  Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ) ,
people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. Meda makes
nervous-system, pain and inflammation treatments which generated
sales of 12.9 billion Swedish kronor in 2012 ($2 billion).  While Meda seems like an “adequate target” for Sun due to
location and product portfolio, Stada remains “the simplest
route for Sun to build up significant business in Western and
Eastern Europe,” Thomas Maul, an analyst with DZ Bank AG, said
in a note to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
