Natural gas futures declined in  New
York  for the first time in three days on forecasts that a weekly
report will show a larger-than-average stockpile increase.  Gas dropped as much as 0.6 percent. Government data
scheduled for release tomorrow in  Washington  may show that
inventories rose 99 billion cubic feet in the seven days ended
May 31, according to the median of 11 analyst  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for the week is 92
billion. Supplies rose 63 billion the same week last year.  “This could be the biggest storage injection for a
while,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst for Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “If we see a number in the triple
digits, that’s going to put a negative spin on the market.”  Natural gas for July delivery fell 1.7 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.981 per million British thermal units at 9:19
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 40
percent below the average for the time of day. The futures have
gained 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
