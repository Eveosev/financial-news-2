CC Sabathia struck out nine and
pitched his first complete game of the season as the  New York 
Yankees held on to beat the Cleveland Indians 6-4 and complete a
three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium.  Staked to a 6-0 lead after two innings, Sabathia took a
perfect game into the fifth inning, and threw 115 pitches for
his sixth win of the season. The 32-year-old left hander allowed
a pair of runs in the sixth and seventh innings before retiring
seven of the final eight batters.  The Yankees built their lead on a two-run home run from
Travis Hafner and a three-run homer from  Brett Gardner . Yan
Gomes hit a home run for Cleveland.  The Yankees outscored the Indians 17-11 in the three-game
series. New York is now 34-25, two games behind the  Boston Red
Sox  in the American League East division.  To contact the reporters on this story:
