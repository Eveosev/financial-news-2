Most  Chinese stocks  rose as wine
companies climbed after the government started an anti-dumping
probe into European Union imports. Industrial companies fell as
BNP Paribas SA said the slowing economy may hurt prospects.  Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Co. (000869)  and Tonghua Grape Wine Co.
jumped at least 6.2 percent as  China  announced an investigation
on EU products after the regional group imposed tariffs on
Chinese solar products.  Citic Securities Co. (600030)  gained on
speculation a government plan to bolster the brokerage industry
will increase earnings.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , the biggest
construction machinery company, dropped 1.1 percent after BNP
Paribas advised an underweight allocation for industrial stocks.  About six stocks rose for every five that dropped on the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which slipped less than 0.1 percent to
2,270.93 at the close. The CSI 300 Index lost 0.2 percent to
2,560.54. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  retreated 0.9
percent. The ChiNext index rose 0.6 percent. The Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index slid 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday.  “The economy is lackluster and there aren’t any drivers
for stocks,” Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang Securities
Co., said in Shanghai. “Investors are waiting for first-half
company earnings” from next month, he said.  China’s benchmark indexes have fallen over the past week on
signs small businesses are struggling. The official  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index for smaller companies slid in May, even as the
broader gauge rose, while a PMI index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics that includes small enterprises fell more than
forecast to an eight-month low.  Anti-Dumping Probe  The Shanghai index’s trading volumes were 26 percent below
the 30-day average today, while 30-day  volatility  was at 15.5,
compared with this year’s average of 19.2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It trades at 9.2 times 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with the seven-year average of 15.5 times,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure gained 5.6
percent last month, the most since December.  Yantai Changyu, the listed unit of the country’s biggest
vintner, jumped by the 10 percent daily limit to 44.44  yuan .
Tonghua Grape Wine gained 6.2 percent to 11.86 yuan.  Citic Guoan
Vine Co. (600084)  surged 10 percent to 5.61 yuan.  Commerce Ministry Spokesman Shen Danyang said China has
started procedures for anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes on
EU wine, according to a statement posted on the ministry’s
website. The move came after the EU decided yesterday to impose
tariffs as high as 67.9 percent on solar panels from China.  Underweight Cyclicals  “It’s a signal,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia
economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. China had said in the
past that “there will be consequences, so they have to back it
up with action.”  Citic Securities Co., China’s biggest listed brokerage,
added 1.1 percent to 12.88 yuan. Haitong Securities Co., the
second largest, rose 0.9 percent to 11.80 yuan.  The nation is drafting a development plan for the
securities industry that aims to grow it ten-fold, the newspaper
said. Regulators may encourage brokerages to develop fixed-income and M&A financing businesses this year, it said.  A gauge of industrial companies in the CSI 300 dropped 0.5
percent, the second most among the 10 indexes. Sany Heavy fell
1.1 percent to 9.06 yuan.  Jiangsu Zhongnan Construction Group
Co. (000961)  sank 5 percent to 10.85 yuan. Xiamen C & D Inc., an
investment holding company, lost 4.7 percent to 7.58 yuan.  Investors should underweight Chinese domestic cyclical
shares, particularly industrial and financial companies, as the
country undergoes a structural slowdown, BNP analyst Manishi Raychaudhuri wrote in a report dated today.  The statistics bureau will release May industrial output,
retail sales, and inflation data on June 9 along with fixed-asset investment for the first five months of the year. The
customs administration will report May trade figures on June 8.
