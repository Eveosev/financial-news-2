Bayer AG  and a  Merck KGaA  unit sued
 Actavis Inc.  in Delaware over a planned generic version of the
birth-control drug Safyral.  “Plaintiffs are entitled to relief” from competition
until patent protection ends, and Actavis was aware that its
plan “constitutes an act of infringement,” lawyers for Bayer
and Merck said in the complaint.  Merck & Cie, based in Altdorf, Switzerland, owns the
patent, and Bayer Pharma AG is the exclusive licensee, according
to the complaint. Merck & Cie is a unit of Merck KGaA, based in
Darmstadt, Germany.  Bayer and Merck asked for a ruling that Actavis, based in
Corona, California, infringed claims of the patent and are
seeking damages and an injunction to bar Actavis from marketing
the  Safyral  tablets in the U.S. before the patent’s 2020
expiration date.  An Actavis spokesman,  Charlie Mayr , didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Merck & Cie v. Watson Laboratories Inc., 13-cv-00978, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent in the lawsuit, click: 6,441,168.  To contact the reporter on this story:
