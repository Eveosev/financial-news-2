My MIT colleague  Frank Levy  had the great idea a while back to put on a series of lunches bringing together the MIT economics, business, computer science, and robotics geeks who are interested in how recent technological progress is affecting the economy and labor force. It's a large group, and a ridiculously impressive one. The Institute is home to some of the world's best people in each of these areas, so the lunches always leave me with a buzzing head, a full notebook, and an advanced case of  impostor syndrome. At our most recent lunch  Bill Freeman  gave us a short overview of the state of computer vision, his specialty. And he organized his remarks in a way that brought home to me how fast digital progress is these days. He introduced us to the field by listing some of its particular goals â€” problems people have been working on since they started hooking cameras up to computers and digitizing images in the 1970s.  They include: All of these are obviously valuable for robotics, security, industry, navigation and guidance, and lots of other purposes. So where are we on them at present?  Here's Freeman's assessment: In short, we're almost there.  The combination of fast computers, big data, and smart geeks has allowed the field of computer vision to reach many of its goals. And the computers are only getting faster, the data bigger, and the geeks smarter and more numerous thanks to  MOOCs (massive, open, online courses)  and other educational innovations. All of this leads me to conclude that progress in other fields will also be rapid, and we'll see lots of other milestones being reached soon. Robots will  walk across rooms  and  fold towels ,  translation software  will allow you to have a smooth conversation with someone who does not share a language with you, computers will  diagnose diseases better than any human doctor , and science fiction will become everyday reality in countless other ways in the years to come. I make these predictions not because I have inside knowledge in any of these areas. I make them simply because they're important problems of the digital world, and fast hardware, big data, and smart geeks are proving again and again to be the right team for solving them. Anybody want to bet against that team? If so, I'd love to hear why.
