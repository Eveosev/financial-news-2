ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-largest
telecommunications equipment maker, said it won a contract to
build an optical network for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to carry
most of the e-commerce company’s data traffic.  The first stage of the project will cover Hangzhou, where
Alibaba is based, as well as the cities of Beijing and Tianjin,
ZTE said in an e-mailed statement. Financial terms of the
contract weren’t disclosed.  ZTE overtook  Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU)  in the first quarter to
become the second-largest supplier in the global $14.5 billion
optical networking market behind Huawei Technologies Co.,
researcher Ovum said in a report last month. Sales on Alibaba’s
Taobao and Tmall sites surpassed 1 trillion  yuan  ($163 billion)
last year, exceeding 2 percent of  China ’s gross domestic
product.  Shares of ZTE rose 2.3 percent to HK$12.70 as of 1:19 p.m.
in Hong Kong trading. The stock has dropped 2.8 percent this
year.  ZTE said it will build an “ultra-large bandwidth, high
capacity” network for Alibaba.  The contract makes ZTE a “long-term partner” for
Alibaba’s broadband network construction and deployment, ZTE
said in the statement. John Spelich, a spokesman for Alibaba,
said he couldn’t provide additional comment on the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
