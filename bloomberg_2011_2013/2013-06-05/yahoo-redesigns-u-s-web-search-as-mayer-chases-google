Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  redesigned its U.S. Web
search as Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer works to revive
growth at the Internet portal.  Search results will now load faster and appear higher on
the page, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said today in
a  statement . The company is also introducing a navigation bar at
the top of the page to help users browse other Yahoo sites.  Mayer, CEO of the biggest U.S. Web portal since July, is
trying to lure users and advertisers back to Yahoo as it chases
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Facebook Inc. in the $17.7 billion market for
display ads. Mayer has made several acquisitions since taking
the helm, including last months’s $1.1 billion agreement to
acquire blogging network Tumblr Inc.  Yahoo  fell  1.9 percent to $25.75 at the close in New York.
The shares had advanced 29 percent this year compared with a 13
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
