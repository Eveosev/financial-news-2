Celgene Corp. (CELG) ’s Revlimid, the
company’s best-selling drug, won approval for wider use in
patients with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called mantle
cell lymphoma that starts in white blood cells.  The Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug for
patients who have already been treated for the disease and have
relapsed, the Summit, New Jersey-based company said today in a
statement.  Revlimid is already cleared for multiple myeloma, another
white blood cell cancer. The $3.8 billion drug, approved in
2005, may generate $5.9 billion in 2016, according to 14
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Mantle cell lymphoma is a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Patients use
 Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502) ’s Velcade and Roche Holding AG and
 Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) ’s Rituxan, approved for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  Celgene fell 4.7 percent to $112.20 at the close in New
York. The company has gained 74 percent in the past 12 months.  Mantle cell lymphoma represents about 2 percent to 7
percent of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas and primarily affects men
older than 50, according to the National Organization for Rare
Disorders. Almost 70,000 people are expected to be diagnosed and
19,000 will die from non-Hodgkin lymphoma this year.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and  Pharmacyclics Inc. (PCYC)  are studying
ibrutinib to treat mantle cell lymphoma patients who have
received other treatment.  Celgene asked for approval based on data from the second of
what are typically three phases of clinical trials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
