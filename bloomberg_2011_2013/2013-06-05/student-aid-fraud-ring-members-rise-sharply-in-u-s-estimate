The number of applicants for U.S.
student aid who were members of fraud rings, using bogus
identities and credentials to apply for government grants and
loans for college, has grown 82 percent since 2009, according to
an Education Department analysis.  The government lost about $187 million to such fraudulent
applicants from 2009 through 2012, the agency’s Office of the
Inspector General said today in a  report .  The Office of the Inspector General began calling attention
to the vulnerability of online education providers to fraud
rings in 2010. Two years ago, the office suggested that the
Education Department establish a system for flagging
applications from potential fraud conspirators, which the
department has said it is acting on.  For 2012, the office’s E-Fraud Data Analytical System
indicated that 34,007 applicants for federal student aid might
be members of fraud rings. In 2009, the number was 18,719, the
office said in its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
