General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
foreign automaker in  China , reported a 9.4 percent gain in new
sales last month on demand for Buick cars.  GM delivered 252,942 units in May, after a 15 percent
increase in the preceding month, according to a statement by the
Detroit-based company today.  Buick-branded vehicles led the rise, gaining 23 percent
from a year earlier to 63,007 units, the company said. Chevrolet
sales rose by 4.1 percent to 50,531 units, while Cadillac
deliveries jumped 74 percent to 3,843 units on the SRX crossover
and XTS sedan.  GM is stepping up its efforts in China as it works to
consolidate its position and fend off  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  in its
largest market. In the first three months of this year, GM
outsold Volkswagen for the first time in three quarters.  Its light commercial vehicle segment, Wuling, gained 1.7
percent to 121,756 units while it sold 74 percent more of the
low-cost Baojun brand at 8,706 units.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
