JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, lost its challenge to a cost-recovery
program sought by  California ’s grid operator before the  Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission .  The FERC conditionally approved the California Independent
System Operator’s plan to allow generators in the state to cover
some of their costs when providing power, according to an order
the agency released yesterday.  A JPMorgan energy-trading unit, JP Morgan Ventures Energy
Corp., had disputed the plan, saying that the grid operator had
violated FERC’s previous orders by resettling past cost-recovery
payments without the federal agency’s approval, according to the
filing.  “JP Morgan’s argument regarding the timing of the
resettlements does not demonstrate harm and relies solely on
process,” the FERC said in its order. The federal agency
directed the grid operator to file a report showing detailed
calculations of resettlement payments.  Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. The Sacramento Bee reported on the FERC’s
order yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
