Brovedani SpA and  Continental AG  will
receive state aid from the Slovak government in exchange for
pledges to create jobs at a time when the economy is slowing.  Slovakia’s Cabinet approved 3.6 million euros ($4.7
million) in tax breaks for Italy’s auto-parts maker Brovedani,
which is expanding production at its Slovak factory and will add
130 jobs, the government in the capital Bratislava said on its
website today. The project’s total costs are estimated at 14.3
million euros, according to the document.  Continental Matador Rubber was granted 19.9 million euros
in tax breaks in exchange for a 250 million-euro investment in
expansion of its tire factory, creating 595 jobs, according to
the government.  State aid combined with labor costs, which are lower than
in western Europe are helping the eastern euro-area member to
lure investors, mainly from the automotive industry. The
government relies on foreign investment to help cut unemployment
that at 14.4 percent in April is among the highest in European
Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
