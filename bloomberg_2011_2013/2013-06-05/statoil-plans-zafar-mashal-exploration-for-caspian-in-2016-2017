Statoil ASA (STL)  aims to sign a deal soon
with State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan for the Zafar-Mashal block in
the  Caspian Sea  and begin exploration in 2016 or 2017.  Exploration at Zafar-Mashal will depend on availability of
drilling rigs, Nick Maden, Statoil’s senior vice president for
international exploration, said today in the Azeri capital of
Baku. New rigs planned by Socar, as the country’s state oil
company is known, will speed up the process, Maden said.  Socar and Statoil signed a memorandum of understanding in
April to explore and develop Zafar-Mashal, seven years after
Exxon Mobil Corp. and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  withdrew from the deepwater
block about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southeast of Baku. Socar
estimates the block holds 300 billion cubic meters of natural
gas and 37 million metric tons of condensate, or light oil.  Socar yesterday agreed with Singapore-based Keppel Corp. to
build a modern drilling rig at an estimated cost of more than $1
billion. The companies are also in talks on a second rig to be
built at the same time, Socar President Rovnaq Abdullayev said.
 Azerbaijan  needs two more rigs to explore and develop offshore
fields including Babak, Umid, Absheron and Nakhchivan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
