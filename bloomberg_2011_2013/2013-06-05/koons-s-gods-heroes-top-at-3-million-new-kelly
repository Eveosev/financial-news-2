White, large and occasionally
cracked, Jeff Koons’s plaster sculptures of Greek gods and
heroes crowd David Zwirner gallery in Chelsea. Men in black
guard the works.  Titled “Gazing Ball,” Koons’s solo debut at the gallery
sent shockwaves through the art world because of the artist’s
long-term affiliation with Gagosian gallery. Apparently, he’s
spreading the love since the Gagosian has its own Koons show.  Each piece features a reflective blue ball balancing on a
limb, a head or a torso. At once mesmerizing and farcical, the
globes provide an easy distraction from classical beauty because
it’s impossible not to stare into their glossy, mirrored
surfaces -- and see your unclassical self.  Prices top at $3 million. The show runs through June 29 at
525 W. 19th St. +1-212-727-2072;  http://www.davidzwirner.com .  Gagosian Koons  The Gagosian Koons show, titled “New Paintings and
Sculpture,” is a more colorful and familiar affair. There is a
happy Incredible Hulk (made with polychromed bronze, resembling
stainless steel), and works that combine the imagery of Old
Masters with children’s doodles (painted by numerous assistants
who leave no trace of the human hand).  One space is occupied by three gigantic, phallic balloon
creatures from Koons’s “Celebration” series -- a red monkey, a
blue swan and a yellow rabbit.  “Celebration” series pieces have sold for as much as
$33.7 million at auction. The show runs through June 29 at 555
West 24th St. +1-212-741-1111;  http://www.gagosian.com .  Rodney Graham  Down the street at 303 Gallery, artist Rodney Graham poses
as an aging punk, a scientist and a construction worker on
stilts in a series of 10-foot-tall lightbox photographs.
Graham’s solo show inaugurates the gallery’s new 8,000-square-foot home underneath the High Line.  Prices range from $250,000 to $650,000. The show runs
through June 15 at 507 W.24th St. +1-212-255-1121;
 http://www.303gallery.com   Ellsworth Kelly  Matthew Marks gallery is celebrating the 90th birthday of
Ellsworth Kelly by showing 14 paintings and two sculptures
created in the past two years.  Luminous, orderly and meditative, many of the works are
formed by superimposed monochrome canvases, creating three-dimensional reliefs. The 3-panel “Gold With Orange Reliefs” is
the first time Kelly has used a metallic color in a painting.  Prices start at $2 million. The show runs through June 29
at 522 and 502 W. 22nd St. and 523 W. 24th St. 212-243-0200;

Bosch’s apocalyptic visions and ghouls.  He uses torn towels, stained Hanes underwear, wool,
feathers and diapers. One cheerful monster hovers over a garbage
can; Another mimics the pose in Munch’s “The Scream.”  Prices range from $6,000 to $40,000. The show runs through
June 22 at 535 W. 22nd St. +1-212-741-8849;
 http://www.andrewkreps.com .  Mark di Suvero  Mark di Suvero’s steel sculpture “Little Dancer” at Paula
Cooper gallery weighs 13,100 pounds and is 19 feet tall. A
curvy, spiral shape hangs from one of several intersecting I-beams that form the bulky structure, lending it playful
lightness. In the next room, an 8-by-16-foot painting,
“Origins,” echoes the spiraling motif with blue swirls cutting
through red, orange and yellow.  Prices range from $450,000 to $3 million. The show runs
through June 28 at 534 W.21st St. +1-212-255-1105;
 http://www.paulacoopergallery.com .  Ugo Rondinone  Next door, Ugo Rondinone has populated the Gladstone
gallery with sculptures made of stacked stones suggestive of the
human figure in its most elemental, monolithic form. Displayed
on concrete pedestals, they feature cracks, moss and dirt. The
smallest rises 20 inches high, the largest is 7 feet tall.
Titled “Soul,” the show accompanies Rondinone’s nine massive
Stonehenge-like figures outside of  Rockefeller Center  as part of
an exhibition organized by Tishman Speyer Properties LP and the
Public Art Fund.  Prices start at $70,000 -- all works have been sold. The
show runs through July 3 at 530 W. 21st St. +1-212-206-7606;
 http://www.gladstonegallery.com .  Tabitha Vevers  For “Lover’s Eyes,” Tabitha Vevers’s solo debut at Lori
Bookstein Fine Art, the artist sourced imagery from Cranach, El
Greco and Picasso. Each of her miniature oil paintings zooms in
on the gaze of the subject: male on one wall, female on the
opposite wall.  Prices range from $3,200 to $5,500. The show runs through
June 29 at 138 Tenth Ave. +1-212-750-0949;
