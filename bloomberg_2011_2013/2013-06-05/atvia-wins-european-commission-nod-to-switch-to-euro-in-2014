Latvia  won the European Commission’s endorsement to switch to the euro in 2014, making it the 18th country to use the currency.  Latvia met targets for inflation, deficits, debt, long-term interest rates and currency stability, the Brussels-based commission said in a statement today.  Latvia needs to keep inflation down by preventing a re-emergence of the credit bubble that burst in the run-up to the economic crisis, the commission said. It said Latvia is “well integrated” with the broader European economy.  European finance ministers, who have never overturned a commission recommendation on euro eligibility, will make the final decision on Latvia on July 9.
