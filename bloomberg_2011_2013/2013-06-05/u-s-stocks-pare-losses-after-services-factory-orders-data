U.S. stocks pared losses after
separate reports showed service industries grew more than
forecast last month and factory orders in April trailed
estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent to
1,629.06 at 10:05 a.m. in New York, trimming an earlier decline
of as much as 0.4 percent.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index, which covers almost 90 percent of the economy, rose to
53.7 in May from 53.1 the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group said today.  A separate report from the Commerce Department showed U.S.
factory orders rose 1 percent in April, following a revised 4.7
percent decline the prior month. The median forecast of 61
economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted orders would climb by
1.5 percent.  An earlier report from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Research Institute showed employers added 135,000 workers in
May, up from a revised 113,000 in April. That was fewer than the
165,000 median forecast of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent yesterday, the seventh day of
alternating between gains and losses as Fed policy makers
continue to debate whether the economy is strong enough to begin
reducing monetary stimulus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
