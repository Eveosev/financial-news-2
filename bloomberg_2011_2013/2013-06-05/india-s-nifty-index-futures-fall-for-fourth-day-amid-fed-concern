Most Indian stocks climbed after a
three-day decline in the benchmark index lured some investors.
Oil and gas companies led the advance.  The S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.1 percent to 19,568.22 at close
in Mumbai, with volume 25 percent less than the 30-day average.
Three stocks climbed for every two that retreated.  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining complex,
rallied 2.8 percent, ending a four-day drop. Oil &  Natural Gas 
Corp., the nation’s biggest explorer, climbed for a second day.
 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP)  added 1.8 percent.  The Sensex slid to a more than one-month low yesterday amid
concern that the nation’s slowing economic growth would prompt
foreign funds to pare their holdings. The drop dragged the
Sensex’s valuation to 13.48 times  projected 12-month profits 
yesterday, the lowest reading in more than five weeks.  “The markets have been suppressed continuously for few
days and is looking reasonable on a price-to-earnings basis,”
Chokkalingam G, chief investment officer with Centrum Wealth
Management Ltd. in Mumbai, told Bloomberg TV  India  today. “We
have hit a short-term bottom and should recover from here.”  Foreign funds have bought a net $15.2 billion of  Indian (SENSEX) 
equities this year, the second-highest among 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg, even as government data showed May 31 the
 economy  grew a decade-low 5 percent in the year ended March and
a separate report June 3 showed factory output in May fell to a
50-month low.  Reliance increased 2.8 percent to 802 rupees, ending a
four-day, 8 percent drop. The stock has the second-highest
weighting in the Sensex. Oil & Natural Gas gained 2 percent to
324.6 rupees, the most since May 28.  Sun, Maruti  Sun Pharmaceutical advanced 1.8 percent to 1,037 rupees.
 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  added 1.4 percent to 1,568.3 rupees,
the most since May 24, ending three days of losses.  HDFC Bank
Ltd. (HDFCB) , the second-biggest private lender, added 0.7 percent to
687.95 rupees.  The Sensex has slumped 3.5 percent since reaching a more
than two-year high on May 17, paring its gain for the year to
0.7 percent. The gauge’s 14-day relative strength index was at
44.8, near the lowest level since April 15.  The 50-stock  CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange
of India Ltd. rose 0.1 percent to 5,923.85. Its June futures
settled at 5,944.90. India VIX, which gauges the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, dropped 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
