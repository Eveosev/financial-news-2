The death of former Russian spy
 Alexander Litvinenko  in London in 2006 should be the subject of
a public inquiry, the coroner responsible for the inquest said.  Judge Robert Owen  wrote  to Justice Secretary  Chris Grayling 
yesterday asking him to order a probe into the circumstances
surrounding the death of Litvinenko, a critic of the Kremlin who
lived in London and died about three weeks after being exposed
to radioactive polonium hidden in a pot of tea.  British prosecutors said in 2007 that another former
Russian intelligence officer,  Andrei Lugovoi , should be charged
with murder. There is evidence indicating the Russian government
was also involved, lawyers working on the inquest said in
December. Russia has refused requests for Lugovoi’s extradition.  Grayling’s office will consider the application carefully,
a spokeswoman for the minister said by telephone. The request
will also be reviewed by the Home Office and Foreign Office, she
said.  Owen ruled last month that some testimony to the inquest
would be heard in secret, compromising his ability to hold a
“full, fair” investigation.  Litvinenko’s death led to a worsening of diplomatic
relations between the U.K. and Russia. He blamed Russian
President Vladimir Putin for the murder in a death-bed
statement, an accusation the Kremlin called “absurd.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
