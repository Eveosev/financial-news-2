Indonesia’s rupiah headed for its
biggest drop in almost 11 months after global funds sold the
nation’s assets amid a lack of clarity on fuel-subsidy policy
and speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its stimulus.  Overseas investors pulled $1.1 billion from stocks and
 government bonds  since the beginning of last week, exchange and
finance ministry data show. In April, President  Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono  made an increase in fuel prices conditional on
parliament approving a compensation package for the poor. Bank
Indonesia’s foreign-exchange reserves may have dropped to as low
as $102 billion in May, the least since February 2011, according
to a PT Mandiri Sekuritas research note.  “The rupiah will be under pressure seeing the outflows, as
investors are still worried about the fuel policy,” said Billie Fuliangsahar, head of treasury at PT Rabobank International
Indonesia in Jakarta. “If foreign reserves fall below the
psychological level of $100 billion, the rupiah will be under
even more pressure.”  The Indonesian currency weakened 0.7 percent to 9,870 per
dollar as of 12:32 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since July
12, 2012, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. It traded at a 0.7 percent premium to the one-month
non-deliverable forwards, which gained 0.1 percent to 9,939 per
dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Kansas City Fed President Esther George yesterday called
for a reduction in the central bank’s bond-buying, while San
Francisco Fed President  John Williams  said a “modest adjustment
downward” was possible “as early as this summer.” The
monetary authority’s $85 billion a month of purchases has
increased fund flows to  emerging markets .  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
79 basis points, or 0.79 percentage point, to 7.96 percent.  The yield on government bonds due May 2023 climbed three
basis points to 6.06 percent, the highest level since Sept. 5,
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
