A  CapLease Inc.  shareholder sued to
block the company’s proposed $2.2 billion sale to real-estate
investment trust American Realty Capital Properties Inc., saying
the price is too low.  American Realty , seeking to expand its holdings of single-tenant commercial properties, agreed to pay $8.50 a share for
CapLease’s common stock, or about $755 million, plus the
assumption of debt, according to a May 28 regulatory  filing .
That’s 20 percent higher than the May 24 closing price of $7.10.
CapLease preferred shares will be converted into the right to
receive $25 a share in cash plus accrued dividends.  Jacquelyn Mizani sued both companies in state Supreme Court
in Manhattan yesterday, calling the transaction “grossly
inadequate” to CapLease  shareholders . She’s seeking to proceed
on behalf of a class of CapLease investors.  CapLease, based in New York,  owns  real estate across the
U.S. ranging from single-tenant office buildings to distribution
centers. Its largest tenants include the federal government, Aon
Corp. and Kroger Co., according to the regulatory filing. The
acquisition, which should be completed in the third quarter,
will add more than 70 properties to American Realty’s portfolio,
bringing its total to about 800.  Brad Cohen, a spokesman for CapLease with ICR LLC, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit.
American Realty didn’t immediately return a phone message left
at its New York headquarters today seeking comment.  The case is Mizani v. CapLease Inc., 651986/2013, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
