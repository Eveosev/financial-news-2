Gold rebounded to trade above $1,400
an ounce as equities retreated and the dollar’s rally halted,
boosting demand for the metal as a store of value. Silver,
platinum and palladium increased.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.7 percent to $1,408.50 an
ounce, and traded at $1,405.06 at 2:12 p.m. in  Singapore . Prices
decreased 0.9 percent yesterday. Cash silver advanced 0.4
percent to $22.6295 an ounce.  Gold dropped 16 percent this year as investors sold the
metal from exchange-traded products at a record pace and the
MSCI All-Country World Index rallied 7.8 percent. Asian stocks
fell for the fourth time in five days, while the  Dollar Index 
lost 0.2 percent. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust declined to
1,010.45 metric tons, shrinking for the first time in a week.  “The decline in the stock markets appears to be lifting
gold,” said Huang Fulong, an analyst at CITICS Futures Co., a
unit of  China ’s largest listed brokerage. “The dollar’s
performance has kept gold in a tight range. We continue to watch
ETF flows with interest.”  Bullion for August delivery gained 0.5 percent to $1,404.20
an ounce on the Comex, after sliding 1 percent yesterday as
 India , the world’s biggest consumer, widened curbs on imports.
The restrictions on overseas purchases by banks on a consignment
basis will be expanded to include state-run trading companies
and others authorized to directly import gold, the  Reserve Bank 
of India said.  Platinum climbed 0.4 percent to $1,499.50 an ounce, while
palladium rose 0.6 percent to $755.10 an ounce. Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd., the second-biggest producer of the metal, said
yesterday about 3,000 workers began an unauthorized strike after
an employee was dismissed from one of its South African mines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
