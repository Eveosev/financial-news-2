 A Dell Inc. board committee said
Carl Icahn’s takeover offer has a “significant liquidity gap”
that may lower the value of a dividend he proposed as part of
his buyout plan.  Billionaire Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management Inc.,
who together own about 13 percent of Dell, teamed up last month
to propose a counteroffer to founder Michael Dell and Silver
Lake Management LLC’s $24.4 billion buyout. Icahn’s plan
involves existing cash at the PC maker and about $5.2 billion in
new debt for Dell to offer investors $12 a share in cash or
stock while letting them retain stakes in a public company.  A liquidity gap may cut the value of Icahn’s proposed $12
dividend to $9.35 a share -- and to as low as $8.50 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
