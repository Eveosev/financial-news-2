Serbia’s Pensioners Party will not
agree to pension cuts and is prepared to withdraw support for
the government, which will lead to early elections in October,
weekly magazine NIN reported, citing deputy Prime Minister  Jovan Krkobabic .  Taking away 5,000 dinars ($57.6) from each of 1.75 million
pensioners in the country may plug a budget hole and also
trigger a “plague” among the nation’s elderly population, the
Belgrade-based magazine cited Krkobabic as saying. He also leads
the Pensioners party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
