Dallas temperatures may reach 100
degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) and Houston may see the 90s by
mid-June, boosting energy demand for cooling, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC .  Readings across Texas are expected to be 5 to 8 degrees
above normal from June 10 to June 19, Rogers said in a forecast
today. Temperatures along the East Coast from Maine and the
Canadian Maritimes to South Carolina will probably be seasonal.  “In terms of duration and intensity, the Texas area
continues to take center stage in the 6- to 15-day forecast
range,” said Rogers, who’s based in Bethesda, Maryland.  Higher-than-normal temperatures in large population areas
can spur natural gas needs as more people turn to air
conditioning to keep cool. Power plants will account for 32
percent of U.S. gas consumption this year, Energy Information
Administration data show.  A loose collection of thunderstorms currently moving over
the  Gulf of Mexico  will cross Florida and head up the East Coast
through the weekend, Rogers said. The rain and clouds will lower
temperatures just enough that there may be a decrease in daytime
energy demand in those areas, he said.  The  U.S. National Hurricane Center  gives that weather
system, now off Florida’s west coast, a 50 percent chance of
becoming tropical in the next two days.  The normal average temperature on June 14 in  New York  City
is 72 degrees, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston, it’s 68; Chicago, 69;
Houston, 82;  St. Louis , 76; and in Burbank, California, 69.  To contact the reporter on this story:
