Japanese property stocks, including
 Daikyo Inc. (8840)  and  NTT Urban Development Corp. (8933) , rose in Tokyo after
the Nikkei newspaper reported Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will
outline an economic plan promoting high-rise apartments.  Daikyo gained as much as 7.5 percent to 328 yen and traded
at 315 yen as of 10:10 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. NTT
Urban advanced 4 percent to 123,700 yen. The 43-member Topix
Real Estate Index rose as much as 2.9 percent and was up 0.2
percent.  Abe has pledged to end deflation to boost the world’s
third-largest economy, including measures to revive the property
industry, which has been struggling since an asset bubble burst
two decades ago. He will seek to loosen rules in special zones
in  Tokyo  to allow more high-rise apartments, Nikkei reported,
without citing anyone. Abe is scheduled to speak on the growth
plan details at 12:30 p.m. local time.  “It’s positive news for the residential sector,” said
Hirokazu Anai, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo.
“Easing the floor ratio will benefit city developers.”  Mitsui Fudosan Co., Mitsubishi Estate Co., Sumitomo Realty
& Development Co., Tokyu Land Corp., Tokyo Tatemono Co., NTT
Urban and Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc., which own land
reserved for condominium developments, are among those to
benefit in the long run, Anai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
