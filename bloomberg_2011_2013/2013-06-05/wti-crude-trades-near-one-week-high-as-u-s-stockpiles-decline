West Texas Intermediate crude rose
for a second day in  New York , trading near its highest level in
a week after U.S. stockpiles dropped the most this year.  Futures climbed as much as 0.8 percent after gaining 0.5
percent yesterday. U.S. crude supplies slid by  6.3 million
barrels  last week, the most since December, data from the Energy
Information Administration showed yesterday. They were projected
to decline by 800,000 barrels, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Monthly U.S. jobs data will be released tomorrow. The
 European Central Bank  and  Bank of England  kept their benchmark
 interest rates  unchanged.  “The weekly inventory data yesterday surprised quite a
bit,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S
in Copenhagen, said by phone today. “We have the U.S. monthly
job report tomorrow and central bank meetings today, so there’s
potential for a bit of position squaring.”  WTI for July delivery advanced as much as 72 cents to
$94.46 a barrel, and was at $94.27 a barrel, up 53 cents, in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:01
p.m. London time. The volume of all futures traded was 14
percent above the 100-day average. The contract rose 43 cents
yesterday to $93.74, the highest close since May 28.  Brent for July settlement increased 16 cents to $103.20 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark grade was at a premium of $8.90 to WTI
futures, down from $9.30 yesterday.  BFOE Loadings  The European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged at
a record low while improving confidence underscored President
 Mario Draghi ’s timetable for an economic recovery later this
year. The Bank of England maintained its benchmark interest rate
and held its asset purchase plan in line with economists
estimates.  Daily exports of North Sea Brent, Forties, Oseberg and
Ekofisk crudes, which make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will
increase by 7 percent in July from this month, loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News show.  U.S. gasoline inventories fell by 366,000 barrels last
week, said the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
Stockpiles were projected to increase by  1 million barrels ,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Distillate supplies, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, rose by 2.6 million barrels, compared with a
forecast 1.4 million barrel gain in the survey.  Gasoline Inventories  Refineries operated at 88.4 percent of capacity, up 2
percentage points to the highest level since Jan. 4, the EIA
said.  Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI
futures and the biggest oil storage hub in the U.S., dropped by
484,000 barrels last week to 50 million, according to the EIA
data. They fell for the first time in four weeks.  Domestic crude production exceeded imports for the first
time in 16 years, the EIA  figures  showed. Output increased 0.1
percent to 7.3 million barrels a day, while overseas purchases
dropped 7 percent to 7.27 million a day.  Canada ’s crude output will more than double to 6.7 million
barrels a day by 2030, provided new pipelines such as Keystone
XL are built to transport growing oil-sands production, an
industry group representing the country’s petroleum producers
said yesterday.  Crude from the  oil sands , the largest component of Canadian
output, will rise to 5.2 million barrels a day by 2030 from 1.8
million currently, the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers said in its 2013 annual forecast. The group boosted
its overall estimate for Canada by 500,000 barrels a day from a
2012 outlook.  Storm Andrea  Companies probably boosted payrolls by 165,000 workers last
month, matching the gain in April, according to the median
forecast from 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before a Labor
Department report this week.  Tropical Storm Andrea poses the risk of tornadoes across
central and southern  Florida  today, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said in an advisory. The storm, located about 160 miles
(255 kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida, is moving north-northeast at 14 miles per hour and is expected to increase
forward speed later today, the center said.  The  Atlantic hurricane season  began on June 1 and ends on
Nov. 30. Forecasters are expecting more than 12 storms, the 30-year average, will form in the Atlantic this year. The eastern
Pacific season began on May 15 and has already produced two
storms off the west coast of  Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
