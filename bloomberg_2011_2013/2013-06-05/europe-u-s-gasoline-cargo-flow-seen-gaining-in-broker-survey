The number of gasoline cargoes booked
for shipment to the U.S. from  Europe  is poised to climb during
the next two weeks, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders will charter a total of 22 Medium Range tankers for
loading to June 18, according to the median in a survey
yesterday of six shipbrokers. That’s four more vessels, each
normally carrying 37,000 metric tons of the auto fuel, compared
with a corresponding survey last week. There are 45 ships
available for the trade, 11 more than last week.  U.S. gasoline usage typically peaks during the so-called
driving season between the Memorial Day holiday in late May and
Labor Day in early September. Still, rising prices and a drop in
the number of miles driven are curbing total U.S. demand for the
fuel, according to maritime consultant Poten & Partners Inc.
Vessels plying the trans-Atlantic route were earning $10,329
daily as of yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 28, according to
the  Baltic Exchange  in  London .  Eleven of the 22 charters have been completed and the rest
are anticipated, according to the latest survey. Ship bookings
often contain clauses allowing vessels to sail to different
ports.  The survey is based on the industry’s benchmark Rotterdam-to-New York voyage, which takes about 11 days at 12.5 knots,
according to the sea-distances.com website. Below is a table of
ships chartered, probably hired and available to be booked for
the journey loading over the two-week periods from the dates
shown.  *T                             June 4      May 28       Change
