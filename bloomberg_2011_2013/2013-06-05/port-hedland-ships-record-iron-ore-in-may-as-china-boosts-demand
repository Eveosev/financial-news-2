Iron ore  shipments from  Australia ’s
 Port Hedland , the world’s biggest bulk terminal, climbed to a
record last month as  China ’s purchases rose to an all-time high.  Exports totaled 27.9 million metric tons compared with 26
million tons in April, data on the Port Hedland Port Authority’s
website showed. Shipments to China climbed to 23.3 million tons
in May from 19.3 million tons a month earlier.  Iron ore dropped into a  bear market  last month, retreating
from a 16-month high in February, on concern that slowing growth
in China would curb demand in the largest buyer. The decline
offered an excellent buying opportunity as Chinese mills will
need to restock, Morgan Stanley said on May 30. The price
rallied 4.2 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since October.  “Low iron ore prices could support  import  volumes,”
Clarkson  Capital Markets  wrote in a June 3 note. “With the
weaker  market sentiment  in the Chinese  steel industry , the spot
price for imported iron ore could drop to a level that would
stimulate inventory re-stocking.”  Iron ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin  gained  to $116.60 a dry ton yesterday, according
to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices dropped 18 percent in May,
touching $110.40 on May 31, the lowest level since October.  Inventories at Chinese ports rose a fifth week on May 31 to
70.72 million tons, the highest level since January, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Holdings had
dropped to 66.26 million tons on March 8, the lowest since 2009.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, and
 Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)  are among companies that ship ore
through the port, which is about 1,660 kilometers (1,031 miles)
northeast by road from Perth, capital of West Australia.
Australia is the world’s largest iron ore shipper.  To contact the reporter for this story:
