China  agreed to buy as much as 29
million bushels of soybeans from Perdue AgriBusiness Inc.,
Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell said in a June 3 statement
posted on the state’s website.  Perdue, which owns and operates a deep-water export
terminal for grains and oilseeds in Chesapeake, will supply
Dandong Port Group Co. and its affiliate Dandong Pasite Grain
and Oilseed Co. in a series of shipments for the 2013 crop,
according to the statement. The accord was reached last month in
Dandong during McDonnell’s trade mission to  Asia , it said.  The value of the shipments will depend on market prices at
the time each order is placed, it said. Soybeans rose 8.6
percent to $15.305 a bushel in Chicago trading this year. China
is the world’s biggest consumer of the oilseed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
