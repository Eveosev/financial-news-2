France  fell further behind Britain
and  Germany  in 2012 in attracting foreign direct investment,
according to consultant Ernst & Young.  The number of new investments in France fell 13 percent
last year to 471 from 540 in 2011, according to the company’s
annual  European Investment Monitor . New investments in Britain
rose 3 percent last year to 697, while in Germany they rose 4.5
percent to 624. Spain was in fourth place with 274 projects.  France remained the favorite European destination for U.S.
investors, while Asian and other emerging-market investors
increasingly preferred the U.K. and Germany, Ernst & Young said.  The cost of labor, taxes, and bureaucracy were the main
arguments against investing in France, according to a survey of
212 international companies in 25 countries that accompanied the
study. The quality of the workforce and infrastructures were
France’s main strengths, the survey found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
