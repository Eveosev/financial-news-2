Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ’s share of the
Indian market for  wind turbines  dropped for a second year as
more companies compete for orders in the world’s third-biggest
market for the machines.  Suzlon, based in Pune, India, supplied 35 percent of the 
2,923 megawatts of capacity added in the year through March, 
down from 41 percent the previous year, according to data from 
the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association. The company’s 
lead over its biggest local competitor, Enercon (India) Ltd., 
also narrowed to 11 percent from 20 percent.  Competition for orders in India is intensifying as
manufacturers seek expansion in new regions to counter weaker
growth in more established markets such as  China , the biggest. 
The expiry of a U.S. tax credit for wind farms at the end of the
year may also cut installations in that country by 95 percent,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  ReGen Powertech Pvt., which has a technology partnership
with Germany’s Vensys Energy AG, rose two places to become
India’s third-biggest supplier with a 14 percent share, after
selling 401 megawatts of turbines.  Spain’s  Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM)  and Denmark’s  Vestas
Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s biggest turbine-maker, slipped one
place each to be ranked fourth and fifth. They retained market
shares of 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
