Connacher Oil and Gas Ltd. ’s Great
Falls,  Montana , refinery is running at normal rates after the
naphtha heater was shut down following a May 24 fire.  The unit came back online May 25, and the shutdown didn’t
affect production, Jesse Beaudry, Calgary-based vice president
of sustainability for Connacher, said by phone.  “Things were back to normal in fairly short order,”
Beaudry said.  The plant, owned by Connacher’s Montana Refining Co.
subsidiary, produces 10,000 barrels of refined product a day and
receives heavy  crude oil  by pipeline and rail car, the Montana
Refining website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
