OMV AG (OMV) ’s investments in its Romanian
unit OMV  Petrom (SNP)  SA will depend on the country’s “fiscal
stability and regulation,” Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss said in an interview for  Ziarul Financiar .  Roiss said that any change in the Romanian taxing system
will impact the investment plan of Petrom, the country’s biggest
oil company, according to the Bucharest-based newspaper.  Romanian Economy Minister Daniel Chitoiu said on May 18
that the government is discussing new taxes on “exceptional”
profits of energy companies after freeing natural-gas and
electricity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
