The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 1.7 percent to 582.74 at 4:51 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
jumped 6.7 percent to 1,421.383.  CRUDE OIL  Oil gained a second day in  New York  before a government
report that may show stockpiles dropped forthe first time in 11
weeks in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of crude.  Oil for July delivery gained as much as 94 cents to $84.92
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $84.41 at 2:48 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday rose 0.9 percent to $83.98, the highest close
since May 31. Prices are 15 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rebounded after forecasts for cooler weather in
the eastern U.S. pulled futures to a four-week low in New York.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July rose $2.95, or 2.7 percent,
to $111.85 a barrel, PVM data showed. The premium of gasoil to
Dubai crude was at $15.60 a barrel, up 1 cent. Jet fuel traded
at a premium of 75 cents a barrel to gasoil, up 5 cents. This
spread, also known as the regrade, has narrowed 44 percent from
May 29, signaling it is less profitable to make  aviation fuel 
compared with a week earlier.  Naphtha swaps for July rose $28, or 3.7 percent, to $780.50
a metric ton at 10:08 a.m. Singapore time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Yesterday, prices
dropped to $752.50 a ton, the lowest since Bloomberg records
began in January 2011.  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $23 to $30.79 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Singapore fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from the fuel, widened to $2.35 a ton from $1.58
yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. The
spread is at the widest since May 16.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell for a second day, reversing an earlier advance,
as the euro weakened against the dollar before finance ministers
and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations hold
a call on  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Immediate-delivery gold slid as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,612.80 an ounce and was at $1,614.70 at 4:14 p.m. in
Singapore. The metal earlier climbed 0.3 percent along with
Asian stocks and other commodities on speculation that policy
makers from the U.S. to  China  will take steps to boost economies
after data signaled slowing growth.  August-delivery bullion was little changed at $1,615.70 an
ounce on the Comex in New York, after rising as much as 0.7
percent. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded product backed by bullion, stood unchanged at 1,273.88
metric tons yesterday, after climbing on June 1 for the first
time since May 24, the company’s website showed.  BASE METALS  Copper advanced for the first time in five days, rallying
from the lowest level in more than five months, amid speculation
global policy makers will take steps to stimulate economic
growth.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn dropped after climbing the most in two weeks as crop
conditions in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, held
steady last week after rain revived some dry fields in the
Midwest and South. Soybeans advanced.  Corn for July delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent to $5.66
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade before trading at $5.6725
at 3:10 p.m. in  Singapore . Earlier, the price rose as much as
0.4 percent. Futures jumped 3 percent yesterday, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since May 16, on concern dry
weather may threaten crops in the Midwest.  Rubber advanced as a four-day decline to the lowest level
in 30 months attracted buyers on speculation that global policy
makers may take steps to stimulate growth.  The November-delivery contract gained as much as 2.4
percent to 248.5 yen a kilogram ($3,175 a metric ton) before
settling at 243.8 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures
plunged to 240.3 yen yesterday, the lowest price since Nov. 30,
2009, as data from the U.S. and China raised concern that
slowing expansion may cut demand.  Soybeans for November delivery was little changed at $12.69
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for July
gained 0.3 percent to 48.46 cents a pound.  Palm oil  and soybean
oil are both used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil gained for the first time in five days as the
lowest price in seven months spurred buying by countries
stockpiling to meet higher demand during the Muslim fasting
month of Ramadan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
