Natural-gas consumption may rise 17
percent by 2017 from last year as demand surges in Asia and the
U.S., according to the  International Energy Agency . China’s use
of the fuel will double while  Europe ’s will remain below the
level of 2010, it said.  Demand worldwide will climb by 576 billion cubic meters to
3.937 trillion, the Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations
said today in its first Medium-Term Gas Market Report. That’s an
average increase of 2.7 percent a year, which is similar to the
growth during the last decade, the e-mailed report showed.
Emerging nations will account for 69 percent of the gain.  “Asia will be by far the fastest growing region, driven
primarily by China, which will emerge as the third-largest gas
user by 2013,” the IEA said. “Europe looks for a floor and
Americas for a ceiling.”  China ’s gas consumption will rise to 273 billion cubic
meters in 2017 from 130 billion in 2011, according to the IEA.
The increase of 13 percent a year compares with an annual
expansion of 20 percent over the past three years, it said.  U.S. demand will expand 13 percent to 779 billion cubic
meters by 2017, according to the report. While Europe’s
requirements will rise by 7.9 percent to 561 billion, that’s
still below the 570 billion in 2010, the IEA said.  Chinese Imports  The rate of growth in China’s gas use depends on the
nation’s construction of infrastructure to handle imports and
domestic distribution and storage, the report shows. Wholesale
and retail gas prices also need to be high enough to attract
more expensive supplies such as liquefied natural gas, according
to the agency.  Gas imports are expected to rise to 85 billion cubic meters
from total consumption of 223 billion cubic meters in 2015, the
report shows. About 47 billion cubic meters will be delivered as
LNG, while 35 billion will be piped from Central  Asia  and 3
billion from Myanmar.  That’s still less than the 120 billion cubic meters that
the nation may be able to receive from overseas by 2015, the IEA
said. China has 26 billion cubic meters of LNG-receiving
capacity under construction in addition to the 29 billion
already operating, it said. A 12 billion cubic-meters-a-year
link from Myanmar will start in 2013, and the annual capacity of
the Central Asia pipeline is expected to reach as much as 60
billion by 2015.  Russian Gas  Russian piped supplies to China remain an uncertainty,
according to the IEA. While deliveries aren’t expected before
2017, imports from the nation will make up a significant part of
Chinese purchases in the longer term unless China ramps up its
production of shale gas rapidly, it said.  “There are no doubts that China will become a major
importer of gas,” the IEA said. “The question for external
suppliers is how much pipeline gas and LNG China will need in
five or 10 years.”  Power generation will account for 66 percent of the
increase in gas use in the Americas as utilities switch to the
lower-cost fuel from coal, according to the report. Gas futures
at the  Henry Hub  in  New York  fell to the lowest intraday price
in 10 years on April 19 amid rising U.S. stockpiles and
increased production of shale gas.  “The continued boom in unconventional gas in the U.S. may
even herald the end of the hundred-year dominance of coal in
U.S. power generation,” the IEA said. “In 2005, when the first
shale well was fractured, coal produced almost three times as
much power in the U.S. as gas. By 2017, the race will be almost
even.”  European Demand  Gas demand in Europe will be curbed by relatively high
prices, slower economic growth, and the development of renewable
energy, according to the agency.  U.K. gas for next-day delivery closed at 54.01 pence a
therm on June 1. That’s equivalent to $8.31 per million British
thermal units. U.S. gas for July delivery settled at $2.33 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Power from wind and solar sources in Europe is expected to
more than double from 179 terawatt-hours in 2010, while output
from other renewable energy including bioenergy and geothermal
will grow by about 50 percent, the IEA said.  “European industrials will not see any benefits of lower
 gas prices  induced by shale gas developments,” according to the
report. “In the power-generation sector, the boom of renewable
energy sources actually results in declining generation by
combustible fuels.”  The New Qatar  The volume of gas traded internationally may increase 35
percent from 2011 to 2017, including a 31 percent rise for LNG
to 426 billion cubic meters in 2017, the IEA estimates. Growth
will slow through mid-2014 before accelerating because only 25
billion cubic meters of a total 114 billion of liquefaction
capacity under construction will come online during 2012 and
2013, according to the report.  “The global  trade balance  is visibly shifting to Asia,
which is now attracting increasing flows of LNG and pipeline
gas,” the IEA said. “ Australia  is set to become the new Qatar,
with one plant started in May 2012, seven plants currently under
construction and many others close to reaching final investment
decisions,” the IEA said.  Qatar is the world’s biggest exporter of LNG, or gas cooled
to a liquid for transportation by ship.  New liquefaction plants are being discussed in Australia,
 Russia ,  Nigeria ,  Tanzania ,  Mozambique  and  South Asia , according
to the IEA.  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass gas-export
terminal in  Louisiana  is likely to advance after receiving
authorization from the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  in
April, the agency said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
