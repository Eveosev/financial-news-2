Ukraineâ€™s exports of grain fell by
almost 45 percent to 1.35 million metric tons in May,
agriculture researcher ProAgro said, citing preliminary
information from Ukrainian ports.  That compared with 2.4 million tons of grain exported in
April, ProAgro said in e-mailed statement today, without giving
a reason for the decline.  Shipments of wheat fell by 58 percent to 281,700 tons
compared with 675,540 in April, the researcher said. Deliveries
to  Israel  fell by 30 percent and to  Egypt  by 77 percent,
according to Kiev-based ProAgro.  Corn exports declined in May by 39 percent to 926,400 tons
from 1.5 million tons a month earlier. Barley exports fell by 47
