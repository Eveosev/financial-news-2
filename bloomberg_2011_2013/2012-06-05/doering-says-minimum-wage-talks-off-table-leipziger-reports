Patrick Doering, the general-
secretary of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Free Democratic
coalition partner, said a women’s quota, minimum wage and
passenger vehicle tolls are “off the table” and won’t be
themes for the government in this legislative period,  Leipziger
Volkszeitung  reported today, citing an interview with Doering.  The coalition should only concentrate on themes where it
can reach an agreement, Doering said, according to the
newspaper. The government should work for more growth and less
debt, Doering was cited by Leipziger Volkszeitung as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
