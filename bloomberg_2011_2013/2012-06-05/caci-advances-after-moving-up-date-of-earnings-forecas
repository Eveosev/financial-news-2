CACI International Inc. (CACI) , a technology
consultant to the U.S. government, rose the most in six months
amid investor speculation the company will announce a positive
fiscal 2013 earnings  forecast  tomorrow.  The shares rose 4.8 percent to close at $44.11 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York, the biggest gain since Nov. 28. The stock has
declined 21 percent so far this year.  On May 3, the Arlington, Virginia-based company reduced its
fiscal 2012 revenue forecast in part because of slower-than-
expected customer purchases. CACI said in a statement released
after the close of markets yesterday it would move up the date
for providing its fiscal 2013 earnings outlook to tomorrow from
June 27.  “Investors are viewing the early announcement favorably,”
said Tobey Sommer, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson in
Nashville,  Tennessee . “Maybe things aren’t as bad as we
thought.”  Analysts estimate profit for the year ending June 30 of
$5.82 a share, the average of 17 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
The company earned $4.61 a share last year. The average estimate
for fiscal 2013 is $5.66 a share.  CACI also said today it was awarded a $165 million contract
to automate procurement activities for the  Department of
Defense .  (CACI will hold a conference call June 7 at 8:30 a.m.  New
York (NYX)  time, available through the company’s website at
www.caci.com.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
