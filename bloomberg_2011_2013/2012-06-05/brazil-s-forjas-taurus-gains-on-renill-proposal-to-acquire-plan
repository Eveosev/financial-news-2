Forjas Taurus SA (FJTA4) , a Brazilian
manufacturer of firearms, rose after receiving a proposal from
Renill Participacoes Ltda. to buy a plant.  Shares rallied 2.6 percent to 1.95 reais at 11:19 a.m. in

from the machinery company a proposal to buy a facility in
Gravatai, Rio Grande do Sul, owned by a subsidiary, Taurus
Maquinas-Ferramenta Ltda.  The sale of the subsidiary was planned in May 2011 as part
of the reorganization of Forjas Taurus, which is scheduled to be
completed by September.  Forjas Taurus has gained 33 percent this year while the
Bovespa has slid 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
