Greece  will probably need a second
debt cut and an “orderly insolvency” to return to sustainable
public finances, Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja told
 Germany ’s  Die Zeit  weekly newspaper.  Markets have already priced in a Greek default and the
damage that would follow such an event would be less
catastrophic than many fear, the newspaper cited Tuomioja as
saying in an interview. It’s up to the Greeks to decide whether
they want to keep the euro, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
