Italy’s 1.9 trillion-euro ($2.4
trillion) debt remains sustainable and borrowing costs are
within government budget forecasts, Maria Cannata, head of the
country’s debt management agency told Class CNBC television.  Italy’s 10-year bonds yield 6 percent, a rate that is less
than what was budgeted in Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity
plan passed in December and in line with the government’s latest
economic forecasts adopted in April, she said in an interview.  Italians now hold more than half of the government’s debt,
a fact that Cannata said was both a sign of stability and of
weakness. She told CNBC that while foreign investors in recent
months haven’t been buying as much debt at auction as they
traditionally have, they are not selling their holdings of
Italian debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
