Brazil ’s central bank President
Alexandre Tombini said smaller lenders are financially solid,
profitable and play an important role in reducing the country’s
borrowing costs.  His comments, in congressional testimony, appeared to be
pushing back against concerns that yesterday’s intervention in
Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA points to bigger, undetected risks in
the nation’s banking system.  Tombini said the central bank hasn’t received any offers to
buy Cruzeiro do Sul though he said he doesn’t rule out a
“market solution” for the Sao Paulo-based lender’s problems.  Brazil’s privately-owned deposit insurance fund, known as
FGC, is managing Cruzeiro do Sul after the central bank said
yesterday it was intervening in Brazil’s 27th-largest lender for
allegedly violating financial regulations.  Cruzeiro do Sul became at least the fifth midsize Brazilian
bank to require intervention from regulators since 2010,
underscoring strains in the industry as the lenders seek to
refinance debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
