European  stock futures  rose,
indicating the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will snap four days of
losses, amid speculation that policy makers around the world
will take steps to stimulate economic growth. U.S. index futures
and Asian shares also advanced.  Aryzta AG (ARYN)  may be active after it said third-quarter sales
increased 15 percent.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring this month
gained 0.8 percent to 2,092 at 7:06 a.m. in London. The U.K.
market is closed today. The Stoxx 600 has declined 14 percent
from its 2012 high on March 16 amid growing concern that  Greece 
will be forced to leave the euro currency union. Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index futures climbed 0.6 percent, while the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index added 1.5 percent.  “Markets will be all ears for any hint of a coordinated
response,” Cameron Peacock, a market analyst at IG Markets in
 Melbourne , wrote in an e-mail. “The term ‘hopeful optimism’
might apply to the market’s perception of today’s emergency
meeting between Group of Seven finance ministers. Merely a
‘phone hook-up’, such meetings have nearly always over promised
and under delivered, and at this stage there is no reason to
believe today’s get together will be any different.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
