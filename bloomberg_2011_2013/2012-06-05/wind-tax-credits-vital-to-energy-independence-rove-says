(Corrects date in last paragraph.)  Renewal of federal tax credits for
wind energy can save U.S. jobs and reduce dependence on foreign
oil, according to  Karl Rove , an adviser to former President
 George W. Bush .  “We’ve got a growing economy that’s increasing energy
consumption and wind energy should be part of the solution,”
Rove said today on a panel at a wind conference in Atlanta.
Extending the so-called production tax credit “should be a
priority.”  A bill to extend through 2016 the 2.2-cent-a-kilowatt-hour
credit for electricity produced by wind turbines, biomass,
geothermal and landfill-gas plants has stalled in congress along
with about 100 other expiring tax-related incentives.  The tax credit is one of the major topics of debate this
week as executives gather for the  Windpower 2012  annual
conference.  There are about 75,000 U.S. wind-industry workers,
according to the  American Wind Energy Association . Letting the
credit lapse will lead to the elimination of 10,000 wind-
industry jobs this year and another 27,000 in 2013, the
Washington-based trade group estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
