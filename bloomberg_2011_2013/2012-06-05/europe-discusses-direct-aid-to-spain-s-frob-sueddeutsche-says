European leaders are discussing if
European Union rescue program money can be paid directly to
 Spain ’s bank rescue fund FROB to help Spain solve its banking
crisis without seeking a full bailout,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  In return for the cash, Spain would have to promise to
solve its banking problems with measures that may include
closing or merging financial institutions, the newspaper
reported. Spain would not have to promise any major austerity or
economic reforms in return for the help, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
