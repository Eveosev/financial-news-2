France  and  Sweden  rounded off their
preparations for soccer’s European Championship with wins as
tournament co-host Ukraine lost to  Turkey  in its final tuneup.  Karim Benzema scored twice as France warmed up for its
opening Group D game against England on June 11 in Donetsk by
routing Estonia 4-0 in Le Mans last night. Franck Ribery and
substitute Jeremy Menez got the other goals.  The victory extended 1984 and 2000 European champion
France’s unbeaten run to 21 matches. The streak is the longest
without a loss among all nations, according to Infostrada Sports.  Sweden beat Serbia 2-1 in its last match before taking on
Ukraine in Kiev on June 11. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the
winning goal from the penalty spot in the 52nd minute in Solna
after Neven Subotic replied for Serbia following Ola Toivonen’s
23rd-minute opener.  Three days after winning 3-1 in Portugal, Turkey defeated
another Euro 2012 participant as goals by Caner Erkin and
Mustafa Pektemek sent Ukraine to a 2-0 loss in Ingolstadt,
Germany.  Co-host Poland opens the 16-nation tournament against
Greece in Warsaw on June 8, when Russia faces the  Czech Republic 
in the other Group A match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
