The yield on  Ghana ’s $750 million
Eurobonds rose to the highest in more than three months, as
uncertainty surrounding the future of euro zone reduced demand
for assets seen by investors as risky.  Interest on the 8.5 percent dollar bonds due 2017 rose 11
basis points to 6.338 percent by 4:13 p.m. in London, the
highest since Feb. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Uncertainty surrounding the future of the euro zone has
increased risk aversion in the global markets, including
emerging/frontier markets,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging markets
strategist at Standard Bank Plc in London, said in an e-mailed
note today.  “Investors are selling emerging-market and frontier-market
assets and shifting to the  U.S. dollar  and U.S. Treasuries
because of the uncertain global environment,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
