Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO) ,
the owner of downtown New York’s World Financial Center, bought
two office towers in  Seattle  for $210 million, its first
acquisition in the West Coast city.  Metropolitan Park East and West, a 700,000-square-foot
(65,000-square-meter) complex in downtown Seattle, was purchased
with cash and $126 million in financing, New York-based
Brookfield said today in a statement. The 20- and 18-story
buildings are 85 percent occupied.  “The Seattle market has demonstrated strong fundamentals
with positive absorption over the past 18 months,” Dennis Friedrich, global chief investment officer of Brookfield, said
in the statement. “Metropolitan Park fits our strategy of
owning premier assets in the best-located areas of the top urban
markets and presents an opportunity to add diversification to
our tenant base within the high-growth technology and social-
media sectors.”  Real estate investors have favored purchases of high-
quality properties in such U.S. coastal cities as Seattle, which
have recovered more quickly after the recession. Brookfield owns
office buildings in the U.S.,  Canada  and Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
