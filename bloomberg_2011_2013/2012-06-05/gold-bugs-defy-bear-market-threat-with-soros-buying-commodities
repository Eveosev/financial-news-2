Gold is stuck in the longest slump in
a decade as investors shun bullion for the dollar and bonds,
just seven months after Bank of America Corp. said  Europe ’s debt
crisis would send prices to a record $2,000 an ounce.  The bank was joined by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and Barclays Plc in urging investors to buy in December
and January. Now, after gold fell 10 percent in a four-month
slide through May, they say prices will rebound this year or
next as the Federal Reserve shores up the world’s biggest
economy by easing monetary policy and devaluing the dollar.  Billionaire  George Soros  bought more in the first quarter
and hedge- fund manager   John Paulson  held on to the biggest stake
in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest exchange-traded product
backed by bullion, Securities and Exchange Commission filings
show. Some investors are refusing to capitulate even after
failed elections in  Greece  drove the euro to a two-year low
against the dollar and gold slumped as much as 21 percent in
December from the record $1,923.70 set in September.  “The $2,000 target has moved further away, but it still
holds,” said John Stephenson, who helps manage $2.7 billion at
First Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto and predicted
in November that prices would reach $2,500 in the next several
months. “We will see some easing, and that will push gold
higher, but the reality is that we are on hold until the outcome
of the Greece elections.”  Bear Market  Gold fell 19 percent by May 16 from its closing high of
$1,891.90 in August, within 1 percentage point of the common
definition of a bear market. Prices then touched a five-month
low of $1,523.90 on Dec. 29. After rallying 3.7 percent on June
1, the metal is now up 4.5 percent since the start of January to
$1,637.80 today, extending an 11-year  bull market .  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot  Index (MXWD)  of 24 commodities
retreated 7.6 percent this year, and the MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities declined 0.8 percent. The U.S. Dollar Index, a
measure against six currencies, advanced 2.9 percent. Treasuries
returned 2.2 percent, a Bank of America index shows.  Hedge funds  and other speculators reduced their net-long
positions, or bets on higher prices, by 70 percent since August,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission  data  show. They held 77,325
U.S. futures and options in the week ended May 29, almost the
fewest since December 2008.  Gold held through ETPs dropped for a third month in May,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Combined with the
decline in prices, the holdings are now valued at $125 billion,
down from $141.7 billion in August.  Goldman Predicts  In October, Bank of America forecast $2,000 by early 2012.
Goldman predicted in December that gold would reach $1,840 by
early June. Barclays and Morgan Stanley said in January that it
would average $1,850 and $1,810 this quarter. The metal actually
averaged $1,619 since the end of March. Goldman now expects
prices to reach $1,940 in 12 months. Barclays predicts an
average of $1,790 in the fourth quarter, and Morgan Stanley
forecasts $2,000 in the final three months.  Bullion is heading for a 12th straight annual gain, after
temporarily giving up its gains for the year last month. The
metal rose almost sixfold since the end of 2000, beating the 24
percent advance in the  S&P 500 , with dividends reinvested, and
the 90 percent return on Treasuries. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  fell 25
percent.  While gold’s four-month drop from February is the longest
since the start of the bull market, it’s not the biggest.
Futures fell 21 percent in a month in 2006 and 30 percent over
eight months in 2008, before rallying to end higher for the
year. The 2,375.8 metric tons held in ETPs exceeds official
 reserves  in all but four nations tracked by the  International
Monetary Fund , and the amount is within 1.5 percent of the
record 2,410.2 tons reached in March.  ‘Last Resort’  “Gold remains the currency of last resort,” said Jeff Currie, the New York-based head of commodity research at
Goldman, which predicts $1,840 by the end of the year. “The
case for higher  gold prices  remains intact.”  Greek voters return to the polls on June 17 after elections
on May 6 failed to produce a government. Syriza, a party
proposing to cancel the terms of an international bailout and
restore pensions and wages, was propelled into second place,
increasing prospects that the 17-nation euro would fracture.
Those concerns were partially allayed last week after Irish
voters backed the EU’s fiscal treaty.  Central banks, the world’s biggest owners of gold, have
added to their reserves for 14 consecutive months through March,
the longest streak since 1964, IMF data show. Investor demand
for gold coins is accelerating, with sales of American Eagles
more than doubling to 53,000 ounces last month, according to
figures on the U.S. Mint’s website. The 10 most widely held
options confer the right to buy bullion at prices from $1,800 to
$2,500 between July and March 2013, Comex data show.  ‘Asset Bubble’  Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by the 81-year-old
billionaire, more than tripled its investment in the SPDR Gold
Trust in the first quarter to 319,550 shares now valued at $50.2
million, an SEC filing May 15 showed. It held as few as 42,800
shares last year and as many as 6.2 million at the end of 2009.
Soros called gold the “ultimate asset bubble” in January 2010.
 Michael Vachon , a spokesman for Soros, didn’t respond to a
voicemail for comment.  Paulson & Co., founded by the 56-year-old investor who
became a billionaire in 2007 by wagering against the subprime
mortgage market, still  holds  17.3 million shares in the SPDR
Gold Trust, now valued at $2.72 billion, an SEC filing on May 15
showed. Paulson is seeking to reverse record losses last year
caused by an ill-timed bet on an economic recovery.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson, declined to comment.  Winning Streak  The decline in prices accelerated a contraction in the size
of the gold market. Open interest, or contracts outstanding,
fell to 423,433 on June 4, from as much as 650,764 in November
2010, Comex data show. An average of 17.9 million ounces was
cleared through London in April, the least since October 2010,
according to the London Bullion Market Association.  Prices slumped as investors sought safety in the dollar,
the world’s most-used currency, and bonds. The Dollar Index has
appreciated for five consecutive weeks, the longest winning
streak since January 2009. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, 10-year
U.K. gilts and 10-year German bunds declined to records last
month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “People are moving to the dollar because of liquidity,”
said  Peter Sorrentino , a senior fund manager at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati, which oversees $14.7 billion of assets.
“Gold has had extended periods in this bull run where it has
backed up and given up some of those gains,” he said,
predicting $2,000 in the first quarter of next year.  Central Bank  Gold rallied last year in anticipation of the  Federal
Reserve  announcing a third round of debt buying. The metal rose
about 70 percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two
rounds of so-called quantitative easing ending in June 2011. The
central bank has since held off on prospects for accelerating
growth in this and the next two quarters, the median of as many
as 69 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Demand may also be supported by record-low  interest rates 
from the U.S. to Europe because gold generally earns investors
returns only through price gains. The Fed has pledged to keep
rates at “exceptionally low levels” at least through late
2014. The  European Central Bank , as well as flooding markets
with more than 1 trillion euros ($1.23 trillion), has kept its
refinancing rate at 1 percent since December.  Cover Losses  Some investors sold gold to cover losses across commodities
and equities, said Jeffrey Sica, the Morristown, New Jersey-
based president of SICA Wealth Management who helps oversee $1
billion of assets. About $6 trillion was erased from the value
of global equities since the end of March, and the S&P GSCI
commodities gauge slid 14 percent as Europe’s crisis deepened
and growth slowed in China, the biggest consumer of everything
from coal to soybeans to copper.  “Gold is still going to $2,000 an ounce this year,” said
 Michael Widmer , an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in
London, who predicts a fourth-quarter average of $1,875.  “It’s
just going to take a little bit longer to get there.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
