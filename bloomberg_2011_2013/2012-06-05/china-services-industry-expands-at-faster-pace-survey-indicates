China ’s services industry expanded at
a faster pace in May, according to a survey of purchasing
managers released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  The PMI rose to a 19-month high of 54.7 in May from 54.1 in
April, HSBC and Markit said today. The result contradicted  a
government-backed survey of services businesses released June 3
and signs from other data that a slowdown in the world’s second-
biggest economy is deepening.  China’s stocks rebounded today from the biggest drop in six
months on speculation the government will accelerate measures to
spur  consumer spending . The Ministry of Finance said yesterday
it will offer consumers subsidies for purchases of energy-saving
home appliances including washing machines, water heaters and
refrigerators.  “This should reduce the fears of a sharp growth
slowdown,”  Qu Hongbin , a Hong Kong-based economist for HSBC,
said of the PMI reading.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.4 percent as of 10:47
a.m. local time after sliding 2.7 percent yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
