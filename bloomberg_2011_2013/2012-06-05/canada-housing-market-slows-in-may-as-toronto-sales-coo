Canadian realtors recorded slowing
sales growth last month, regional data suggest, led by a cooling
market in Toronto.  The value of purchases at seven major regional real estate
boards that have reported figures for May rose 4.9 percent from
a year earlier to C$11.2 billion ($10.8 billion), according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News. Those markets had an 8.5
percent annual increase in value during the prior month.  British Columbia led realtor declines in May, with unit
home sales in  Vancouver  falling 16 percent from a year earlier.  The number of homes sold in Toronto rose 11 percent, down
from an increase of 18 percent in April. The average sales price
in  Canada â€™s biggest city rose 6.5 percent, from a gain of 8.5
percent in April.  The  Canadian Real Estate Association  publishes aggregated
national data in the middle of every month. In April, the value
of transactions in all major Canadian markets rose 12.5 percent
from a year earlier, with an 11.5 percent increase in unit
sales. The association also publishes seasonally adjusted data
that showed the value of transactions rose by 1.1 percent in
April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
