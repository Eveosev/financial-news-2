Monsoon rainfall in  India , which
accounts for more than 70 percent of annual precipitation,
reached the mainland in southern Kerala state today, four days
later than normal.  Rains covered all of Kerala and advanced into some parts of
southern Karnataka and  Tamil Nadu  states, the  India
Meteorological Department  said in a  statement  on its website
today. The southern states are the nation’s biggest coffee and
rubber producers.  Farmers in India, the world’s second-biggest producer of
rice, wheat and sugar, depend on the timing of the monsoon to
decide which crops to grow. Rains are crucial as about 55
percent of the nation’s arable land is not irrigated. Monsoon
crops are sown in June and July.  “The delay in onset is not a big concern,”  Kishore Narne ,
head of research at AnandRathi Commodities Ltd., said by phone
from Mumbai today. “If there is further delay in rains
advancing to more areas, oilseed prices will move up.”  Showers in the June to September rainy season, the main
source of irrigation for the nation’s farmers, may be 99 percent
of the long-period average of 89 centimeters, a level deemed
normal, the weather office said in April.  Conditions are favorable for monsoon to advance into parts
of Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and northeastern
states in the next 48 hours, the bureau said.  About 63 million hectares of net sown area in the country
had access to irrigation in 2008-09, compared with the total
area of 141 million hectares, according to the farm ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
