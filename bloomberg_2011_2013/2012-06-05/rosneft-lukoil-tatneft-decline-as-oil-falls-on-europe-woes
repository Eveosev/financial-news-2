OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
producer, OAO  Tatneft (TATN)  and OAO Lukoil led declines on the
benchmark  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index as crude dropped on speculation Europe’s
debt woes will curb energy demand.  Rosneft fell 3.5 percent to 196.30 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the most in a month. Lukoil, the country’s biggest non-
state crude producer, dropped 1.2 percent to 1,711.80 rubles,
sliding for a second day. Tatneft, a regional producer,
retreated 1.7 percent to 166.82 rubles. The Micex slid 0.7
percent to 1,297.04.  Brent crude  dropped as much as 1.2 percent. Euro-area
services and manufacturing output contracted in May, adding to
signs the economy is suffering. Finance ministers and central
bank governors from the world’s leading economies agreed to
coordinate their response to  Europe ’s financial crisis on a
conference call that dealt with Spain and  Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
