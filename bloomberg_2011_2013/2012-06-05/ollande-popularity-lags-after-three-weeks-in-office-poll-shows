French President  Francois Hollande  is
less popular three weeks after taking office than predecessor
 Nicolas Sarkozy  was at the same point in his mandate five years
ago, an  Ifop poll  for Paris Match showed.  About 63 percent of voters approved of Hollandeâ€™s
performance, compared with the 67 percent for Sarkozy in June
2007, Ifop said in an e-mailed statement.  Ifop interviewed 1,005 voters by telephone on May 31 and
June 1. The margin of error was 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
