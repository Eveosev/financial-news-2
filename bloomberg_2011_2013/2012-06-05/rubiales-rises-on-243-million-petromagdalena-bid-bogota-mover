Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC) , the
producer that operates  Colombia ’s largest oil field, rose in
Bogota after saying it agreed to buy  PetroMagdalena Energy Corp. (PMD)   Pacific Rubiales climbed 0.4 percent to 44,800 pesos at the
close of trading, after earlier jumping as much as 2.5 percent
in the biggest intraday advance since May 22. The benchmark IGBC
index fell 0.2 percent. PetroMagdalena’s Canadian-traded  shares 
jumped 26 percent, the most since 2008, to C$1.58. The offer
implies a 28 percent premium to PetroMagdalena’s closing price
of C$1.25 yesterday.  The company agreed to buy PetroMagdalena for C$1.60 per
common share in cash and plans to finance the approximately
C$253 million ($243.7 million) purchase with cash on hand,
Pacific Rubiales said in a statement today.  “It’s a pretty good deal for Pacific,” Matthew Portillo,
an analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., said by phone from  New
York . “They’re buying a lighter oil resource player, where they
can use the lighter crude as a diluent for their heavy-oil
production.”  Pacific Rubiales said earlier this year that it agreed to
receive about 4.4 percent of PetroMagdalena stock as payment for
debt owed from an exploration venture. President Jose Francisco Arata said the company would hold onto stock in PetroMagdalena
at least through this year in a February interview in Cartagena,
Colombia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
