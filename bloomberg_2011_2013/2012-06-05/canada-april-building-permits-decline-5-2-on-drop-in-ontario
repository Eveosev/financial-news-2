Canadian building permits fell for
the first time in three months in April, on fewer construction
plans in Ontario for multiple-unit residences and government
buildings.  The value of municipal permits fell 5.2 percent to C$6.49
billion ($6.77 billion),  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a drop of 1.5
percent, according to the median of nine estimates. Building
intensions fell 21 percent in Ontario.  Non-residential construction  permits fell 8.4 percent to
C$2.69 billion, while residential permits declined 2.8 percent
to C$3.8 billion, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
