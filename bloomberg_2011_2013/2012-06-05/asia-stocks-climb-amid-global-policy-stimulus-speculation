Asian stocks  rose amid speculation
global policy makers will join the  Reserve Bank  of Australia in
taking steps to stimulate economic growth and after a four-day
drop left the regional gauge at the cheapest level this year.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the nation’s biggest lender
by market value, advanced 1.9 percent as the central bank cut
interest rates.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker whose shares
fell yesterday to the lowest level since April 2009, gained 3.4
percent on a stock buyback plan.  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  tumbled 19
percent in Sydney to a record low after forecasting full-year
profit may plunge as much as 91 percent.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 1.3 percent to 110.43 as
of 8:07 p.m. in Tokyo, snapping a four-day decline and recouping
some of yesterday’s 2.1 percent loss. Almost three stocks rose
for each that fell on the gauge.  “We are likely to see a reasonably strong policy response
in a number of countries,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing
director at White Funds Management in Sydney, who manages more
than $350 million. “It’s stacking up to be a reasonably good
buying opportunity.”  The MSCI Asia-Pacific has fallen 14 percent from its peak
this year on Feb. 29. The measure slumped 10 percent in May, the
biggest monthly loss since October 2008, when global markets
tumbled following the collapse of Lehman Brother Holdings Inc.
Equities continued declines this month as a U.S. jobs report
added to concern global growth is slowing amid a deepening debt
crisis in Europe.  Kospi, Topix  South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 1.1 percent. Japan’s
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1 percent, while the broader Topix
Index, which yesterday plunged to a level not seen since 1983,
rose 1.8 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index jumped 1.5 percent on speculation the
government will take steps to boost stocks after the benchmark
index slumped the most in almost seven months yesterday.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 (AS51)  Index jumped 1.5 percent. The
Reserve Bank of Australia cut the benchmark interest rate today
by a quarter point to 3.5 percent, the lowest level since 2009,
as concern about Europe’s fiscal problems and slowing Chinese
growth outweighed low domestic unemployment.  Australian bank shares climbed. Commonwealth Bank gained
1.9 percent to A$50. Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
advanced 2.2 percent to A$21.32.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
rose 2.4 percent to A$22.55 and Westpac banking Corp. climbed
1.9 percent to A$20.59.  Fed, ECB  Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group
of Seven countries will hold a call today to discuss Europe’s
debt crisis, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told
reporters yesterday in Toronto.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke may respond
to weakness in the American job market by announcing further
steps to stimulate growth, according to  Michael Feroli , chief
U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York.  The European Central Bank may cut its benchmark interest
rate from 1 percent as soon as this week,  Holger Schmieding ,
chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, said in a June 1
report. China will respond with a 2 trillion  yuan  ($314 billion)
fiscal stimulus this year and next, according to  Donald Straszheim , senior managing director of New York-based ISI
Group.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge advanced less than 0.1 percent in New York
yesterday, reversing earlier losses.  China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 0.2
percent. The gauge dropped by 64.89 points yesterday, matching
the date on which Chinese authorities crushed student-led
protests on June 4, 1989. Searches for “Shanghai Composite”
were blocked from China’s most-used microblogging service, Sina
Corp.’s Twitter-like Weibo service.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific fell 4.2 percent  this year  through
yesterday, compared with a 4.4 percent drop on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index and a 1.6 percent gain on the S&P 500. Declines in
regional equity markets cut the average price of stocks on the
Asian benchmark to 11.2 times estimated earnings, the lowest
this year. That compares with 12.2 times for the S&P 500 and 9.7
for the Stoxx 600.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s third largest mining company,
increased 1.6 percent to A$53.75 as commodity prices advanced.
BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, climbed
1.3 percent to A$31.16.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (CRY)  of raw materials
climbed 0.6 percent yesterday.  Yen Falls  Japanese exporters gained after the yen fell against 15 of
its 16 major counterparts yesterday. A weaker Japanese currency
boosts the value of overseas earnings when repatriated.  Canon climbed 3.4 percent to 2,991 yen. Mazda Motor Corp.
added 5.6 percent to 94 yen. Sony Corp.,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter
of consumer electronics, rose 3.3 percent to 1,029 yen after
falling yesterday to its lowest since 1980.  Qantas, Australia’s largest carrier, tumbled 19 percent to
A$1.155. Underlying profit before tax may fall as much as 91
percent because of losses on international routes, the airline
said today.  Rengo Co. slumped 14 percent to 447 yen as Japan’s Fair
Trade Commission confirmed it’s investigating the company. The
Nikkei newspaper earlier said the company is being examined on
suspicion of price fixing of cardboard products. The company
manufactures corrugated and paperboard containers. Tomoku Ltd.,
also named by the Nikkei as among companies being examined,
slumped 4.9 percent to 213 yen.  Wharf Holdings Ltd. (4)  jumped 1.5 percent to HK$39.80 after
 Hong Kong  renewed the lease on a cruise-ship terminal and
