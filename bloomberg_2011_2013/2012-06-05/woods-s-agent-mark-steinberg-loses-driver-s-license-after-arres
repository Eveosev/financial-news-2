Mark Steinberg , the agent for golfer
 Tiger Woods , had his license revoked when he was arraigned on
charges related to a drunken driving arrest on June 2.  Steinberg, 44, was arraigned yesterday on aggravated
driving while intoxicated and DWI charges in Ardsley Village
Justice Court in Ardsley, New York, Patricia Basini, the court
clerk, said in a telephone interview. His license was revoked
and he is due to appear back in court on Jan. 25.  Steinberg had blood-alcohol content higher than 0.18, more
than twice the legal limit of 0.08 in New York state, when he
was one of 11 people arrested on June 2 by police at a sobriety
checkpoint off the  New York  State Thruway, according to the
Ardsley Police Department.  Steinberg said in an e-mail that followed his arrest that
“It’s a medical issue that I was dealing with. It’s not what
you think.”  Steinberg is being represented by attorney Andrew Quinn,
Basini said. A woman answering the phone at the office of Quinn,
Mellea & Gioffre LLP in  White Plains , New York, where an Andrew
Quinn is a partner, declined to comment or say whether Steinberg
is a client.  The 44-year-old Steinberg has represented Woods since 1999.
He left New York-based IMG Worldwide in May 2011 and two months
later became a partner at Excel Sports Management. Other golfers
represented by the New York-based company are Woods’s niece,
Cheyenne Woods, as well as U.S. PGA Tour players Matt Kuchar and
Gary Woodland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
