Yields on Treasuries were close to
record lows as Spanish Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro called
for European funds to be used to shore up the nation’s banks,
adding to concern the  European debt crisis  is worsening.  U.S. government securities had recouped earlier losses
after European  retail sales  fell more in April than economists
forecast and German factory orders declined.  “This kind of movement is very likely to continue,” said
Kei Katayama, who invests in  U.S. government debt  in Tokyo at
Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which has the equivalent of $63.3
billion and is a unit of  Japan ’s second-largest brokerage. “The
euro region is having a bad effect on the  U.S. economy . It’s
weaker than many people thought.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.54 percent at 7:35 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
maturing in May 2022 fell 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 31/32. The yield reached a record low of 1.4387
percent on June 1.  Treasuries closed at 3 p.m.  Tokyo  time and were shut during
London market hours in observance of Queen Elizabeth II’s
Diamond Jubilee, according to the New York-based Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association.  Treasuries have surged 3.7 percent since the end of the
first quarter through yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. The MSCI All-Country World Index of
 stocks  lost 12 percent including dividends.  U.S. yields tumbled to records on June 1 after the Labor
Department reported the economy added 69,000 jobs in May, less
than half the figure projected by a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  ‘Bad Effect’  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. non-
manufacturing index, which covers almost 90 percent of the
economy, held at 53.5 in May from April, according to the  median 
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
report today.  The central bank is replacing $400 billion of shorter-term
debt in its holdings with longer maturities to support the
economy by keeping borrowing costs down. The Fed plans to buy as
much as $5.5 billion of Treasuries maturing from August 2020 to
May 2022 today, according to the Fed Bank of  New York ’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
