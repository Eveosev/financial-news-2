Kevin Durant  had 27 points and the
Oklahoma City Thunder moved within one victory of reaching the
National Basketball Association Finals with a 108-103 win
against the host San Antonio Spurs.  Russell Westbrook  added 23 points as the Thunder took a
three-games-to-two lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference
finals. Game 6 is scheduled for June 6 in Oklahoma City.  Manu Ginobili had 34 points to lead San Antonio.  The game featured several big lead shifts. The Thunder took
a 14-point lead two minutes before halftime, only to have the
Spurs build a six-point advantage midway through the third
period. Oklahoma City responded with a 25-10 run to finish the
third quarter, and took a nine-point lead into the fourth
period.  In the final quarter, the Spurs fell behind by 13 points
before Tim Duncan scored six straight points in an 11-0 San
Antonio run to make it 101-99 with two minutes remaining. The
teams traded baskets before  James Harden  hit a 3-pointer to give
the Thunder a 106-101 lead with 29 seconds left.  Ginobili hit a layup with 22 seconds left and the Spurs
then forced a turnover. Ginobili missed a 3-pointer that would
have tied the game with four seconds left, and Durant hit two
clinching free throws.  The winner of the series will face the  Miami Heat  or the
 Boston Celtics  for the NBA championship. The Heat and Celtics
are tied 2-2 in the Eastern Conference finals with Game 5 set
for tomorrow in Miami.  Heat All-Star forward  Chris Bosh  could return tomorrow from
an abdominal strain that has sidelined him since May 13. After
three weeks of being listed as out indefinitely, Miami coach
Erik Spoelstra said today that Bosh has made considerable
progress in his rehabilitation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
