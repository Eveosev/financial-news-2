Fannie Mae  has selected Timothy J. Mayopoulos, the companyâ€™s current executive vice president, as
its new president and chief executive officer, the Washington-
based mortgage finance company announced today.  Mayopoulos, 53, will replace current CEO Michael J.
Williams, a longtime company employee who said in January that
he would step down after serving in the top position for three
years.  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and its smaller rival, Freddie Mac, have
operated under U.S. conservatorship since September 2008, when
investments in risky mortgages pushed them to the brink of
collapse. The taxpayer-owned company has drawn a total of $117.1
billion in aid from the U.S. Treasury while under federal
control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
