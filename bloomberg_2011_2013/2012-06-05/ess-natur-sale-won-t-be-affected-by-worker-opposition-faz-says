The sale of fashion retailer Hess
Natur to Capvis Equity Partners AG won’t be affected by workers’
opposition,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing
Matthias Siekmann, head of the Primondo Specialty Group, which
is selling Hess Natur.  Capvis offered a higher price than HN Geno, a financial
investor that was backed up by Hess Natur’s works council, FAZ
said, citing people familiar with the transaction. There’s no
reason to re-open negotiations with HN Geno, Siekmann was cited
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
