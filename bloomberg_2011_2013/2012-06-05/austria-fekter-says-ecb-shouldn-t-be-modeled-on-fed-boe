Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said the  European Central Bank  shouldn’t be modeled on
the U.S. Federal Reserve or on the  Bank of England .  The ECB should continue to focus on maintaining price
stability, Fekter told lawmakers in Vienna today, according to a
 statement  from Austria’s Parliament. At the same time it was
pragmatic of the ECB to extend its scope to avoid major
contagion in the markets, she said.  Fekter also argued for a continuation of a hard currency
policy, according to the statement.“We only replaced the strong
schilling against a strong euro -- we don’t want a weak
currency,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
