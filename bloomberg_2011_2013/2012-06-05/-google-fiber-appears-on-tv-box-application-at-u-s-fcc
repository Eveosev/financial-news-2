A digital-equipment maker has applied
for U.S. regulatory clearance for a device labeled “Google
fiber” that’s described in filings as a set-top box for video
service.  Humax Co. Ltd. (115160) , based in Gyeonggi, South Korea, submitted
diagrams and a request for confidentiality to the Federal
Communications Commission today, according to the agency’s
website.  Google is building a high-speed data  network  in  Kansas
City , Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. The company is readying
a pay-TV service there that would compete with  Time-Warner Cable
Inc. (TWC) , according to a February report in the  New York  Post.  “We’re still exploring what product offerings will be
available when we launch Google Fiber in Kansas City and we have
nothing to announce at this time,” Jenna Wandres, a Google
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
