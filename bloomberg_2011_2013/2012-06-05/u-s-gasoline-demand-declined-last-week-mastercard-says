U.S. gasoline demand slid 3.7 percent
last week, the first decline in four weeks, as Americans used
less fuel during the Memorial Day holiday weekend, according to
 MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 9.01 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended June 1, down from 9.36 million the week before,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed.  For the Memorial Day Holiday weekend, from May 25 through
May 28, drivers pumped 1.7 percent less gasoline than the same
holiday period in 2011.  The average pump price declined 6 cents in the past week to
$3.63 a gallon, the lowest level since Feb. 24. Prices are 4.2
percent below a year earlier.  “While on the one hand the lower prices help drive
consumption, sluggish economic conditions continue to act as
braking force,” John Gamel, a gasoline analyst and director of
economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the report.  The highest prices were on the West Coast, where the
average fell 2 cents to $4.20 a gallon. The lowest prices were
on the  Gulf Coast , where a gallon declined 7 cents to $3.42.  Fuel consumption was 2 percent below the year-earlier
level, the 40th straight decline in that measure. Year-to-date
gasoline demand is 4.8 percent below the same period in 2011.  Fuel use over the previous four weeks fell 1.9 percent
below the same period in 2011, a record 63rd consecutive drop in
that measure. That was the smallest decline since the weed
ending Sept. 16, 2011.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
