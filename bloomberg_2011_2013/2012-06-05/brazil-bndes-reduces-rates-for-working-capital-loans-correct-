Brazil ’s state-controlled development
bank, known as BNDES, said it  cut interest rates  that it charges
companies on loans to finance working capital.  The rates, which vary depending on the company taking the
loan, were lowered to 6 percent from 9.5 percent in the case of
small companies, BNDES said today in a statement distributed to
reporters in Rio de Janeiro. The bank has 14 billion reais ($6.9
billion) available for the working capital loan program through
2013 and dispensed 4 billion reais last year, said  Luciano Coutinho , president of the bank, to reporters in Rio.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has renewed
efforts to spur growth in the world’s biggest emerging market
after  China , as  gross domestic product  expanded less than
expected in the first quarter. The central bank reduced the
benchmark  interest rate  to a record low 8.5 percent on May 30,
and the government has cut taxes on consumer loans and cars and
pressured banks to lower rates on loans to companies and
individuals.  Loans under the working capital program are made through
the banking system, and will now be available for all small and
medium-size manufacturers, whereas before only certain medium-
sized companies qualified.  “The BNDES is making a strong cost reduction and wants it
to be passed on by financial agents,” Coutinho said. “We
believe in the cooperation of the banking system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
