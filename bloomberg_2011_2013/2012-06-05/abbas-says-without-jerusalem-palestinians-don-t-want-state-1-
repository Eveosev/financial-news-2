Palestinian Authority President
 Mahmoud Abbas  said his people don’t want to establish their own
state unless they’re assured that Jerusalem will be its capital.  Abbas, speaking today at a meeting of the World Economic
Forum in Istanbul, blamed Israel for the standstill in peace
efforts and called on the U.S. to help break the deadlock.  Palestinians want to create an independent state with east
Jerusalem, the  West Bank  and the Gaza Strip, which Israel
captured in the 1967 war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he won’t give up any part of Jerusalem, which he
calls the nation’s “undivided, everlasting” capital.  Abbas also told WEF delegates that the West Bank and  Gaza
Strip  currently offer opportunities for investors, particularly
in real estate and tourism.  To contact the reporters on this story:
