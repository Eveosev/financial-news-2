Russia  expects no more “significant
fluctuations” in the ruble exchange rate following its recent
depreciation versus the  U.S. dollar , Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told Echo of Moscow radio station today.  The Russian currency weakened as much as 15 percent in the
last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It cost
33.68 rubles to buy one dollar on June 1 versus 29.4020 rubles
per dollar on May 2.  If the ruble-weakening trend prevails long-term, it may
boost prices of imported goods and increase inflation in Russia
by as much as 1 percentage point, Siluanov told Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
