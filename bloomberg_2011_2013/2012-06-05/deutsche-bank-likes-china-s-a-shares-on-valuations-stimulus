Deutsche Bank AG recommended  China ’s
yuan-denominated shares because of cheap valuations and the
prospect of economic stimulus, according to Ajay Kapur, head of
Asian equity strategy at the bank.  The nation’s regulators also “want the market to go up,”
said Kapur, referring to measures by the government to boost the
stock market such as allowing foreign investors to buy more
equities. He recommended Chinese airlines, brokerages and
insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
