Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. (GGBL) , a unit
of  Diageo Plc (DGE) , rose to the highest in more than three years on
speculation the company increased profit for the year ending
this month.  The shares rose 3.7 percent to 1.95 cedis as of 1:15 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, the highest since February 2009.  “We expect a 30 percent increase on what the company made
in the nine months through March,” Xorlali Torsu, a stock
trader at Accra-based Databank Financial Services Ltd., said by
phone today. “The company has been posting a good performance
since it raised money through a rights issue to pay debt on its
books.”  Torsu said the stock is being considered a safe-haven amid
a sell-off as investors turn to Treasury bills.  Guinness  Ghana ’s profit soared to 17.5 million cedis ($9.2
million) in the nine months through March, from 911,000 cedis in
the same period a year earlier. It recorded profit of 533,000
cedis for the full year ended June 2011 from a loss of 4.6
million cedis the year before.  The company raised 70 million cedis through a rights offer
in November 2011, of which it earmarked 40 million cedis to pay
down debt and the rest for investment in water supply and
electricity at the plants.  Guinness’s fiscal 2012 results are scheduled to be out by
the second week in July, according to Torsu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
