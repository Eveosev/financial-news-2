The wealth funds of Russia and  China 
will each commit $1 billion in a  joint investment fund  worth as
much as $4 billion, raising additional money from third-party
international investors, China Investment Corp. said today.  China Investment Corp.’s Chairman Lou Jiwei and Russian
Direct Investment Fund’s Chief Executive Officer  Kirill Dmitriev 
signed a memorandum today “signifying the full launch of the
joint fund,” according to the statement posted on the Chinese
sovereign wealth fund’s website.  The China-Russia Investment Fund is being set up in the
form of a limited partnership and will be run as a “commercial
operation”, the statement added.  The joint fund is likely to target transactions in Russian
forestry, logistics and agriculture, Dmitriev said in an April
interview. As much as 70 percent of the joint fund will be
invested in  Russia  and the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Dmitriev said in a statement April 29.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
