Torrebras, the Brazilian unit of
Spanish wind tower maker Windar Renovables SL, will build a 25
million-real ($12.3 million) factory in the northeastern state
of Bahia to tap a growing local market for renewable energy.  The facility, proposed for the city of Camacari, will be
able to produce 220 towers a year and start operating in
December, the state government of Bahia said yesterday on its
 website .  Bahia’s blustery weather is attracting investments from
wind developers and equipment providers keen to furnish
components for the energy projects. The plant’s capacity may be
doubled in the first half of next year to cater to foreign
markets, according to the statement.  About 57 projects with 1,600 megawatts of total power
generation capacity are planned for Bahia, according to the
statement.  Spain’s  Gamesa Corpo. Tecnologica SA (GAM)  and  France ’s  Alstom SA (ALO) 
both opened factories in Bahia last year to produce wind-energy
equipment, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
