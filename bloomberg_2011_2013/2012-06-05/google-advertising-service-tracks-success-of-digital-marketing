Google Inc. (GOOG)  is introducing a feature
to help advertisers manage different types of promotions --
including mobile, video, display and search -- as it tries to
boost revenue by streamlining digital marketing.  Called “DoubleClick Digital Marketing,” Google’s new tool
lets clients use a single software service to track the
effectiveness of different types of a digital ads, said Neal Mohan, Google’s vice president of display advertising.  Google is expanding advertising options and offering new
tools to gauge how the ads work as it steps up competition with
Facebook and Yahoo! Inc. This year, Google will account for 16.5
percent of the U.S. display-ad market, which includes banners
and videos, according to EMarketer Inc. By next year, Google is
expected to grab almost 20 percent, unseating  Facebook (FB)  as the
market leader.  “This is the first technology platform that will be truly
integrated and seamless,” Mohan said in an interview.  Advertisers currently use a hodgepodge of software tools to
track different types of digital advertising, making it
difficult to quickly analyze and tailor marketing messages,
Mohan said. The new service, which manages promotions on various
sites including Yahoo and other rivals, will offer a faster look
at ad performance, he said.  In April,  Mountain View , California-based Google rolled out
a new feature, called Brand Activate, which makes it easier for
companies to know when Web surfers see their ads.  Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.2 billion in 2008 to
improve its display-advertising efforts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
