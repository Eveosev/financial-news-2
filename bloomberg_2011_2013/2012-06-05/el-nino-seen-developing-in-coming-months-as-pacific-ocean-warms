El Nino weather conditions, which can
parch Asia and bring cooler weather to the U.S., are likely to
develop in the coming months as the  Pacific Ocean  continues to
warm, according to  Australia ’s Bureau of Meteorology.  Conditions are likely to approach or possibly exceed El
Nino  thresholds  during late winter to early spring, the bureau
said today, citing seven models. Winter in Australia begins on
June 1, while spring starts on Sept. 1. The bureau first noted
an increased chance of an El Nino developing on April 24.  El Ninos are caused by the periodic warming of the Pacific,
while their reverse, La Ninas, are indicated by a cooling of
surface waters. The twin patterns influence weather worldwide
and can roil commodity markets as farmers from  Indonesia  to
 Argentina  contend with drought or battle too much rain. A back-
to-back La Nina event, which drenched parts of  Asia , peaked in
January and has ended, the bureau said in March.  “Ocean temperatures below the surface are currently
warmer-than-average in the central and western Pacific,” the
bureau said, adding that the eastern Pacific is slowly warming.
“The tropical Pacific Ocean is likely to warm further.”  Historically, about 70 percent of two-year La Ninas are
followed by neutral or El Nino phases, according to the bureau,
which said that at present indicators are neutral. No models
favor a return to La Nina, the bureau said today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
