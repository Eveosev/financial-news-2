The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 4 basis points to 206 basis
points as of 8:57 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its biggest daily
drop since May 28 and its lowest close since May 31, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points to
208 as of 10:59 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  The index is on course for its biggest decrease since May
28, having risen 27.5 basis points this year, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 2 basis points to
200 basis points as of 9:57 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
