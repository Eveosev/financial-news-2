The first-ever formal measurement of
 China ’s Great Wall has determined that the structure is 21,196
kilometers (13,173 miles) long, the Xinhua News Agency reported
today, citing the State Administration of Cultural Heritage.  An archaeological survey jointly conducted by the agency
and the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping since 2007 found
that the pieces making up the Great Wall span 15 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities in China, the report said.  The wall was first built more than 2,200 years ago to fend
off foreign invaders, and was reinforced and extended many times
during later dynasties, according to the Xinhua report.  A previous measurement of the Great Wall’s length was based
on a 2008 preliminary survey that only included structures built
during the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to 1644. The
measurement then was 8,850 kilometers (5,500 miles), the report
said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
