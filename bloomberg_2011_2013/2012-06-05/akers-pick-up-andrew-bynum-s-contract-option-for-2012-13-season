The  Los Angeles Lakers  picked up the
contract option of All-Star center  Andrew Bynum  for the 2012-13
National Basketball Association season.  The Lakers, whose season ended with a second-round playoff
loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, didn’t disclose financial
terms of the option in a  statement  yesterday. The Los Angeles
Times has reported it’s worth $16.1 million.  Bynum, 24, averaged a career-high 18.7 points and 11.8
rebounds while playing in 60 of the Lakers’ 66 games this season.
He averaged 16.7 points, 11.1 rebounds and 3.1 blocks in the
playoffs, though he was limited to 10 points and four rebounds
in a season-ending Game 5 loss to the Thunder.  Bynum told reporters after that loss that “it doesn’t
matter” where he played next season. The Lakers’ 2005 first-
round draft pick later said he wanted to return to Los Angeles.  Bynum has won two NBA titles in his seven seasons with the
Lakers, averaging 11.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
