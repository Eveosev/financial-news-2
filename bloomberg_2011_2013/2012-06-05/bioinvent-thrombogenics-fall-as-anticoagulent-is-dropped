BioInvent International AB (BINV)  and
partner  ThromboGenics NV (THR)  each fell by a record after the
companies said they halted development of a blood thinner that
caused excessive bleeding in a clinical trial.  BioInvent dropped as much as 61 percent to 5.05 kronor and
was trading down 57 percent at 12:12 p.m. in the biggest decline
since the Lund, Sweden-based drugmaker’s June 2001 initial
public offering. The stock has plunged 66 percent this year,
valuing the company at 406.6 million kronor ($56 million).  Hip or knee surgery patients who received the TB-402 drug
had “a significantly higher incidence of bleeding events” than
those on  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Xarelto, BioInvent and Leuven,  Belgium ,
ThromboGenics said in a statement today. Their experimental
infusion wasn’t any better than Xarelto at blocking blood clots
after the surgery.  The companies wanted to “raise the bar” for TB-402 by
testing it against Xarelto, BioInvent Chief Executive Officer
Svein Mathisen said in the statement.  The partners said in a separate statement today that  Roche
Holding AG (ROG)  has ended its licensing deal for a different project,
TB-403, a monoclonal antibody thought to block the growth of new
blood vessels in eye diseases such as age-related macular
degeneration. BioInvent and ThromboGenics said they’ll keep
studying the experimental drug.  ThromboGenics fell as much as 21 percent to 17.10 euros,
the stock’s biggest intraday drop since the company’s July 2006
IPO, and traded down 20 percent in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
