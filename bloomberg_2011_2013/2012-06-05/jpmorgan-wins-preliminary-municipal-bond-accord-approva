JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  won preliminary
court approval of a $44.6 million settlement of a lawsuit in
which it was accused of conspiring to rig bids on municipal bond
deals.  U.S. District Judge  Victor Marrero  in  New York  ruled
yesterday in a 2008 class-action antitrust case against JPMorgan
and other banks. This settlement applies to only JPMorgan and
its Bear Stearns unit. Other banks have settled, and state
attorneys general have entered into accords with banks.  “The court finds the agreement was entered into at arm’s
length by highly experienced counsel and is sufficiently within
the range of reasonableness,” Marrero wrote.  Justin Perras , a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the ruling. Investors who brought the
suit include the city of Baltimore and the University of
Mississippi Medical Center.  Michael D. Hausfeld, a lawyer for the investors, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the approval. The
judge scheduled a hearing in the case for Dec. 14. As part of
his ruling, Marrero agreed that certification of the case as a
class-action suit was warranted.  The investors claim that the banks rigged bids and
“restrained, suppressed or eliminated” competition for
municipal derivatives, according to court papers.  The case is In Re Municipal Derivatives  Antitrust
Litigation , 08-cv-2516, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
