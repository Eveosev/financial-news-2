A Nigerian appeal court upheld a
judgment recognizing a claim by a former adviser of  Statoil ASA (STL) 
to 1.5 percent of the profit from its interest in the West
African nation’s Agbami offshore oil field.  John Abebe , the former adviser, said Statoil agreed to pay
him that share of the profit from its 18.9 percent stake in the
field for helping the company expand in Nigeria in the 1990s.
Judge Charles Archibong of the Federal High Court in Lagos ruled
in his favor on Dec. 6, 2010 and Statoil appealed.  “We disagree with the ruling,” Statoil spokesman Baard
Glad Pedersen said today by phone. “We think that Abebe’s
claims are groundless and that we have strong legal arguments to
reject all his claims. We take note of the appeal court’s
assessment, and we think we have good chances to be heard by the
supreme court.”  Court of Appeal Justice Helen Ogunwumiju said today in
Lagos that Statoil inherited the agreement since it was reached
with an alliance involving it and  BP Plc (BP/) , before BP left the
West African nation.  The Agbami field operated by  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  started output
in 2008 and last year reached 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent
a day, giving Statoil about 44,000 barrels a day. The field has
reserves of about 900 million barrels of oil equivalent,
according to Statoil.  “The panel of three judges took every point the lower
court highlighted and came to their judgment,” Abebe said today
in a phone interview from Lagos. “It was the only conclusion
they could have come to.”  Statoil operates two other deepwater exploration licenses
in Nigeria and has shares in two others, operated by  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and Ocean Energy Inc.  Abebe became involved with the company when it entered an
alliance with BP Plc in  Nigeria  in the early 1990s, Statoil said
on Feb. 26, 2010. Abebe, whose brother-in-law Olusegun Obasanjo
was head of state in 1976-1979 and 1999-2007, worked as a
consultant for BP and later joined Statoil Nigeria’s board, it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
