Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  will shut Line 5 next
month for a hydrotest that’s part of an effort to expand the
capacity of the crude oil pipeline.  Dates for the shutdown haven’t been finalized and will be
discussed at a shipper meeting later this week, Lorraine Little,
a company spokeswoman in Superior, Wisconsin, said in an e-mail.  The Calgary-based company is increasing the capacity of the
line by 50,000 barrels a day “through work at existing
facilities, maintenance digs and hydrotesting,” she said.  Line 5 runs from Superior to Sarnia, Ontario, and has a
capacity of 491,200 barrels a day, according to the company’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
