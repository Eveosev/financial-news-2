New York City  balanced its $68.7
billion spending plan for fiscal 2013 with revenue from $7.3
billion in Wall Street firms’ first-quarter profits, state
Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said.  New York Stock Exchange firms bounced back after losing $2
billion in the fourth quarter of 2011, DiNapoli said in his
yearly analysis of the city budget. Mayor  Michael Bloomberg 
balanced the  financial plan  for the year that begins July 1 with
reserves and non-recurring resources, the comptroller said.  The city’s finances remain at risk because of “heightened
concerns” that the European sovereign debt crisis will further
slow the U.S. recovery, which would have a disproportionate
impact on a city in which Wall Street provides the most revenue
of any industry, DiNapoli said.  “ Wall Street  got off to a strong start which bodes well
for the city’s economy, but securities industry profitability in
recent years has been volatile and one quarter’s results may not
be indicative of the outcome for the entire year,” DiNapoli
said in a news release accompanying the report.  The mayor’s budget, presented in May, assumed Wall Street
profits would total $10 billion in 2012, increasing to $13.4
billion by 2016. The $7.3 billion profit in the first quarter
“greatly exceeds” the city’s expectations, DiNapoli said.  Finance Jobs  Hiring in the securities industry brought back 41 percent
of the 28,100 jobs lost during the financial crisis before the
industry began losing jobs again, shedding 1,400 since October
2011, DiNapoli said. The mayor’s financial plan assumed 2,600
financial jobs would be lost in 2012 and another 1,600 by 2016.  The comptroller estimated that lower Wall Street profit and
increased use of deferred compensation would cause a 14 percent
decline in cash bonuses taxable this year. The mayor predicted
cash bonuses would decline 12 percent.  DiNapoli also noted the budget predicts the costs of legal
judgments to grow to $815 million in fiscal 2016, from $665
million in 2012, in part because of increased claims related to
police actions, and discrimination suits against the Fire
Department.  The proposed budget, which must be approved by the mayor
and City Council by June 30, is balanced with $4 billion in
nonrecurring resources, DiNapoli said. That includes $1.6
billion of surplus funds from fiscal 2012, $1 billion
anticipated from the sale of taxi medallions, and $1 billion
from a Retiree Health Benefits Trust, set up several years ago
to pay future employee’s health-care needs.  Contractor Settlement  The budget also received a one-time payment of $466 million
from Science Applications International Corp. to settle a
federal prosecution for alleged billing fraud to the city on an
automated-payroll project.  The comptroller noted the city faced a $3 billion gap in
2014, rising to $3.7 billion in 2014.  “Overall, the mayor’s executive budget for 2013 is
balanced based on reasonable assumptions, but the city should
develop a contingency plan in case it does not realize the full
$1 billion anticipated from the sale of taxi medallions in that
year,” DiNapoli’s report stated.  Marc LaVorgna , spokesman for the mayor, didn’t immediately
return a request for comment on the report. The mayor is founder
and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
