Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA*) , the retail and
banking stock that has tumbled 65 percent this year, jumped the
most in eight months as billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s brokerage
executed the majority of purchases.  Elektra’s stock soared 8.5 percent to 490.27 pesos at the
close of trading in Mexico City, the biggest advance since Sept.
15. The benchmark  IPC index  of 35 Mexican companies rose 0.1
percent.  Grupo Financiera Inbursa SAB, the financial services firm
controlled by Slim, executed purchase orders for about 680,000
shares, accounting for 53 percent of volume, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. Inbursa had executed about 102,000
Elektra purchases during the rest of 2012. The data doesn’t
indicate whether the brokerage’s orders were for clients or for
its own investments. An  Inbursa (GFINBURO)  spokesman declined to comment.  “For many investors the price is looking attractive,”
said Leon Cabrera, a trader at CI Casa de Bolsa, in a telephone
interview from Mexico City. The Inbursa-executed purchases
“definitely help.”  Elektra had been plunging amid speculation the local stock
exchange will remove it from its benchmark index and after MSCI
Inc. eliminated it from its gauges. The shares have tumbled 61
percent since April 11, when the stock exchange announced
changes to the guidelines for eligibility on the gauge.  The stock  traded  yesterday at 11.2 times trailing earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the
cheapest since March 31, 2008. The ratio rose to 12.2 times
earnings at today’s close.  Slim, 72, is the world’s richest person with a net worth of
$63.8 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
