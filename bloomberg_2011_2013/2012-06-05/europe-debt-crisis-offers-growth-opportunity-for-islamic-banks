The  European debt crisis  and public
anger over government aid to banks offered Islamic lenders a
“golden opportunity” to capture a bigger share of the world
banking market, according to Noor Investment Group LLC.  Islamic banking has the potential to overtake conventional
lenders by offering an alternative to both Muslims and non-
Muslims, Hussain Al Qemzi, chief executive officer of the United
Arab Emirates-based group, said in a statement at the World
Islamic Banking Conference in Singapore today.  “The world is crying out for a better, more ethical way of
doing business,” he said. “Now is the time to position our
industry as a global alternative financial system, one which can
safeguard against the excesses.”  Islamic banking assets with commercial banks are expected
to reach $1.1 trillion this year from $826 billion in 2010,
according to an estimate published by Ernst & Young. Financial-
services firms are under pressure from governments to reduce
compensation amid public anger about trillions of dollars of
taxpayer assistance to banks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
