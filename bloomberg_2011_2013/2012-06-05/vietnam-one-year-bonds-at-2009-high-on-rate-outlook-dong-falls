Vietnam ’s one-year bonds advanced,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in nearly three years, on
speculation the central bank will continue to cut  interest rates 
to spur the economy. The dong weakened.  The planning ministry said today that  growth  may drop to as
low as 5.2 percent in 2012, the least in more than a decade. The
central bank last week cut interest rates for the third month in
a row after official data showed  inflation  eased to 8.3 percent,
the slowest pace since 2010.  “The government will keep loosening monetary policy to
stimulate the economy, and that will affect short-term bond
yields the most,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income
research at Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corp.  The  yield  on one-year bonds fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 8.59 percent, according to the midday
fixing rate. That’s the lowest level since July 24, 2009. The
yield on the benchmark five-year bonds declined two basis points
to 9.54 percent.  The dong fell 0.3 percent to 20,965 per dollar as of 2:43
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
