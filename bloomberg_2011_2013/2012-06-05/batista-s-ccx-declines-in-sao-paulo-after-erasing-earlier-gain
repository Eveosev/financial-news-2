CCX Carvao da Colombia SA , the coal
unit of Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , fell 0.4 percent to
5.38 reais in Sao Paulo trading after reversing an earlier gain
of as much as 9.3 percent. The benchmark Bovespa index slid 1.7
percent.  Subsidiary CCX Colombia SA published a statement in
Colombian newspapers today giving formal notice that it wants to
build a port in the city of Dibulla, La Guajira state. CCX said
in a separate filing to Brazilian regulators that it will submit
the request to the Colombian government after 45 days.  The development of the port will allow storage and other
activities to support CCX’s coal production exports, estimated
at 35 million tons per year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
