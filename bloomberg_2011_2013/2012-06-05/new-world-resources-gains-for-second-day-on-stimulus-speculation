New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, increased for a second day as
speculation policy makers will take more steps to stimulate
global economic growth boosted demand for riskier assets.  The stock jumped 2.1 percent to 93.2 koruna by 10:48 a.m.
in Prague, adding to a 2 percent gain yesterday. The  PX (PX)  index of
14 equities, in which NWR has a 3.5 percent weighting, advanced
0.8 percent.  Global stocks rose and oil gained as leaders from the Group
of Seven countries prepared to discuss the European debt crisis
ahead of the G-20 meeting this month. NWR has been rebounding
from an 11 percent drop last week to its lowest in almost three
years, which sent the stockâ€™s 14-day relative strength index to
22 on June 1. Readings below 30 suggest in technical analysis an
asset may rise. The RSI climbed to 29 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
