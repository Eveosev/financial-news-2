American International Group Inc.
Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  said the insurer’s
Chartis property-casualty unit may be renamed with the AIG brand
as the company emerges from a U.S. government rescue.  “When I got to AIG, they said AIG is gone, it’s finished,
the brand will never come back,” Benmosche, 68, said today in a
speech at a Korea Society dinner in New York, where AIG is
based. “We are considering being just AIG, being proud of what
we’ve accomplished.”  Benmosche delivered the keynote address at the dinner
marking the 55th anniversary of the New York-based nonprofit,
which promotes cooperation between the U.S. and Korea. He said
the insurer would continue to invest in Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
