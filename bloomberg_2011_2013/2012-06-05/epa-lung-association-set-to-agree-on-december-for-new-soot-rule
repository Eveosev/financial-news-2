The Environmental Protection Agency
and American Lung Association said theyâ€™re close to settling a
lawsuit filed by the advocacy group to force regulators to issue
overdue rules on soot.  In a joint filing today in federal court, the EPA, health
organizations and states sought to delay a hearing scheduled for
next week, saying the two sides need time to work out the
details of an agreement that would see final soot regulations
issued Dec. 14. U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins in  Washington 
granted the request.  Separately, the EPA asked the court to give it until June
14 to issue proposed regulations on soot, a week more than the deadline Wilkins set last week. The Lung Association opposed
that delay in a motion filed today.  The EPA issued its last standards on particulate matter in
2006, and by law must review those standards every five years.  The case is American Lung Association v. U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, 12-cv-00243, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
