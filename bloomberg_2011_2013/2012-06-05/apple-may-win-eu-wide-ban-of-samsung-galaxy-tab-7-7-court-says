Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is likely to win extension
of a sales ban of Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy 7.7 tablet
computers to other European Union member countries, a German
appeals court judge said.  The iPad maker will probably succeed to overturn a lower
court ruling that restricted the ban to  Germany , Presiding Judge
Wilhelm Berneke said at a hearing at the Higher Regional Court
in Dusseldorf today. The court’s assessment is preliminary and
can change after hearing and deliberating arguments.  Today’s case is: OLG Duesseldorf, I-20 U 141/11.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
