Argentine farmers will suspend all
trade of grains and livestock for six days after  Buenos Aires ,
the largest farming province, raised taxes on rural property.  Farmers will halt sales nationwide between June 6 and June
12 to protest government agricultural policies, including the
tax increase and currency-exchange restrictions, Ruben Ferrero,
president of the  Argentine Rural Confederation , said during a
televised meeting with reporters in the capital city of Buenos
Aires.  The strike deepens the dispute between farmers and
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government. Four
months of farmer strikes in 2008 led to food shortages
throughout Argentina after Fernandez tried to raise taxes on
corn and soybeans.  “We’re in a bad situation and it’s getting worse,”
Eduardo Buzzi, head of the Argentine Agrarian Federation, said
in a televised meeting of the farm unions. “The government is
indifferent to the agriculture problem.”  Argentina  is the world’s second-largest corn exporter
behind the U.S., according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . The country is also the world’s third-largest
soybean grower behind the U.S. and  Brazil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
