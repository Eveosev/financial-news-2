The Los Angeles Kings beat the New
Jersey Devils 4-0 to move within one win of sweeping the  Stanley
Cup  Final and securing their first National Hockey League
championship.  Alec Martinez and  Anze Kopitar  scored in the second period
at Staples Center in Los Angeles for the Kings. Power-play goals
one minute, 32 seconds apart in the third period from Jeff
Carter and Justin Williams made it 4-0 to the home team.  The Kings, who lost in their only prior visit to the
Stanley Cup Final in 1993, can sweep the best-of-seven series
with a home win in Game 4 on June 6.  In 1942, the Toronto Maple Leafs became the only team to
win the Stanley Cup after losing the first three games in the
championship round, against the  Detroit Red Wings .  The Red Wings were the last team to sweep the Stanley Cup
Final, in 1997 and 1998.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
