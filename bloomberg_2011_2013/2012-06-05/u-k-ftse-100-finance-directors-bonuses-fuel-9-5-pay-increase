Earnings of finance directors in the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index companies rose 9.5 percent to an average
of 1.07 million pounds ($1.6 million) in the past financial
year, according to a report published today.  The increase was driven by “large bonus payments” of an
average 588,500 pounds, equivalent to 127 percent of salary,
while salaries rose by a “subdued” 2.4 percent, London-based
Incomes Data Services said.  Companies felt under pressure to offer more attractive
bonuses to finance directors in order to retain their services
or entice highly skilled executives away from existing
positions, according to the report.  “The so called ’shareholder spring’ has seen executive
remuneration in the spotlight once again,” said  Adam Cohen ,
author of the report. “While salary rises in the FTSE 100 have
been modest, bonuses, which account for a greater proportion of
pay, have increased much more strongly.”  The average salary for finance directors in FTSE 100 firms
was 499,330 pounds and in AIM-listed companies was 130,000
pounds, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
