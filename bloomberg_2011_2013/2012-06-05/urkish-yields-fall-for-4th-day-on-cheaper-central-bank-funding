Yields on two-year Turkish benchmark
debt fell for a fourth day after the central bank provided
funding at its cheaper rate for the first time in four days.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt declined two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.23 percent at the 5 p.m.
close in Istanbul, at the lowest level since March 9.  The central bank provided funding at its lowest rate of
5.75 percent, lending 3 billion liras ($1.6 billion) in one-week
 repurchase agreements , its first so-called “normal” day after
withholding lending at that rate for the previous three days,
which are termed “exceptional” days. Emerging-market stocks
rose, with a benchmark index climbing from a six-month low, amid
speculation global policy makers will take steps to bolster
economic growth.  “The return to normal days by the central bank and
increased risk appetite in the globe are helping bonds,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-income strategist at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS, said
in e-mailed comments.  The lira strengthened 0.2 percent at 1.8480 per dollar,
taking this year’s gains to 2.3 percent, the second-best
performance among emerging-market currencies after the Colombian
peso.  “Today’s rise is meaningful after yesterday’s inflation
data,” Murat Yardimci, head of trading at ING Bank AS, said in
e-mailed comments.  Inflation slowed the most in almost a decade, with the rate
falling to 8.3 percent in May from 11.1 percent in April, the
biggest decrease since January 2003, the statistics office in
Ankara said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
