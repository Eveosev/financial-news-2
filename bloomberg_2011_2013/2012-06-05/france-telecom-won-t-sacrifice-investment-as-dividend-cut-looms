France Telecom  SA Chief Executive
Officer Stephane Richard said the phone company’s 2012 dividend
will be reduced “reasonably” and the owner of the Orange brand
won’t sacrifice investments as it responds to price cuts by
 Iliad SA. (ILD)   “For 2012, it is clear that we will lower the level of our
dividend to take into account how our results evolve,” Richard
said in an interview with BFM Business Radio. “Our dividend
will go down reasonably.”  With one of the highest dividend yields in the
telecommunications  industry  in  Europe , Paris-based France
Telecom has been under pressure to cut payouts to preserve cash
as Europe’s debt crisis hurt consumer demand.  Telefonica SA (TEF)  last
week slashed the cash portion of its 2012 dividend by 69 percent
and announced plans to spin off its German and Latin American
assets to accelerate debt repayment.  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) 
announced cuts to its 2011 dividend in February.  France Telecom said on Feb. 22 that its 2012 payout will be
in a range of 1.21 euros to 1.35 euros a share, cutting the
forecast from 1.40 euros a share, because of a projected decline
in operating cash flow. At the annual  shareholders’ meeting  in
Paris today, Richard reiterated the company’s  forecasts  for
2012, including a plan for payouts of 40 percent to 45 percent
of operating cash flow.  Employees’ Proposal  Shareholders today approved a dividend of 1.40 euros a
share for 2011. An investment fund representing workers who are
also investors had filed a resolution proposing to reduce the
payout to 1 euro a share.  Richard  said  at the meeting that the dividend for 2012 will
probably exceed 1 euro a share.  France Telecom  fell  0.2 percent to 10.25 euros at the close
in Paris. The stock has declined 16 percent this year, valuing
the company at 27.2 billion euros ($33.8 billion).  The  dividend yield  is 13.6 percent, compared with an
industry average of 9.3 percent and 13.9 percent for Madrid-
based Telefonica, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The phone company has “no intention of conducting share
buybacks” this year, Chief Financial Officer Gervais Pellissier
said at the annual meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
