European  retail sales  declined more
than economists forecast in April as the worsening debt crisis
prompted consumers from Spain to  Austria  to cut spending.  Sales dropped 1 percent from March, when they advanced 0.3
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast a drop of 0.1 percent,
according to the median of 23 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. From a year earlier, April  sales  fell 2.5 percent.  European companies are relying on faster-growing economies
to bolster sales as the euro area’s deepening slump erodes
 consumer confidence  and curbs spending. Prada SpA, the Italian
fashion company that owns the Miu Miu brand, said on May 24 that
it plans to add 260 stores in  emerging markets  such as Brazil
and China in the next three years.  German retail sales advanced 0.6 percent in April from the
previous month, when they rose 1.6 percent, today’s report
showed. In  Spain , sales fell 2.4 percent from March, when they
decreased 0.5 percent, while Portugal saw a 2.1 percent drop in
the latest month.  Austria reported a 3.5 percent fall in April, while French
sales declined 1.5 percent. The statistics office didn’t release
data for Greece or Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
