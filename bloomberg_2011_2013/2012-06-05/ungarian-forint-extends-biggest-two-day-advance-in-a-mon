The forint extended the biggest two-
day advance in more than a month and  Hungary ’s five-year bonds
gained.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 301.5 per
euro by 4:05 p.m. in Budapest, taking its gains this week to 1.1
percent, the most since the two days through May 2. The
government’s five-year bonds rallied, cutting yields five basis
points or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.796 percent.  The forint rebounded yesterday from a four-month low as
lawmakers delayed a vote on a central bank law to allow the
government more time to reach a consensus with the  International
Monetary Fund  on its content and help start talks on a bailout.  European stocks rose, snapping a four-day decline, amid
speculation that policy makers around the world will take steps
to stimulate economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
