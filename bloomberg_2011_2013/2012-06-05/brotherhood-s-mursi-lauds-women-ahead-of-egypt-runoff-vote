The Muslim Brotherhood’s presidential
hopeful said Egyptian woman are entitled to the same rights as
men under the law, lauding women’s role in society as he headed
into a presidential runoff race in less than two weeks.  Mohammed Mursi said in a televised news conference that
 women’s rights  are guaranteed under the law and that they
provide a key contribution to Egyptian society. The comments
mark Mursi’s push to win over secularists and others who fear
that a win by him in the presidential runoff, slated to begin
June 16, would lead to the imposition of Islamic law.  “I’m not saying this because of the elections,” Mursi
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
