The  Syria  International Islamic Bank,
placed under sanctions by the U.S. last week, said the measure
has not affected operations because the bank has no assets in
the U.S.  The bank said on its website yesterday that its
transactions are legally “flawless” and it has the documents
to prove that. The U.S. designated the bank on May 30 as
“acting for or on behalf of” the Commercial Bank of Syria and
providing services to the Syrian Lebanese Commercial bank, both
of which are subject to U.S. sanctions.  The action will add to economic pressure on the government
of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad “by closing off a key
evasion route,”  David Cohen , the Treasury’s undersecretary for
terrorism and financial intelligence, said last week.  Assad is trying to quell a 15-month uprising against his
rule. The crackdown has killed more than 10,000 people,
according to United Nations estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
