German bonds rose, pushing two-year
note yields to zero, as Spanish Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro called for European funds to be used to shore up the
nation’s banks.  Ten-year  bunds  pared a decline after a German report showed
factory orders fell more in April than economists forecast,
underpinning demand for the safest assets. Spanish bonds
advanced as finance ministers and central-bank governors from
the Group of Seven nations held a call to discuss the debt
crisis.  Belgium  and the European Financial Stability Facility
sold bills.  “Bunds have turned around quite sharply on the back of the
Spanish headlines,” said  Michael Leister , a rates strategist at
DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Today’s data flow has further
supported bunds.”  Germany ’s  two-year  yield was little changed at 0.015
percent at 4:08 p.m. London time after dropping to zero for the
fourth time in the past five days. The price of the 0 percent
note due in June 2014 was 99.97. The yield slid to a record-low
minus 0.012 percent on June 1.  The 10-year bond yield was one basis point higher at 1.22
percent after climbing as much as four basis points. The all-
time-low of 1.127 percent was set on June 1.  Spanish banks don’t need “excessive” amounts to
recapitalize, and the question is “where that figure comes
from,” Montoro said in an interview with Spanish broadcaster
Onda Cero in  Madrid . “That’s why it’s so important that the
European institutions open up and help us achieve, help
facilitate, that figure because we’re not talking about
astronomical figures,” he said.  Factory Orders  German factory orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and
inflation, dropped 1.9 percent from March, when they jumped a
revised 3.2 percent, the  Economy Ministry  said in Berlin.
Economists forecast a decline of 1.1 percent, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors discussed
Europe’s progress toward fiscal union on a call today, an
official said.  “The G-7 counterparts reviewed developments in the global
economy and financial markets and the policy response under
consideration, including the progress towards financial and
fiscal union in  Europe ,” the official said. “They agreed to
monitor developments closely ahead of the G-20 summit in Los
Cabos,”  Mexico  on June 18-19.  Spanish bonds rose for a fourth day, with the 10-year yield
dropping 11 basis points to 6.3 percent. Italy’s 10-year yield
declined one basis point to 5.65 percent.  Treasuries, Euro  The U.S. Treasury 10-year yield climbed three basis points
to 1.55 percent, while the euro weakened 0.4 percent to $1.2455.  Germany’s  borrowing costs  have plunged to the lowest on
record as investors sought the nation’s debt as a haven from
Europe’s financial turmoil and concern mounted that Greece will
exit the euro area after inconclusive elections on May 6.  There’s at least a one in three chance of  Greece  leaving
the single currency within months of a June 17 election that may
halt its international bailout,  Standard & Poor’s  said in a
statement yesterday.  Germany plans to sell an additional 5 billion euros of
five-year notes tomorrow. The previous auction of the securities
on May 9 saw a record-low auction average yield of 0.56 percent.
The five-year yield was at 0.37 percent today, after dropping to
a record 0.295 percent on June 1.  Spain Sale  Spain  is scheduled to sell bonds maturing between 2014 and
2022 on June 7.  France  will auction securities due between 2019
and 2060 the same day.  Belgium sold 3.52 billion euros of bills, exceeding its 3.2
billion-euro target. The debt agency said it sold 1.81 billion
euros of three-month debt at an average yield of 0.213 percent,
versus 0.201 percent at the previous auction on May 15.
Investors also bought 1.71 billion euros of securities due in
November at a 0.266 percent, compared with 0.226 percent.  The EFSF sold 1.99 billion euros of three-months bills.  The  European Central Bank  will keep its main refinancing
 rate  at a record-low 1 percent at its monthly meeting tomorrow,
according to the median estimate of 58 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Eleven predict a cut of 25 basis points, while one sees
a reduction to 0.5 percent.  German bonds have returned 4.8 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities fell 4.2
percent, as Italy’s debt earned 8.5 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
