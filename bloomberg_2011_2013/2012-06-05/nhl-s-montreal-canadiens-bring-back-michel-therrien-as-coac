The  Montreal Canadiens  ended months
of managerial turmoil by rehiring Michel Therrien as coach.  Therrien , 48, led the team to a 77-77-36 record over parts
of three National Hockey League seasons from 2000-01 through
2002-03. He replaces Randy Cunneyworth, who was named interim
coach at midseason after Jacques Martin was fired.  The Canadiens finished the season 31-35-16 and in last
place in the Eastern Conference’s Northeast Division.  Therrien coached the  Pittsburgh Penguins  from 2005-06
through 2008-09, guiding the team to the Stanley Cup Final in
the 2007-2008 season. They lost to the  Detroit Red Wings  in six
games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
