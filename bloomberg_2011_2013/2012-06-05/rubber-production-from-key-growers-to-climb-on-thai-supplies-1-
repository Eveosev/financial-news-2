Rubber production from key growers
may expand 1.5 percent this year, due mainly to higher-than-
expected output from top growers  Thailand  and  Indonesia ,
according to  Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries .  Output from members, representing 93 percent of global
supply, may climb to 10.475 million metric tons, the group said
in its monthly bulletin today. The group had said in April that
production may drop 0.1 percent to 10.297 million tons, the
first decline since a 3.8 percent contraction in 2009.  “Although the demand and supply may more or less match
each other during this year, the market is likely to continue
its bearish mode on account of the continuing unfavorable trends
in currency rates and crude oil,” the group said.  Rubber futures in  Tokyo  plunged 16 percent in May, erasing
gains this year, as concerns mounted that the  European debt
crisis  may deepen and economic growth in  China , the biggest
consumer of rubber, may slow.  Imports by the group, which represents 57 percent of global
rubber consumption, may increase 3.8 percent to 4 million tons
this year, the association said. Purchases climbed 7.8 percent
and 17 percent in the first and second quarter, it said.  Thailand’s production may total 3.63 million tons this
year, more than the 3.53 million tons forecast in April, while
output from Indonesia may rise to 3 million tons from 2.92
million tons, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
