U.S. stock futures erased gains,
leaving contracts on the benchmark Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index
little changed.  S&P 500 futures expiring this month slipped 0.1 percent to
1,271.5 at 9:36 a.m. in  London , erasing an earlier advance of as
much as 0.6 percent. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average lost 10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,053.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
