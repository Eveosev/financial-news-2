Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the insurer
seeking a new chief executive officer, had the outlook of its
Canadian mortgage-insurance subsidiary lowered by  Standard &
Poor’s  as the nation’s economic growth slows.  “Macroeconomic factors may begin to weigh on housing
prices,” the ratings firm said today in a statement on the
Canadian business of the Richmond, Virginia-based insurer,
dropping the outlook to stable from positive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
