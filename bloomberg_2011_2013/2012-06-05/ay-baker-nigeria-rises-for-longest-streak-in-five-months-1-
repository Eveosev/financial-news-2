May & Baker of Nigeria Plc , the
nation’s second-biggest pharmaceuticals maker by market value,
gained for a fifth day, the longest winning streak in five
months.  The stock rose 4.7 percent to 1.55 naira by the 3:55 p.m.
close in Lagos, the commercial capital, its longest streak of
gains since Jan. 6. The shares have fallen 22 percent this year.  “Investors believe the stock has fallen to a level where
value once more has been restored to the stock, price-wise,”
David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co. said by phone today. The rally will
continue “but may not be sustained for a long time,” he said,
without saying how much it will rise further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
