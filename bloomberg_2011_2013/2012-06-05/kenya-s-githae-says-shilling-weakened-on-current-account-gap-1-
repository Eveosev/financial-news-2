Kenya ’s shilling is weakening because
of the country’s widening current account gap and the long-term
solution to stabilizing the currency is boosting exports,
Finance Minister Robinson Githae said.  The increasing deficit on the current account, the broadest
measure of trade in goods and services, is “worrying,” Githae
told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital.  “It means we are importing unnecessary items,” he said.  Kenya’s current account deficit widened to $4.45 billion in
the year through February from $2.27 billion a year earlier, the
central bank said in a Monthly Economic Review on May 31.  The shilling weakened last month because companies with
overseas shareholders remitted dividend payments, Githae said.
The currency is also under pressure because of declining
Treasury-bill rates, he said.  The shilling depreciated 3.5 percent last month, making it
the sixth-worst performer among African currencies, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
