industry plans to sell 70 percent of production before the
season starts.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cocoa for July delivery

percent to $84.29 a barrel.  Brent oil for July settlement slipped 1 cent to $98.84 a

economies and metal demand.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for July delivery
fell 0.5 percent to $3.289 a pound.  The London Metal Exchange was closed for a public holiday.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures fell from a one-week high on speculation
