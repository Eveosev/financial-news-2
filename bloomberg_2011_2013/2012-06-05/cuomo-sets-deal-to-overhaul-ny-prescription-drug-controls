New York  Governor  Andrew Cuomo  struck
a deal with legislative leaders on enhanced prescription-drug
tracking to improve distribution controls and curb abuse.  The measure will make New York one of the first U.S. states
to require the use of an electronic system to prescribe almost
all controlled substances, helping physicians and pharmacists to
identify patients who try to see multiple doctors to get the
same drug, according to a statement today from Cuomo’s office.  “This landmark agreement will help put a stop to the
growing number of fatalities resulting from overdoses,” Cuomo
said in the statement. “We have seen too many untimely deaths
as a result of prescription drug abuse,” he said. “Enough is
enough.”  Painkillers lead to almost 15,000 overdose deaths each
year, according to the statement, which cited the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Prescription-drug
abuse has helped make poisoning the leading accidental killer in
the U.S., topping deaths caused by both cocaine and heroin,
according to a report released last month by the Trust for
America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  From  Washington  to  Maine , states have passed or are
considering steps to tighten prescription-drug regulation. In
New York, the electronic prescription-monitoring system will
help prevent drug trafficking by providing access to updated
patient records, according to the statement. Currently, doctors
must report certain prescriptions to the state within 45 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
