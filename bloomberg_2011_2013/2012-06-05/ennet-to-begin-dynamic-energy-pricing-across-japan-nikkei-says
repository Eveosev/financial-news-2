Ennet Corp., a privately-owned
independent power producer in  Japan , is planning to vary the
price it charges customers for electricity based on peak and
off-peak demand, the Nikkei newspaper reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  The system, known as dynamic pricing, is designed to reduce
energy consumption and reward customers that reduce their usage
in peak hours, the Nikkei said. Ennet plans to introduce the
system in July, according to the report.  Ennet, which has about 10,000 corporate customers in Japan,
including department store operator  Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings
Ltd. (3099) , says the pricing system will lower energy bills by as much
as 5 percent compared with fixed-rate contracts, the newspaper
reported.  One option for customers includes a tripling of electricity
prices to about 50 yen per kilowatt-hour from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.
in exchange for a 2 yen discount at other times, the Nikkei
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
