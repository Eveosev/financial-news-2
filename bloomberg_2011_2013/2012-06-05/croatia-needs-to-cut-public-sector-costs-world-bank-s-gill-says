Croatia  needs to restructure its
public sector to reduce spending and increase investment in
innovation as it prepares to join the European Union next year,
the  World Bank  said.  “Croatia spends more than 40 percent of gross domestic
product on government services, about 14 percent on social
protection, and only 0.8 percent on innovation,” Indermit Gill,
the World Bank’s chief economist for Europe and Central Asia,
said at a conference in Zagreb today. “The country will be
joining the EU from the position of weakness.”  Croatia, which is set to become the European Union’s 28th
member in July 2013, is struggling to attract investment as it
recovers from a two-year recession. Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  said in January the government will invest 8 billion
kuna ($1.3 billion) from reconstruction banks and the EU’s funds
in infrastructure projects to revive investment in energy and
tourism.  Croatia’s economy will grow 0.8 percent this year,
according to a government forecast, while the  World Bank  in
April estimated a 1 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
