Alfred Woyome, a Ghanaian businessman
who was charged with fraud after he received a court judgment
payment of 51 million cedis ($27 million), was discharged and
later re-arrested, Accra-based Joy FM reported.  The state decided not to pursue prosecution of the fraud
case against Woyome and three others, the broadcaster said,
citing prosecutor Cynthia Lamptey. The trial was due to start
today.  Shortly after he was freed by the court, Woyome was re-
arrested on charges of defrauding by false pretense and causing
financial loss to the state, Joy FM reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
