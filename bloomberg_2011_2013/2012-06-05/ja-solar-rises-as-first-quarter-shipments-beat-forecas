JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , China’s
largest solar-cell maker, rose the most in more than four months
after reporting first-quarter shipments that exceeded its
forecast.  JA Solar’s American depositary receipts gained 17 percent
to $1.04 at the close in New York, the most since Jan. 11. Each
ADR is worth one ordinary share.  JA Solar shipped 366 megawatts of solar cells and panels in
the first quarter, ahead of its forecast of 320 megawatts to 350
megawatts, on strong demand in Italy and Germany, according to a
statement today. Revenue for the Shanghai-based company was 1.6
billion  yuan  ($254.4 million), beating expectations of 1.51
billion yuan, the average of nine analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg,  JA Solar affirmed its 2012 shipment forecast of 1.8
gigawatts to 2 gigawatts of solar products. It sells solar cells
and panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
