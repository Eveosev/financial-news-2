Ethanol declined for the fifth time
in six days in  Chicago  as demand for gasoline slipped amid
rising supply.  Prices sank on concern that consumption isn’t robust enough
to eat away at  stockpiles  that have advanced for two weeks in a
row, according to Energy Department data. Demand for gasoline
fell 3.7 percent last week, the first decline in four weeks,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed today. Ethanol is
blended into gasoline.  “There still isn’t great demand,” said  Ian Jackson , a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “There isn’t great
demand in the products like gasoline either. We’re kind of stuck
in this no-man’s land.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 0.7 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $2.003 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The contract expired today. Futures have fallen 9.1
percent this year. Ethanol for July fell 0.3 cent to $2.031.  The MasterCard report showed that drivers bought 9.01
million barrels of gasoline in the week ended June 1, down from
9.36 million the week before. Ethanol supply climbed 0.5 percent
to 21.5 million barrels in the week ended May 25, Energy
Department data showed.  In spot market trading, ethanol sank 0.5 cent to $2.05 a
gallon in  New York  and in the U.S. Gulf, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Ethanol in Chicago increased 0.5 cent to
$1.985 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel jumped 0.5
cent to $2.20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
