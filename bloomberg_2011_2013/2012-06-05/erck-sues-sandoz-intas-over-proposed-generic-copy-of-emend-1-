Merck & Co. (MRK)  sued the Sandoz unit of
Swiss drugmaker  Novartis AG (NOVN)  and  Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (INTAS)  to
block them from selling generic forms of Emend, which prevents
nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy.  Sandoz, the generic-drug maker, and Intas’s Accord
Healthcare unit seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
to sell intravenous forms of Emend, according to the lawsuits,
filed in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey.  Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker, said the Sandoz
and Accord drugs would infringe two patents and seeks a court
order to prevent sales until they expire in February 2015 and
March 2019. Emend in all forms generated $419 million in sales
last year, an 11 percent rise over 2010, Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based Merck said in its annual report.  The Sandoz case was filed May 31, and the Accord complaint
was filed June 1.  Eric Althoff , a spokesman for Novartis,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Samir Mehta, the president
of Durham, North Carolina-based Accord, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  The cases are Merck v. Accord Healthcare, 12-cv-3324 and
Merck v. Sandoz Inc., 12-cv-3289, U.S. District Court, District
of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporters on this story:
