Burckhardt Compression Holding AG (BCHN) 
gained the most in seven months after the Swiss compressor maker
said new order growth may exceed 10 percent this year.  The stock rose as much as 11 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Oct. 19. The shares traded 9.5 percent higher at
231.9 Swiss francs at 12:59 p.m. in Zurich.  Sales will be “substantially” higher in the 12 months
through March 2013 as the Winterthur-based company clears a
backlog of contracts, Chief Executive Officer Marcel Pawlicek
said at a presentation. New orders will probably rise in a
“high single-digit to double digit” range, he said. Net income
rose 12 percent to 50.5 million francs ($52 million) in the past
fiscal year at the company, which sells compressors to  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028)   Burckhardt gave discounts to gain more orders to offset the
stronger franc, which gained 16 percent against the euro in the
past two years. That will lead to a “somewhat lower” operating
profit margin this year, the company said.  New refinery projects in Asia and the increasing use of
natural gas are driving demand for compressors, Pawlicek said.
Burckhardt is the world’s second-largest maker of reciprocating
compressors for the oil and gas industries after  Dresser-Rand
Group Inc. (DRC)  in the U.S., Pawlicek said, adding that the top four
companies share as much as 70 percent of the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
