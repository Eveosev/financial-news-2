underlying futures moved the least in a week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in

of options prices, was 34.33 percent at 2:34 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 37.28 yesterday. Volatility
has fallen two consecutive days since June 1 when it was 40.56
percent, the highest level since Oct. 20.  Crude oil for July delivery rose 31 cents to settle at
$84.29 a barrel on the Nymex. The change of 0.4 percent was the
