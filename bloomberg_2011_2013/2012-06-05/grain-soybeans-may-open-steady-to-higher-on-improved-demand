What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on increased  demand  for
supplies at export terminals near  New Orleans  after the lowest
cash prices since December halted farmer sales, Jerrod Kitt, the
director of research at the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT on speculation that central bank governors from the
Group of Seven industrialized nations will work together to ease
the European debt crisis, boosting demand for commodities, Kitt
said. Soybean-meal futures may open steady to down 50 cents per
2,000 pounds, and soybean-oil futures are expected to open
steady to 0.1 cent a pound higher.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that the lowest prices in three
weeks may increase demand from investors holding short
positions, Kitt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
