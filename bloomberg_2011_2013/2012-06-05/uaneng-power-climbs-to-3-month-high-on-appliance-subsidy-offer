Huaneng Power International Inc. (HNP) , the
publicly traded unit of China’s largest electricity producer,
rose to the highest in three months as coal prices fell and the
government will subsidize energy-saving appliance purchases.  American depositary receipts of Huaneng, which owns and
operates  power plants  throughout China, gained 3.9 percent to
$25.97 in New York, its highest price since Feb. 17. Huaneng
Power  shares  traded in  Hong Kong  gained 1.8 percent to HK$5.07,
or the equivalent of 65 U.S. cents. Each ADR represents 40
shares.  China’s benchmark power-station coal price at Qinhuangdao
port fell the most in five months yesterday as a slowdown in the
world’s second-biggest economy has cut demand for electricity
and caused stockpiles across the country to surge. China will
offer subsidies for the purchase of energy-saving home
appliances, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement
yesterday.  “The move down in commodity prices is helping companies
such as Huaneng, which uses a lot of coal,” Greg Lesko, who
helps oversee over $800 million at Deltec Asset Management in
 New York , said in a phone interview. “Concerning Chinese
growth, we’re seeing smaller, modest easing measures, and we’re
likely to see more of those as the government has made clear it
wants to keep the economy going, though probably not at the pace
it grew in the past.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
