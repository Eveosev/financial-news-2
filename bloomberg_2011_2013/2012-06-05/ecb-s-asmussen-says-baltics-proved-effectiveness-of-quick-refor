European Central Bank Executive Board
member Joerg Asmussen said the Baltic states have reaped the
benefits of implementing fiscal reforms rapidly.  “When adjustment is inevitable, it is better to take the
medicine right away than to let the fever rise for months,”
Asmussen said at an event in  Riga  today. “By acting with speed
and determination, the Latvian government was able to capture
the sense of urgency prevailing among the population and
mobilize it to support adjustment. This way, most of the
required painful budgetary decisions could be passed before the
so-called ‘adjustment fatigue’ kicked in.”  Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia all reduced spending and
raised taxes to keep deficits under control, with Latvia
slashing expenditure equivalent to about 9 percent of gross
domestic product from its 2009 budget. The euro area’s sovereign
debt crisis is worsening as political support for budget cuts in
Greece dwindles and  Spain  struggles to recapitalize its banks.  Asmussen said the level of public support for budget cuts
is “an important factor that explains the different
trajectories of the Baltics and certain southern European
countries.”  “The ECB has long argued that the potential trade-off
between fiscal discipline and growth can be mitigated if
consolidation is accompanied by growth-enhancing structural
reforms,” Asmussen said. “The case of the Baltics confirms
this.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
