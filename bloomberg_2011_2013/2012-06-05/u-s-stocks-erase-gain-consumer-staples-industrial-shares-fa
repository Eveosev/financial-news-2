U.S. stocks erased earlier gains as
consumer-staples and industrial companies led declines that
snuffed out an early rally triggered by an unexpected increase
in a gauge of service industries.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,277.92 at 11:58 a.m. in  New York  after rallying 0.5 percent
earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
