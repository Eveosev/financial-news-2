Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , a
developer of natural-gas engines, climbed the most in more than
three years after unveiling an agreement with  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
to develop fuel systems for off-road vehicles.  Westport, based in Vancouver,  rose  22 percent to close at
C$28.17 in Toronto, the biggest increase since November 2008.
The shares have declined 17 percent this year.  Cooperation with Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar will
initially focus on development of natural-gas engines used in
mining trucks and locomotives and the possible use of Westport’s
High Pressure Direct Injection technology, Westport said today
in a statement. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of
construction and mining equipment, will fund development under
the agreement, Westport said.  “The substantial price difference between natural gas and
 diesel fuel  is resulting in a strong financial incentive to
enable off-road applications to take advantage of low natural
gas energy costs without sacrificing operational performance,”
Westport said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
