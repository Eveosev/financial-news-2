Croatian central bank Deputy Governor
Boris Vujcic will be nominated to replace Governor Zeljko Rohatinski, who leaves in July, according to two officials close
to the decision who declined to be identified because the
nomination is not public yet.  Rohatinski told reporters yesterday that Prime Minister
 Zoran Milanovic  didnâ€™t offer him a third six-year term at the
post. Rohatinski, who first took the post in 2000, is credited
with keeping the kuna steady against the euro.  Central bank spokeswoman Dejana Rebernik declined to
comment when reached today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
