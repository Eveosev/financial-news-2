The commander of U.S. Special Forces
in South  Korea  was replaced after he was quoted as saying
American and South Korean units have been parachuting into North
Korea to spy on its underground military facilities.  Brigadier General Neil Tolley is being replaced by
Brigadier General Eric Wendt in a “routine” job rotation, Kim
Young Ku, a public affairs officer at  U.S. Forces Korea , said
today in  Seoul .  “It was time for him to leave,” Kim said, adding that the
timing of the shift was “merely coincidental.” Wendt’s
appointment was announced by the Pentagon on June 1.  The Diplomat, a Tokyo-based foreign affairs magazine, last
week quoted Tolley as saying at a May 22 conference in  Florida 
that American and South Korean special forces were sent to  North
Korea  on reconnaissance missions. After first denying the
comments, the U.S. military in Seoul put out a statement from
Tolley saying that while he had been accurately quoted, he
should have been clearer in his comments.  “The discussion was meant to address how technology could
help us in the future,” Tolley said in a May 30 statement. “In
my attempt to explain where technology could help us, I spoke in
the present tense. To be clear, at no time have we sent special
operations forces into North Korea.”  South and North Korea remain technically at war as the
1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty and the U.S. keeps
28,500 troops stationed in  South Korea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
