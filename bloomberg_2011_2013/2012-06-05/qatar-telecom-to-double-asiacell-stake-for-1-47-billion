Qatar Telecom  QSC said it reached
agreements to double its holding to 60 percent in Asiacell, a
mobile operator in Iraq, for $1.47 billion as the company seeks
to expand outside its home base.  Qatar Telecom will initially increase ownership to 53.9
percent and raise that further after approval from Iraq’s
government and regulators, according to an e-mailed company
statement today. The transaction will be financed from existing
funds, it said, without saying who is selling the stake.  “The Iraqi market is about to enter a period of rapid
broadband and data growth and Asiacell is well-positioned to
meet the demands of the population for high quality, reliable
and affordable voice and data services,”  Sheikh Abdullah  said
in the statement. “We continue to work hard on preparing for
Asiacell’s landmark IPO planned for later this year.”  Qatar Telecom, the Persian Gulf country’s largest company
by revenue, has sought to expand outside its home market where
it faces increased competition from  Vodafone Qatar. (VFQS)  The company
teamed up with Princesse Holding of Tunisia in 2010 to buy
Orascom Telecom Holding SAE’s 50 percent stake in Telecom
Tunisie for $1.2 billion.  Qatar Telecom held talks with MerchantBridge & Co., a
London-based  investment company , to buy a 19 percent stake in
Asiacell, Chairman Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed Al Thani said in
January. Eric le Blan, acting chief executive officer of
MerchantBridge, declined to comment by phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
