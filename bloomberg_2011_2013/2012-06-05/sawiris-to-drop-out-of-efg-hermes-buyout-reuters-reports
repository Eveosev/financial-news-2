informed  EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  that one of the conditions for
his participation in the Planet IB Ltd. bid hasn’t been

2, the  news agency  reported, citing an unidentified official at
EFG-Hermes.  Sawiris and Hanzada Nessim, a spokeswoman for EFG-Hermes,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.
