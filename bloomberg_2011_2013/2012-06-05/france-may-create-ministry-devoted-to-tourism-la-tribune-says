French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault plans to create a ministry for tourism after the
legislative elections in mid-June,  La Tribune  reported, without
disclosing where it got the information.  France  remained the top tourist destination worldwide in
2011 with 77.1 million visitors, the newspaper said. Tourism
represents 7.1 percent of the country’s economy and while France
gets less revenue from tourism than the U.S. and  Spain , Ayrault
considers there’s sufficient reason to dedicate a ministry to
the industry, La Tribune said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
