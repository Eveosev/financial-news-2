AS Tallinna Vesi (TVEAT) ,  Estonia ’s biggest
water utility, said the Tallinn District Court ruled in its
favor regarding a tariff dispute with the competition authority.  The court stated the company’s tariff mechanism is
regulated by a public law agreement, as opposed to an
administrative act, the Tallinn-based company said in a
regulatory statement today.  The ruling means the competition watchdog has to prove the
company’s agreement with the municipality on providing services
severely damages a predominant public interest, or the company
can claim compensation, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
