Ukrainian stocks fell to the lowest
in almost three years as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis worsens
and global growth slows.  The benchmark  Ukrainian Equities Index (UX)  fell 4.8 percent to
932.22, the lowest level since July 2009, by the close in Kiev.  Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group
of Seven countries hold a call today to discuss the European
debt crisis. Euro-area services and manufacturing output
contracted at the fastest pace in almost three years in May,
adding to signs the economy is suffering.  Spain  called for
outside support for the first time to battle the financial
crisis as Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said European
institutions should help shore up the nation’s lenders.  “Investors are in a bad mood because of the disappointing
European data and because the Spanish minister called for more
support for the Spanish banks,” Dmitry Churin, the head of
research at Eavex Capital in Kiev, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
