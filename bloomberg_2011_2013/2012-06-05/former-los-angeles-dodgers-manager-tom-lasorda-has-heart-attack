Former Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Tommy Lasorda had a mild heart attack two days ago while
attending  Major League Baseball ’s first-year draft in  New York .  Lasorda, 84, was resting comfortably at New York-
Presbyterian Hospital/ Columbia University Medical Center  after
doctors inserted a stent to correct a blocked artery, the
Dodgers said yesterday in a release.  “The doctors confirmed I do bleed Dodger Blue,” Lasorda
said in the team statement. “I’m looking forward to being back
at the stadium to cheer on the Dodgers.”  The Hall of Fame manager led the Dodgers from 1976 to 1996,
retiring after he had a heart attack in June 1996. He is now a
special adviser for the team. He led the franchise to World
Series titles in 1981 and 1988, and twice was selected National
League manager of the year.  Lasorda, who went 0-4 in parts of three seasons as a major
league pitcher from 1954-56, was elected to the Hall of Fame in
1997 after compiling a 1,599-1,439 record as manager. He ranks
18th on the major league career list for wins as a manager.  He also led the U.S. Olympic team to the gold medal at the
2000 Games in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
