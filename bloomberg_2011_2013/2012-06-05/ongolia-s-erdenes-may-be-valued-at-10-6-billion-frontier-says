Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, the Mongolian
state-owned coal miner proposing an initial public offering, may
be worth as much as $10.6 billion, according to Frontier
Securities.  The value of the each Erdenes share is 933 tugrik (70.8
cents), Frontier said in a e-mailed report, citing a May 30
statement on the government’s website. Frontier calculated the
value of the company based on Erdenes having 15 billion shares.  Erdenes Chief Operating Officer Graeme Hancock confirmed a
value had been set without giving further details.  The company last month delayed its planned IPO until
February or March, citing a decline in global market conditions.
It had planned to raise $3 billion from the share sale in  Hong
Kong , London and Mongolia’s capital,  Ulan Bator  before the
delay.  “The valuation is reasonable and is in line with that of
 Mongolia Mining Corp. (975) ,” Helen Lau, an analyst at  UOB-Kay Hian
Ltd. (UOBK)  in Hong Kong, said by phone. “But market sentiment is poor
right now and investors may not have the appetite.”  Mongolian Mining, the nation’s biggest coking coal
exporter, is worth HK$19.8 billion ($2.5 billion) based on
today’s share price at 2:54 p.m. It has 3.7 million shares
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mining companies have lost 32 percent of their market value
in the past year, the Bloomberg  World Mining (MIGWMFA)  Index shows.
Companies including  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  and  China Nonferrous
Mining Corp. (1258)  canceled or reduced share sales planned for last
month in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong IPOs  Companies have raised $3.1 billion selling new shares in
Hong Kong so far in 2012, down 65 percent on a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The IPO is set to be Mongolia’s first listing of a state-
run miner overseas as the country’s economy grew by a record
17.3 percent last year. Mongolia is holding parliamentary
elections on June 28.  Erdenes is developing the East Tsankhi part of the 6
billion-metric-ton Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
