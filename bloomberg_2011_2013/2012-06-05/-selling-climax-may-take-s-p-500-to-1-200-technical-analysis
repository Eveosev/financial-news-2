The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
extend its decline from its April peak to 15 percent in a
“selling climax” that would deplete bears, according to
StockCharts.com Inc.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities dropped 9.9 percent
to 1,278.18 through yesterday from its 2012 high on April 2 as
concern grew that global economic growth is slowing and  Europe ’s
debt crisis is worsening. While the gauge will likely be
supported at 1,250, further selling may push it as low as 1,200,
a level where the S&P 500 would  retrace 61.8 percent  its advance
since October, said Arthur Hill, a technical analyst at Redmond,
Washington-based StockCharts.com.  “Economic reports have been largely below expectations the
last two months and the stock market is pricing in this
information,” Hill wrote in a note yesterday. While the  S&P 500 
will probably find support at 1,250, “we could even see an
overshoot because some sort of selling climax is possible before
all selling is exhausted,” he said.  The S&P 500 slumped 6.3 percent in May, the most since
September, amid concern  Greece  would exit the euro area and as
data on U.S. jobs and manufacturing missed forecasts. The index
on June 1 dropped below its  200-day average  for the first time
since December after a Labor Department report showed the
economy added the fewest jobs in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
