India ’s rupee was steady amid
speculation the central bank will lower borrowing costs this
month for a second time in 2012 to support economic growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has more room to ease monetary
policy after gains in gross domestic product  slowed  and oil
prices dropped, even as inflation risks remain, Deputy Governor
Subir Gokarn said in Mumbai yesterday. The RBI is due to review
rates on June 18. The currency erased most of the day’s gains
after a report showed  Europe ’s manufacturing and services
industries shrank the most in almost three years.  “The deterioration in the rupee is both fundamental and
sentiment-driven,” Deepali Bhargava, Mumbai-based chief
economist for India at Espirito Santo Investment Bank, wrote in
a report today. “Our call of another 75 basis points or 100
basis points rate cut by the RBI in an effort to address growth
concerns, together with the recent correction in  oil prices  and
gold demand, would likely be a positive.”  The rupee was little changed at 55.6450 per dollar in
Mumbai, compared with 55.6650 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency’s one-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point, to 12.9
percent.  Asia ’s third-largest economy expanded 5.3 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the least since 2003, government
data showed last week. Crude oil, the nation’s biggest import,
has declined 22 percent this quarter in  London  to $98.02 a
barrel. Local demand for gold, the second-largest import, will
drop as much as 14 percent this year, the World Gold Council
said in May.  Three-month onshore currency forwards traded at 56.58 a
dollar, compared with 56.41 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.73 from 56.63. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
