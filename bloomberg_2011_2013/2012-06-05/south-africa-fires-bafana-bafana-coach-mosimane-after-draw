The South African Football
Association said it fired Pitso Mosimane, the coach of the
national team, after the country drew 1-1 at home against
 Ethiopia  in its opening match of the campaign to qualify for the
2014  World Cup .  Steve Komphela will act as caretaker coach, the
Johannesburg-based association said on its website today.  Mosimane presided over the failure of the team, known as
Bafana Bafana, to qualify for this yearâ€™s African Cup of Nations
after he misunderstood the rules and played for a draw when a
win was needed. The team celebrated at the televised match
before being told that they had failed to qualify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
