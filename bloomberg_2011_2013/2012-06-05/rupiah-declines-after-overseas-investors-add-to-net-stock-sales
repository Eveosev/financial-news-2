Indonesia ’s rupiah declined after
overseas investors cut holdings of the country’s stocks.  Funds based abroad sold $25 million more of the nation’s
equities than they bought yesterday, taking net sales this month
to $98 million. Finance ministers and central bank governors
from the Group of Seven countries will hold a call today to
discuss the European debt crisis, Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said yesterday as a report showed U.S. factory orders
unexpectedly contracted in April for a second month.  “It’s risk aversion and so there has been equity market
outflows,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The big picture hasn’t changed, in
that markets are still pretty edgy and there’s no real solution
to the European crisis.”  The rupiah weakened 0.4 percent to 9,438 per dollar as of
3:45 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency gained 1.4 percent
yesterday. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was little changed
at 15.75 percent.  The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds declined, with the
 yield  rising one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.54
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
