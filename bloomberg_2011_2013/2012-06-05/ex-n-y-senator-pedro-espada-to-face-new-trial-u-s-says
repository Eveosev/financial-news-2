Pedro Espada Jr., the former  New York 
State Senate majority leader, and his son will face a new trial
on charges they stole from nonprofit health-care clinics the
elder Espada ran in the Bronx.  A jury convicted Espada on May 14 of four counts of theft,
while failing to reach a decision on other counts of theft and
conspiracy. Jurors failed to reach a verdict on any of the
charges against his son, Pedro Gautier Espada.  “The government is going forward on all counts,”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn Pokorny told U.S. District Judge
Frederic Block today in  Brooklyn , New York.  U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch accused the Espadas of stealing
more than $500,000 from Soundview Healthcare Center, which the
elder Espada started in 1978 and which gets more than $1 million
a year in federal funding.  The Espadas were charged in December 2010 when the elder
Espada was still in the state senate. He had been defeated that
September in the Democratic primary for his Bronx seat. The
Espadas engaged in several illegal schemes from January 2005 to
February 2010, prosecutors said.  The Espadas were tried on eight counts. Five charged them
with stealing from Soundview, one count for each year from 2005
through 2009. They were also charged with conspiring to steal
from Soundview, to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and
to commit  wire fraud . The theft counts carry maximum prison
sentences of 10 years.  The case is U.S. v. Espada, 10-cr-985, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  -- Editors: Stephen Farr,  Andrew Dunn   To contact the reporter on this story:
