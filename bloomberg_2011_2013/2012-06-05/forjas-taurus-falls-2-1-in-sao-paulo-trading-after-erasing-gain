Forjas Taurus SA (FJTA4) , a Brazilian
manufacturer of firearms, fell 3.2 percent to 1.84 reais at the
close in  Sao Paulo , after erasing an earlier gain of as much as
2.6 percent. The benchmark Bovespa index slid 1.7 percent.  Taurus said in a regulatory filing today that it received
from the machinery company Renill Participacoes Ltda. a proposal
to buy a facility in Gravatai, Rio Grande do Sul, owned by a
subsidiary, Taurus Maquinas-Ferramenta Ltda.  The sale of the subsidiary was planned in May 2011 as part
of the reorganization of Forjas Taurus, which is scheduled to be
completed by September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
