The euro region’s troubled southern
members should look to  Finland ,  Canada  and the Baltic states for
evidence that debt cutting can promote economic growth,
according to a German government policy paper.  Expansion in these countries was bolstered by “structural
reforms” along with strengthening public finances, which create
confidence and foster credibility among consumers and investors,
said the paper prepared for coalition lawmakers.  Sustainable growth “can neither be bought by public-
spending programs, nor by government intervention that distorts
competition, or expansive monetary policy,” according to the
eight-page report completed by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s office
along with the economy and finance ministries.  The paper reflects Merkel’s position in negotiations with
the opposition parties in the lower house of parliament, whose
support Merkel needs to pass a law on the fiscal pact for more
budgetary discipline in  Europe  and the permanent euro region
backstop, the European Stability Mechanism.  The government and the two biggest opposition parties have
set up working groups to reconcile  differing views  on the best
way to foster European growth. Merkel and opposition leaders are
scheduled to meet June 13, four days before parliamentary
elections in France and Greece, to agree on a position.  To contact the reporters on this story:
