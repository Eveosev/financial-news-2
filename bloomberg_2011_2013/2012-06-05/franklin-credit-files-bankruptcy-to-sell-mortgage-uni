Franklin Credit Holding Corp. (FCMC)  filed
for bankruptcy with plans to sell its only asset, an 80 percent
stake in a mortgage-servicing unit, to help pay creditors owed
$827.3 million.  Franklin listed $1.2 million in assets in a Chapter 11
filing yesterday in Newark,  New Jersey . Creditors including
Huntington National Bank agreed to support a plan to sell
operating unit Franklin Credit Management Corp., which isn’t in
bankruptcy, Franklin said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission  filing .  The sale may allow “Franklin Holdings stockholders to
potentially retain some value,” according to the regulatory
filing. The company could exit bankruptcy by August if creditors
and the court approve the plan, Franklin said.  Mortgage-servicing companies, which collect payments from
borrowers and oversee foreclosures, have struggled after a drop
in housing prices led more homeowners to default. Residential
Capital LLC, the mortgage lender and servicer owned by  Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY) , last month filed the year’s biggest bankruptcy.  The case is In re: Franklin Credit Holding Corporation
12-24411, U.S. Bankruptcy Court District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
