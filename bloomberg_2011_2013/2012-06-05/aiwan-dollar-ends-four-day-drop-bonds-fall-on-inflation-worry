Taiwan ’s dollar snapped a four-day
decline and government bonds fell for the first time in a week
after official data showed inflation accelerated more than
economists estimated in May.  Consumer prices  rose 1.74 percent from a year earlier,
compared with an increase of 1.44 percent in April and the
median forecast of 1.4 percent by economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The U.S. dollar’s 14-day relative-strength index against
the local currency reached 80.4 yesterday, exceeding the
threshold of 70 that signals the greenback will reverse gains.
Global funds sold $439 million more of the island’s stocks than
they bought in June on concern an escalating  European debt
crisis  is hurting Taiwan’s economy.  “Some exporters sold the greenback as they see the rally
is kind of over for now,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-
exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The central
bank might keep the Taiwan dollar stable to strike a balance
between inflation risk and slowing growth.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$30 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$30.07 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 17. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders
use to price options, fell 25 basis points to 5.81 percent.  Exports slumped 5.3 percent in May from a year earlier, a
third month of contraction, analysts estimated before official
data due on June 7.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.927
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. It reached 0.909
percent yesterday, the lowest level for benchmark five-year
rates since Oct. 26, 2010.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
