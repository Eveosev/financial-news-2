Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said the government will have to raise taxes to finance
spending after revenue projections were lower than originally
planned.  “Revenue projections have turned out to be low,” Fischer,
68, said at a conference in  Jerusalem  today. ’’We are going to
have to raise taxes in order not to have excessive deficits.’’  Fischer, who is in his second term overseeing Israel’s $245
billion economy, said that while no decision has been made
regarding which tax to increase, the government is likely to be
“particularly careful” about raising corporate taxes because
it doesn’t want them to exceed the rates in other countries. The
value-added tax may be a possibility, he said.  “Everybody is talking about an increase in the VAT and
there may be other taxes that need to be raised in order to
finance spending without having too big a deficit,” Fischer
said.  The government deficit is estimated as reaching 3.2 percent
of gross domestic product this year, compared with a target of 2
percent, as a result of the expected decline in revenue, Fischer
has said.  Israel ’s economic growth is expected to slow to 3.2 percent
this year from 4.8 percent last year, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said in May, stunted by the
 European debt crisis . Exports account for about 40 percent of
the economy, and  Europe  is the country’s largest market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
