The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose,
amid the cheapest valuation in six months, after an unexpected
increase in a measure of  service industries  and as a report said
Europe’s bailout fund was preparing a  credit line  for Spain.  Financial, commodity and technology shares had the biggest
gains in the S&P 500 among 10 groups.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  climbed at least 2.9 percent. A gauge of
 homebuilders  in S&P indexes rallied 4 percent as  Lennar (LEN)  Corp.
and  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  surged more than 5.9 percent.  Facebook Inc. (FB) 
retreated 3.8 percent, extending its decline since the company’s
initial public offering last month to 32 percent.  The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 1,285.50 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 26.49 points, or
0.2 percent, to 12,127.95. It snapped a four-day drop. The
Russell 2000 Index of small companies gained 1.2 percent to
746.09. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges
today, or 9.3 percent below the three-month average.  “I’d be a buyer of stocks,”  John Manley , chief equity
strategist for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in New York, said in
a telephone interview. His firm oversees $205 billion. “The
 U.S. economy  is doing OK. Obviously, there are lots of things
that could go wrong. We’re going to have to see more agreements
in Europe. Yet valuation is attractive, the market is cheap.”  The  S&P 500  started the day trading at  12.9 times  its
companies’ reported earnings, the lowest valuation since
November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday,
the index briefly extended a drop from its April peak to more
than 10 percent amid disappointing economic data.  Economic Data  Equities reversed early losses today as the Institute for
Supply Management’s  index  of non-manufacturing businesses, which
covers about 90 percent of the economy, unexpectedly rose to
53.7 last month from April’s 53.5. The  median  forecast of 75
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected 53.4. Finance
ministers and central bank governors from the world’s leading
economies agreed to coordinate their response to Europe’s crisis
on a conference call that dealt with Spain and Greece.  Spain called for outside support for the first time to
battle the  financial (S5FINL)  crisis as Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro
said European institutions should help shore up the nation’s
lenders. The country may receive a precautionary credit line
from the European Financial Stability Facility, Germany’s Die
Welt newspaper reported in a preview of a story that will run
tomorrow, citing unidentified people familiar with talks about
the possible option.  ‘Bipolar’ Market  “We’re going to continue to see a bipolar financial market
until the European situation gets sorted out,” said Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees $127 billion of assets.
“The U.S. economy is growing at a glacial pace. This growth
rate could sustain market valuations.”  Eight out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 gained. The  KBW Bank
Index (BKX)  added 1.5 percent. JPMorgan climbed 3.2 percent to $31.99.
Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest personal-computer maker,
rose 2.9 percent to $21.68. Homebuilder Lennar jumped 6.7
percent to $25.27, after slumping 13 percent in two days.
PulteGroup increased 6 percent to $8.16.  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  led a rally of  life insurers  as
investors bet the company’s agreement to handle pension
obligations for General Motors Co. may signal more opportunities
for the industry. Prudential, the second-largest U.S. life
insurer, advanced 2.8 percent to $45.99. No. 1  MetLife Inc. (MET) 
climbed 2.1 percent to $28.39.  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  surged 5.5 percent to $33.41. The company,
which makes memory chips used in mobile devices, was rated
outperform in new coverage at Pacific Crest Securities.  Facebook Slumps  Facebook slid 3.8 percent to $25.87, the lowest since it
went public last month at $38. A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed
sagging interest in the site and a minority of users being
influenced by ads and comments when making purchasing decisions.  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  dropped 2.8 percent to $52.41. The world’s
largest coffee-shop operator agreed to buy Bay Bread LLC for
$100 million in cash, making its largest acquisition to further
expand its offering of food with pastries and sandwiches.  Dollar General Corp. (DG)  declined 3.6 percent to $46.76. The
discount-retail chain said Buck Holdings LP, along with Chief
Executive Officer Richard Dreiling and other executives, plans
to sell a total of  25 million shares .  W.W. Grainger Inc. dropped 5.1 percent to $177.95. The
supplier of industrial goods from tools to paper fell after an
MKM Partners analyst said the growth phase of the manufacturing
cycle is over.  ‘Selling Climax’  The S&P 500 may extend its decline from its April peak to
15 percent in a “selling climax” that would deplete bears,
according to StockCharts.com Inc. The index dropped 9.9 percent
to 1,278.18 through yesterday from its 2012 high on April 2 as
concern grew that global economic growth is slowing and  Europe ’s
debt crisis is worsening.  While the gauge will likely be supported at 1,250, further
selling may push it as low as 1,200, a level where the S&P 500
would  retrace 61.8 percent  its advance since October, said
Arthur Hill, a technical analyst at Redmond, Washington-based
StockCharts.com.  “Economic reports have been largely below expectations the
last two months and the stock market is pricing in this
information,” Hill wrote in a note yesterday. While the S&P 500
will probably find support at 1,250, “we could even see an
overshoot because some sort of selling climax is possible before
all selling is exhausted,” he said.  The S&P 500 slumped 6.3 percent in May, the most since
September, amid concern Greece would exit the euro area and as
data on U.S. jobs and manufacturing missed forecasts. The index
on June 1 dropped below its  200-day average  for the first time
since December after a Labor Department report showed the
economy added the fewest jobs in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
