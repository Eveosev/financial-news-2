Portugal ’s construction sector is on
the “verge of collapse” and in need of an emergency program to
help restructure debt, the country’s biggest industry group
said.  The construction industry owes banks about 25 billion euros
($31 billion) and insolvency risks are rising as banks cut back
on loans, Ricardo Pedrosa Gomes, president of the Public Works
and Construction Association said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The industry needs an emergency program to promote
investment and to help cut and restructure debt, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
