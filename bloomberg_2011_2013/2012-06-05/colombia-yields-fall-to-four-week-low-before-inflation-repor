Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level in four weeks, before a report
forecast to show inflation slowed in May.  The yield on 10 percent peso-denominated debt due in July
2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.08
percent, according to the central bank. That’s the lowest on a
closing basis since May 8. The price increased 0.21 centavo to
123.256 centavos per peso.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.32 percent in May from 3.43
percent the previous month, according to the median estimate of
23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics
agency is slated to publish its monthly report this evening in
Bogota. Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said last month
inflation will probably end the year at about 3 percent, the
mid-point of the bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target.  “People have been lowering their inflation bets,” said
Pedro Ospina, a fixed-income analyst in Bogota at Interbolsa SA,
the country’s biggest brokerage. “ Gas prices  have been cut and
as the economy expands at a slower pace” that curbs inflation,
he said.  Colombia lowered the price of gasoline in June for a second
straight month as international  oil prices  fell in May. Policy
makers expect  Latin America ’s fifth-largest economy to grow 5
percent this year after expanding 5.9 percent in 2011.  The peso climbed 1.4 percent to 1,792.35 per  U.S. dollar .
That’s its biggest jump on a closing basis since December 2010.
The peso is up 8.2 percent this year, the best performance among
all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
