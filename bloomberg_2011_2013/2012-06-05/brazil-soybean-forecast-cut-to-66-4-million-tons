Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer, will harvest less than
previously forecast after drought pared output, the government
said.  The forecast for the crop year that started Sept. 1 was
reduced to 66.4 million metric tons from 66.7 million tons
estimated on May 10, the  Agriculture Ministry ’s crop-forecasting
agency, known as Conab, said in a report today. Production will
fall from 75.3 million tons in the previous crop year.  The forecast for corn output was raised to 67.8 million
tons from 65.9 million tons. Brazil, the world’s third-largest
grower of the grain, produced 57.4 million tons of corn in the
previous crop year.  The U.S. is the world’s largest producer of soybeans and
corn.  China  is the world’s second-biggest corn grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
