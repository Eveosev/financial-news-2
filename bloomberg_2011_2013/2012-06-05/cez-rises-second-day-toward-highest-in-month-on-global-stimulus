CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
increased for a second day, headed for its highest in a month as
speculation that the worldâ€™s policy makers will take measures to
stimulate economic growth boosted demand for riskier assets.  The stock rose 1.1 percent to 741 koruna by 3:08 p.m. in
Prague. A close at that level would be the highest since May 2.
The  PX (PX)  index of 14 equities, in which CEZ has a 21 percent
weighting, gained 1 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
