Australia ’s dollar rallied to the
strongest in a week versus the dollar after the central bank
lowered  interest rates  less than some forecasts yesterday.  The Aussie gained for a second day before a report
projected to show the nation’s economy expanded at the fastest
annual rate in four years in the first quarter.  New Zealand ’s
currency rose against the yen as global stocks advanced.  “There are still a lot of concerns in the market, but
central banks are coming in and taking measures to ease
conditions, so we’re seeing less of a deterioration in risk than
recently,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for
Gain Capital Group LLC in  New York .  Australia’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to 97.42 U.S. cents as
of 5 p.m. in New York yesterday. It touched 98.04 U.S. cents,
the strongest since May 30. The Aussie added 0.7 percent to
76.72 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 75.61 U.S. cents
and the kiwi gained 0.5 percent to 59.55 yen.  The  Reserve Bank of Australia  cut interest rates by 0.25
percent to 3.5 percent. Swaps data compiled by Bloomberg had
shown a more than 40 percent chance of a reduction to 3.25
percent.  “With a further reduction in rates from the RBA likely at
future policy meetings, we would view Aussie-dollar strength as
short opportunities and look to fade rallies,” Viloria wrote to
clients today.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  rose 0.6 percent. The S&P
GSCI Index of 24 raw materials gained 0.1 percent.  Australia’s gross domestic product rose 3.3 percent in the
three months through March from a year earlier, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists.
That would be the biggest increase since the first quarter of
2008.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand, scheduled to hold a policy
meeting June 13, held its target rate at 2.5 percent in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
