The Swiss central bank’s reference to
the possible introduction of  capital controls  should be taken
seriously, Bank Sarasin said.  “Given the mounting pressure,” the announcement is
clearly intended as a warning shot to ‘speculators’,’’ Sarasin
economists said in an e-mailed research note published today.
Still, “such measures would only be considered in a worst case
as the costs would be high.”  Pressure on the SNB to resort to unorthodox measures to
defend its limit of 1.20 francs per euro could be mounting as
the escalating euro-area debt crisis prompts investors to seek
the Swiss currency as a safe haven. SNB President Thomas Jordan
on May 28 said in an interview controls on capital inflows are
among ways being considered by a government-led panel to stop
the franc from strengthening if the debt crisis worsens.  Negative  interest rates  would be the most probable means of
capital controls, Sarasin added. To discourage speculators, they
needed to be higher than the expected appreciation of the franc.  “If we assume in a worst case scenario that the SNB is not
able to defend the floor with its interventions” the Swiss
franc’s appreciation versus the euro could match the 15 to 20
percent quarterly gains seen last year,’’ Sarasin said. “In
that case, negative interest rates would need to be at a similar
level to ward off capital inflows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
