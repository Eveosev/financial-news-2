Syed Alwi bin Mohamed Sultan, the
Kuala Lumpur-based head of Islamic banking for Asia Pacific at
BNP Paribas Malaysia Bhd., discusses the trends in Islamic
finance at the World Islamic Banking Conference in  Singapore .  “There’s greater diversification of the investor base.
What we have seen from recent issuance is that there are greater
non-Islamic investors coming in to accept sukuk or invest in
sukuk instruments. The Khazanah Nasional Dim Sum sukuk witnessed
more than 50 percent from Singapore and Hong Kong investors. A
deal that BNP Paribas led and brought to market, the Bahrain
sukuk, more than 20 percent of European investors
participated.”  “We’re seeing the phenomenon of sukuk issuance is being
stretched. What seemed to be the sweet spot of sukuk tenors was
the five year. But today we can see the tenor being stretched
from seven to 10 years. This is a demonstration of the growing
maturity of the  Islamic finance  market.  “This year we will witness potential issuance from
countries like  South Africa ,  Kenya , and Senegal. Hong Kong had
already issued consultations into the bonds to look into the
stamp duty and tax ordinances to level the playing field for
sukuk issuance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
