JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  charges Mirella
Tovar as much as 10.25 percent annual interest on her student
loans -- a rate as high as a  credit card .  The 24-year-old aspiring graphic designer, the first in her
family to go to college, is among millions of former students
paying off high-interest loans to private lenders, among them
JPMorgan,  SLM Corp. (SLM)  and Discover Financial Services. In a good
month, Tovar earns $730 as a part-time hostess in a pizza
parlor, and most of that money goes toward her debt of $98,000.  Unlike the federal student-loan program, which lets
consumers borrow at fixed rates directly from the government,
these loans from at least 30 banks and other private lenders
feature mostly variable rates that can be more than twice what
some people pay in the U.S. program. With college costs
spiraling, the marketing and interest rates of these loans are
drawing increasing complaints from borrowers and regulators, who
say teenage consumers often don’t understand their terms.  “It was like signing up for iTunes,” said Austin Bousley,
25, who applied on the Internet for a private loan from SLM,
known as Sallie Mae, as a student at  Suffolk University  in
 Boston . Some of his loans, which he began taking out in 2006,
carried rates as high as 9.25 percent. “The interest is
accruing and accruing. I have a feeling I’ll be making payments
forever.”  Discover, SLM  Loans from banks and other private lenders make up about 15
percent of the $1 trillion in outstanding student debt,
according to an estimate by  Mark Kantrowitz , who runs
 FinAid.org , a website about college grants and loans. About 2.9
million students have private loans, according to the most
recent federal data analyzed by  The Institute for College Access
and Success , an Oakland, California-based nonprofit group.  Now, with college costs continuing to soar, Discover and
SLM are both working to expand their student-loan businesses.  “Student lending is a good investment,” said Carlos Minetti, president of consumer banking and operations at
 Discover. (DFS)  “It has an attractive customer base that tends to
have higher earning potential and lower unemployment over
time.”  JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, said in April
it would stop offering student loans on July 1 except to bank
customers. The shrinking private student-loan market and the
government’s expansion into originating federal student loans
are behind the bank’s decision, Steve O’Halloran, a spokesman,
said in an interview.  Staying Afloat  Private-lending practices are drawing the government’s
attention as Congress and the Obama administration look to help
students avoid predatory, high-interest loans.  “Like mortgages before the financial crisis, many
borrowers took on private student-loan debt with terms and
conditions they didn’t fully understand,” said Rohit Chopra,
the student-loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, a federal agency studying the private-loan market.
Recent graduates “are now fighting to stay afloat because these
loans don’t always have the same repayment options as federal
student loans,” he said.  To pay for college, students typically rely on fixed-rate
government-backed loans, with current  interest rates  for
undergraduates ranging from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. These
federal loans are  capped at $31,000  for a dependent student’s
undergraduate career. Parents can also take out federal loans at
7.9 percent up to the cost of attendance less any financial aid.  Fewer Protections  Beyond that are private loans, which are often used to
bridge the gap between the cost of college and what a student
can take in federal loans.  Private loans don’t offer students the same protections as
federal loans, such as  income-based repayment  plans and
deferment. Unlike federal loans, whose interest rates are set by
Congress, private loans aren’t guaranteed by the government.  Private loans can carry higher rates because students often
don’t have a credit history.  While lenders charge students high rates, banks such as
JPMorgan have been able to borrow from the U.S. Federal Reserve
at close to zero percent since December 2008. The central bank,
whose target for overnight interbank lending is zero to 0.25
percent, has said economic conditions will probably warrant
keeping it low through at least 2014.  Mortgage Rates  The average rate for a 30-year home mortgage dropped to
3.75 percent last week from 4.55 percent a year earlier,
according to mortgage finance company  Freddie Mac . Yesterday,
the U.S. 30-year bond yielded 2.57 percent.  Much of the outstanding private student debt was amassed
before 2008 when credit standards were less stringent and
lenders targeted the education market often through direct
marketing to students.  Private loans to students peaked at $22 billion in the
2007-2008 school year, according to data collected by the
 College Board , a New York-based nonprofit group. At the time,
about 14 percent of undergraduates took private loans, according
to a  2010 report  from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Annual lending dropped to about $6 billion in 2010-2011 as
lending standards tightened and federal loan limits increased.  More than two-thirds of borrowers with private loans who
took part in an online survey said they didn’t understand the
main differences between private and government loans. About
6,650 borrowers responded to the questionnaire from Young
Invincibles, a nonprofit group in  Washington  that focuses on
issues facing 18-to-34 year-olds.  Lifetime ‘Haunt’  Students are making decisions about private loans “when
they’re 19, 20, 21 years of age, which will haunt them for a
lifetime,” Senator  Richard Durbin  of  Illinois  said in a
telephone interview.  A bill introduced by Durbin and fellow Democrat, Iowa
Senator  Tom Harkin , in March would require colleges to counsel
students about taking out the maximum in federal loans before
venturing into the private market.  Tovar, the aspiring graphic designer, would have welcomed
such information. She said she didn’t know the difference
between private and federal loans in 2006, when she enrolled at
 Columbia College Chicago , a private, nonprofit school
specializing in art and media.  “I thought that was going to be the best option,” said
Tovar, who was also unaware that her loans didn’t carry a fixed
rate. “The school never sat down with me and had meetings about
payments or loans.”  Steve Kauffman, a spokesman for Columbia College Chicago,
declined to comment.  Loan Default  Tovar, who lives with her parents in the Chicago suburb of
Blue Island, owes $55,600 to Chase Student Loans, a unit of
JPMorgan, according to a May 17 statement provided by her. A
loan for $24,794 carries an interest rate of 10.25 percent, as
does a second loan for more than $2,619. A third for $28,187 has
a rate of 8.97 percent. She has a balance of $42,326 in loans
from a different lender.  While her parents have helped with her payments, it wasn’t
enough to avoid default on some loans. Tovar said she contacted
Chase and the bank told her they couldn’t negotiate.  American
Education Services , which services some of her loans told her
she could defer payment for one month, Tovar said.  “We continue to encourage customers to contact us if they
have questions about paying back their loans,” O’Halloran, the
Chase spokesman, said in an e-mail. He declined to comment
on the interest rates the bank charges for student loans.  ‘Same Stuff’  Bousley, who was 18 when he applied for his first student
loan from  Sallie Mae , also said he didn’t know the difference
between a private loan and a federal loan.  “If it said ‘student loan,’ I assumed it was all the same
stuff,” Bousley said. The cost to attend the  New England School
of Art and Design  at Suffolk University was about $37,000 his
freshman year, according to the college.  Bousley said he asked for more financial aid his senior
year. The school told him he would need to take out more loans
or he would be unable to continue his studies there, he said.
Also that year, Sallie Mae required a co-signer on his loan, he
said.  Suffolk has “historically and consistently” encouraged
students to utilize federal loan programs before taking out
private loans, Greg Gatlin, a spokesman for the school, said in
an e-mail. He said the campus counsels students about options
available to finance their education.  $116,000 Balance  Bousley said he borrowed $83,000 in private loans from
Sallie Mae. Today, the balance is more than $116,000 because of
accrued interest and missed payments, he said. He had been
making interest-only payments of $250 to $275 a month on just
two of his eight loans.  Sallie Mae  will adjust the terms of private loans for
certain customers when it determines the changes may increase a
customer’s ability to make payments, according to the company.
Options can include reduced payment plans, lower rates or
extended terms and temporary suspension of the requirement to
make payments, the company said.  After Bousley said he approached the lender, Sallie Mae
reduced the rate on all of his loans last month to 6 percent and
extended the terms, according to the company. He now pays about
$860 monthly, it said. He needs to keep up the payments for 15
months to maintain the lower rates moving forward.  Bousley, who now makes $65,000 a year, said his
indebtedness continues to dent his lifestyle. He was turned down
as a tenant by five Boston rental apartments last year, he said.
His sixth attempt, for a studio-sized apartment, was successful
only after his girlfriend’s father agreed to co-sign the lease.  Tuition Increases  Students are relying on private loans as the cost of
tuition rises faster than the pace of inflation. Average tuition
and fees to attend a public, four-year college were $8,244 this
past year, almost triple the $2,811 in 1995-1996. They have more
than doubled to  $28,500  from $12,216 at private schools,
according to data from the College Board. The figures exclude
room, board and other costs.  Sallie Mae, based in  Newark ,  Delaware , is trying to
increase its lending to students. The company’s private-loan
portfolio was $37 billion in the first quarter, about the same
level as in 2009. While the company said in April that it
expects to write $3.2 billion in private loans this year, that
is down from $7.92 billion in 2007.  Today, 88 percent of Sallie Mae’s outstanding private loans
carry rates below 10 percent, while half are less than 6.75
percent, according to the company.  Sallie Mae works with customers to help them navigate the
loan process, said Patricia Nash Christel, a spokeswoman for
Sallie Mae.  “Rates are disclosed multiple times during the application
process,” Christel said. “We incent customers to make small
payments while in school by offering rate reductions -- and in
the process save money over the life of the loan.”  Fixed Rate  Last month, the company said it planned to offer its first
fixed-rate student loans with interest rates ranging from 5.75
percent to 12.875 percent.  Discover, based in Riverwoods, Illinois, bought Citigroup
Inc.’s private student-lending business in 2010 and $4.2 billion
of the bank’s private student loans. It purchased an additional
$2.5 billion of loans in 2011.  Discover said last month it would offer a fixed-rate,
private student loan with interest rates from 6.79 percent to
9.99 percent, depending on the borrower’s creditworthiness and
if there is a co-signer, said Jon Drummond, a spokesman.  Tovar, the pizza parlor hostess, said when she talks to
young coworkers planning to attend college, she advises them to
seek federal student loans first.  “I tell them to take private loans as a last resort,” she
said. “I wish someone would have told me that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
