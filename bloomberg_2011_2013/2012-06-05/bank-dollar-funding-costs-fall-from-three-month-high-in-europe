The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell from the highest since March, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 55.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9:42 a.m.
in London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s down
from minus 59 yesterday, which was the most expensive since
March 19.  The one-year basis swap declined to 64 basis points below
Euribor, from minus 67 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- were unchanged at 33 basis points.  The Euribor/OIS spread held at 40 basis points. The measure
has been little changed for the past two months.  Lenders decreased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 781 billion euros ($970
billion) from 785 billion euros at the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
