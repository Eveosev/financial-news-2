Iranian parliament speaker  Ali Larijani , who has clashed with President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
over relations with the West regarding the country’s nuclear
program, was re-elected by lawmakers to head the assembly for
another year.  Larijani won 177 votes in the parliament today while
opponent Gholam Ali Haddad Adel received 89, the state-run  Mehr 
news channel reported. He beat the same opponent in last month’s
vote for an interim speaker.  Larijani has headed the parliament for the past four years.
The new legislature, which was  sworn in  on May 27, was formed
after elections earlier this year in which opponents of the
president won a majority.  A former top nuclear negotiator who stepped down from his
post following clashes with the president, Larijani ran in the
2005 election against Ahmadinejad. He is considered a potential
candidate in next year’s presidential race. Ahmadinejad, who is
serving his second four-year term, isn’t allowed to run again.  In March, Ahmadinejad became the first president in the
history of the Islamic Republic to be summoned by parliament and
questioned about allegations of political and economic
mismanagement. He has also been criticized for failing to show
sufficient allegiance to the country’s highest authority,
Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .  Larijani’s brother Sadegh heads the Iranian judiciary and
another brother, Mohammad Javad, is an adviser to Khamenei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
