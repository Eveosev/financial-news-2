Ahmad Mohamed Ali, president of the
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia-based  Islamic Development Bank , comments on
plans to set up a Shariah-compliant megabank. He commented in an
interview at the World Islamic Banking Conference in Singapore
today.  “There’s a team working very hard to finalize this,
hopefully by the end of this year. It’s very important for the
Islamic banking industry to manage their liquidity in a
professional way. The megabank will issue papers and instruments
which will allow Islamic banks to buy or disinvest them.”  On the turmoil in western banking:  “We want Islamic banking to complement and contribute to
the restructuring exercise of the global financial and banking
system. There are certain elements in Islamic banking which are
useful to the global financial infrastructure such as ethics,
doing real business in a real economy rather than market
speculation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
