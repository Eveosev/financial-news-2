Gold One International Ltd. (GDO)  obtained
an interim interdict from  South Africa ’s labor court ruling that
the  strike action  at its Modder East unit, which halted
operations yesterday, is unprotected.  Work stopped on June 3 when most night-shift employees
didn’t report for duty, while a group of day-shift workers
started a planned strike yesterday. The court interdicted the
Professional Transport Allied Workers Union from encouraging or
inciting any employees to participate in the unprotected strike
at the operation, located 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of
Johannesburg, Sydney-based Gold One said in a statement today.  “This continued unprotected strike action will result in
disciplinary action, which may include dismissal,” it said.  The union, which represents fewer than 30 percent of the
employees at Modder East, isn’t recognized by the company. The
 National Union of Mineworkers  represents the majority of the
1,800 employees at the mine.  Modder East management is communicating the details of the
interdict to employees and has instructed that they report for
duty, it said. Most workers for both yesterday’s night shift and
today’s morning session failed to report for duty, the company
said.  Gold One closed unchanged at 3.85 rand in Johannesburg. The
stock was also unchanged at 43 Australian cents in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
