(Corrects to say Buck Holdings and executives are selling
shares.)  Dollar General  Corp. declined the
most in more than two months after the discount-retail chain
said Buck Holdings LP, along with Chief Executive Officer
Richard Dreiling and other executives, plans to sell a total of
25 million shares.  Dollar General  fell  3.1 percent to $46.98 at 11:16 a.m. in
 New York , after earlier slumping as much as 4.2 percent for the
biggest drop since March 30. The stock had risen 18 percent this
year before today.  Buck Holdings, whose membership interests include
affiliates of KKR & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., plan to
sell 24.6 million shares, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. Dreiling, who is also Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based
Dollar General’s chairman, and other executives, will sell the
rest of the total.  The company raised its annual forecast yesterday and said
it expects annual profit excluding certain items of as much as
$2.78 a share, up from a prior projection of as much as $2.75.
That compared to an average analyst estimate of $2.77, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the first quarter, the chain had “excellent same-store
sales growth of 6.7 percent, representing the fifth consecutive
quarter of accelerating improvement,” Dreiling said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
