Spain  had an “extremely warm and
very dry” month of May, the  Agriculture Ministry  reported.  Average rainfall was 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) last
month, 40 percent below normal values, the ministry wrote in a
 report  on its website today. The average temperature was 18.6
degrees Celsius (65.5 Fahrenheit), making last month the fourth-
warmest May since 1960.  April was wetter than normal in Spain, while March was the
driest since 1997 and the December-February period brought the
least rain to the country since at least 1947, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
