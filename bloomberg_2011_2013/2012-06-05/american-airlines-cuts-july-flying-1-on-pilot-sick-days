AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s  American Airlines  will
cut its July flight schedule by about 1 percent as pilots at the
bankrupt carrier take sick days at a “higher-than-normal”
rate.  “We are constantly evaluating our operational and staffing
needs,”  Bruce Hicks , a spokesman, said today in an e-mailed
statement. “These schedule adjustments will ensure we provide
our customers with reliable service while minimizing any impact
to their travel plans.”  American’s move builds on a 1.5 percent pullback in June
flying by the third-largest U.S. carrier, which is restructuring
in Chapter 11. That reduction was spurred by the announcement of
 retirement plans  by 57 pilots, almost four times the number who
left the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline at the end of May.  Hicks’s statement cited “a number of factors” for the
July retrenchment, while only citing pilot sick time. American
had to pare flights in at least two months in 2011, when larger-
than-usual numbers of pilots retired to protect their pensions
from stock-market declines and a possible bankruptcy filing.  AMR sought court protection on Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
