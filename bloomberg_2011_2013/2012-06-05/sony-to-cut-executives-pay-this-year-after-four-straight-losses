Sony Corp. (6758)  will cut the salaries of
Chief Executive Officer  Kazuo Hirai  and directors after Japan’s
biggest exporter of consumer electronics  lost  856 billion yen
during the past four years.  Payments to executives including Hirai will be reduced,
Mami Imada, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, said by phone today. She
declined to elaborate. The  company  paid 799 million yen ($10
million) in salaries to 21 executives and  directors  in the year
ended in March, it said in a statement today.  Seven corporate executive officers returned their bonuses
for the year ended March 31, Sony said in a statement to
shareholders today. Once a trendsetter with products such as the
Walkman, Sony’s losses have mounted after customers switched to
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  TVs and Apple Inc. iPhones, pushing the
shares below  1,000 yen  yesterday for the first time since 1980.  Hirai took over as CEO in April from  Howard Stringer  and
predicted a return to  profit  this year.  Sony will seek shareholder approval for a new board,
consisting of 14 members, at a June 27 meeting, the company said
in the statement. Hirai also is seeking to become a board
member.  The Tokyo-based company, cutting 10,000 jobs as part of a
turnaround plan, has forecast making a profit of 30 billion yen
in the year ending March 31. Last year, the company had a record
457 billion-yen loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
