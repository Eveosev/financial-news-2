The 17 euro nations should jointly
issue debt to cut borrowing costs and adopt more pro-growth
policies to combat the regionâ€™s debt crisis, French European
Union Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told newspaper La
Stampa.  The disagreement between  France  and Germany over whether to
jointly sell debt centers on when to introduce the securities
and not whether to sell them, Cazeneuve told the Italian
newspaper. France wants to begin the process now as a way to
overcome the debt crisis, while Germany would back the bonds
once conditions improve as a way to signal that Europe has
overcome the crisis, he said in the interview.  French President  Francois Hollande  has been so outspoken on
the need for more policies to stimulate growth because without
more economic expansion, European democracy may be threatened by
the radical and populist forces that have gaining support during
the debt crisis, he told La Stampa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
