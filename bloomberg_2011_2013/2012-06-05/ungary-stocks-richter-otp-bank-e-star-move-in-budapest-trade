The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index fell 0.6
percent to 16,398.39 by the close in Budapest.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Gedeon Richter Nyrt. (RICHT)  , Hungary’s biggest
drugmaker, fell for the first time in four days after Origo
reported late yesterday that the government will further cut
spending on drug subsidies. The shares dropped 0.7 percent to
36,500 forint.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, rose 0.8
percent to 3,350 forint. European stocks rose, snapping four
days of losses, amid speculation that policy makers around the
world will take steps to stimulate economic growth.  E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR HB), a Hungarian energy
company, rallied 15 percent to 1,637 forint, the biggest gain
since August 2009. The stock’s 15 percent plunge yesterday
pushed its 14-day relative strength index to 18. RSI below 30
indicates to some analysts that a security is oversold. E-Star’s
Polish unit received an offer for a loan from Bank Zachodni WBK
SA, E-Star  said today .  To contact the reporter on this story:
