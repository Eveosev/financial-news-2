Libya ’s former spy chief went on
trial today on charges of ordering attacks on civilians and
forming an armed group to incite sedition and civil war, in the
first trial of a former official in Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  Abuzeid Dorda, who headed Libya’s foreign intelligence
service, was also accused of using force to prevent peaceful
demonstrations, the unlawful detention of civilians and abuse of
office, the official  Libya News Agency  said. It didn’t say what
sentence he could face if convicted.  Dorda is the first official to have served under Qaddafi’s
regime to be brought to trial under the new interim government.
Qaddafi was captured and killed months after the uprising began
last February.  One of the former leader’s sons, heir-apparent Saif al-
Islam Qaddafi, is being held by the Zintan militia and the
government has refused to hand him over for trial before the
 International Criminal Court , saying he must be tried at home.  The session was adjourned until June 26 after the
prosecution and the defense made their opening remarks, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
