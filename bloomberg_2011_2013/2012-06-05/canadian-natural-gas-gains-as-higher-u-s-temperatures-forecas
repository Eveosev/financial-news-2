Canadian natural gas fell as domestic
storage levels rose to a four-month high.  July gas in  Alberta  declined 1.8 percent. Canadian  supplies 
gained 17.8 billion cubic feet, or 3.3 percent, to 553.2 billion
in the week ended May 25, the most since Feb. 3, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg and Canadian Enerdata Ltd.  “It’s just relatively slack export demand,”  Martin King ,
an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp., in Calgary, said in a
telephone interview. “We’ve done some strong injections in the
last couple of days and that says some supply was getting backed
up in the system and it could be carrying over into today.”  Alberta gas for July delivery fell 3.5 cents to C$1.92 a
gigajoule ($1.75 per million British thermal units) on NGX, a
Canadian internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped
to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange rose 3.1 cents to settle at $2.446 per million Btu.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
gained 6.54 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.4442 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 2.52 cents to $2.2047, according to ICE.
At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas rose 2.33 cents to $2.2977 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.92 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.02 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 281 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.7 billion cubic feet today, or 86 percent of its
capacity of 1.98 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.78
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
