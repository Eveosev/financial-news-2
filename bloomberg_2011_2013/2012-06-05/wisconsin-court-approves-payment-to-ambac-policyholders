Wisconsin ’s insurance commissioner
gained a state court judge’s approval of cash payments to Ambac
Assurance Corp. policyholders who have filed more than
$3 billion in claims.  Commissioner Theodore Nickel’s office undertook
rehabilitation of a segregated portfolio of Ambac policies
covering as much as $50 billion in mortgage-backed securities
and other corporate liabilities two years ago, winning court
approval in 2011 to pay claimants 25 percent of their losses in
cash and the balance by 2020.  Judge William Johnston in Dane County yesterday granted
Nickel’s request, filed last month, to start making those
payments.  Payment could begin in the third quarter of this year,
 Michael Fitzgerald , a spokesman for corporate parent  Ambac
Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) , said in a telephone interview today.  Ambac Assurance was the second-biggest U.S. bond insurer
before the 2008 financial crisis, after which mounting claims
spurred by mortgage defaults swamped the company with claims and
threatened its viability.  The insurer was paying out as much as $150 million a month,
exceeding its revenue, Nickel’s predecessor, Sean Dilweg, had
said.  The case is In re The Rehabilitation of Segregated Account
of Ambac Assurance Corp., 2010-cv-001576,  Dane County ,
Wisconsin, Circuit Court (Madison).  To contact the reporter on this story:
