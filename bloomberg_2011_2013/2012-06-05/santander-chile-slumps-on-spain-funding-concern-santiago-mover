Banco Santander Chile (BSAN) , a unit of
 Spain ’s largest lender, completed its steepest three-day loss in
four months amid concern that  Europe ’s deepening debt crisis
will require Spanish banks to seek further capital injections.  Santander Chile fell 1.3 percent to 35.40 pesos as Chile’s
benchmark stock index was little changed. The stock has lost 4.2
percent this week.  “Any negative sentiment from Spain will always weigh on
Santander Chile,” said Christopher Disalvatore, an analyst at
IM Trust SA in Santiago. “People may be selling on concern the
controller chooses to sell more shares by December once a lock-
up period announced for a previous sale comes to an end.”  Spain called for outside support for the first time to
battle the financial crisis as Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro
said European institutions should help shore up the nation’s
lenders. Shares in Spanish controller  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  reached
on May 30 the lowest closing level in more than three years.  Santander sold 7.8 percent of the Chilean unit for $960
million in December when it also agreed to divest its Colombia
unit to shore up finances. At the time the Madrid-based lender
agreed not to sell more shares in the Chilean unit for a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
