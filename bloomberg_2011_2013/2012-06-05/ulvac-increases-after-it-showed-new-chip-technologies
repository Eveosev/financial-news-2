Ulvac Inc. (6728)  surged the most in more
than three years in Tokyo trading amid speculation products the
company unveiled to investors yesterday will drive growth at the
Japanese maker of equipment for manufacturing chips.  The  shares  rose 17 percent, the biggest gain since December
2008, to 542 yen at close of trading in Tokyo. Almost 7 million
shares changed hands, a 10-fold increase over the six-month
daily average of about 670,000, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ulvac, based in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo, introduced
technology for making memory chips and electronic devices used
in smartphones at an investor seminar at its research center
yesterday, Takayuki Usumi, a company spokesman, said by phone
today. The technologies introduced match trends in the industry,
said Yuichi Ishida, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities
Co. in  Tokyo .  The investor seminar “led to a positive impression that
Ulvac’s chip-related businesses will probably help earnings,”
Ishida, who rates the stock a notch above neutral, said by phone
today.  The company gave no financial or unit sales targets for the
technologies introduced at the seminar, Usumi said.  Net income will probably be about 525 million yen ($6.7
million) in the year ending June 30, 2013, compared with a 51.8
billion yen loss this fiscal year, according to the average of
nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
