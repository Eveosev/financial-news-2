The ruble appreciated against the
dollar for a second day, paring its steepest decline since 2009
after the Russian central bank increased its intervention in the
market.  The currency gained 1.3 percent to 33.005 per dollar by the
7 p.m. close in Moscow, after losing the most since January 2009
last month. Russia’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due 2022 rose,
cutting the yield by five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 4.346 percent.  The central bank increased its foreign-currency sales to
support the ruble to $250 million to $300 million yesterday
after the currency passed 37.65 against its target dollar-euro
basket, according to Nomos Bank. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index
of equities climbed 0.6 percent today to 887.36 on bets global
policy makers will take steps to bolster growth.  “The reason for the ruble’s gains on the domestic market,
apart from the actions of the central bank, were the seeds of
optimism in world markets,” analysts at Moscow-based Broker
Credit Service wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  The ruble strengthened 1.6 percent to 36.6664 against the
basket and 1.8 percent to 41.1414 per euro.  Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.52 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 33.9695 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
