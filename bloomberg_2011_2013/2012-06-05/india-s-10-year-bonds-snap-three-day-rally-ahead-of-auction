India’s benchmark bonds were little
changed, with yields holding at the lowest level in seven weeks,
on speculation slowing economic growth will prompt the central
bank to cut  interest rates  this month.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has more room to cut interest
rates after economic  growth  slowed and  oil prices  dropped,
Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said yesterday. The nation’s
economy expanded 5.3 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, the least in nine years, according to official data
published last week.  “Investors are probably taking a cue from the slump in GDP
growth and betting on a rate cut possibility,” said
Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  “The decline
in international crude prices is also a positive.”  The yield on the government’s 8.79 percent bonds due
November 2021 was unchanged at 8.34 percent in Mumbai, according
to the central bank’s trading system. That is the lowest level
since April 17.  Brent crude oil has dropped 22 percent to $97.81 per barrel
since March. India imports about 80 percent of its oil.  The monetary authority last cut the repurchase  rate  by 50
basis points to 8 percent in April, after increasing borrowing
costs 13 times between March 2010 and October 2011. The next
rate decision is scheduled for June 18.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, were little
changed at 7.63 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
