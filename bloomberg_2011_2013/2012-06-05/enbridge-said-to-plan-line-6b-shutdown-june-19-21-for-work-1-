Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  plans to shut crude oil
Line 6B from June 19 to 21 for maintenance, according to two
people with knowledge of the situation.  The shutdown, for routine work, has been factored into the
month’s crude nominations and won’t affect deliveries, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  “We do not comment on routine, non-material pipeline
maintenance or operations,” Lorraine Little, a Superior,
Wisconsin-based spokeswoman for Enbridge, said in an e-mail.
“Lines are shut down and reactivated throughout the month for
various reasons and as part of routine activity, and those
shutdowns typically have no impact on shipments.”  Line 6B has a capacity of 283,000 barrels a day and runs
from Griffith,  Indiana , to Sarnia, Ontario. The line is
currently operating under a pressure restriction which limits
capacity to 231,400 barrels a day, according to a January update
on the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
