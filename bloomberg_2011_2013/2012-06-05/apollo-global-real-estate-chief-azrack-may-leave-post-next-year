Joseph Azrack, global head of real
estate at private-equity firm  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , may
scale back his role to chairman next year, a move that would
leave a void at the top as the firm accelerates its search for
investing opportunities in the industry.  Azrack, 65, entered into an agreement with Apollo on June 1
under which he may give up his role as managing partner of the
firm’s real estate business after Dec. 31, according to a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Azrack,
who has taught at  Columbia Business School  in New York and is a
 member  of its real estate program’s advisory board, has been
managing partner of New York-based Apollo’s property business
since 2008.  Raymond Mikulich, the former co-head of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s real estate investments who joined Apollo in
2010 to run its North American property business, stepped down
earlier this year. Coburn Packard and Jess Lipsey, two other
former Lehman employees who joined Apollo with Mikulich, remain
at the real estate division.  Azrack will receive an annual base pay of $1 million while
he remains in his current position and $350,000 if he
transitions to the chairman role, Apollo said. The firm’s real
estate business oversaw more than $8 billion as of March and
sees an “interesting” pipeline of investing opportunities,
President Marc Spilker said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
