Syncrude strengthened after  Canadian
Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the largest owner of the Syncrude Canada Ltd.
joint venture, said production of the synthetic grade dropped 41
percent last month.  Output fell because of work on the venture’s 8-3 coker unit
at its upgrader near Fort McMurray,  Alberta . May production
declined to 196,300 barrels a day from 330,300 barrels in April,
the company said in a report on its website yesterday. Total
production dropped to 6.1 million barrels from 9.9 million a
month earlier, according to the posting.  Syncrude’s discount to West Texas Intermediate narrowed
$1.50 a barrel to $7 at 1:51 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed
$1 to $24 a barrel. Bakken oil’s discount narrowed 35 cents to
$11.65.  U.S. Gulf Coast crude grades also strengthened. Light
Louisiana Sweet’s  premium  to WTI gained 70 cents to $12.70 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 80 cents to
$15.15 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium gained 65 cents to $10.90. Southern
Green Canyon’s premium widened $1.10 to $10.90. Poseidon’s
premium increased $1.80 to $11.25.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 25 cents to $12.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
