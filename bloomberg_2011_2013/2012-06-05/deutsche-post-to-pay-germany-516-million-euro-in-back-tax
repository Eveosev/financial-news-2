Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ,  Europe ’s largest
mail carrier, will pay 516 million euros ($642 million) in
German back taxes covering 1998 to 2010 to settle a dispute.  The postal company’s earnings goals for 2012 remain intact,
even with a second-quarter cost that will cut 180 million-euro
from earnings before tax and interest, because of earlier
provisions covering part of the payments, Bonn-based Deutsche
Post said today in a  statement .  Deutsche Post, which has been discussing the scope of the
extra value-added tax payment with authorities since 2010, won’t
appeal the sum since “the back-and-forth in a court wouldn’t be
any different from how the talks have been so far,” Dirk Klasen, a Deutsche Post spokesman, said by telephone. “We want
to close the book on the issue.”  Germany ’s government is separately demanding that Deutsche
Post repay 298 million euros in subsidies that the European
Commission said breached antitrust legislation. The German
postal operator has already filed an appeal against the European
Union ruling.  The tax payment announced today will reduce second-quarter
net income by 256 million euros, the postal operator said.  Deutsche Post  rose  as much as 0.7 percent to 12.89 euros
and was trading up 0.5 percent at 9:51 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The
stock has gained 8.3 percent this year, valuing the company at
15.6 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
