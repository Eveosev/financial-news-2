The dollar may drop toward 75.56
versus the yen after breaching key technical levels amid  risk
aversion  by investors, according to Bank of America Corp.  The U.S. currency may be poised for further declines after
it closed below the so-called cloud on its weekly ichimoku
chart, according to  MacNeil Curry , the bank’s New York-based
head of foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical strategy.
The dollar slid 2.1 percent to 78.02 yen in the five days ended
June 1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “While far from a definitive break, the larger bull trend
in U.S. Treasuries, and risk off trend generally, indicates that
this level will ultimately give way,”  Curry wrote in a report
yesterday. The greenback may fall toward a support area at 76.25
yen to 75.56 yen, he wrote. Support is an area on a chart where
orders to buy may be clustered.  The dollar lost 0.1 percent to 78.30 yen as of 10:16 a.m.
in  Tokyo . It retreated to 75.35 yen in October, a post-World War
II record low.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold two-year
Treasuries instead of similar-maturity Japanese bonds was at 15
basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, down from this year’s
high of 28 basis points.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said in August there’s a “relatively high”
correlation between the rate gap and the dollar-yen rate, as
falling yield premiums in the U.S. damp dollar-buying demand
from Japanese investors.  Ichimoku analysis is used to predict a currency’s direction
through analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows.
The cloud refers to the area between the first and second
leading span lines on the chart and is used to show an area
where buy orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
