Rates for ships that carry dry-bulk
commodities will recover later than previously estimated as
demand for cargoes slows, according to Fearnley Securities.  Daily earnings for Capesizes, the largest ships hauling
iron ore and coal, will average $14,000 next year and $16,000 in
2014, down from previous respective forecasts of $16,000 and
$20,000, according to the investment-banking unit of  Norway ’s
second-largest shipbroker. Rates for the vessels have been close
to operating costs for about half a year, Lars Erich Nilsen, an
analyst at Fearnley in Oslo, said today.  Global trade in dry-bulk raw materials will expand 4
percent this year, the least since 2009, according to Clarkson
Research Services Ltd., a unit of the biggest global shipbroker.
At the same time, outstanding orders at shipyards equal 23
percent of the current fleet, data from IHS Inc. show.  “Volume growth has been lower than expected for the last
few months and supply growth stays at a high level,” Nilsen
said by phone today. “There doesn’t seem to be a recovery in
this market for quite some time.”  Panamaxes, which can carry about half as much as Capesizes,
will earn $11,000 a day next year and $12,000 a day in 2014,
Fearnley predicted, cutting its previous forecasts of $14,500
and $18,125.  To contact the reporter on this story:
