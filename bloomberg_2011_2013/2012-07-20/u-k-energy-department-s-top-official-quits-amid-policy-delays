Moira Wallace, the top official at
the U.K.’s Department for Energy and  Climate Change , said she
plans to resign at the end of October.  Wallace, 50, will leave her position of  permanent secretary 
and take a short sabbatical before beginning an unspecified job,
the department said in a  statement  late yesterday.  The announcement comes three days after the department
delayed a decision on renewable power subsidies after a clash
with the Treasury over the magnitude of the reduction in support
for onshore wind power. The government is in the process of
changing its energy market to drive spending on new nuclear
power plants, wind farms and electricity networks.  The department said in an e-mail that it’s “absolutely not
the case” that Wallace was forced out, and that she was staying
until October to ensure an “orderly transition.”  “Four years is generally considered the norm for a
Permanent Secretary, and now is a suitable time for both the
department and Moira’s own career for her to move on,” the
department said.  Wallace was appointed permanent secretary to DECC in
November 2008. Prior to this, she held positions in the U.K.
Treasury and was Private Secretary to prime ministers  John Major 
and  Tony Blair  from 1995 to 1997.  She is one of nine women among 38 civil servants holding
the rank of permanent secretary or second permanent secretary,
according to the Civil Service website. The rank marks the most
senior official in a government department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
