Ecuador, which doubled exports to
the U.S. over the last three years, is seeking to expand trade
with the world’s biggest economy by tapping consumer demand for
the South American nation’s food and agricultural products.  The world’s biggest banana producer and top grower of  cocoa
beans  used in fine chocolate opened a commercial office in Miami
yesterday in a bid to increase exports, the Andean country’s
ambassador to the U.S., Nathalie Cely, said today in an
interview. Agricultural goods from Ecuador are sold in  Whole
Foods Market Inc. (WFM)  supermarkets, and the country plans to boost
exports of fresh fruit, cut flowers and fish by using Miami’s
access to direct flights to Asian nations like  South Korea , she
said.  “Miami is an extremely important port for us,” Cely said
by telephone from the Atlantic-coast city known for its beaches,
international banks and high concentration of Spanish-speaking
Americans. “On the East coast we see big opportunities but we
are also targeting the Latin American market inside the U.S.”  U.S. imports of Ecuadorean goods jumped 29 percent last
year to $9.6 billion while exports to the South American country
increased 12 percent to $6.1 billion, according to the  U.S.
Census Bureau . The U.S. is  Ecuador ’s biggest trade partner.  “A large part of our exportable goods have high potential
in the Latino market,” Cely, Ecuador’s former production
minister, said. “One of the things that makes me very happy is
to find our chocolates here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
