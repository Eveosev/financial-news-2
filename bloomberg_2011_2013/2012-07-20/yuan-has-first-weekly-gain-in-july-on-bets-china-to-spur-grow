China’s  yuan  had its first weekly
gain this month after the central bank strengthened the
currency’s daily fixing and on speculation that Premier  Wen
Jiabao  will implement measures to revive economic growth.  Wen said at least twice this week that the nation’s economy
is yet to stabilize and reiterated the need for policy fine-
tuning in coming months to spur growth. The People’s Bank of
China raised the yuan’s  reference rate  0.02 percent to 6.3112
per dollar today, the strongest level since June 21. The
currency will continue weaken against the dollar in the second
half and the government may have to intervene to ensure a stable
exchange rate, China Securities Journal said, citing  Liu Yuhui ,
a researcher at the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .  “People are expecting Premier Wen will announce something
more significant than what he has done and the foreign-exchange
market is getting firmer,” said  Tim Condon , chief Asia
economist at ING Financial Markets in Singapore. “The risk-on
environment also helps with no particular news from Europe.”  The yuan gained 0.08 percent this week to close at 6.3735
per dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency, which can trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the fixing, was little changed today. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, traded at 1.35 percent, from last week’s 1.45
percent.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.02
percent today to 6.3720, limiting its weekly advance to 0.07
percent. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.12 percent
this week to 6.4135, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contracts dropped 0.01 percent today, a 0.62 percent
discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
