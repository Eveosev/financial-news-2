Ethiopian police yesterday arrested
an unspecified number of Muslim leaders involved in last week’s
unrest in the capital,  Addis Ababa , Communications Minister
Bereket Simom said.  “Those arrested are people who instigated the violence,” he
said by phone from the city today. “They were trying to
undermine the constitution under the guise of religion.”  The arrest of a “self-appointed” committee from Awalia
Mosque in Addis Ababa and others was made after obtaining a
court order, Bereket said. He declined to say how many people
had been detained.  The mobile-phone of Ahmedin Jebel, a spokesman for the
committee, was switched off when Bloomberg called seeking
comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
