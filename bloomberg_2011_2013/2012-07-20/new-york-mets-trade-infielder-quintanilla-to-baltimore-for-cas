The New York Mets traded Omar Quintanilla to the  Baltimore Orioles  today, three days after the
infielder had been designated for assignment.  Quintanilla, 30, has a .218 batting average in seven Major
League Baseball seasons with Colorado, Texas and the Mets, with
whom he hit .257 in 29 games as a backup infielder this season.  The Mets announced in a news release that they had received
an unspecified amount of cash from the Orioles in exchange for
Quintanilla.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
