French police arrested four
Romanians suspected of being part of a gang thatâ€™s stolen 5
million euros ($6.1 million) worth of farm tractors, regional
newspaper Le Dauphine reported.  The gang specialized in stealing new tractors from
dealerships and stole about 50 of the machines since the end of
2010, with prices ranging from 70,000 euros to 120,000 euros,
depending on the model, the newspaper reported.  The four suspects were stopped southeast of Paris this week
as they were headed for  Romania  with a truck carrying three
stolen tractors, Le Dauphine wrote. The gang would take the  farm
equipment  through Belgium, Germany and Hungary before selling
the tractors in Romania, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
