Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose the most in two months after yields fell at a debt auction
yesterday. The dong weakened.  The State Treasury sold 1.3 trillion dong ($62.4 million)
of the 2 trillion dong of five-year notes on offer at a yield of
9.88 percent, according to the  Hanoi Stock Exchange . At the last
sale on July 12, it issued 500 billion dong of similar-maturity
securities at 9.9 percent, compared with the 2 trillion dong
available.  “The actual yield at auction, and the amount sold at the
auction, implies that investors have come back to the market,”
said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based fixed-income trader at Bank
for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  The yield on five-year bonds fell 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 9.95 percent in Hanoi, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest drop
since May 10. Yields fell 12 basis points this week, the most
since the period ended June 8.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 3:23 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,843 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency strengthened 0.1 percent
from July 13.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
