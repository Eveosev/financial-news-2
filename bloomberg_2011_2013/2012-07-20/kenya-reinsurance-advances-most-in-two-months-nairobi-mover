Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE) , the state-
owned reinsurer, rose the most in two months on speculation the
company will benefit from gains in the equity market.  Kenya Re advanced 5.4 percent to 9.85 shillings by the
close in Nairobi, the biggest gain since May 17, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The stock has gained as investors expect good
performances from insurance companies due to their investment in
the equity market as it has rebounded by 20 percent year to
date,” Eric Musau, an analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank, said by phone today. “Kenya’s insurance
companies are required to invest a third of their premium in
quoted equities for purposes of liquidity.”  The Nairobi Securities Exchange All Share Index has gained
26 percent this year. Kenya Re’s full-year net income climbed 24
percent to 1.91 billion shillings ($22.6 million), it said on
April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
