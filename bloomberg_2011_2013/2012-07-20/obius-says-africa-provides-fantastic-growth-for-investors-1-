Economic growth is making Africa a
“fantastic” investment destination, with the most attractive
companies being those focused on consumers, said  Mark Mobius ,
the executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group.  Producers of “packaged foods, soft drinks, beer, anything
that’s relatively low priced and within reach of the massive
population” are top picks, Mobius, who oversees about $45
billion, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The
Pulse” with Maryam Nemazee in London today.  The  MSCI EFM Africa Index (MXFMEAF)  of shares has climbed 6.1 percent
this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index. Gross domestic product in Sub-Saharan Africa will
increase 5.4 percent this year, compared with a 3.5 percent
expansion for the global economy, according to forecasts by the
International Monetary Fund this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
