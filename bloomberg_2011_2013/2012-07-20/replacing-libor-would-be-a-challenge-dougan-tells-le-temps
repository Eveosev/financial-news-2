Replacing Libor would be a
“challenge” given the number of contracts linked to the rate,
 Le Temps  reported, citing an interview with Credit Suisse Group
AG Chief Executive  Brady Dougan .  Credit Suisse has done internal studies with respect to the
setting of Libor rates and the firm isn’t aware at this time of
a “significant problem” in this area, the Swiss newspaper
cited Dougan as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
