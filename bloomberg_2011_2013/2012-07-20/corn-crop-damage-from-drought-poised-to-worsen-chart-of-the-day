Corn is due for more damage from a
drought that has produced the worst U.S. growing conditions in 
almost a quarter century, according to  David Driscoll , a 
Citigroup Inc. analyst.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the percentage of the corn
crop in good to excellent condition, according to data compiled
by the Agriculture Department. Average readings for the previous
25 years and data for 1988, another drought year, are included
for comparison.  Only 31 percent of this year’s crop was good or excellent
last week, the USDA data showed. The figure was lower than the
38 percent rated as poor or very poor.  “Above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall
will likely persist,” Driscoll wrote two days ago in a report
citing  weather forecasts  for the Midwest, where most U.S. corn
is produced. “This would worsen the corn situation.”  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  is at risk, he wrote, because
higher corn prices tied to the drought will make the company’s
ethanol production more costly. Driscoll cut his rating on the
Decatur, Illinois-based company to neutral from buy on July 1.  The effect on packaged-food producers will depend on the
extent of damage to soybeans as well as corn, the report said.
Although this will be clearer at the end of August, he wrote,
current crop prices point to “a manageable situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
