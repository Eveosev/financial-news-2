Electricite de France SA started its
Chinon B-4 nuclear power plant, according to the nation’s grid
operator Reseau de Transport d’Electricite.  EDF, the world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator, has
40 reactors online, representing 69 percent of available nuclear
capacity, RTE data show. EDF’s 58 nuclear plants generate about
78 percent of the country’s power.  The following table lists EDF’s atomic units that are out
of  service , their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE. Two asterisks highlight an unplanned halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
