Apple Inc. (AAPL)  was barred by a federal
judge from using a court order blocking U.S. sales of  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) ’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer as evidence in
a patent-infringement trial set to start July 30 in  San Jose ,
 California .  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose ruled her order
last month barring sales of the Tab is of “limited value” in
the upcoming trial, and the “prejudicial effect to Samsung
would greatly outweigh any relevance for the jury,” according
to a July 19 ruling made public yesterday.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit yesterday
denied Samsung’s request to lift a ban on sales of the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 tablet computer pending appeal. Koh also issued a June
29 ruling blocking U.S. sales of Samsung’s Galaxy Nexus
smartphone.  “Admitting these rulings into evidence would likely
confuse the issues and waste time because it would likely
devolve into a litigation within a litigation,” Koh wrote in
her ruling.  Koh’s order stems from pretrial arguments in the case in
which Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung and Cupertino,
California-based Apple, the world’s two biggest makers of high-
end phones, have accused each other of copying designs and
technology for mobile devices. The companies are fighting patent
battles on four continents to retain their dominance in the $219
billion global smartphone market.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-
cv-1846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
