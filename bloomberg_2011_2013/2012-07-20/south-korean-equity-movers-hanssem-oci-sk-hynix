Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in South Korea trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Seoul. The Kospi
index was little changed at 1,822.93. The gauge rose 0.6 percent
this week.  Hanssem Co. (009240)  (009240 KS), which makes kitchen furniture,
gained 1.9 percent to 16,500 won. The company plans to buy back
250,000 shares, according to a regulatory filing.  OCI Co. (010060)  (010060 KS), South Korea’s biggest polysilicon
maker, dropped 1 percent to 199,000 won, the lowest level since
June 8. China will start anti-dumping probes on solar-grade
polysilicon products imported from U.S. and South Korea,
according to a statement posted on the Chinese commerce
ministry’s website.  SK Hynix Inc. (000660)  (000660 KS) rallied 4.2 percent to 21,250
won, its steepest gain since June 11.  Investors appear to bet that the recent share-price decline
was “excessive,” and demand in the third quarter may be better
than earlier estimated, Kim Hyung Sik, an analyst at Taurus
Investment & Securities Co., said by phone today. The stock
tumbled 9.6 percent in the first three days of this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
