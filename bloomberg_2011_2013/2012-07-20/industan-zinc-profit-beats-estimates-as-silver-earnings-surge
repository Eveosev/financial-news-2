Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) ,  India ’s largest
producer of the metal, reported its highest profit in five
quarters, beating analysts’ estimates, after earnings from its
silver business surged.  Net income rose 6 percent to 15.8 billion rupees ($286
million), or 3.74 rupees a share, in the three months ended June
30, the unit of London-based  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  said in a
stock exchange filing. Sales fell 4 percent to 27.1 billion
rupees.  Silver sales surged 70 percent to 3.9 billion rupees, while
profit rose 82 percent to 3.5 billion rupees in the quarter. An
almost 60 percent increase in other income and lower tax
expenses helped the company beat a decline in prices of lead and
zinc, its biggest products.  Zinc, used to rust-proof steel sheets, averaged 15 percent
lower in the quarter, while the average lead price on the London
Metal Exchange fell 23 percent. The two metals, which make up 83
percent of the company’s revenue, accounted for 55 percent of
its profit, according to the statement.  Shares of Udaipur, Rajasthan-based Hindustan Zinc rose 0.7
percent to 119.80 rupees in Mumbai today. The stock has declined
13 percent in the past year, compared with a 7.3 percent drop in
the benchmark Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
