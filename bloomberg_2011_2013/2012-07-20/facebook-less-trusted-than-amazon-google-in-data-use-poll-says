Fewer Web users trust  Facebook Inc. (FB) 
with personal data than other Internet companies, including
Amazon.com Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , a new poll suggests.  One-third of Internet users said they’re comfortable with
Facebook’s handling of personal information to target ads for
them, according to a  Harris Interactive Inc. (HPOL)  survey released
today. Twice as many, or 66 percent, are comfortable with online
retailer Amazon using data on past purchases to recommend
products, and 41 percent of respondents trust Google to show ads
based on past Web searches, according to the data.  Facebook, owner of the world’s largest social network, uses
data about people’s preferences to help advertisers market their
wares. It agreed in November to settle complaints by the Federal
Trade Commission that it failed to protect user information or
disclose how the data would be used.  The poll, conducted by Harris on behalf of mobile marketing
firm Placecast, surveyed 2,262 U.S. adults online in February.
It asked about their level of comfort with the use of their data
by various companies and types of merchants, including grocery
stores and mobile-phone carriers.  Grocery stores were the most trusted group among
respondents, 81 percent of whom said they felt comfortable with
grocers using their shopping habits to tailor coupons to them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
