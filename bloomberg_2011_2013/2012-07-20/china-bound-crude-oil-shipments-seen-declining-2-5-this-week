Crude-oil shipments aboard
supertankers bound for  China  fell 2.5 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tankers with a total carrying capacity of almost 14 million
deadweight tons are heading for the Asian nation, compared with
14.3 million tons last week. About 10 percent of the fleet of
the largest  oil tankers  signaling future destinations is bound
for China, the world’s biggest energy consumer. The ships would
haul about 102.5 million barrels of oil, assuming a conversion
factor of 7.33 barrels a ton.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 439 very large crude
carriers, out of a global fleet of 571, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Average drafts are expressed as a
percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size. Each country’s percentage share of total oil
shipments is shown for the current and previous weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
