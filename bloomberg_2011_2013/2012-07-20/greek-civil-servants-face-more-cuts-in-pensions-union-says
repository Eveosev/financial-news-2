The Greek government plans to cut
lump-sums paid to civil servants on retirement by more than a
fifth, according to the civil servants’ union, which said it
will resist the measure.  The one-time pension payments are set to fall by 22.3
percent, on top of a 20 percent reduction in earlier rounds of
austerity measures, the union, ADEDY, said in an e-mailed
statement. The union’s leadership met with Labor Minister
Ioannis Vroutsis in Athens yesterday. The minister rejected
proposals for securing the viability of civil servants’ pension
funds, according to the union statement.  “The government’s now-stated decision to proceed with
drastic new cuts to public workers’ insurance and pension rights
is a cause for war for civil servants,” the union said in the
statement. “We demand that the government respects and honors
its commitments not to cut workers’ and pensioners’ incomes
further.”  Greece ’s coalition government is working on an 11.5
billion-euro ($14 billion) package of measures for the next two
years to convince international creditors to disburse bailout
loans. About 8 billion euros of cuts and savings had been found
as of July 18, when a meeting was held between Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras and the leaders of the two other parties in his
coalition, a Finance Ministry official said.  ADEDY said in its statement that the financial viability of
state-run pension funds was damaged by the forced inclusion of
their Greek government bond holdings in a 200 billion-euro debt
restructuring this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
