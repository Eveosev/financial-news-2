Asian currencies had a second weekly
advance on speculation the U.S. and China will adjust policies
to revive the world’s two biggest economies, boosting demand for
riskier assets.  Malaysia’s ringgit gained the most since January and South
Korea’s won reached a two-week high after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on July 17 that policy makers are
studying options for further stimulus measures. Premier  Wen
Jiabao  said the government needs to assess the situation in
China’s economy, which grew at the slowest pace since 2009 last
quarter, Xinhua News Agency reported on July 15.  “Investor sentiment is still being driven by prospects of
fresh quantitative easing in the U.S.,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh ,
a strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. “This is
benefiting high-yielding assets.”  The ringgit rallied 1.1 percent to 3.1513 per dollar as of
4:28 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, snapping a two-week drop, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The won rose 0.8 percent to
1,141.20, the  Philippine peso  gained 0.3 percent to 41.865 and
Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.995.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s currencies, added 0.2 percent while its 60-day
historical volatility dropped to 3.66 percent from 3.72 percent
a week ago. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of equities climbed 1.3
percent for the week.  Signs of Slowdown  Reports this week showed sales of existing homes and
consumer spending in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped in June,
while U.K. retail sales rose less than economists predicted. The
 International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth forecast for
2013 on July 16 to 3.9 percent from a 4.1 percent estimate in
April. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trade partners, fell  0.5 percent  from
July 13.  China’s  yuan  gained 0.1 percent to 6.3740 per dollar in
Shanghai. The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s daily
reference rate at 6.3112 today, the strongest level since June
21. Premier Wen said this week the economy is yet to stabilize
and reiterated the need for policy adjustments in the coming
months to spur growth.  “People are expecting Premier Wen will announce something
more significant than what he has done and the foreign-exchange
market is getting firmer,” said  Tim Condon , chief Asia
economist at ING Financial Markets in Singapore. “The risk-on
environment also helps with no particular news from Europe.”  The central bank has lowered its benchmark  interest rates 
twice in the past two months, while trimming banks’ reserve-
requirement ratio three times since November. Nomura Holdings
Inc. said the State Council may detail more stimulus measures
this week.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.2 percent this week to
9,465 per dollar, Thailand’s baht was steady at 31.67 and
India’s rupee was little changed at 55.1525. The Vietnamese dong
rose 0.1 percent to 20,850.  To contact the reporter on this story:
