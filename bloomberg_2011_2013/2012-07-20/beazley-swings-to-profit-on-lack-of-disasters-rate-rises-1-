(Corrects analysts’ estimate in second paragraph.)  Beazley Plc (BEZ) , a Lloyd’s of London
insurer, swung to a first-half profit on premium rate rises and
an absence of costly natural disasters so far this year.  Pretax profit was $112.9 million in the six months to June
30 compared with a $24.2 million loss a year earlier, the
Dublin-based company said today in a statement. That beat the
$96 million average estimate of three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “Claims experience in the first half of 2012 has been
relatively benign, with claims notifications lower than normal
and loss development in line with our expectations,” Beazley
said in the statement.  The lack of major natural disasters this year has helped
insurers recover from 2011, when earthquakes in  Japan  and  New
Zealand , windstorms in the U.S. and flooding in  Thailand  cost
the industry $105 billion, the most on record for single year.
Those costs helped Beazley raise premium rates 3 percent, with
policies covering catastrophes up 5 percent, the company said.  Beazley raised its first-half dividend 8 percent to 2.7
pence a share, compared with 2.5 pence a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
