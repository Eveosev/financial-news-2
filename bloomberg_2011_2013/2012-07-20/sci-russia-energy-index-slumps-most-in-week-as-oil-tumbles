MSCI Inc.’s Russia Energy Index (MXRU0EN)  fell
the most in two weeks as the nation’s oil producers retreated
after crude dropped for the first day in eight in  New York .  The MSCI  Russia  Energy Index declined 1.8 percent to 966.04
by 7:11 p.m. in Moscow, the most since July 6. OAO Rosneft
dropped 1.4 percent to 205.39 rubles on the Micex Index. OAO
Surgutneftegas retreated 1.1 percent to 27.15 rubles. OAO
 Tatneft (TATN)  declined 2.6 percent to 192.12 rubles. OAO Lukoil fell 1
percent to 1,805.20 rubles and OAO Transneft retreated 1.9
percent to 50,540 rubles.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, fell from a nine-week
high in New York, as worse-than-expected U.S. manufacturing and
existing home sales data spurred concern crude demand may be
weakening. Oil retreated 1.5 percent to $91.31 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
