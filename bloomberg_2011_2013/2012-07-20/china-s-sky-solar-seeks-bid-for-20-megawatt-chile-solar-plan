Sky Solar Holdings Co. , a Chinese
solar-energy developer, will solicit bids to build a $60 million
demonstration plant in Chile’s northern Arica province to grab
the attention of the local  mining industry .  Companies will bid for the rights to install and supply
panels with 20 megawatts of generation capacity that will track
the sun’s movement along a single axis, Hong Chen, Shanghai-
based Sky Solar’s managing director for  Latin America  and
 emerging markets , said yesterday in a telephone interview.  Mining companies that pay some of the region’s highest
prices for power are being inundated with requests from solar
developers claiming they can cut their energy costs, Chen said.  “This project is meant to build our prestige and
reputation,” Chen said.  Sky Solar plans to sell part of the facility’s power to a
mining company after it comes online in the first half of next
year, he said. The remaining capacity will be sold on the spot
market, where electricity sells at an average $120 a megawatt
hour.  Sky Solar, the Chinese Development Bank Corp. and  Sigdo
Koppers SA (SK) , a local engineering company, plan to develop 300
megawatts of projects in Chile that may cost $900 million, Sky
Solar said June 28 on its  website .  Chile’s high power prices and sunny climate mean it “will
be the first Latin American country to reach grid parity” where
solar projects generate profit without subsidies, Chen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
