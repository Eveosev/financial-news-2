Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
abandoned his forecast for a return to growth next year as the
euro area’s fourth-largest economy endures a fourth round of
austerity.  Gross domestic product will fall 0.5 percent in 2013
instead of rising 0.2 percent as the government predicted April
27, Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said after a weekly
Cabinet meeting today in Madrid. Unemployment will rise to 24.6
percent in 2012 instead of 24.3 percent, dropping to 24.3
percent in 2013 instead of 24.2 percent, he said.  The economy returned to recession last year, and Spaniards
are enduring their fifth year of crisis and surging unemployment
after the collapse of the real-estate boom. The nation’s
economic outlook is worsening as Rajoy’s government implements
110 billion euros ($135 billion) of measures over three years to
cut budgets, raise taxes, shrink public wages and charge more
for education and health care to tackle the euro area’s third-
largest budget deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
