Gold Resource Corp. (GORO) , a miner of the
metal with operations in  Mexico , dropped the most in more than
three years after cutting its full-year ouptut forecast.  The shares  fell  24 percent to $19.16 at 10:45 a.m. in New
York, the biggest intraday decline since Nov. 20, 2008.  Gold Resource cut its 2012 production forecast to 100,000
ounces to 120,000 ounces of so-called gold equivalent, which
includes silver, after lower-than-expected output in the second
quarter from its Arista mine in Oaxaca state, the company said
yesterday in a statement after the close of regular trading. It
previously forecast 120,000 ounces to 140,000 ounces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
