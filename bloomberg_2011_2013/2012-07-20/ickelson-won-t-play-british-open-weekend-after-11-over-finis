Phil Mickelson  missed the midway cut
at the British Open after shooting a second-round 78 yesterday
to leave him 11 over par at the golf seasonâ€™s third major
championship.  Mickelson, the four-time major winner who is 16th in the
 Official World Golf Ranking , finished two rounds at Royal Lytham
& St. Annes in northwest England 21 strokes behind leader  Brandt Snedeker , who is 10 under par. The cut line was 3 over and 83
golfers advanced to play the final two rounds.  Mickelson, 42, had three double-bogeys, three bogeys and
one birdie yesterday, shooting a 41 on his final nine holes. He
shot a 3-over-par 73 during opening-round play.  After a career-best runner-up finish at the British Open
last year, Mickelson slumped recently before finishing 16th last
week at the Scottish Open. He had 30-1 odds entering the
tournament, making him tied as the seventh favorite, according
to a consensus of Nevada sports books.  To contact the reporter on this story:
