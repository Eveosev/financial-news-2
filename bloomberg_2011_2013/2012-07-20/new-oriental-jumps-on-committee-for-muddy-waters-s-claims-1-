New Oriental Education & Technology
Group Inc. (EDU)  rallied for a second day after forming an independent
committee to review allegations raised by short seller Muddy
Waters LLC about the Chinese company’s accounting practices.  The American depositary receipts of New Oriental jumped 15
percent to $12.91 in  New York , extending a two-day gain to 36
percent. The rebound followed a 35 percent slump on July 18 as
Muddy Waters questioned the ownership of some of New Oriental’s
schools and the consolidation of their financial statements with
the parent company.  The Beijing-based educational services provider, known as
EDU, said it formed a special committee comprised of three
independent directors to conduct a review of the allegations. It
aims “to provide the highest level of transparency to its
shareholders,” according to its statement today.  “EDU provided a more detailed response and addressed
additional allegations via a conference call last night,”
Jeffrey Meuler, an analyst at Robert W Baird & Co., wrote in a
note to clients today. “The management said they were not aware
of the report until this Wednesday, and therefore EDU is still
in the process of gathering and analyzing data.”  New Oriental, responding to  Muddy Waters ’s allegations in a
statement yesterday, said it owned 664 schools and learning
centers at the end of May as previously disclosed and that 21
third-party operated “cooperation facilities” and their
students were never counted as the company’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
