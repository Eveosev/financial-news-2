The district court in Cyprus’s port
city of Limassol will decide Monday whether a 24-year-old
Lebanese with a Swedish passport remains in police custody on
terrorism related charges, his lawyer said.  “The defense objected to the continuation of the detention
on the grounds that there is no reasonable suspicion for the
offense and that there is no evidence to the effect that
Hezbollah is a terrorist organization,” Antonis Georgiades, who
represents the suspect, told reporters in Limassol today.  Georgiades said he also objected to additional charges
related to “what was reported in the press” against his
client, who was arrested two weeks ago.  The newspaper Phileleftheros today reported that Cyprus
authorities are assuming that the arrest is related to a plan
similar to the bomb attack against a bus carrying Israeli
tourists at Burgas airport in  Bulgaria  on July 18.  Israel  blamed
 Iran  and the Lebanese organization Hezbollah for the attack,
which killed seven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
