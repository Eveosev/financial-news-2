China ’s stockpiles of crude for
commercial use rose in June for a fourth month to the highest
level in at least 30 months, and oil-product inventories
declined, according to the official Xinhua News agency.  Supplies of crude, excluding emergency reserves, climbed
4.8 percent at the end of June from a month earlier, Xinhua’s
China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals newsletter showed today. That
puts inventories 1.43 million higher in the month at 31.31
million metric tons, the most since January 2010, when Bloomberg
started compiling the data. The newsletter stopped reporting
volumes in July 2010 and now reports on the percentage changes.  China raised its crude reserves as the European Union put
sanctions on Iranian oil exports starting July 1 and Brent crude
prices slid in May and June. The nation’s crude surplus supplies
in June, or net  imports  and domestic production minus the amount
processed, were 2.13 million tons, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on government data.  Gasoline inventory fell 7 percent, and diesel dropped 8.8
percent last month, according to the newsletter. China’s daily
crude refining declined to the lowest level in eight months in
June, government data showed July 13.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
