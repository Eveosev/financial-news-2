The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  fell 0.4 percent to settle at 651.87 at 4 p.m.
in  New York , paced by industrial metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26  prices  declined 0.4
percent to 1,573.51.  BASE METALS  Copper futures fell the most in a month after  China  said it
won’t ease restrictions on home purchases, dimming demand
prospects from the world’s largest metal-consuming country.  China will seek to keep a “firm grip” on the market to
prevent a rebound in housing prices, the official Xinhua News
Agency said. The Copper Development Association estimates that
40 percent of world demand comes from construction materials
including wire and pipe.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for September
delivery dropped 2.4 percent to $3.448 a pound, the biggest
decline for a most-active contract since June 21.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slid 2.4 percent to $7,545 a ton ($3.42 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc, tin, lead and nickel also fell in London.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle prices fell the most in five weeks on speculation
that high feed costs and drought-damaged pastures will force
more U.S. ranchers to sell livestock, increasing beef supplies
amid weak demand.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
October delivery fell 1 percent to $1.231 a pound, the biggest
decline since June 13.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 2.2
percent to $1.361 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.3 percent to
79.8 cents a pound.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell for the first time in eight days on concern
that European governments aren’t doing enough to contain the
worsening debt crisis, raising speculation that demand will ebb.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for August
delivery dropped 1.3 percent to $91.44 a barrel.  Brent oil for September settlement retreated 0.9 percent to
$106.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  Statoil ASA failed to sell North Sea Forties crude at a
higher price than yesterday. Glencore International Plc offered
Russian Urals in northwest Europe without success at a bigger
discount to Dated Brent.  Libya ’s state-run National Oil Corp. reduced its August
official selling price of benchmark Es Sider crude to the lowest
level in almost three years, according to a price list obtained
by Bloomberg News.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil fell, ending a seven-session rally, on concern
that Europe’s debt crisis, slower growth in China and a stagnant
 U.S. economy  will reduce fuel demand.  On the Nymex, heating-oil futures for August delivery fell
0.8 percent to $2.9243 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for August delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$2.943 a gallon.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybeans extended a rally to a record and corn closed at an
all-time high as forecasts for dry weather next week boosted
concern that the persistent Midwest drought will cut output in
the U.S., the world’s top grower.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean futures for November
delivery jumped 2.1 percent to $16.8625 a bushel, after reaching
a record $16.91.  Corn futures for December delivery increased 2.2 percent to
$7.9575 a bushel, a record settlement for a most-active
contract.  Wheat futures for September delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
$9.4325 a bushel, rising for an eighth straight session, the
longest rally since Dec. 28.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas closed above $3 per million British thermal
units for the first time in six months on forecasts for hotter-
than-normal weather that would erode a surplus of the U.S.
power-plant fuel.  On the Nymex, gas futures for August delivery rose 2.7
percent to $3.081, the first settlement above $3 since Jan. 6.  The U.K. price for immediate delivery rose as the network
manager forecast lower supply after Dutch pipeline deliveries
halted and flows from a liquefied natural-gas terminal slumped.  Gas added as much as 1.1 pence to 55.6 pence a therm. It
was at 55 pence at 4:30 p.m. London time, according to broker
prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equal to $8.59 per million
Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures gained for the second straight day as  Russia ’s
central bank increased holdings of the precious metal.  On the Comex, gold futures for August delivery rose 0.2
percent to $1,582.80 an ounce, narrowing this week’s loss to 0.6
percent.  Silver futures for September delivery climbed 0.3 percent
to $27.302 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for October delivery fell
0.6 percent to $1,414.50 an ounce. Palladium futures for
September delivery dropped 1.5 percent to $576.10 an ounce.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Orange juice  fell for the ninth straight session, the
longest slump in three years, as rains boosted the crop outlook
in  Florida , the world’s second-biggest citrus grower.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, orange juice for September
delivery slid 2.3 percent to $1.11 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery jumped 2.9 percent
to 23.92 cents a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
