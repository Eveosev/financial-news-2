Speculative-grade corporate debt in
Europe is the most expensive to insure against losses in 1 1/2
years relative to sovereign bonds as companies need to refinance
as much as $180 billion of debt by 2014.  An index of credit-default swaps on junk-rated European
companies exceeds one for  government bonds  by 2.44 times, up
from 1.65 in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Finnish mobile-phone manufacturer  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  led the increase
among European non-financial companies, with a 136 percent jump
in the last three months, followed by Rome-based toll-highway
operator  Atlantia SpA (ATL) , whose swaps climbed 72 percent.  Borrowers in Europe, the  Middle East  and  Africa  face $84
billion of junk-rated debt maturing next year and $96 billion in
2014, compared with 2011’s record bond sales of $70 billion,
Moody’s Investors Service said. Their ability to service debt is
being hurt by the worsening economic outlook, with the
International Monetary Fund forecasting July 16 that output will
shrink 0.3 percent in the euro area this year.  “The problems now are for peripheral corporates,” said
Nicolo Bocchin, a  money manager  at Aletti Gestielle SGR SpA in
Milan. “It is very difficult to access the market.”  The divergence between high-yield corporate and government
default risk is being exacerbated by investors snapping up bonds
of the safest sovereigns, in some cases agreeing to pay to lend
to the nations.  Germany ’s two-year note yield fell to minus
0.074 percent on July 18 while Austrian, Swiss and Finnish rates
also turned negative this week for the first time.  Fiat Bonds  Italian carmaker  Fiat SpA (F)  paid a yield of 677 basis points
more than the benchmark mid-swap rate when it sold 600 million
euros ($737 million) of 7.75 percent bonds due October 2016 on
July 11.  The Turin, Italy-based company borrowed for five years at a
spread of 408 basis points when it issued 1.5 billion euros of
6.875 percent notes in November 2009. It has 6.55 billion euros
of debt due by the end of 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Richard Gadeselli, a Fiat spokesman, declined to comment.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate debt from default in the U.S. increased, with the
Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors
use to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
climbing 2.6 basis points to a mid-price of 110.7 basis points
as of 11:02 a.m. in  New York , according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  The measure typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  Rate Swaps  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
bond market stress, increased 0.56 basis point to 23.75 basis
points as of 11:03 a.m. in New York. The gauge widens when
investors seek the perceived safety of  government securities  and
narrows when they favor assets such as corporate bonds.  Bonds of  San Jose , California-based EBay Inc. are the most
actively traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by
dealers today, with 245 trades of $1 million or more as of 11:03
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The
world’s largest Internet marketplace sold $3 billion of debt
yesterday in its first offering since 2010.  Junk-rated companies in Europe’s so-called peripheral
countries have about $144 billion of debt outstanding, of which
54 percent matures between 2013 and 2016, according to Moody’s.
Portuguese companies have 48 billion euros of the debt and those
in  Greece  have 11 billion euros, the New York-based ratings
company’s data show.  Sovereign Downgrades  The amount of high-yield debt has swelled amid downgrades
of previously investment-grade businesses as reductions in
sovereign ratings drag down issuers’ grades.  Moody’s reduced  Spain ’s rating three levels to Baa3 on June
13, and said it may cut it further. S&P lowered its grade of A
to BBB+ on April 26.  Italy , which was cut two steps to Baa2 at
Moody’s on July 13, is rated one level higher at BBB+ by S&P.  “The real issue is we’ve had lots of peripherals that are
fallen angels as a result of sovereign ratings going down,”
said Andrew Lake, the head of high-yield at London-based Aviva
Investors Ltd., which manages the equivalent of $410 billion.
“Those companies have lots of short-dated debt, hence the
increase in the wall of maturities 2013 to 2014.”  The cost of insuring European high-yield corporate debt has
declined in the past month, though less than for sovereigns.  Crossover Index  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 mostly junk-rated borrowers fell to 645.5 basis points,
from 753 on May 18, a 14 percent decline, prices compiled by
Bloomberg show. The Markit SovX Western  Europe  Index of 15
governments fell to 255 from 330 on June 1, a 23 percent drop.  The ratio between the two increased to as much as 2.56
times on July 17, the highest since December 2010. The figure
has come down from as much as 6.32 times in March 2010.  The deterioration in speculative-grade European company
credit is being worsened by the outlook for economic growth.  The euro-area economy stalled in the first quarter as the
sovereign debt crisis deepened.  Gross domestic product  was
unchanged from the last three months of 2011, when it shrank 0.3
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said June 6.  The lack of growth is holding back companies’ capital
spending and hiring, reducing  tax revenue  for governments and
deepening the crisis. Unemployment was 24.6 percent in Spain in
May, and 10.1 percent in Italy, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development in Paris said on July 10.  Paying More  It’s also causing some companies to pay more to raise money
or to be taken over when they can’t pay their debt.  Findus Group Ltd., the frozen-food company owned by
private-equity firm  Lion Capital  LLP, will be taken over by its
junior lenders in a debt restructuring after it breached debt
covenants that creditors had waived in March, four people with
knowledge of the situation said July 7.  Under the plan led by Lion Capital, Highbridge Capital
Management LLC and JPMorgan, junior creditors will write off
more than 200 million pounds ($310 million) of mezzanine loans
in return for ownership and provide 70 million pounds in a
short-term credit facility, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private. They will inject
220 million pounds into the company, including 125 million
pounds to reduce senior debt, the people said.  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest cement maker, paid 441
basis points over swaps to issue 500 million euros of 5.875
percent seven-year notes on July 2, its first bond sale after it
was cut to junk in March 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Nokia credit-default swaps rose to 1,192 basis points from
518 on April 19, while Atlantia contracts increased to 381 from
224, Bloomberg prices show.  If companies “don’t have cash on the balance sheet”
they’re “not in a good place,” said Andrew Sheets, a European
credit strategist at Morgan Stanley in  London . “If a company
generates free cash then it’s in control of its own future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
