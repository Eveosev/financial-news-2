A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , a U.S. maker of
 lithium-ion batteries  for electric cars, surged the most in a
month after winning a contract to supply a 2-megawatt system to
China’s  Ray Power Systems Co.  to help regulate grid frequency.  A123, based in Waltham,  Massachusetts , rose 9.6 percent to
76 cents at the close in New York, the most since June 18. With
today’s gain the company has a market value of about $111
million.  The batteries will store electricity until needed to help
stabilize China’s electric grid and allow for the integration of
fluctuating renewable-energy resources such as wind and solar
power plants, Ray Power Systems said today in a statement
released by A123.  “This is an application A123 has been chasing for some
time and it’s good to see they’re making progress,” said
Michael Lew, a senior analyst at Needham & Co. in  New York  who
has a hold on the stock. He estimates that the 2-megawatt
storage system is comparable to enough batteries to run about
800 to 1,000 hybrid-electric cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
