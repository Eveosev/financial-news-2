Ethanol futures in  Chicago  fell for
a second day on speculation that supplies of the fuel are ample
to meet demand even as producers trim output because of high
corn prices brought on by drought.  The biofuel fell two days after an Energy Department report
that  inventories  climbed last week to 19.6 million barrels, 2.1
percent above a year earlier. Producers have responded to
estimates of a smaller corn crop and higher manufacturing costs
by cutting  output  to the lowest level in more than two years.  “The ethanol market is still relatively well-supplied,”
said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in New York.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 1.3 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.705 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices are up 23 percent so far this year and gained
5.8 percent for a fifth weekly advance, the longest streak since
March 16.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.82 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.68, in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.74 and on the West Coast at $2.92 a gallon, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn for December delivery advanced 17.25 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $7.9575 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Distillers are losing about 34 cents on each gallon of the
biofuel made, based on September contracts for corn and ethanol,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and 34 cents based on
the December contracts after the corn harvest. Corn is the
primary ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol, and an estimated 78
percent of the U.S. crop is affected by drought.  “The corn crop is in serious trouble,” Breitenbach said.
“We can expect this combination to put pressure on ethanol
margins until production and inventories adjust to economic
conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
