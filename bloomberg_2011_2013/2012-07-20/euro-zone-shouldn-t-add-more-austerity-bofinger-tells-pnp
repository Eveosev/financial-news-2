Peter Bofinger , a member of German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of outside economic advisers,
said the countries in the euro zone shouldn’t add any more
austerity programs,  Passauer Neue Presse  reported.  Such measures could lead to a downward spiral and need to
be delayed until the economy recovers, the newspaper cited
Bofinger as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
