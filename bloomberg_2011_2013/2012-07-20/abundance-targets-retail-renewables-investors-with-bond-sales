Abundance NRG Ltd.,  a London
investment company, is courting retail investors with an offer
to buy into wind, solar and other renewable energy projects for
as little as 5 pounds ($7.90).  Abundance sells bonds issued by developers of wind farms
and solar parks to those wishing to invest directly, co-founder
Bruce Davies said in an interview. The bonds will deliver cash
returns of 6.75 to 8 percent a year to investors who spend as
much as 50,000 pounds per venture, Davies said by phone.  “There’s a massive gap in the funding of renewable
energy,” Davies said from London of plans to court an
alternative brand of investor. “Small-scale projects find it
hard to raise bank finance because from a bank’s point of view,
for a small project it’s hard to charge a larger fee.”  Abundance said it plans to get 1.4 million pounds this year
for its first 500-kilowatt wind project in the Forest of Dean.
It also is aiming to attract 250 million pounds of investments
in five years, provided it grows in the period.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
