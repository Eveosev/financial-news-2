Oil may fall next week as signs of
slowing economic growth increase concern that demand will
decline, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Fourteen of 32 analysts, or 44 percent, forecast crude will
drop through July 27. Twelve respondents, or 38 percent,
predicted that futures will rise and six said there will be
little change in prices. Last week, 42 percent of analysts
projected a decrease.  More Americans than forecast filed first-time claims for
unemployment insurance payments last week, the Labor Department
reported yesterday. Sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly
dropped in June and manufacturing in the Philadelphia region
contracted for a third month in July.  “The economic fundamentals are very bearish and are
getting more bearish every day,” said  James Williams , an
economist at WTRG Economics, an energy-research firm in  London ,
 Arkansas . “There will be weak demand for oil because of the
weak economy.”  Applications for  jobless benefits  increased by 34,000 to
386,000 in the week ended July 14, higher than the 365,000
forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg, Labor Department
figures showed.  Home  purchases  slid to a 4.37 million annual rate last
month, an eight-month low, data from the National Association of
Realtors showed. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index was minus 12.9 in July after minus 16.6
the month before. Readings of less than zero signal contraction.  Gasoline consumption fell 3.2 percent last week to 8.63
million barrels a day, the Energy Department reported on July
18. That’s 4.3 percent lower than a year ago.  Oil advanced $4.34, or 5 percent, to $91.44 a barrel this
week on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , a second consecutive
gain. Prices are down 7.5 percent in 2012.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 49 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
