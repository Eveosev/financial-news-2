Magellan Health Services Inc. (MGLN) , a
manager of behavioral, radiology and specialty drug services, is
exploring the company’s sale and has held talks with possible
bidders, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  Magellan is working with Credit Suisse Group AG, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the discussions
are private. The market value of the Avon, Connecticut-based
company as of yesterday was $1.44 billion, after DealReporter
said Magellan had been working on a possible sale.  Magellan also administers plans for Medicaid, the joint
state-federal health program for the poor, according to its
 website . The company doesn’t comment on rumors and speculation,
David Carter, a spokesman for Magellan, said in a telephone
interview today. A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment.  Companies may be spurred to make more acquisitions as they
seek to compete to manage an expanding Medicaid market under
President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the biggest U.S. health plan, in
February paid $2 billion to acquire XL Health Corp, which
administers plans for chronically ill patients for Medicare, the
U.S.-backed insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
 WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the second-largest U.S. health insurer, on July
9 agreed to buy  Amerigroup Corp. (AGP)  for $4.9 billion to become the
biggest private provider of Medicaid coverage.  Magellan rose 4.9 percent to $55.12 at the close in New
York, after yesterday gaining 12 percent. The shares have
increased 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
