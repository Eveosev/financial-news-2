Peru ’s government will send Congress
a bill next month that seeks to create “investment
alternatives” for private pension funds, Finance Minister
Miguel Castilla said.  The capital markets initiative will go hand-in-hand with a
pension overhaul that will add about 1.9 million new pension
affiliates by lowering fees, Castilla said. The Constitutional
Tribunal, Peru’s highest court, will rule on a challenge to the
pension legislation by opposition lawmakers, he said.  The bill “expands the range of investment alternatives”
and “will be presented to Congress in its next session,”
Castilla said today at a press conference in  Lima . He did not
offer further details about the legislation.  President  Ollanta Humala  won elections a year ago pledging
to give the poorest Peruvians a state pension and reduce fees
charged by the country’s four private pension administrators.
The first overhaul of the private pension system created 19
years ago will boost competition and cut fees by about 30
percent,Castilla told Congress June 5.  Peru’s private pension system has 90 billion soles ($34
billion) in  assets under management , according to the Andean
nation’s financial regulator. Fund managers have 5 million
customers, of which 40 percent, or 2.2 million, are actively
contributing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
