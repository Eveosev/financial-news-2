Former Japanese Prime Minister  Yukio Hatoyama  joined a weekly protest outside current leader
Yoshihiko Noda’s official residence today against the re-start
of nuclear power plants.  Hatoyama broke ranks with the ruling  Democratic Party  for
the second time in less than a month, after he voted against
Noda’s sales-tax increase in the lower house of parliament on
June 26. He has said in the past he may leave the party, a move
that could deprive Noda of his majority in the lower house and
put the government at risk.  Rifts within the ruling party have deepened, reflecting
divisions among voters over the restarting of nuclear reactors
following the Fukushima disaster last year and the plan to try
to tackle  Japan ’s ballooning debt by doubling the  sales tax .  Anti-nuclear demonstrations outside the prime minister’s
residence have drawn tens of thousands of people in recent
weeks, some of the largest demonstrations in decades.  “This new wave of democracy must be taken very
seriously,” Hatoyama said in a speech to protesters. “The
walls of the prime minister’s residence are thick, and sometimes
the voices of the people do not get through.”  Hatoyama then met with top government spokesman Osamu Fujimura and told reporters he wanted to arrange a meeting
between Noda and the demonstrators in the near future.  Noda, who already faces an opposition-dominated upper
house, would face fresh difficulty passing legislation if the
DPJ were to lose its lower house majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
