Warburg Pincus  LLC, the New York-
based private-equity firm that says it has invested more than
$215 million in the companies of  Titan Petrochemicals Group
Ltd. (1192) , sued for misrepresentation and breach of contract.  Titan, its founder Tsoi Tin Chun and two other executives
are responsible for 1.48 billion  yuan  ($232 million) of
unauthorized guarantees by subsidiaries of Titan Group
Investment Ltd., Warburg Pincus affiliate Saturn Storage Ltd.
said in its lawsuit with Hong Kong’s High Court yesterday.  Saturn is a shareholder in Titan Group Investment, which
has been damaged and incurred potential liabilities by the
guarantees, Warburg Pincus said in an e-mailed statement. The
lawsuit seeks enforcement of agreements it says were breached as
well as relief including unspecified damages and costs.  Titan Petrochemicals, which Warburg Pincus has asked a
Bermuda court to liquidate, said on July 18 that China state-
owned Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co. has offered to buy a
controlling stake in the loss-making Hong Kong-listed oil
transportation and storage services provider.  Titan Petrochemicals spokeswoman Serene Goh didn’t
immediately respond to two telephone calls to her office seeking
comment.  The case is: Saturn Storage Ltd. and Tsoi, Tin Chun, Titan
Petrochemicals Group Ltd., Titan Oil Storage Investment Ltd.,
Wong, Siu Hung Patrick and Tu, Chung To Allen, HCA1265/2012 in
the  Hong Kong  Court of First Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
