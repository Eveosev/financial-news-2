Anshu Jain, the co-head of  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) , ordered an internal investigation into potential Libor
and Euribor manipulation at the bank in 2010, Handelsblatt
reported without saying where it got the information.  Jain was not aware of any possible manipulation earlier,
the paper said. The results of the investigation will be ready
by September, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
