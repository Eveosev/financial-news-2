More than 30,000 Syrians have
entered Lebanon via the Masnaa border crossing in the past 48
hours,  the Daily Star  reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese
security official.  Cars were backed up for almost a kilometer at the border
post, the Star said. Most of the Syrians are being classified as
refugees, and Lebanon is waiving the usual documentary
requirements in many cases, the Beirut-based newspaper cited the
official as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
