Former German Finance Minister  Peer
Steinbrueck  said he’s convinced several countries will leave the
euro area,  Bild am Sonntag  reported in a preview of an article
to appear today.  Steinbrueck declined in an interview to name any of the
countries that might leave the euro region, although he did
predict that the common currency will survive, the newspaper
reported.  He also said he supported allowing ailing financial
institutions in euro countries to go bankrupt, adding that
 Europe  needs banking insolvency laws, Bild reported. Steinbrueck
added that he opposed a European deposit insurance program and
that the euro crisis was pushing Germany’s democracy to the
limits of its ability to handle risk and complex issues, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
