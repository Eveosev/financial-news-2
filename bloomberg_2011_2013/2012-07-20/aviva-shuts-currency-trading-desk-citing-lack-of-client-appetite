Aviva Plc (AV/) ’s asset-management unit
shut its currency desk as  Europe ’s financial turmoil reduced
client demand.  Pierre Lequeux, who headed the London-based team at Aviva
Investors, is leaving the company at the end of the month after
two years, he said today in a telephone interview. It closed the
desk after “client appetite for exposure to currency as an
asset class” fell as Europe’s economy worsened, the company
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Aviva is exiting 16 divisions including some U.K. bulk-
purchase annuities, its South Korean unit and some partnerships 
in  Italy  as it seeks to bolster capital reserves and limit the 
effects of the sovereign debt crisis, it said on July 5.  Aviva Investors had about 273 billion pounds ($428 billion)
under management as of March 31, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
