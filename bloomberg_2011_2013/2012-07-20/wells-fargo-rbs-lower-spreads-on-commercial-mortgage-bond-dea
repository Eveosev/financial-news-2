Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  reduced relative yields on debt tied to
commercial mortgages as investors are drawn to the securities
amid record-low  interest rates .  The lenders are issuing top-ranked debt maturing in about
10 years to pay a spread of 120 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, according to a person familiar with the
offering who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t
public. The banks initially marketed the securities to yield as
much as 135 basis points more than the benchmark. Morgan Stanley
and Bank of America Corp. sold similar debt paying a spread of
135 basis points last week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Wall Street  banks aim to increase originations of loans
tied to office buildings, shopping malls and hotels as investors
seek out riskier assets with the  Federal Reserve  keeping
interest rates at record lows into a fourth year. Wells Fargo
increased its 2012 forecast for commercial mortgage-backed
securities issuance to $35 billion from $25 billion last week,
and Credit Suisse Group AG projects as much as $45 billion this
year.  Relative yields on top-ranked bonds linked to commercial
mortgages have dropped to 172 basis points more than Treasuries
as of yesterday, down from 261 basis points on Dec. 30,
according to a Barclays Plc index. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  122 Properties  The offering from Wells Fargo and Royal Bank of  Scotland  is
tied to 80 loans on 122 properties across the U.S., the person
said. Retail properties account for 37.2 percent of the pool,
the largest portion, with office mortgages making up 29.6
percent of the deal.  Leverage on recent deals is increasing as banks compete for
a limited pool of borrowers, with the level of today’s sale
“slightly higher” than previous deals this year, according to
 Fitch Ratings . The mortgages are about 97.4 percent of the
properties’ worth, compared with the average 94.2 percent for
2012 offerings, Fitch said in a July 17 assessment of the
transaction. The banks peg the current ratio of loan-to-value at
63.4 percent.  Wall Street has arranged about $16.8 billion in commercial
mortgage-backed securities this year, compared with $28 billion
in all of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
record $232 billion of the debt was sold in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
