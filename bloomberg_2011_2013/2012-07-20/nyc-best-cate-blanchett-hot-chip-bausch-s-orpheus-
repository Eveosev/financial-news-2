As Arthur C. Clarke explained,
advanced technology always seems like magic.  “Ghosts in the Machine” explores the complex relationship
between art and tech over a span of 50 years. See  Richard
Hamilton ’s “Man, Machine and Motion” (1955), never before
shown in  New York .  The concept of vision gets a workout from Op artists such
as Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely.  Runs through Sept. 30 at the New Museum, 235 Bowery.
Information: +1-212-219-1222;  http://www.newmuseum.org .  Have smart fun at the New Museum Block Party.  Hands-on workshops include making your own exhibition
catalogue from the museum’s digital archive, creating Op Art

transformed.  There will be performances from improv-master Yvonne Meier
and Sxip Shirey, who plays a variety of instruments, including
the “obnoxiophone.”  From noon to 5 p.m. at Sara D. Roosevelt Park, Chrystie
St., between Delancey and Broome Streets. Information: +1-212-
219-1222;  http://www.newmuseum.org .  Saturday Night  The hot theater ticket gets you in to see  Cate Blanchett  as
Yelena in Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya.”  Young, beautiful and bored, she makes everyone fall in love
with her.  Richard Roxburgh is sad-sack Vanya, with Hugo Weaving as
the tippling doctor Astrov, both smitten with the exotic visitor
to their provincial outpost.  Directed by Tamas Ascher for the Sydney Theatre Company,
the production is part of the Lincoln Center Festival.  Runs through July 28 at City Center, 131 W. 55th St.
Information: +1-212-581-1212;  http://www.nycitycenter.org .  Forget your own provincial disappointments with a glass of
Prosecco at nearby Abboccato.  Follow that with a plate of fusilli alla Napoletana, a mix
of pasta, slow-cooked squid, tomato, garlic and olives.  At 136 W. 55th St. Information: +1-212-265-4000.  Or you could head up to Caramoor for some Bellini. Eglise
Gutierrez (Juliet) and Kate Aldrich (Romeo) sing a lot of
wonderful tunes in this semi-staged production of “I Capuleti e
I Montecchi.”  Will Crutchfield conducts the fleet Orchestra of St.
Luke’s.  Go early, enjoy the gardens, bring a picnic.  149 Girdle Ridge Rd., Katonah, NY. Information: +1-914-232-

“Homage to the Square” (1950-1976).  But the square, said the artist, is “only the dish I serve
my craziness about color in.”  The Morgan Library and Museum is exhibiting 80 studies on
paper that show Albers’s more spontaneous side.  “Josef Albers in America: Painting on Paper” runs through
Oct. 14 at 225 Madison Ave. Information: +1-212-685-0008;

and Eurydice,” she created paired singers and dancers.  In this Paris Opera Ballet production, Stephane Bullion and
Maria Riccarda Wesseling share the role of Orpheus, whose music

Eurydice, who must return to eternal darkness.  Part of the Lincoln Center Festival, at the David H. Koch
Theatre. Information: +1-212-721-6500;

woman.”  John Kennedy  conducts the Ensemble ACJW.  At Gerald W. Lynch Theatre, John Jay College, 524 W. 59th
