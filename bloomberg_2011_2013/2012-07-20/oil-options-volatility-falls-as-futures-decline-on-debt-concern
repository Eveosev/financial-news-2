Oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures retreated for the first time in eight days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 32.3 percent at 4:15 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 33.6 yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery declined $1.14, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $91.83 a barrel on the Nymex, while the
front-month August contract lost $1.22 to $91.44.  Futures fell on growing concern that  Europe â€™s debt crisis,
slowing growth in  China  and a struggling U.S. economy will lower
fuel demand. The euro touched a two-year low against the dollar,
reducing the investment appeal of commodities.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $130 calls, which rose 1 cent to 12 cents a barrel at
4:19 p.m. with 2,055 lots trading. September $115 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,851 lots changing hands as
they fell 3 cents to 13 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 59 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted 66 percent
of the 207,142 contracts traded in the previous session.  March $140 calls tied for the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 10,000 lots changing hands. They rose 10 cents
to 53 cents a barrel. March $150 calls advanced 6 cents to 34
cents on volume of 10,000.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 43,209
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,241 lots and
December $100 calls with 38,546.  To contact the reporter on this story:
