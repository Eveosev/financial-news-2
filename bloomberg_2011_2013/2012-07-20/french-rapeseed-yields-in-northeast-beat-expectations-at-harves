Rapeseed yields in  France ’s
northeast are better than expected with results indicating
they’re “correct to very good,” oilseed researcher Cetiom
reported.  Harvesting has been delayed, with little progress last week
as farmers took advantage of drier weather to bring in winter
barley crops first, the Paris-based researcher wrote in an
online  report  today. Some farmers in Burgundy have started
cutting wheat first because not all rapeseed is ripe, it said.  The harvest in the Franche-Comte region is virtually
completed and the average yield is around 4 metric tons per
hectare (2.47 acres), with similar values in the Aube, Marne and
Seine-et-Marne regions, Cetiom said.  France is the European Union’s largest rapeseed grower.
Crops in the northeast suffered frost damage in February, and
the  Agriculture Ministry  has forecast average rapeseed yields in
the country will fall to 3.23 tons per hectare from 3.45 tons in
2011.  Yields in the Auvergne region, where crops suffered frost
damage, range from about 2.4 tons to 3 tons per hectare,
according to Cetiom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
