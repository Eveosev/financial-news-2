Dustin Pedroia scored the tying run
in the ninth inning as the Boston Red Sox rallied for a 3-1 win
against the Chicago White Sox hours after he was activated from
the 15-day disabled list.  Pedroia, 28, went 1-for-4 last night in his return from a
right thumb sprain.  With Boston trailing 1-0, Carl Crawford led off the bottom
of the ninth at Fenway Park with a single and Pedroia grounded
into a forceout.  Adrian Gonzalez  then singled, sending Pedroia
to second, and  Cody Ross  homered for the Red Sox win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
