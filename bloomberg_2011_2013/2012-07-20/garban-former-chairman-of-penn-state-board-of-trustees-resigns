Steve Garban has resigned from the
Pennsylvania State University Board of Trustees after serving
for 14 years, including a stint as chairman in 2010-11 when the
child sex-abuse scandal involving former assistant football
coach Jerry Sandusky first became public.  Garban, who was the Senior Vice President of Finance and
Operations/Treasurer Emeritus of  Penn State , serves as a
director of Metropolitan Life Series Fund in New York, according
to the school’s website.  “I want to sincerely thank him for his many years of
service to Penn State University and for the leadership he
exhibited today,” board Chairwoman Karen Peetz said in a letter
posted on the board’s website.  “Steve dedicated his adult life to Penn State, devoting
more than 33 years of service to help make this a
better institution,” Peetz said in her letter.  A report released last week by former Federal Bureau of
Investigation Director  Louis Freeh  said the school’s top
executives, including former university President Graham Spanier  and football coach  Joe Paterno , concealed sexual abuse of
children Sandusky to protect the
school from “bad publicity.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
