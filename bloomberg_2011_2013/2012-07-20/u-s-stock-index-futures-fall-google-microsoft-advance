The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
fell, capping the biggest decline in about a month, as the euro
tumbled after Spain said the recession will extend into next
year and concern about its regional governments’ finances grew.  Bank of America Corp.  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  dropped at
least 1.6 percent, amid a plunge in European lenders, as Spain’s
bond yields rose to a euro-era record. Raw material shares in
the S&P 500 fell on news China won’t relax property control
policies, intensifying concern an economic slowdown could reduce
demand for commodities. Restaurant shares tumbled as  Chipotle
Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG)  plunged 22 percent on disappointing sales.  The S&P 500 lost 1 percent to 1,362.66 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time. It rose 1.7 percent over the previous three days. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  fell 120.79 points, or 0.9 percent, to
12,822.57. The euro weakened to the lowest versus the yen since
November 2000. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was
6.8 billion shares, about in line with the three-month average.  “The problem is everywhere,” said Tom Wirth, who helps
manage $1.6 billion as senior investment officer for Chemung
Canal Trust Co., in Elmira, New York. “Once the disease starts,
it seems hard to stop and you wonder whether the euro will
survive. There’s also concern about China’s statement because
their actions have been more supportive of asset prices.”  Global equities fell in a vote of no-confidence to European
authorities after the final approval of a bailout of Spanish
banks. Valencia, the second-most indebted region, said it would
tap an emergency-loan fund. Italy’s Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
blamed unrest in Spain for surging borrowing costs.  ‘Spanish Ghost’  “The problem hasn’t gone away and the unnerving part is
that it’s deepening,” said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more
than $20 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-
banking unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland . “The Spanish ghost is
rising again. It’s not only the banks. The regional governments
also need help. Things are not better yet.”  Concern about a global slowdown also grew today as China
will seek to keep a “firm grip” on the real estate market to
prevent a rebound in housing prices, Xinhua News Agency
reported. The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index, which tracks
companies most-dependent on economic growth, slid 1.7 percent.  Expectations for stimulus measures and better-than-
estimated profits still gave the  S&P 500  its second straight
weekly gain. Earnings have exceeded analysts’ forecasts at 73
percent of the 118 S&P 500 companies that have reported
quarterly results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Financial Shares  Financial shares dropped the  most  among 10 S&P 500 groups,
declining 1.5 percent. Bank of America lost 2.6 percent to
$7.07. JPMorgan fell 1.6 percent to $33.90.  Wall Street’s five biggest banks reported the worst start
to a year since 2008. JPMorgan, Bank of America,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Morgan Stanley had combined first-
half revenue of $161 billion, down 4.5 percent from 2011 and the
lowest since $135 billion four years ago.  Raw material shares also slumped as a rally in the  U.S.
dollar  reduced the appeal of commodities. The S&P GSCI gauge of
commodities slid 0.4 percent.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , the biggest publicly traded copper producer, retreated 1.9
percent to $33.77.  All  24 stocks  in the S&P Supercomposite Restaurants Index
retreated. Chipotle Mexican tumbled 22 percent, the most since
its initial public offering in 2006, to $316.98. The best-
performing  restaurant (S15REST)  stock in the S&P 500 last year reported
second-quarter sales that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Other Restaurants  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the largest restaurant chain, dropped 1.3
percent to $91.58.  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , owner of the KFC and Taco
Bell brands, lost 1.4 percent to $64.95.  Xerox Corp. (XRX)  slumped 6.8 percent to $6.70. The provider of
printers and business services cut its full-year profit forecast
as the economic slump in  Europe  crimped demand for technology.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  tumbled 13 percent to $4.22,
the lowest price since 2009. The maker of processors for
personal computers predicted a  revenue  decline as a sluggish
economy curbs PC sales.  Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. lost 6.5 percent to $9.55. The
maker of semiconductor processors forecast third-quarter revenue
that missed analysts’ estimates.  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  slipped 5.3 percent to $15.73 as
investors reacted to an announcement that general counsel Kim Rucker plans to leave the company for another post.  Cepheid Inc. (CPHD)  decreased 18 percent, the most since 2009, to
$36.01. The maker of health-care diagnostics said 2012 profit
would be lower than previously  forecast .  Flash Memory  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  rallied 10 percent, the most since May 2010,
to $38.70. The shares also had the biggest gain in the S&P 500.
The maker of flash memory for mobile devices reported second-
quarter profit that  topped  analysts’ estimates.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  advanced 3 percent to $610.82. The owner of the
most popular search engine said second-quarter revenue surged 35
percent, helped by its  acquisition  of Motorola Mobility Holdings
and as more users clicked on advertisements.  Energy shares in the S&P 500 rose even as oil dropped for
the first time in eight days. Natural gas futures closed above
$3 for the first time in six months.  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  jumped 9.2 percent to $45.59 after the
third-largest oilfield-services company reported second-quarter
profit that  beat  analysts’ estimates.  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  added 1 percent to $69.33. The world’s
largest oilfield-services provider said second-quarter  profit 
rose as customers increased their quest for crude outside the
U.S. and Canada onshore market.  GE’s Results  General Electric Co. (GE)  rose 0.4 percent to $19.87. Earnings
climbed 7 percent in the second quarter after profit growth at
the finance and energy units overcame a drop in wind-turbine
orders. Revenue rose 2 percent to $36.5 billion, trailing
analysts’ estimates of $36.8 billion.  A measure of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes jumped 2.6
percent.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  rallied 3.7 percent to $10.86. D.R.
Horton Inc. added 2.2 percent to $18.88.  Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW)  and  Kayak (KYAK)  Software Corp. jumped in
their trading debuts after raising more than planned in initial
public offerings, bolstering the revival in technology IPOs.
Palo Alto, a provider of Internet-firewall technology, climbed
27 percent to $53.13, while Kayak, the travel-site operator,
rose 28 percent to $33.18.  Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX)  increased 12 percent to $76.38 as
a treatment for a deadly blood cancer won U.S. approval, giving
the company its first wholly owned drug to sell.  Protection Costs  The cost of protecting against U.S. equity losses is
dropping at the fastest rate in more than three years, pushed
lower by speculation the  Federal Reserve  will stimulate the
economy as concern about Europe recedes.  Puts with an exercise level 10 percent below the S&P 500
cost 8.73 points more than calls 10 percent above on July 18,
the lowest since May 2011, according to data on three-month
contracts compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship known as
skew shrunk 32 percent since its June 15 high, the biggest
decline since March 2009 over comparable periods.  U.S. shares jumped in the past month as optimism grew that
European leaders would be able to contain the region’s crisis
and investors speculated the Fed will increase stimulus
measures. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  this week told senators
the central bank is prepared to act to boost growth if the labor
market doesn’t improve.  “The acute concern about Europe’s debt crisis has faded
somewhat, and markets have become a bit more complacent,” Kevin Caron, a market strategist in Florham Park,  New Jersey , at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which has more than $120 billion in
client assets, said yesterday in a phone interview. “The market
has moved very quickly to now speculate about the next round of
monetary easing, anticipating some kind of policy response.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
