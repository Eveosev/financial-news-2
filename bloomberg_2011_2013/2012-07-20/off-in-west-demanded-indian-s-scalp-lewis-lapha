Captain William Stewart wanted to
see the prairie, the Rockies and American Indians. As the second
son of a rich Scots nobleman, he was free to do as he pleased,
so in 1833 he set off from  St. Louis  to join a fur-trading pack
train.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In what is now  Montana , Stewart’s party was overtaken by
Crows, who outnumbered them four to one. They stole guns,
watches, furs, trade goods and horses, but, after negotiations,
gave back enough equipment to get the white men out of Crow
territory.  A few months later, Stewart was robbed again -- an inside
job by an Iowa Indian who’d been hired as a camp helper. He soon
ran off with Stewart’s favorite rifle and two horses.  “I’d give $500 for his scalp!” raged the captain.  An old trapper brought back the horses and the rifle --with
the Indian’s scalp displayed on the barrel.  I spoke with Peter Pagnamenta, author of “Prairie Fever:
British Aristocrats in the American West 1830-1890,” on the
following topics:  1. Hooked on Wilderness  2. Native Americans  3. Captain Stewart  4. Romance Novels  5. Little England  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
