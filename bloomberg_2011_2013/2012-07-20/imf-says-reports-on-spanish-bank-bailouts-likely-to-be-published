The  International Monetary Fund  said
it will give “independent advice” on the bailout of Spanish
banks and publish its reports quarterly unless Spanish or
European authorities object.  Finance ministers from the euro region today signed off on
a 100 billion-euro ($122 billion) aid package for Spanish banks,
adding to three existing bailouts to countries in the currency
union. The Washington-based IMF, which  co-finances  loans to
Greece, Ireland and  Portugal , wasn’t asked to contribute to the
Spanish package.  While the IMF isn’t a party to the memorandum of
understanding for financial assistance or responsible for
carrying it out, the reports “can be used by the authorities
and the European Commission in their reviews under the financial
assistance,” the IMF said in an e-mailed release today.  The IMF said the reports will focus on progress toward
recapitalization of the Spanish banking industry without
discussing individual firms.  “Fund staff would participate in all financial assistance
monitoring missions conducted” by the commission, the IMF said.
“Confidential information shared with the fund staff, and
particularly individual bank information, will not be included
in the reports.”  Both the commission and the Spanish government and central
bank can refuse publication of reports or delay them on a case-
by-case basis, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
