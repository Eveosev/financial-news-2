Portugal  is “sounding out” the
market as it prepares to resume sales of medium-term notes, the
head of the nation’s debt agency said in an interview.  “It will depend on market conditions and on the appetite
from specific investors,” Joao Moreira Rato, chairman of the
Lisbon-based debt agency, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. There is no scheduled date for issuing the notes, he
said. “We are continuously sounding out the market.”  The debt agency plans to issue “a substantially lower
value” than the total limit of 10 billion euros ($12.2 billion)
for the debt agency’s medium-term-note program, Moreira Rato
said. He declined to specify investors who might purchase the
securities.  Portugal aims to regain access to bond markets by September
2013 and Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  has said that if the
country can’t do that for “external reasons,” it would be able
to count on continued support from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . Portugal is cutting spending and
raising taxes to comply with the terms of a 78 billion-euro aid
plan requested in April 2011.  The  Portuguese government  plans to issue medium-term notes
with maturities of one year to five years that are designed for
specific creditors, the IMF said in a report released on July
17. The government is also expected to sell more treasury bills
with maturities of more than one year in the coming months, the
Washington-based fund said.  Longest Maturity  The IGCP, as the Lisbon-based debt agency is known, sold 1
billion euros of 18-month bills on April 4, the longest debt
maturity auctioned since the country requested the bailout, at
an average yield of 4.537 percent. The IGCP said on July 2 it
plans to sell as much as 3.75 billion euros of bills in the
third quarter.  Portugal on July 18 sold 1.25 billion euros of 12-month
bills due in July 2013 at an average yield of 3.505 percent, the
lowest since November 2010, the debt management agency said.  Spain , which is getting a 100 billion-euro bank bailout, on
the previous day sold 12-month bills at a yield of 3.918
percent. Cyprus on June 25 became the fifth euro country to
request a bailout since  Greece  triggered the European fiscal
crisis.  The IGCP has also issued debt during the past year through
a commercial paper program with maturities of as much as 12
months for specific investors, according to Moreira Rato.  Bond Yields  Portugal’s 10-year bond yield is now at about 10.5 percent,
while two-year debt yields 7.6 percent. The difference in yield
that investors demand to hold Portugal’s 10-year bonds instead
of German bunds has narrowed to 9.3 percentage points from 16
percentage points on Jan. 31.  The IMF projects Portugal’s  debt  will peak at about 118.5
percent of gross domestic product in 2013 and decline to less
than 80 percent of GDP by 2030. The projection assumes annual
economic growth of 2 percent and medium and long-term borrowing
costs of 7 percent in 2013, declining gradually to 5 percent
over the next four years.  Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said on June 26
that the weighted average rate of the country’s financial-aid
program is 3.6 percent. The next review of the country’s aid
program, which is scheduled to start on Aug. 28, will focus on
the planned return to bond markets in 2013, Passos Coelho said
on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
