UT Bank Ltd. (UTB)  of Ghana increased its
capital to 84 million cedis ($43 million), exceeding the minimum
capital requirement of 60 million cedis, Chairman Joseph Nsonamoah said.  A $5 million loan from  Deutsche Investitions und
Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH , a Cologne-based company that funds
investments, “will reinforce the capital position of UT Bank,”
Nsonamoah said today in Accra, the capital. The loan will be
used to meet rising demand for medium-term funding for small and
mid-sized businesses, he said.  Bank of Ghana  has directed lenders in West Africa’s second-
biggest economy to increase their minimum capital by December 31
or have their licenses downgraded.  UT Bank had previously received $10 million in equity
investment from the company also known as DEG on June 19, after
shareholders approved the transaction on May 8, Pearl Esua- Mensah, deputy managing director said today. With the latest
fund injection, DEG’s stake probably increased to 13 percent
from 12 percent, Esua-Mensah said.  UT Bank’s shares were unchanged at the Ghana Stock Exchange
at 30 pesewas as of 2:14 p.m. in Accra.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
