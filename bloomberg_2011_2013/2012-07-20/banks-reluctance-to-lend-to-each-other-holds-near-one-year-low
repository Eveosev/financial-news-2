European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest in almost a year, according to
a money market indicator.  The Euribor OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 35.5
basis points at 8:50 a.m. in  London , from 35 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A decline signals banks
are more willing to lend.  Euribor is the rate  banks  say they see each other lending
in euros and is derived from a survey by the European Banking
Federation. Three-month Euribor was set at a record low 0.458
percent yesterday from 0.464 percent the day before.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was 0.453 percent yesterday from 0.455 the
day before. Libor, which acts as a benchmark for about $360
trillion of financial instruments worldwide, is published by the
British Bankers’ Association.  An estimate of euro average overnight borrowing costs over
the next three months -- the Eonia OIS swap -- declined to 10.4
basis points from 10.9. Eonia was set at 12 basis points
yesterday from 11.9 the day before, according to the EBF.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars increased
from an 11-week low. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap ,
the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments into
dollars, was 45 basis points below Euribor from as low as minus
43 basis points yesterday, the cheapest since May 7.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 49 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday,
placing 357 billion euros ($438 billion) with the Frankfurt-
based central bank from 360 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
