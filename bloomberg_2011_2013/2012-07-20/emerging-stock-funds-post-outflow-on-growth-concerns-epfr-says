Emerging-market stock funds posted
net outflows of $808 million in the week ended July 18 as
concern about U.S. growth offset speculation central banks will
act to stimulate their economies, according to EPFR Global.  Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $13.55 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $11.9
billion for the same period of 2011, according to a report e-
mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded net outflows for the week of $201 million, the data
show. Latin American equity funds posted redemptions of $241
million as those dedicated to  Mexico  jumped to their highest
level of outflows in 18 weeks, $114 million,  Cameron Brandt ,
EPFR director of research, said by e-mail today.  Asian funds excluding  Japan  recorded a net outflow of $305
million while funds dedicated to China snapped an 11-week
outflow streak, posting an inflow of $14 million, as weaker
growth in the second quarter boosted bets for additional
stimulus. Russia-dedicated equity funds recorded net outflows of
$57 million.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 0.01
percent loss for the week, paring the 2012 advance to 4.74
percent, Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $935
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
