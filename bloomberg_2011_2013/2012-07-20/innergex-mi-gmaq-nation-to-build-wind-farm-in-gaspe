Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. (INE) , a
Canadian company that owns hydropower, wind and solar farms, and
the Mi’gmawei Mawiomi have partnered to build wind farm of about
150 megawatts in capacity on  Quebec ’s Gaspe Peninsula.  The two partners agreed on the development, financing,
construction, and operation of the project that will be located
on public lands, Longueuil, Quebec-based Innergex said in a
statement today. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  “This project could mark the beginning of a new era of
prosperity for the Mi’gmaq of Quebec,” said Chief Claude
Jeannotte, chairperson of the Mi’gmawei Mawiomi, an organization
for three Mi’gmaq indigenous communities that are also known as
the Mi’gmaq Nation.  The project would add to  six wind-power projects  totaling
589.5 megawatts to the other wind farms Innergex operates or is
building in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
