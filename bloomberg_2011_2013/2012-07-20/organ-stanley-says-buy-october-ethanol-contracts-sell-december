Morgan Stanley recommended buying
October ethanol contracts while selling December as higher
prices are required to encourage production amid rising corn.  “We see ethanol prices needing to move higher to keep
producers motivated in light of rising corn prices,”  Hussein
Allidina , a New York-based analyst at the bank, wrote in a July
19 report. The spread between October and December ethanol
prices was 6 cents a gallon, according to the report. The bank
recommends taking profit when it reaches 15 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
