CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility in
the Czech Republic, fell for a third day, leading a drop in
Czech shares, as growing concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
slowing global growth drove investors from riskier assets.  The stock slumped 1.6 percent to 708.50 koruna as of 10:06
a.m. in Prague, taking this week’s losses to 3.4 percent. The
14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, in which CEZ has an 18 percent
weighting, retreated 0.3 percent to 907.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
