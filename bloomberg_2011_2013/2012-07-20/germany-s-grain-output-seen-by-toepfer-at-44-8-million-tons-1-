Germany ’s grain harvest may rise 6.9
percent from last year as fields received ample rainfall,
according to Toepfer International GmbH.  Germany may produce 44.8 million metric tons of grain this
year, up from 41.9 million tons a year earlier, the Hamburg-
based company wrote in an e-mailed report today. Wheat output in
the country,  Europe ’s second-largest grower of the grain, may be
23.2 million tons, compared with 22.7 million tons a year
earlier, it said.  For wheat, “the kernel-filling period was accompanied by
generally sufficient water supplies,” Toepfer said. Still,
persistent wet weather has slowed crop maturation and
interrupted the barley harvest, according to the report.  Grain production in the 27 countries of the European Union
may total 281.5 million tons, down from 284.1 million in 2011,
Toepfer said. EU wheat output may be 127.6 million tons in 2012,
compared with 129.8 million tons a year earlier.  Declining production is mostly the result of a smaller
wheat harvest expected in  Spain , where output may drop 26
percent from 2011 to 4.4 million tons. The country has suffered
from drought this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
