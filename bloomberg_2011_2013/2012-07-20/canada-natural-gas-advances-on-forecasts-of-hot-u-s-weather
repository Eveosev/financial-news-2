Canadian natural gas advanced on
forecasts of above-normal temperatures that may increase power-
plant use of the fuel.  August gas in Alberta  climbed 2.2 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted hotter-than-normal
weather in the eastern and central U.S. from July 25 through
Aug. 3. Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 8 percent above normal
from July 26 through July 30, according to Weather Derivatives
in Belton,  Missouri .  “The near-term and long-term forecasts are pointing to
high temperatures,” Carl Neill, a consultant with Risk
Management Inc. in Atlanta, said in a telephone interview. “The
heat is not abating, and traders are buying up gas as a
result.”  Alberta gas for August delivery increased 5 cents to C$2.32
gigajoule ($2.17 per million British thermal units) as of 2:35
p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market. Gas

per million Btu, the first close above $3 since Jan. 9.  The high temperature in Chicago on July 23 will be 94

Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.04 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
