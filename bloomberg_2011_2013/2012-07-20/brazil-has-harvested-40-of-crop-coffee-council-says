Coffee growers in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer of the bean, have harvested 40 percent
of the current season’s crop after delays caused by rain, the
Brazilian Coffee Council, known as CNC, said today.  The rain has compromised quality of this season’s crop and
also caused early flowering for the 2012-2013 season, said CNC
in a report sent by e-mail.  The early flowering may hurt next season’s production and
Brazil may have “worse than expected” output, CNC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
