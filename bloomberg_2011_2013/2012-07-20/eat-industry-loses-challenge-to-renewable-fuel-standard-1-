The  National Chicken Council  and two
other meat-industry groups lost a court challenge to the EPA’s
national renewable-fuel standard that they said will increase
feed prices in the U.S as more corn is used to produce ethanol.  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Appeals Court in Washington
today rejected the group’s lawsuit accusing the Environmental
Protection Agency of improperly exempting some ethanol producers
from requirements that their fuels have fewer greenhouse gas
emissions than petroleum fuels. The judges found the groups
lacked the authority to bring the case.  “The petitioners fail to show a ’substantial probability’
that qualifying ethanol plants would reduce their ethanol
production,” if the rule were vacated by the court, U.S.
Circuit Judge  Janice Rogers Brown  wrote in the opinion.  Brown said the court’s decision didn’t foreclose a later
challenge to the rules, noting in the ruling that a different
lawsuit “could allow us to address the merits of EPA’s
reading.”  The groups, which include the  National Turkey Federation 
and the  National Meat Association , claimed EPA didn’t have the
authority to exempt certain ethanol producers from the fuel
standards. They argued they had the right to sue because the
exemption will lead to an increase in the amount of corn being
diverted to produce ethanol, thus leading to an increase in
prices for  animal feed .  The case is National Chicken Council v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 10-1107,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
