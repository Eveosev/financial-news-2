Reseau Ferre de  France , a French
railroad operator, signed a 1.25 billion-euro ($1.5 billion)
revolving credit to refinance a facility expiring in December.  RFF increased the five-year credit line from 1 billion
euros after lenders offered more than the Paris-based company
sought, according to an e-mailed statement from  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,
one of the arrangers of the financing.  The loan replaces a 1.25 billion-euro credit line signed in
2007 that paid an initial interest margin of 7.5 basis points
more than benchmark rates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Barclays,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , Credit Suisse Group AG,
Natixis SA and Societe Generale SA arranged the facility as
bookrunners.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank
AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase
& Co., Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada joined the wider
banking group as mandated lead arrangers.  RFF has about 31 billion euros of bonds outstanding,
Bloomberg data show, and sold 100 million euros of 20-year
structured notes in April. RFF Chief Financial Officer Alain Quinet said in January that the companyâ€™s debt rose 1.2 billion
euros to 28.6 billion euros in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
