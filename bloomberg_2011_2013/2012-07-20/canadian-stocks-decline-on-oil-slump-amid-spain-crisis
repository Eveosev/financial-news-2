Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in six days as crude tumbled and commodities retreated over
concern the debt crisis in  Europe  is worsening.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  lost 1.2 percent and  RMP Energy Inc. (RMP) 
declined 6.3 percent.  Bank of Nova Scotia , the third-largest
lender in the country, dropped 0.9 percent.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) 
rose 1.1 percent as gold advanced in New York. Energy companies
and banks contributed the most among 10 industries to the
decline of the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index. (SPTSX)   The S&P/TSX fell 42.79 points, or 0.4 percent, to
11,622.91. The benchmark index rose 0.9 percent this week and
has lost 2.8 percent in 2012.  “Trading is really driven by concerns in Europe today,”
Jeffrey Bradacs, who manages C$1.7 billion at Toronto-based
Manulife Asset Management, said in a phone interview. “There
are lagging concerns with  Spain ’s debt costs continuing to
increase, and the oil price, as a result, has been volatile.
Today is about risk-off trade.”  Oil declined 1.3 percent in  New York , snapping seven days
of gains to settle at $91.44 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Spain said the recession will extend into next year as
the region of Valencia prepared to seek a rescue from the
central government and European finance ministers approved the
bailout of Spanish banks.  Commodities Retreat  The S&P GSCI gauge of commodities slipped 0.4 percent.
