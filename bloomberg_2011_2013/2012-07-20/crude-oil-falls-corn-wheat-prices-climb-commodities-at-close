The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.6 percent to 651.12 at 5:42 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials gained
0.4 percent to 1573.623.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell from a nine-week high in  New York , paring a second
weekly advance, as worse-than-expected economic data added to
signs seasonal crude demand is weakening.  Crude for August delivery, which expires today, slid as
much as 97 cents to $91.69 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $91.72 at 10:22 a.m.
 London  time. It climbed 3.1 percent yesterday to $92.66, the
highest close since May 16. The more-actively traded September
future decreased 96 cents to $92.01. Front-month prices are 5.3
percent higher this week and down 7.2 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures extended gains after closing at the
highest price in six months yesterday in New York as the surplus
in U.S. stockpiles narrowed.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude rose 45 cents to $18.11 a barrel at 11:55 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. , a broker.
This crack spread , measure of processing profit, has widened 10
percent so far this week, the largest percentage gain since the
seven days ending Sept. 30. Swaps for August climbed $1.36, or
1.1 percent, to $121.86 a barrel, PVM said. Prices are up 6
percent from last week.  Naphtha swaps for August increased $6.75, or 0.8 percent,
to $883.25 a metric ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical and
gasoline feedstock is set for a fourth weekly advance.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
up $10.14 at $74.48 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread was headed for a 23 percent weekly
rebound after losing 22 percent last week.  High-sulfur  fuel oil  rose 94 cents to $1.78 a barrel below
Dubai crude, according to PVM. The discount  was set to narrow
for the first week in three, indicating reduced losses for
refiners turning crude into residual products.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold was set to rise for a second day in London as concern
about  Europe ’s debt crisis spurred demand for a protector of
wealth and as physical demand gained.  Bullion for immediate delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1,584.90 an ounce by 9:41 a.m. in London. Prices are down 0.3
percent this week, limiting this year’s gain to 1.4 percent.
August-delivery futures climbed 0.2 percent to $1,584.30 on the
Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper fell in London after  China , the world’s biggest
consumer of the metal, ordered local governments to maintain
curbs on real estate.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn resumed a rally and soybeans traded near a record as
the worst drought since 1956 threatened to cut production in the
U.S., the biggest grower of both crops. Wheat fell from the
highest price in almost four years.  Corn for December delivery gained 1.3 percent to $7.8825 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, at 2:14 p.m. Singapore
time, set for a 6.5 percent gain this week. The grain peaked at
$7.99 yesterday, before ending 0.7 percent lower. The record for

to $16.6675 a bushel, before trading at $16.65. The price peaked
at $16.7375 yesterday and is set for a fifth weekly gain, the
best run since April.  September-delivery wheat fell as much as 1.2 percent to
$9.235 a bushel and traded at $9.34. Futures are set to climb 10
percent this week. The most-active price reached $9.38
yesterday, the most expensive since Aug. 21, 2008.  Crude palm oil futures advanced after a decision by  India ,
the world’s biggest buyer, to raise benchmark prices used to
calculate the import tax for refined oil to match market rates
for the first time since 2006.  The October-delivery contract rose as much as 0.7 percent
to 3,065 ringgit ($972) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, and was at 3,051 ringgit at 4:31 p.m. local time.
Futures are set to drop 0.5 percent this week.  Rubber declined for a second week after U.S. economic data
