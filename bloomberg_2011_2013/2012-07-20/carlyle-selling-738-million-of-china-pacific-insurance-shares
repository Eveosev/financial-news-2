Funds controlled by  Carlyle Group
LP (CG) , the world’s second-largest private-equity firm, are selling
as much as $738 million of shares in  China Pacific Insurance
(Group) Co. (2601)   Carlyle Holdings Mauritius Ltd. and Parallel Investors
Holdings Ltd. are selling 220 million shares in the Chinese
insurer for HK$25.5 to HK$26 ($3.35) each, the terms show. The
selling price represents a  discount  of as much as 5.2 percent to
the stock’s closing price in  Hong Kong  today, according to terms
for the sale obtained by Bloomberg News. Last July, Carlyle sold
about $1 billion of the insurer’s shares.  First-half net income may decline about 55 percent from the
year-ago period, as investment income dropped and business
growth slowed, the Shanghai-based insurer said in a statement
last week. China Pacific is listed in both Shanghai and Hong
Kong.  The Hong Kong-listed shares of China Pacific gained about
22 percent this year, outperforming the city’s benchmark  Hang
Seng Index , which rose about 6.5 percent.  Parallel Investors is an entity controlled by Carlyle-
managed funds, according to China Pacific’s website.  Carlyle spokesman Randall Whitestone declined to comment on
the process.  Washington-based Carlyle led the investor group that agreed
almost six years ago to take a 25 percent stake in China Pacific
Life Insurance Co., a unit of Pacific Insurance, for 3.3 billion
 yuan  ($510 million). The investment was converted into a stake
in the parent company in 2007, and then into Pacific Insurance’s
Hong Kong-listed shares in 2009 as the insurer sold stock in the
city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
