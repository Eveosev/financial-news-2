Kazakhstan’s state grain trader has
no plans to buy cereals this season because a smaller crop is
forecast and stockpiles are ample following purchases last year.  “We probably won’t buy grain this year,” Beybitkhan
Kabdrakhmanov, chief executive officer of JSC National Co. Food
Contract Corp., told reporters in the capital city of Astana
today. “It is expected to be harvested much less in comparison
with last year.”  The company purchased 5 million metric tons of grain last
year from the 2011 harvest, of which 2 million tons held for
state inventories will be milled to make flour and sold on the
domestic market at fixed prices, he said. The rest will be sold
at market prices, according to the CEO.  Kazakhstan, the biggest wheat producer in Central Asia,
harvested a record 26.9 million tons of grains in 2011,
according to government statistics. This year’s crop is forecast
at 14 million tons because of dry weather.  The government plans to support agricultural producers
affected by a persistent drought in main grain-growing regions,
Agricultural Minister Asylzhan Mamytbekov said today, without
elaborating.  JSC has exported less than 100,000 tons of grain since
January, mostly to  Iran , according to Kabdrakhmanov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
