Coal may regain some market share
for power generation from  natural gas  during the summer as
deferred shipments pour in, according to analysts from Barclays
Capital Inc.  Cheap gas displaced coal for making electricity earlier in
the year, leading to high stockpiles of the fuel and prompting
utilities to postpone deliveries, Shiyang Wang, an analyst in
 New York  at the bank, said today in an e-mailed research note.  “Deferred coal shipments also create an additional
headwind for natural gas consumption in the U.S. power sector
through the summer,” Wang wrote.  Coal producers allowed the deferred shipments in lieu of
renegotiating legacy contracts and slashing prices, Barclays
said. As the deliveries trickle into utilities and plants also
take advantage of lower spot prices for coal, gas demand may
wane, according to the investment bank.  Spot  coal  from  Wyoming ’s Powder River Basin, which holds
the largest and least expensive reserves, has fallen 40 percent
to $8.75 a ton from a year earlier, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
