China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
country’s second-biggest mobile carrier, rose the most in more
than 10 months in Hong Kong trading after the company added more
3G service users than Deutsche Bank AG analysts estimated.  The  company  rose 6.6 percent to HK$10.68 as of 1:02 p.m. in
Hong Kong, poised for the biggest advance since Aug. 25. The
stock is the biggest gainer among 49 members on the city’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index. Bigger rival  China Mobile Ltd. (941)  rose
0.7 percent to HK$88.20 while  China Telecom Corp. (728)  jumped 4.1
percent to HK$3.77.  China Unicom gained 3.03 million users for its 3G, or
third-generation, service last month, the Beijing-based company
said in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday. That’s
about 7.8 percent more than Deutsche Bank’s estimate, analysts
Alan Hellawell and William Bratton wrote in a note to clients
yesterday.  “CU spent more heavily on advertising and promotion in
June,” the analysts wrote. Demand was helped by China Unicom’s
introduction of a 20 yuan ($3) pre-paid package, and the release
of several new handsets including those from  Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930) , Motorola Mobility and  HTC Corp. (2498) , they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
