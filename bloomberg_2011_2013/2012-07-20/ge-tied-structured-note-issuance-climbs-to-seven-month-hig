U.S. sales of structured notes
linked to General Electric Corp. climbed to the highest level in
seven months after the company’s stock reached a more than one-
year high at the end of June.  Banks have already sold $50.2 million of securities tied to
the world’s largest jet-engine maker in six deals this month,
the most since $150 million of issuance in December, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based
company is the second-most commonly linked single stock for U.S.
notes this year, trailing Apple Inc.  GE reported earnings today that topped analysts’ second-
quarter estimates, as profit growth at the finance and energy
units overcame a drop in wind-turbine orders. The company gained
0.8 percent to $19.96 at 11:06 a.m. in  New York . The shares,
which closed on June 29 at $20.84, the highest since Feb. 28,
2011, advanced 11 percent this year before today’s earnings,
compared with a 9.5 percent gain for the  Standard & Poor’s  500
index.  Barclays Plc issued $21.3 million of three-year notes on
July 13, the largest deal tied to the company this month,
Bloomberg data show. The securities are called on quarterly
dates if the stock price exceeds its initial value, and yield
2.66 percent for each period GE doesn’t fall by more than 25
percent, with investors risking their principal, according to a
 prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Morgan Stanley distributed the notes for a 2.25
percent commission.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
