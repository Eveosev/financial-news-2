The percentage of Chileans living
below the poverty line fell to 14.4 percent last year, reversing
the increase posted in the previous survey in 2009 when the
economy was mired in recession.  The  poverty rate  slid from  15.1 percent  three years ago and
compared with 13.7 percent in 2006 and 38.6 percent in 1990 when
the surveys began, Social Development Minister Joaquin Lavin
said today on live TV. Extreme poverty, or the percentage of
people who can’t afford the basic basket of foods, fell to 2.8
percent last year from 3.7 percent in 2009.  President Sebastian Pinera is committed to eliminating
extreme poverty by the time his four-year term ends in 2014. He
also campaigned on the promise to help  Chile  eliminate poverty
by the end of this decade through a faster pace of  job creation 
and economic growth.  “This is very good news, but we have a long way to go,”
Pinera, a Harvard University-trained economist, said on state-
owned television channel TVN today. “The commitment that gets
me up in the morning -- even though many times one goes to bed
frustrated and tired -- is being able to eliminate extreme
poverty in our country.”  Economic growth in the Andean nation slowed to 6 percent
last year from 6.1 percent in 2010 as the inflation rate climbed
to 4.4 percent from 3 percent the year before. Growth will ease
further in 2012, with GDP expanding 4.7 percent and inflation
closing the year at 2.7 percent, according to government
forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
