Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude oil
strengthened against West Texas Intermediate as WTI’s discount
to Brent widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent widened 17 cents to $15 a
barrel based on September settlement prices in  New York . When
Brent gains versus WTI, it typically strengthens the value of
U.S. grades that compete with foreign oils priced against the
European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 40 cents to $15.40 over WTI at
2:08 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The gain was the first in four days. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
premium to WTI was unchanged at $16 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium decreased 60 cents to $9.20 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon lost $1.30 to $8 over WTI. Mars Blend
weakened 45 cents to $10 a barrel over the U.S. benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
decreased $1.65 to $12.50.  Syncrude’s premium was steady at $3 over WTI. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $2.55 to $14
below WTI.  Bakken oil’s discount widened 75 cents to $1.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
