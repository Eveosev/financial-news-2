Federal Reserve Governor  Elizabeth Duke  said monetary policy coordination among central banks is
usually not ideal and each central bank must have tools to carry
out objectives independent of its counterparts.  “While central banks may benefit from coordination and
cooperation, taking the same policy stance at the same time
typically will not be the best choice for all central banks,”
Duke said today in remarks prepared for a speech in Mexico City.  The Fed and five other major central banks reduced  interest
rates  in October 2008 in response to economic weakness and have
cooperated on financial regulation, including raising
international bank capital standards, Duke said. Since then, the
economies of the various nations have rebounded at different
rates, prompting different monetary policies.  “It is imperative for each central bank to have monetary
policy tools to appropriately address domestic objectives
independent of the actions of other  central banks ,” Duke said
to the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies 60th
Anniversary Conference.  The Fed official didn’t comment on the outlook for the  U.S.
economy  or monetary policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
