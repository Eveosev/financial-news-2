James Rooney, Seoul-based chief
executive officer of consulting firm Market Force Co., comments
on the investigation by  South Korea ’s Fair Trade Commission of
alleged collusion on pricing of certificate of deposit rates by
banks and brokerages. He spoke on Bloomberg Television and in a
separate interview in  Seoul .  On what the probe means for the financial services industry in
South  Korea :  “It clearly has an impact on the trust the domestic savers
will have in their financial institutions. In general, the
Korean banks have been better sheltered from regulatory abuse
and other kinds of malfeasance than some of their larger
brothers in other countries. It’s very distressing to see the
breakdown of discipline and proper behavior in the financial
sector, especially when the world needs a restoration of
confidence in the sector.”  On what implication the probe has for the South Korean economy
and society:  “I’m worried the most about confidence from the Mrs. Kim
and Mrs. Lees of Korea who supply deposits to these banks. They
would be asking, ‘Why would I keep my money in these banks? The
savings banks offered me better returns and they’ve gone
bankrupt. And the commercial banks are now cheating on their
rates. I don’t trust anybody’.”  “You would naturally see a reduction of  money supply  from
the private sector, and therefore shrinkages in the velocity of
money and shrinkages in the supply of money into the economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
