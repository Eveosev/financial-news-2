Cemex SAB (CX) , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, said its second-quarter net loss narrowed as
sales rose in the U.S.  The net loss for the three months ended June 30 shrank to
$187 million from $209 million in the same period last year,
Cemex said today in a statement.  Revenue was $3.86 billion, down 7 percent from a year
earlier and less than the  $4.1 billion median estimate  of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 15 percent in the
U.S., fell 14 percent in  Mexico  and dropped 18 percent in
northern Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
