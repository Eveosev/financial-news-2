South Africa  rebounded against
England today and reached 86-1 at stumps on the second day of
the opening cricket Test, trailing by 299 runs.  The hosts resumed this morning on 267-3 at the Oval in
London but the visitors restricted them to 385 by taking seven
wickets for 118 runs. Only Matt Prior, with 60, made an
impression on the Proteas’ bowlers today.  James Anderson  then made an early breakthrough for the hosts
this afternoon, trapping Alviro Petersen leg-before-wicket for
no score with only one run on the board. Rain interrupted play
for more than 90 minutes before South Africa resumed on 27-1 and
reached the close without losing another wicket.  Captain  Graeme Smith , in his 100th Test, and Hashim Amla
ended on 37 and 47, respectively. England captain Andrew Strauss, fielding in the slips, had a catching chance off Amla
but couldn’t hold onto the ball with his left hand.  This morning, most of England’s batsmen lacked assurance
against a revitalized Proteas attack.  Alastair Cook added only one run before he was bowled by
 Dale Steyn , finishing on 115 after his 20th Test century. Soon
afterward, Steyn dismissed  Ravi Bopara , caught behind by AB de
Villiers without scoring.  Then Jacques Kallis struck in his first over, bowling Ian Bell for 13 to leave England wobbling at 284-6. Tim Bresnan
dragged a ball from Imran Tahir onto his stumps after scoring
eight and England reached 326-7 at lunch.  Stuart Broad  was out for 16, and Prior was caught by De
Villiers off Morne Morkel. Finally, Anderson was another victim
of Morkel, who finished with 4-72 as the innings ended just
before 2:45 p.m. local time.  South Africa, the No. 3 Test team in International Cricket
Council rankings, could leapfrog No. 1 England by winning the
three-match series, which continues with games at Leeds and at
Lord’s in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
