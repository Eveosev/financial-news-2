The cost of protecting Japanese
corporate bonds from default dropped, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 1 basis point to 177
basis points as of 9:26 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup
Inc. The gauge is set for its lowest close since July 11,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 161 basis points
as of 8:27 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark has ranged between 161.5 and 173.5
this month, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 171
basis points as of 10:24 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The measure is set to decrease for a third straight
week, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
