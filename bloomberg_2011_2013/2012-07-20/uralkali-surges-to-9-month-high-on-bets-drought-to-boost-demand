OAO Uralkali, the worldâ€™s largest
potash producer, climbed to the highest level in ten months on
bets the worst U.S. drought in a half-century will increase
demand for the fertilizer.  Uralkali rose 1.1 percent to 272.67 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the highest level since Sept. 21 and the second day of
gains. The Micex Index slumped 1.3 percent to 1,415.38, with 27
out of 30 stocks falling.  Farmers will buy more fertilizer next year as they try to
recoup crops lost this year, according to Karen Ubelhart, an
analyst for Bloomberg Industries.  The drought may persist in the Midwest for the rest of the
growing season, the U.S. government said this week. Above-
average temperatures and below-normal rainfall will continue
through next week, according to meteorologist Telvent DTN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
