Romania ’s wheat crop may fall this
year after a drought in 2011 that damaged grains, Agriculture
Minister Daniel Constantin said.  “The wheat harvest will probably be lower than last year
because of a drought in the fall, but not alarmingly so,” he
told reporters today during a conference at the government’s
headquarters in Bucharest. “We’ll be able to ensure domestic
consumption needs without a problem.”  Romania harvested 7.2 million metric tons of wheat last
year. Dryness across the country in recent weeks may damage corn
and sunflowers, Constantin also said. The 2011 corn harvest came
to 11.7 million tons in Romania, the European Union’s fifth-
biggest cereal producer last year after  France , Germany,  Poland 
and the U.K., according to  figures  from the bloc.  “We’re going through a profound drought right now, which
risks damaging the spring crops, especially corn and
sunflower,” Constantin said. “If it doesn’t rain in the
following period, we might register pretty big losses.”  Romania’s wheat harvest so far this year is down 20 percent
from a year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry  said July 10 in a
statement. Farmers reaped the grain on 30 percent of planted
areas, with quality improving from previous years, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
