The House Agriculture Committee’s
top Democrat criticized Republican leaders for failing to
schedule a vote on a new farm-policy bill, saying time to pass
the measure before the current law expires is “running out.”  Representative  Collin Peterson  of Minnesota said House
Republican leaders failed to include the bill, which the
Agriculture Committee passed July 12, in their schedule for
floor action next week. That leaves only four legislative days
to consider the measure before Congress adjourns for recess on
Aug. 6, Peterson said.  “There is no excuse not to bring the farm bill to the
floor,” Peterson said today in a statement, accusing
Republicans of wasting the past two weeks on what he called
“political messaging bills that are going nowhere.” House
Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat, has also
called for a vote.  The House panel’s bill would cut U.S. Department of
Agriculture spending by $35.1 billion over 10 years. The farm
bill reauthorizes all USDA programs, including subsidies for
farmers, food aid for poorer families and initiatives that
improve soil and water quality. The current law expires on Sept.
