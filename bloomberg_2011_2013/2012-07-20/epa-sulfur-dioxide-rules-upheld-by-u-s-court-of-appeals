U.S. limits for sulfur-dioxide
emissions from  power plants , factories and industrial sources
were upheld by a federal appeals court, which rejected a lawsuit
brought by North Dakota and  Texas .  A three judge panel of the U.S. Appeals Court in Washington
said today that the  Environmental Protection Agency  didn’t act
“arbitrarily” in setting the 2010 rule that restricts sulfur-
dioxide levels in the air to 75 parts per billion over a one-
hour period.  “EPA cites evidence that current levels of SO2 in the
ambient air, even when the  air quality  meets the current SO2”
standards, “still cause respiratory effects in some areas,”
U.S. Circuit Judge David Sentelle wrote in the opinion.  The regulation revokes standards for the pollutant adopted
in 1971 that included limits of 140 parts per billion measured
over 24 hours. North Dakota and Texas were among five states
that sued over the rule.  The EPA cited research that shows short-term exposure to
sulfur pollution poses a greater health threat than past rules
took into account, including risks to children, the elderly and
people with asthma. Power plants account for almost 70 percent
of sulfur dioxide in the air, according to the EPA.  On July 13, a different appeals court panel in Washington
upheld EPA’s standards for nitrogen dioxide.  The case is National Environmental Development
Association’s Clean Air Project v. Environmental Protection
Agency, 10-1252,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the  District of
Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
