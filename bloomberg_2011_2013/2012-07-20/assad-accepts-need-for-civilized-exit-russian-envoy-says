Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has
accepted the need for his eventual departure under the terms of
an agreement struck in Geneva June 30, said Alexander Orlov,
 Russia ’s ambassador to France.  “It will be hard for him to stay,” Orlov said today in a
French-language  interview  with Radio France International. “He
is accepting to go, but to go in a civilized manner.”  The comments may signal a shift for Russia, which blocked
last month’s deal from demanding Assad’s ouster. The statement
negotiated by foreign ministers of the five permanent United
Nations Security Council members -- China, France, Russia, the
U.K. and the U.S. -- as well as  Turkey , Qatar,  Kuwait , the
European Union, the Arab League and Iraq called for a process
leading to a political transition in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
