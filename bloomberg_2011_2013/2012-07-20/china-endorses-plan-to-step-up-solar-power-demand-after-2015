The Chinese government said it will
accelerate the pace of solar power installations after 2015,
part of a program including funds from the state to cap carbon
emissions while satisfying the nation’s demand for electricity.  The State Council  said  it aims to boost solar power
capacity to 50 gigawatts in 2020 from 21 gigawatts targeted for
2015. About 3.6 gigawatts are installed now, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. The government will promote
private investment in the industries and set up “special”
funds for research, the council said.  The world’s biggest producer of carbon dioxide from fossil
fuel burning said it aims to derive 4.5 percent of its energy
from low-carbon sources and pare at least 400 million tons of
CO2 a year by 2015. Last year about 0.6 percent of its energy
came from renewable, according to figures from  BP Plc. (BP/)   The targets and fund “will certainly create opportunities
for technology innovation,” said Jessica Ng, an analyst for New
Energy Finance in Beijing.  The world’s second-biggest economy is harnessing low-
emissions energy generated from the sun, wind and biomass to
help meet its target of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions by 17
percent per unit of gross domestic product in its five-year plan
through 2015. China wants to have 100 gigawatts of wind, 21
gigawatts of solar and 13 gigawatts of biomass power installed
capacity by 2015, according to the statement.  By 2020, the country plans to double the wind capacity from
2015 and targets 50 gigawatts of solar and 30 gigawatts of
biomass installed capacity.  The nation aims to have 40 gigawatts of nuclear power
installed capacity by 2015.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
