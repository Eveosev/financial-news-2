India ’s bonds completed a third
weekly gain on speculation the central bank will ease monetary
policy to revive  Asia ’s third-largest economy.  Factory  output  rose 2.4 percent in May from a year earlier,
government data showed last week, compared with an average gain
of 5.1 percent in the previous two years. The $1.7 trillion
 economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the first quarter, the least
since 2003. Inflation held above 7 percent in June for the fifth
straight month, official figures show.  “With growth stuttering, rate cuts are just a question of
time,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-based head of treasury at
state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  “The central bank would like to see
some softening in inflation before easing policy further.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week to 8.08
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It fell one basis point today. The 10-year yield touched
8.05 percent on July 16, the lowest level since June 15.  The  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  this month
cut its annual forecast for growth in car  sales  to a range of 9
percent to 11 percent in the year through March 2013, from an
estimate of 10 percent to 12 percent given in April.  The  Reserve Bank  of India cut the  repurchase rate  by 50
basis points to 8 percent in April, after raising it by a record
375 basis points through 2010 and 2011. Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao held the repo  rate  at 8 percent at a meeting on June
18. The next policy review is scheduled for July 31.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed this week at 7.63 percent, according to data compiled by
