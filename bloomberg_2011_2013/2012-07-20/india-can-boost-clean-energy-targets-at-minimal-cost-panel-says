India, the world’s fourth-biggest
energy consumer, can increase renewable power purchase targets
for distributors at minimal cost, a panel of regulators said.  Clean energy utilities such as wind and solar farms will
add enough capacity to allow state distribution companies and
private operators  Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. (RELI)  and  Tata Power
Co. (TPWR)  to buy as much as 11.4 percent of their electricity from
renewable sources by 2017, the government said today in a
statement, citing a study by top electricity regulators.  The average cost of purchasing power would rise by one
paisa per kilowatt-hour in the first year and gradually drop by
2017, the Forum of Regulators said. The cost can “be easily
accommodated” by distributors, they said, adding that state
governments should focus on enforcing targets.  The study found India can add as much as 40,659 megawatts
of clean power capacity in the next five years if its power
transmission and distribution infrastructure is upgraded. That
would be half of the additional power capacity  India  needs to
build by 2017, according to a January report by the government’s
Planning Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
