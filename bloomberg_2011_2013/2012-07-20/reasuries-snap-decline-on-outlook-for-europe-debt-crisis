Treasuries rose, with five-year
yields falling to record lows, as  Spain  said its recession will
extend into next year after getting approval for a bank bailout,
pushing investors into the safety of government debt.  The yield on the U.S. 10-year note traded almost at a
record low as the Spanish region of Valencia prepared to seek a
rescue from the central government as European finance ministers
approved a $122 billion bank rescue plan. Yields on Spain’s
bonds earlier climbed to record highs over German bunds as
Italian bond yields rose to a six-month high over comparable
bunds.  “Everybody still views the U.S. Treasury market as the
safe haven,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in
New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. Yields “could be driven even lower.
It’s what’s going on in  Europe  again, it’s this fear.”  Five-year note  yields fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.57 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 0.5684
percent, below the previous mark of 0.577 percent set July 16.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury  yield  fell five basis points
to 1.46 percent after touching 1.4449 percent. It set a record
low of 1.4387 percent June 1. The 1.75 percent note due in May
2022 rose 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face value, to 102 21/32.  The yield on the 30-year  bond  dropped seven basis points to
2.5 percent.  The  two-year rate  dropped to 0.2015 percent, the lowest
level since Sept. 23.  Record Levels  Volatility dropped today to 61.3 basis points, almost the
lowest since May 10, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index. It dropped to a five-year low of 56.7 basis
points on May 7, and has averaged 75.6 basis points this year,
touching a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on June 15. It reached
a record high of 264.6 basis points in October 2008 as the
financial crisis intensified. The index measures price swings
based on options.  Treasury trading  volume  reported by ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped to $150
billion after climbing yesterday to $247 billion, the most since
July 11. Trading averaged $241 billion this year.  The term premium, a model created by the  Federal Reserve 
that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and
inflation, showed Treasuries are almost the most expensive ever.
The gauge closed at a negative 0.9612 percent, close to the
record negative 0.9617 set on July 10.  ‘European Fears’  “It’s European fears, particularly the headlines coming
out of Spain,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “While the aid
package won approval, we hear now some of the regions are
seeking help from the central government and that’s really where
this new round of concern originated. That put a bid in
Treasuries.”  Treasuries returned 2.5 percent in the three months ended
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.
The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks handed investors a
2.1 percent loss in the same period, including reinvested
dividends.  The yield spread between 10-year Spanish and German
securities widened to 610 basis points. Credit-default swaps on
Spain rose for a fifth day, climbing 19 basis points to 598 and
approaching the record 624 basis points set June 18. The euro
slid to the lowest level since 2000 versus the yen and a two-
year low versus the dollar.  ‘Safety Flows’  The euro dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 95.35 yen, the
lowest level since November 2000. The shared currency fell as
much as 1.1 percent to $1.2144, the weakest since June 2010.  “It appears to be the ongoing debt-resolution problem,”
said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.9 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York. “That’s encouraged safety flows into the U.S. as Treasury
notes remain among the cheapest of safe-haven assets. That’s
encouraged the strong bid we see in the most distant part of the
Treasury yield curve.”  The  extra yield  investors get for buying 10-year Treasuries
instead of similar-maturity bunds widened seven basis points
this week to 29 basis points. The average over the past year is
14 basis points.  Spain’s 10-year  benchmark  bond yields yesterday climbed
above the 7 percent threshold for the first time since Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  unveiled his fourth austerity package
last week. That’s the level that prompted bailouts for  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal .  Buying, Selling  Treasuries declined yesterday on speculation the Fed will
take steps to counter the growth slowdown.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt
from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of quantitative easing, seeking
to cap borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. While policy
makers refrained from introducing a third round of purchases at
a meeting last month, Bernanke indicated in two days of
testimony in  Washington  this week that it’s an option. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  next meets on July 31 and Aug. 1.  The U.S. sold $7.93 billion of Treasuries due from November
2014 to April 2015 today as part of a program known as Operation
Twist, in which the Fed is swapping short-term Treasuries in its
holdings for longer maturities to put downward pressure on long-
term borrowing costs.  The U.S. will sell $35 billion of two-year notes, the same
amount of five-year securities and $29 billion of seven-year
debt over three days starting July 24, the Treasury announced
yesterday.  “The expectations are that next week’s auctions will go
well despite the absolute low level of yields,” said United
Nations Federal Credit Union’s Sullivan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
