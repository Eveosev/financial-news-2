Drought in the Midwest has lowered
water levels on U.S. rivers, reducing the amount of commodities
such as coal, corn and petroleum products that can be shipped,
the American Waterways Operators said today.  Every 1-inch loss of water decreases the carrying capacity
of a barge by 17 tons of cargo, and losing one foot of draft
results in a loss of 204 tons of cargo capacity per barge, the
Arlington, Virginia-based group said in an e-mailed statement.  Barges are used to ship about 60 percent of U.S. grains, 22
percent of domestic petroleum products and 20 percent of coal
used for electricity generation, according to the most recent
data from the agency.  The organization said that itâ€™s working with the U.S. Coast
Guard and  Army Corps  of Engineers to mitigate the situation.  A loaded tank barge can hold 27,500 barrels of gasoline,
according the AWO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
