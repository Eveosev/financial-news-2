Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. (FSL) , a
maker of semiconductor processors, tumbled as much as 14 percent
after the company forecast third-quarter revenue that missed
analysts’ estimates.  The stock fell 6.4 percent to $9.56 at 9:57 a.m. in  New
York , after earlier trading as low as $8.79 for the biggest
decline since April 20. The Austin, Texas-based company’s stock
had declined 19 percent this year through yesterday.  Freescale, which named former  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) 
executive Gregg Lowe as chief executive officer last month, is
trying to return to profitability after recording losses for the
last two years. Lowe, who replaced Rich Beyer last month, will
conduct a strategic review of the company’s business lines and
expenses in the coming weeks.  “We will complete an analysis of the market potential, our
strengths and weaknesses,” he told analysts on a call
yesterday. “We will continue to scrutinize expenses that do not
impact our ability to grow,” he said.  The company will eliminate its corporate jet and associated
flight operations, he said.  Third-quarter revenue will be $955 million to $1.01
billion, according to a company statement yesterday. That
compared to an average estimate of $1.05 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , the second-biggest maker of
 processors for personal computers, declined 11 percent to
$4.32. The company yesterday predicted its sales would decline
as much as 4 percent in the current quarter as demand for PCs is
dragged down by a slowing economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
