Former international soccer official
 Jack Warner , who resigned amid the bribery probe of Mohamed bin
Hammam, applauded a court’s decision to lift a life ban against
the Qatari.  Warner said in an e-mailed statement that the decision by
the Lausanne, Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport
was “a victory of reason over allegations and mud-throwing.”  The 63-year-old Bin Hamman was the head of Asian soccer
when he ran for the presidency of FIFA, the world soccer
governing body, against incumbent Sepp Blatter.  FIFA banned 11 officials, reprimanded five more and warned
six following its investigation into a specially convened
meeting of the Caribbean Football Union in Trinidad on May 10,
2011, where it was alleged that delegates received envelopes
stuffed with $40,000 from Bin Hammam’s campaign. The meeting was
arranged by Warner, a FIFA vice president at the time.  The court ruled yesterday that there was “insufficient
evidence” for FIFA to expel Bin Hammam, though it did not say
that meant he was innocent of the charges.  Bin Hammam ended his campaign shortly before FIFA started
the investigation, and Blatter was unopposed as he was re-
elected to a fourth four-year term as president.  “FIFA’s reprehensible conduct with regard to Mohamed bin
Hammam has been unmasked, its rulings against him were declared
null and void,” Warner wrote. “The question can be asked as to
how I would have fared under this FIFA system of injustice.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
