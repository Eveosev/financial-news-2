Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first time this week, heading for the biggest decline in more
than a month as the central bank settled matured securities
while refraining from selling new  repurchase agreements .  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy depreciated
by as much as 0.6 percent to 84.26 per dollar and was trading
0.5 percent weaker at 84.18 by 12:43 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. A close at that level would mark the largest retreat
since June 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Kenyan shilling is under pressure today from maturing
repurchase agreements of 6 billion shillings ($71.3 million)
which has boosted money supply,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) ,
said in a note to clients today.  The Central Bank of Kenya stayed out of the money market
for a second day today, according to a bank official, who asked
not to be identified in line with policy. The bank has been
offering repurchase agreements or term-auction deposits to curb
 money supply  since June 27 through July 18.  Businesses are due to pay value added tax, excise duty,
withholding tax, aviation fees and standards levy today,
according to the Kenya Revenue Authority  website.   Uganda’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,470 per dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling depreciated 0.2 percent to 1,585
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
