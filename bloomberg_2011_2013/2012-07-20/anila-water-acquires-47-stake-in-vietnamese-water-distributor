Manila Water  Co., which supplies
water to half of the Philippine capital, said it acquired a 47
percent stake in a Vietnamese water distributor through its
Singapore unit to expand in  Vietnam . Terms werenâ€™t disclosed.  The completion of the deal by Manila Water, provider of
water and sewer services to 6 million city and metro residents,
for almost half of Kenh Dong Water Supply Joint Stock Co. was
disclosed in a Philippine Stock Exchange filing. The utility
bought 49 percent of Thu Duc Water BOO Corp. last November.  Kenh Dong, founded in 2003, has a bulk water supply
contract with Saigon Water Corp., the state-owned company that
manages the Ho Chi Minh City water supply system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
