     July 20 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average capping a second weekly loss, as
brokerages and insurers dropped after U.S. economic reports
missed estimates.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a carmaker that depends on  North
America  for 25 percent of its sales, dropped 1.8 percent. Mito
Securities Co. led brokerages lower. Tokio Marine Holdings Inc.
fell 3.4 percent, pacing declines among insurers.  Yamato
Holdings (9064)  Co. declined 2.4 percent on a report operating profit
slid at the parcel delivery service.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.4 percent to 8,669.87 at the 3 p.m.
trading close in  Tokyo , dropping 0.6 percent this week. The
broader Topix Index slid 1.8 percent to 733.82, with about seven
stocks dropping for each that rose. The gauge has fallen 10 out
of 11 days.  “The shape of recovery is still uncertain,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps oversee about $1 billion at Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. in Sydney. “Equity investors need to be patient
in any case, but more so at the present time. Valuations are
low, which means dividend yields are reasonable.”  The Topix rebounded 5.5 percent from a 29-year low reached
on June 4 as concern eased about  Europe ’s debt crisis and
central banks around the world cut rates to shore up growth.
Foreign investors sold 133.8 billion yen in stocks last week,
according to the Ministry of Finance.  Topix Valuation  Shares on the index are  valued  at 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.2 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.4
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  Companies that do business in the U.S. fell after U.S.
existing home sales unexpectedly fell and manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region contracted for a third month.  “It’s hard to buy exporters because negative macro reports
out of the U.S. are keeping the yen in demand amid speculation
U.S. policy makers may do a third round of quantitative
easing,” said Kuninobu Takeuchi, Tokyo-based executive
portfolio manager at DIAM Co, which manages about 10 trillion
yen ($127 billion).  Toyota declined 1.8 percent to 2,967 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
 Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, dropped 2.2
percent to 958 yen.  Brokerages and insurers fell the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups. Mito Securities slumped 8 percent to 139 yen.
Tokio Marine lost 3.4 percent to 1,857 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent
today. The gauge added 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday after
International Business Machines Corp., the biggest computer-
services provider, and  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , the largest Internet
marketplace, beat profit forecasts.  Earnings Season  Japan’s earnings season is starting in earnest next week,
with 209 of the 1,671 companies listed on the Topix Index
scheduled to report results.  Yamato Holdings dropped 2.4 percent to 1,245 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the delivery company’s operating
profit fell about 30 percent to around 5 billion yen in the
quarter ended June from a year earlier. Competition weighed on
prices and profitability, the newspaper without citing anyone.
Yamato is due to report results on July 31.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Volatility Index fell 0.5 percent to 17.60,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
gauge was 2.1 percent above the 30-day average.  Among stocks that rose, Toshiba Corp. added 1.1 percent to
285 yen after chipmaking partner SanDisk Corp. posted profits
that topped analysts’ estimates. SanDisk yesterday said profit
was 21 cents a share, excluding some items, saying that demand
for memory from corporate customers and international markets is
helping the industry rebound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
