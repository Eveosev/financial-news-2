Frank Asbeck, chief executive
officer of  Solarworld AG (SWV) , said that he will relinquish his pay
until the company is profitable again, he told Handelsblatt.  “I will forgo my salary, my bonus and my dividend payments
till Solarworld writes profits again,” the CEO of the Bonn-
based solar-panel maker said.  In 2011 Asbeck earned 500,000 euros ($612,800), he holds 28
percent of Solarworld and received dividend payments of 2.5
million euros ($3.1 million), Handelsblatt reported. In the last
six months Solarworld’s stock lost more than 75 percent and fell
to 1.04 euros, the newspaper wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
