The bodies of two Ukrainian
mountaineers who died while climbing one of the highest peaks in
 Georgia  were recovered and taken to the city of Zugdidi for
forensic tests, broadcaster Rustavi-2 reported.  The Ukrainians, who died after falling from Ushba, were in
a party of four that tackled the climb on July 13, the Georgian
television station said.  Ushba, at almost 4,700 meters (15,500 feet), is one of the
tallest peaks of the Caucasus mountains, located in the region
of Svaneti in the northwest of Georgia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
