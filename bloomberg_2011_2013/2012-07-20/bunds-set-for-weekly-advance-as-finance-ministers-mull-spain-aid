Spain ’s bonds fell, sending five-
and 30-year yields to euro-era records, as the region of
Valencia prepared to seek a rescue, deepening concern policy
makers are failing to find solutions to the debt crisis.  The nation’s 10-year bonds fell for a seventh day,
increasing the extra yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of German bunds to the most on record, as
Spain also cut its growth forecast. The Italian-German yield gap
reached the most since January and  Germany ’s two-year yields
fell to a record. Belgian and French 10-year bond yields
declined to all-time lows as investors sought higher-yielding
alternatives to benchmark German debt.  “Valencia’s request for assistance underlines fears as to
the central government’s ability to bring wayward regions to
heel,” said  Richard McGuire , senior fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in  London . “That puts Spain under a
considerable degree of pressure.”  Spanish five-year yields jumped 47 basis points, or 0.47
percentage point, to 6.88 percent at 5:21 p.m. London time,
after touching 6.903, the most since the euro started in 1999.
The 4.25 percent note due in October 2016 dropped 1.595, or
15.95 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,216) face amount, to 90.535.  The euro fell to its lowest level since 2000 versus the yen
and reached a two-year low against the dollar.  Valencia will tap Spain’s financing facility for regional
governments, the area’s administration said in a statement on
its website today. The funding mechanism was created last week
to inject liquidity into the cash-strapped regions.  ‘Death Spiral’  The Spanish 30-year bond yield climbed as much as 17 basis
points to 7.35 percent, a euro-era record. The 10-year yield
rose 26 basis points to 7.27 percent, having jumped 61 basis
points this week. The euro-era record is 7.285 percent. The
extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year securities
instead of bunds widened to 613 basis points, the most since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1993.  Spain faces a “death spiral” as higher yields push up
borrowing costs, and that adds to concern the nation won’t be
able to services its debt, McGuire said.  Euro-area finance ministers signed off on a 100 billion-
euro aid package for Spanish banks today after holding a
conference call, Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden told
reporters today.  The cost of insuring against a default on Spanish
government debt rose to the highest in a month, with credit-
default swaps on the country climbing 20 basis points to 600,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg, Spain’s IBEX 35 Index
of shares fell 5.8 percent, the most in more than two years.  Spanish Volatility  Volatility in Spanish government debt was the highest in
developed markets today, followed by  Italy , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  The Italian-German 10-year yield spread widened to as much
as 503 basis points, exceeding 5 percentage points for the first
time since January.  Greek bonds also fell as the  European Central Bank  said
marketable debt instruments backed by  Greece ’s government will
become ineligible for the time being. The 10-year yield rose 46
basis points to 25.58 percent.  Germany’s 10-year yield fell five basis points to 1.17
percent, approaching the June 1 record low of 1.127 percent.  “As people draw their money out of Italy and Spain because
they have lost faith in these economies, they tend to put it
into bunds,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income
strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “That’s
something that boosts bunds at the expense of other markets.”  Belgium, France  German two-year  yields  slipped as much as two basis point
to minus 0.077 percent, an all-time low. Yields below zero mean
investors who hold the debt to maturity will receive less than
the amount they paid to buy them.  Belgium ’s  10-year bond  yields climbed two basis points to
2.47 percent, after the rate earlier fell to a record 2.391
percent. French 10-year yields were at 2.07 percent after
declining to an all-time low 2.024 percent.  Yields on two-year Belgian, French, Austrian, Dutch and
Finnish securities have all fallen to records this week.  “It’s not return on capital, it’s return of capital,”
said Peter Allwright, who helps manage about $4 billion as the
head of absolute rates and currency at RWC Partners Ltd. in
London. “We are in a horrible deflationary and deleveraging
world. In euros, we only want to hold Germany as it’s the best
and the most liquid.”  German debt returned 4.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities lost 6.2 percent, and Italy’s debt rose 7.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
