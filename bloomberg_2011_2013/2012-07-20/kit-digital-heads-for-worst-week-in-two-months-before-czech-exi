Kit Digital Inc. (KITD)  fell for a fourth
day in Czech trading, headed for its biggest weekly slump in two
months, after the software producer said yesterday it will
delist from the  Prague  Stock Exchange.  The stock slumped 7.8 percent to 74 koruna by 10:19 a.m. in
Prague, making it the worst performer in the 14-member  PX (PX)  index
today. A close at that level would mark a 14 percent weekly drop
for Kit shares, the steepest since the five days ended May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
