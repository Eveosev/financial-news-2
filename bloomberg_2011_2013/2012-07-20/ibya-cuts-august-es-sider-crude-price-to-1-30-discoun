Libya â€™s state-run National Oil Corp.
reduced its August official selling price of benchmark Es Sider
crude to the lowest level in almost three years, according to a
price list obtained by Bloomberg News.  The price of the blend was cut by $1.60 a barrel to a
discount of $1.30 to North Sea Dated Brent, the lowest since at
least January 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Following is a table of prices of Libyan crude grades. The
blends are priced in relation to Dated Brent, except Al-Jurf and
Bouri, which are based on Urals in the Mediterranean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
