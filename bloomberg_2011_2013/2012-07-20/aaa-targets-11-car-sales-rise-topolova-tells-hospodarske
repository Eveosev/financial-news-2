AAA Auto Group NV (AAA)  plans to sell as
many as 50,000 vehicles this year, an increase of 11 percent
from last year, Chief Executive Officer Karolina Topolova told
 Hospodarske Noviny  in an interview.  The company’s Russian branch in Moscow, which was opened
last year, broke even recently and should become profitable, the
executive told the newspaper.
The company’s current share price doesn’t reflect the earnings
growth and the overall market development, Topolova told
Hospodarske.  To contact the reporter on this story:
