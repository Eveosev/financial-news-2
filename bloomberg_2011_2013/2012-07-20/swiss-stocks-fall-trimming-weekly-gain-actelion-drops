Swiss stocks  fell from a four-month
high, trimming the benchmark Swiss Market Index’s weekly gain,
as surging Spanish bond yields stoked concern the euro-area debt
crisis is deepening.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  were among the biggest
decliners, tumbling 4.4 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.
 Galenica (GALN)  AG dropped after the stock was downgraded at Vontobel
Holding AG.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  advanced 1 percent for the largest gain on
the  SMI. (SMI)   The SMI retreated 0.6 percent to 6,284.81 at the close of
trading in Zurich even as euro-region finance ministers approved
a bailout of Spain’s banks. The measure still climbed 1.7
percent this week and has rallied 10 percent from its 2012 low
on June 4. The broader Swiss Performance Index also slipped 0.6
percent today.  “European markets and the euro have taken a turn for the
worse today, smacked by headlines out of  Spain ,” Ishaq Siddiqi,
a market strategist at ETX Capital in London, wrote in a note.
“Although EU finance ministers have adopted the Spanish bank
bailout, sentiment has been rattled by Spain painting a bleaker
outlook than previously by downgrading its economic growth
forecasts.”  Spain said the recession will extend into next year as the
region of Valencia prepared to seek a rescue from the central
government. Gross domestic product will fall 0.5 percent in 2013
instead of rising 0.2 percent as the government predicted April
27, Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said after the Cabinet met
today in  Madrid .  Spanish Bonds  The Spanish 10-year yield rose 27 basis points to 7.28
percent at 4:36 p.m. Zurich time, pushing the spread over
equivalent German bunds 22 basis points wider to 613 basis
points, the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data in
1993. The yield on the nation’s five-year notes increased to a
euro-era record of 6.90 percent.  Euro-region finance ministers gave final approval to a
bailout of the nation’s banks worth as much as 100 billion euros
($122 billion). Today’s decision paves the way for a first
payment from Europe’s temporary rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility.  The volume of shares in SMI-listed companies changing hands
today was 55 percent more than the average over the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  UBS, Switzerland’s largest lender, snapped two days of
gains, falling 4.4 percent to 10.03 Swiss francs. Credit Suisse
retreated 2.9 percent to 16.83 francs.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) ,
the wealth manager established in 1890, dropped 0.9 percent to
34.69 francs.  Adecco Drops  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the  world’s largest provider of temporary 
workers, declined 3.1 percent to 41.54 francs, halting five days
of gains.  Galenica, the largest producer of iron replacement drugs,
retreated 5 percent to 591 francs as Vontobel cut the stock to
reduce from hold. The Bern, Switzerland-based company will
probably face a delay in gaining U.S. approval for its
Injectafer treatment and the drug’s use may be limited, Carla Baenziger, an analyst at Vontobel in Zurich, wrote in a note.  Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the world’s biggest maker of
computer mice, lost 3.5 percent to 9.30 francs. The stock was
cut to hold from buy at Kepler Capital Markets.  ABB, a maker of robots and power-transmission gear,
advanced 1 percent to 15.96 francs.  Sulzer AG (SUN)  rose 2.7 percent to 124 francs. The Swiss pump
maker reported first-half earnings before interest and taxes of
193.4 million Swiss francs ($197 million), missing the 203.1
million-franc average of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales increased 9.2 percent to 1.92 billion francs,
driven by growth in oil and gas industry orders in  North America 
and  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
