French soft wheat rated as good or
excellent was stable in the week through July 16 from the
previous week at 70 percent as harvesting accelerated, crop
office  FranceAgriMer  reported.  Within the two top categories, 17 percent of wheat was
rated excellent from 16 percent a week earlier, crop office data
showed. The crop was 9 percent harvested, compared with 3
percent last week and 60 percent of soft wheat harvested at the
same time last year.  Weather has been drier in the past week in  France , allowing
farmers to accelerate harvesting after months of rainy weather.
Forecasts are for sunny and dry conditions on July 22 and at the
start of next week, with afternoon temperatures above 20 degrees
Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), according to weather forecaster
Meteo-France.  The soft-wheat ratings compare with 30 percent seen as good
or excellent at the same time last year, when crops were hurt by
spring drought.  Durum wheat rated good or excellent was also stable at 63
percent, with the top rating rising 2 percentage points to 13
percent.  Winter barley conditions remained at 69 percent good or
excellent, according to FranceAgriMer.  The state of spring barley slipped to 80 percent rated good
or excellent, down 1 percentage point from a week earlier. The
corn crop was 75 percent rated in the top two categories,
climbing from 73 percent the previous week, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
