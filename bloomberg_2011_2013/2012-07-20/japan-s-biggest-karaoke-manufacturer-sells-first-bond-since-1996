Daiichikosho Co. (7458) ,  Japan ’s biggest
karaoke equipment and software provider, sold its first bond in
16 years to diversify its funding sources.  Daiichikosho raised 10 billion yen ($127 million) by
offering 3.5 billion yen of 0.486 percent five-year notes priced
to yield 30 basis points more than sovereign debt, and 6.5
billion yen of seven-year securities with a 0.806 percent coupon
at a spread of 44 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Japan’s corporate borrowing costs are falling as five-year
government bond  yields  dropped as low as 0.175 percent this
month, the least since June 2003. The  extra yield  investors
demand to own company bonds rather than government debt fell to
55 basis points on July 5, the lowest since May 2011, according
to an index compiled by Nomura Securities Co.  “Market conditions right now are good,” Hideo Sekimori,
an assistant general manager at Daiichikosho’s general planning
department, said in a telephone interview from  Tokyo  today. The
purpose of the sale is to diversify funding sources and the
company has no detailed plan for using the proceeds at the
moment, he said.  Daiichikosho last sold bonds in April 1996 when it raised
35 billion yen from convertible notes which matured in March
2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is
 rated  a A with a stable outlook by Japan Credit Rating Agency,
its sixth-highest investment-grade.  The karaoke manufacturer initially planned to sell about 8
billion yen in total, a person with direct knowledge of the
matter said July 17, asking not to be identified because the
details are private.  Karaoke is a form of entertainment in which a machine plays
only the music of popular songs so that people can sing the
words themselves. The market size in Japan was 617 billion yen
in 2011, according to All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist
Association’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
