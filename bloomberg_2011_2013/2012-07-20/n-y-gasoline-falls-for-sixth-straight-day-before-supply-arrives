New York gasoline fell for a sixth
consecutive day before the scheduled arrival of two tankers in
the region, increasing supply of the fuel.  Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd’s Emerald Express is expected to reach
New York on July 27, according to AISLive Ltd. ship-tracking
data compiled by Bloomberg. The tanker, chartered by Valero
Energy Inc., last docked in  Milford Haven , U.K.  Fuyo Kaiun Co Ltd.’s Maersk Maya is expected at the same
hub July 22, the data showed.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor widened 4.25 cents to 10.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:33 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel was at parity
with futures on July 12. Prompt delivery fell 4.02 cents to
$2.8362 a gallon versus futures.  The same fuel in the Gulf Coast narrowed its discount 1
cent to 18.25 cents a gallon versus futures.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s McKee refinery in Texas reported
emissions July 18, according to a filing with state regulators
yesterday. The release occurred after an electrical breaker
opening caused a precipitator field to lose power in the fluid
catalytic cracker.  There was no material impact on production,  Bill Day , a San
Antonio-based spokesman for Valero, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
