Bradley Wiggins, who is bidding to
become the first British winner of the  Tour de France , has the
leader’s yellow jersey as the race enters its final weekend.  Mark Cavendish  won the 18th stage yesterday in a sprint at
the end of the 222.5-kilometer (138-mile) leg between Blagnac
and Brive-la-Gaillarde.  The British rider, a Team Sky teammate of Wiggins, finished
the course in 4 hours, 54 minutes, racing past Nicolas Roche in
the last 300 meters.  “I haven’t done anything this tour, so I saved so much
energy,” Cavendish said in a televised interview. “I knew I’d
be able to go long today and no one would be able to pass me. I
felt really good today.”  It was the 22nd Tour de  France  stage win for Cavendish,
tying him with  Lance Armstrong  and Andre Darrigade. He trails
Andre Leducq, a rider from the 1930s whose 25 career stage wins
puts him in third place. Eddy Merckx is the leader with 34 stage
wins, followed by Bernard Hinault’s 28.  Wiggins has a 2 minute, 5 second lead over teammate Chris
Froome, with Vincenzo Nibali in third place overall, with only
today’s time trial between Bonneval and Chartres and the
ceremonial ride tomorrow to Paris remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
