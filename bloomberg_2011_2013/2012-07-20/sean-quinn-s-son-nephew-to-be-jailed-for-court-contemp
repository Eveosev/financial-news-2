  Sean Quinn  junior, the son of the
country’s former richest man, Sean Quinn senior, will be jailed
for three months after failing to disclose assets in line with a
court order, a judge said today.  Peter Quinn, the nephew of Sean Quinn senior, was given the
same sentence by Judge Elizabeth Dunne. The threat of punitive
sanction was left over Sean Quinn senior by the judge.  Quinn, his son and nephew continued to place assets outside
the reach of nationalized IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank Corp.,
after the court ordered them to stop last year, Judge Dunne
found last month. Dunne put aside “punitive” sanctions on June
29 as she made an order for asset disclosure.  A lawyer for the Irish Bank Resolution Corp. said in a
Dublin court today that the company isn’t happy with the level
of cooperation it has received from the Quinns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
