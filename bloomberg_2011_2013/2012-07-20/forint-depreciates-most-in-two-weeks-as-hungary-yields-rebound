The forint declined the most in two
weeks, paring a second week of advances, on concern the euro-
area debt crisis is deepening.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 286.21 per
euro by 4:10 p.m. in Budapest, bringing its weekly gain to 0.6
percent. The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds slumped,
lifting yields seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to
7.295 percent, after hitting the lowest in 10 months yesterday.  Spain  said its recession will extend into 2013 as the
region of Valencia prepared to seek a government rescue and
euro-area finance ministers signed off on a 100 billion-euro
($122 billion) bailout for the country’s banks. Spain’s 10-year
bonds fell for a seventh day, increasing the extra yield
investors demand to hold the securities instead of German bunds
to the most on record.  Hungary’s government started talks on a  credit line  from
the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union this
week. The international lenders disagreed with the Hungarian
government’s growth forecast at the start of aid talks, chief
negotiator Mihaly Varga said in an interview published in weekly
Figyelo yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
