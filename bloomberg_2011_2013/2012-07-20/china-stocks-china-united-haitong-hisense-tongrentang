percent to 1.22 yuan and for 2013 by 6.3 percent to 1.32 yuan,
Hu Yali, an analyst at Citic Securities Co., wrote in a note
today. An 11 percent increase in first-half profit is lower than
the estimate by the brokerage and the market consensus as price
competition and increased panel costs hurt profitability,
according to the note.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
