Chile ’s peso fell from a two-month
high after copper fell on China’s plans to curb the real estate
market.  The peso declined 0.8 percent to 489.03 per U.S. dollar
from 485.35 yesterday. Copper for September delivery fell as
much as 3.3 percent to $3.418 a pound on the Comex in New York.  China is the world’s biggest buyer of copper, which makes
up half of Chile’s exports. The Chinese government said it will
maintain a “firm grip” on the property market to prevent a
rebound in  house prices . The peso, the region’s best performing
major currency in July, strengthened 0.3 percent this week.  “In the last few days we have had an absence of news from
Europe which had allowed some of that rally,” said  Alejandro Cuadrado , the chief Latin American currency strategist at  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in New York. “In the last few
sessions it has started to look a bit stretched and is no longer
outperforming copper. They are trading more in tandem.”  BBVA was the most accurate forecaster of Latin American
currencies in the six quarters through June, according to data
from Bloomberg Rankings.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $9.2 billion short position in the peso on July 18,
according to central bank data published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
