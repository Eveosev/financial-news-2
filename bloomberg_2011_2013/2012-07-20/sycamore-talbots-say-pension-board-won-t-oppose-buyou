Sycamore Partners LLC and  Talbots
Inc. (TLB)  said the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. won’t challenge the
private equity firm’s buyout of the retailer, satisfying a
condition for the offer.  The companies also removed a financing requirement,
Sycamore and Talbots said today in a statement. Under the
amendment, Sycamore must now accept shares tendered in the offer
even if the parent company hasn’t received proceeds of the
financing commitments from its lenders.  Talbots, a women’s clothing retailer based in Hingham,
 Massachusetts , agreed to be bought by the private equity firm in
May for a reduced price of $369 million, including debt. Earlier
this week, Sycamore extended the offer expiration by two weeks
to July 27. About 80.9 percent of Talbots shares were tendered
as of July 13, Sycamore said on July 16.  The  PBGC  issued a letter to Talbots on July 18 confirming
that it will not take action with respect to the acquisition,
the companies said in the statement. In order to complete the
deal, Talbots needed a letter from the pension board saying that
the agency had concluded a review of the company’s retirement
plan.  Talbots rose as much as 3.8 percent to $2.73 in extended
trading, after closing unchanged at $2.63 in  New York . The
shares have declined 1.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
