Iran’s  Supreme Court  annulled the
death sentence passed on a former U.S. Marine of Iranian
descent, the Iranian Students News Agency said.  “There was an objection to the ruling in the Supreme Court
and the court found fault with it and sent it to another branch
with the same level of authority,” Iran’s judiciary spokesman,
Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, told reporters today at a press
conference, ISNA said. The news agency didn’t give any more
details.  A court found Amir Mirzaei Hekmati guilty in January of
spying for the Central Intelligence Agency. U.S. State
Department spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  has said allegations that
Hekmati worked for the CIA were “simply untrue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
