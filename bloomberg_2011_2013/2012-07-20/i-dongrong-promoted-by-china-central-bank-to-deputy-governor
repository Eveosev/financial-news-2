China’s central bank appointed Li Dongrong as a deputy governor as part of a reshuffle that is
taking place before a once-in-a-decade change in the Communist
Party’s leadership.  Li, 57, previously an assistant governor, has spent his
whole career at the People’s Bank of China and joins deputy
governors  Hu Xiaolian , Liu Shiyu, Yi Gang and Pan Gongsheng,
according to the PBOC’s website.  According to his official biography, Li served at the
PBOC’s Guangdong branch from 1984 until 2002, when he was
promoted to work in Beijing at the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange, an agency which is part of the PBOC and
manages the nation’s $3.2 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves.  A reshuffle at China’s financial regulators has included
changes at the banking, securities and insurance overseers. The
ruling Communist Party is preparing for President  Hu Jintao  and
Premier  Wen Jiabao  to hand power to the next generation of
leaders.  --Zhou Xin. Editor: Paul Panckhurst, Scott Lanman  To contact the reporter on this story:
