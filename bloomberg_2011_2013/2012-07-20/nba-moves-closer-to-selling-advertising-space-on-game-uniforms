The  National Basketball Association 
is moving toward allowing advertising on its game uniforms,
which would make it the first of the traditional big four North
American sports leagues to do so.  “It’s fair to say that our teams were excited about the
opportunity,” NBA Deputy Commissioner  Adam Silver  said during a
press conference in Las Vegas, site of the league owners
meeting. The ads would be in place for the 2013-14 season.  Silver said the league’s 30 teams would generate about $100
million by putting a two-inch by two-inch patch on the uniform
shoulder.  The matter was referred to the league’s planning committee
and requires approval from the full Board of Governors.  Uniform ads are commonplace in European soccer. Major
League Soccer, the U.S.’s top league, also has ads on its
uniforms.  Dallas Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  and Brooklyn Nets Chief
Executive Brett Yormark are among top NBA officials who have
long endorsed the idea of selling uniform ads.  To contact the reporter on this story:
