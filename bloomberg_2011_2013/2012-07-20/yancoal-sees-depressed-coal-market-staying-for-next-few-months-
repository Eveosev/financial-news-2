Yancoal Australia Ltd. (YAL) , the third-
biggest standalone coal producer in  Australia , expects the
market for the fuel to stay depressed for months after price
slides last quarter.  “Both thermal and metallurgical coal markets have
deteriorated during the last quarter and Yancoal does not see
any signs of improvement in the next few months,” the Sydney-
based company, which began trading on the Australian stock
exchange last month following the takeover of Gloucester Coal
Ltd., said today in a statement.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-biggest mining company,
yesterday said it plans to cut jobs at one of its thermal coal
mines in Australia to reduce costs amid falling prices. Thermal
coal, used to generate electricity, has declined 21 percent this
year.  Yancoal reported total thermal coal sales of 1.9 million
metric tons during the three months to June 30, 29 percent
higher than last year, and coking coal sales of 2.1 million
tons, up 25 percent.  “Sales of thermal coal have held up despite a significant
fall in the spot price during the quarter,” the company said,
adding there was currently an oversupply of coking coal in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
