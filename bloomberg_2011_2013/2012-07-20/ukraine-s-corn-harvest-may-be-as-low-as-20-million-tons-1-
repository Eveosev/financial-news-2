Ukraine ’s corn crop may be between
20 million and 22 million metric tons after drought hurt yields
in the country’s south, the national weather forecaster said.  Yields in the south and east may fall to 2 to 3 tons a
hectare (2.47 acres), said Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agro-
meteorology department at the National Meteorology Center.
Fields in the north and west are expected to yield about 5.5
tons a hectare, she said by phone today.  The center’s prediction is below the most recent forecast
from the government, which already cut its outlook to 23 million
to 24 million tons on July 5 from a June forecast of as much as
26 million tons, citing “abnormal weather.”  “The situation with corn is not catastrophic,” Adamenko
said. “But if yields had been better in the southern and
eastern part of Ukraine, where areas under corn are the biggest,
we could have showered the world with it.”  Ukraine produced 22.8 million tons of the grain in 2011,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
