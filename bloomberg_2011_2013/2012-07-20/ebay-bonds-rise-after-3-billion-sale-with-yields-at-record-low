Bonds of  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  rose after the
world’s largest Internet marketplace sold $3 billion of debt in
its first offering since 2010.  The company’s $1 billion of 2.6 percent, 10-year bonds, one
piece of yesterday’s four-part offering, climbed 1 cent from the
issue price to 100.9 cents on the dollar at 10:15 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The yield fell to 2.5
percent, or 103.3 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries. That compares with 110 basis points more at the
issue price of 99.869 cents on the dollar.  Ebay’s $250 million of 0.7 percent notes due 2015, its $1
billion of 1.35 percent debentures maturing in 2017 and its $750
million of 30-year, 4 percent bonds also rose after their sale
yesterday. The 2042 notes gained 1.6 cents from the issue price
to 100.6 cents on the dollar, yielding 3.96 percent, or 142.1
basis points more than Treasuries.  EBay borrowed money as average yields on investment-grade
 U.S. debt  fell to a record 3.09 percent yesterday, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Moody’s Investors
Service rated the  San Jose , California-based company’s bonds A2,
the sixth level of investment grade, and  Standard & Poor’s 
graded the obligations an equivalent A.  To contact the reporter on this story:
