(Corrects currency conversion in first paragraph of story
that ran on July 20.)  Nigerian government revenue
increased 32 percent to 763.6 billion naira ($4.7 billion) in
June from the previous month, boosted by company and oil taxes.  The government distributed 569.4 billion naira to federal,
state and local administrations last month, Accountant-General
of the Federation Jonah Otunla said in a statement handed to
reporters in Abuja, the capital, yesterday.  Nigeria  is  Africa ’s top oil producer and the government
earns 80 percent of revenue from crude exports. The price of oil
jumped 10 percent in  New York  since June 1, reaching as high as
$92.30 a barrel today. Government revenue from oil increased 11
percent to 529.9 billion naira in June from the previous month,
Otunla said.  The Federation Account Allocation Committee transferred
207.9 billion naira into Nigeria’s excess-crude account, which
the government uses to save windfalls when international  oil
prices  exceeds its budgeted price of $72 a barrel. That brought
the total in the excess-crude account to $6.9 billion, Yerima
Ngama, minister of state for finance, told reporters in Abuja
yesterday.  Nigeria’s National Economic Council, which comprises the
country’s 36 state governors, the finance minister and the
central bank governor, agreed on June 25 to boost the  excess-
crude account to $10 billion to provide a buffer against a
global economic slowdown.  About 115 billion naira was transferred to the government’s
non-oil excess crude account, Babayo Shehu, director of funds at
the accountant general’s office, told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
