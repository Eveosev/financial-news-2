OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
maker, agreed on terms of buying phosphates this year from OAO
Phosagro in an out-of-court settlement, the companies said in a
joint e-mailed statement, without disclosing the price.  Separately, Acron said it declined to bid for the
government’s 20 percent stake in OAO Apatit, a Phosagro unit
that produces phosphates. Apatit also agreed to buy phosphate
ore from Acron’s Oleniy Ruchey deposit, which is set to start
mining this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
