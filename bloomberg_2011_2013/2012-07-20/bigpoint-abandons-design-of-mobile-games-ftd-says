Bigpoint GmbH, one of  Europe ’s two
largest online-games companies, stopped the development of
mobile games as “the market is difficult at the moment”, Chief
Executive Officer Heiko Huberts told  Financial Times
Deutschland .  In the future the Hamburg-based company may bring mobile
games in joint ventures to the market, the CEO told the FTD. The
producer of online games had a revenue of 103 million euros
($126 million) and a profit of 3.6 million euros in 2010, FTD
reported, citing a financial filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
