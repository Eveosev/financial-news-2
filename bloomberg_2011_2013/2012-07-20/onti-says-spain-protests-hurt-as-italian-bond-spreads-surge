Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ,
facing a surge in spreads on his country’s 10-year bonds, said
anti-austerity demonstrations in Spain are adding to investor
concerns about European debt.  The difference between the yield on 10-year Italian debt
and similar maturity German bunds rose 19 basis points to 497
basis points at 2:46 p.m. in Rome. Italian spreads haven’t ended
a trading day above that level since Jan. 11.  “It’s difficult to say to what extent the contagion comes
or came from Greece or from  Portugal  or from Ireland or from the
situation of the Spanish banks or of the one apparently emerging
from the streets and the squares of  Madrid ,” Monti told
reporters in Rome. “Obviously, without the problems in those
countries, Italy’s  interest rates  would be lower.”  Italian borrowing costs have climbed since March as Spain
followed the governments of Greece, Ireland and Portugal in
seeking European bailout funds. Spanish streets were filled with
tens of thousands of protesters late yesterday after the
government introduced a 65 billion-euro ($79 billion) austerity
package that failed to contain interest rates.  “The contagion is that unease hitting through the markets
in terms of bigger uncertainty, lower confidence towards the
euro’s integrity, higher interest rates,” Monti said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
