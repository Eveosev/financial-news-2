Pork stockpiles in the U.S. were 20
percent higher at the end of June than a year earlier, the
government said.  Warehouses held 591.7 million pounds (268,384 metric tons)
of the meat, up from  495.1 million  on June 30, 2011, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories
fell 7 percent from the end of May.  While commercial pork output in June fell from the previous
month, May production was at a record, USDA data show. For the
six month through June 30, output rose to 11.376 billion pounds,
up 2.6 percent from the same period in 2011, USDA  data  show. The
gains in May contributed to the inventory boost, said  Bob Brown ,
an independent market consultant in Edmond,  Oklahoma .  Production has “been high all year,” Brown said in a
telephone interview before the report. “Anytime you have a big
increase in production, freezer stocks go up a little bit.”  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.3 percent to
settle at 79.8 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The commodity has declined 5.3 percent this year.  As of June 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, rose 0.9 percent from a year earlier
to 49.1 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham surged 18 percent to 147.4 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of June were 14 percent
smaller than a year earlier at 647.3 million pounds, the USDA
said. Beef supplies rose 8.8 percent to 470.8 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
