The International Monetary Fund
staff reached a preliminary agreement for a $500 million loan to
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is feeling the effects of the euro
region’s debt crisis.  The two-year loan still has to be approved by the IMF’s
board in September after the country implements “a number of
measures” in coming weeks, the fund’s mission chief Costas
Christou said in an e-mailed statement.  “The recovery, which started in 2010, has stalled amid
signs that the euro zone crisis is negatively affecting the
country’s exports and capital inflows,” Christou said.
“Domestic demand remains subdued, held back by fiscal
restraint, stagnant wages and slow credit growth.”  Christou said the IMF’s forecast of zero growth this year
may be optimistic. European policy makers today received another
vote of no-confidence in their efforts to stem economic turmoil
as the euro fell to its lowest in more than two years following
final approval for a bailout of Spanish banks.  The IMF said Bosnia’s economic program “aims to strengthen
national economic policy coordination, maintain fiscal
discipline, safeguard financial sector stability, and improve
the business environment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
