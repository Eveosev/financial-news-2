OAO MRSK Holding retreated the most
in a week and Federal Grid Co. slid after Vedomosti reported
that President  Vladimir Putin ’s economic council will discuss
limiting annual tariff increases today.  MRSK,  Russia ’s largest electricity distribution company,
fell 2.9 percent to 1.771 rubles by the close in Moscow, the
most since July 12 and the first drop in four days. Federal
Grid, the country’s high-voltage power transmission monopoly,
dropped 1.3 percent to 23.67 kopeks.  Capping government-regulated power-price increases at 4
percent, as reported by the newspaper, would be “excessively
tough,” VTB Capital’s analysts led by Mikhail Rasstrigin, said
in an e-mailed research note. The move “could have a strong
negative effect on the sector’s economics,” they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
