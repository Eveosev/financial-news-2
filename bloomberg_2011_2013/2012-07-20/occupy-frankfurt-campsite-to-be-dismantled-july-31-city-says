The Occupy movementâ€™s campsite in
front of the  European Central Bank  in Frankfurt is to be
dismantled by July 31 due to poor sanitary and security
conditions, the city government said in an e-mailed statement.  All of the tents must be removed so that pest control
measures can be taken, City Councillor Markus Frank said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
