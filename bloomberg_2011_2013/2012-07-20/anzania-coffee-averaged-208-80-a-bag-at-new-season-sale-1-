The average price of Tanzanian
coffee fell to $208.80 a 50-kilogram bag at the first sale of
the 2012-13 season from $213.07 a bag at the last sale of the
old season on March 15, the nation’s Coffee Board said.  The lowest price for benchmark Arabica AA climbed to $203 a
bag from $152 a bag, the board said today by e-mail from Moshi
in northern  Tanzania .  Supplies of the grade fell 59 percent to 1,153 bags and
sold for as much as $211 a bag compared with a high of $242.40 a
bag at the previous sale, the board said.  “We had a mixture of beans from the last season and from a
new crop,” Primus Kimaryo, the director of quality and
promotion at the agency, said by phone.  The U.S.,  Japan  and  Germany  are some of the main importers
of Tanzania coffee, according to the board.  Supplies for all the coffee at the auction rose 27 percent
to 13,701 bags, while sales more than doubled to 13,579 bags as
buyers replenished their stocks after the break, the board said.  Tanzania reaps its crop from April through August. Arabica
accounts for 75 percent of the country’s output, while robusta
accounts for the rest.  Production for this marketing season in the 12 months
through June next year may climb to 61,012 tons from 32,045 tons
because of a high-yield crop cycle and good weather, Kimaryo
said on May 30.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
dollars for a 50-kilogram bag for the good grades:  To contact the reporter on this story:
