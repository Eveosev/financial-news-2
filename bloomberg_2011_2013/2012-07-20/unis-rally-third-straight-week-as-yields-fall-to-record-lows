The $3.7 trillion municipal-debt
market is poised to rally for a third straight week as yields on
benchmark 30-year tax-exempts fell to their  lowest level  since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1991.  Tax-free debt gained with Treasuries as investors sought a
haven amid  Europe ’s financial crisis. Concern that a $122
billion rescue plan for  Spain  may not be enough pushed yields on
U.S. federal notes maturing in five years to  record lows .  Ten-year munis rated AAA yielded  1.72 percent  at 1 p.m. in
 New York , down from 1.77 percent at the end of last week,
Bloomberg Valuation data show. The yield has declined three
straight weeks for the first time since May. A benchmark of 30-
year tax-exempts fell to 3.35 percent this week, the lowest
since the index began in 1991.  “People are looking for a little extra yield in what is
still considered by the market as a safe asset class,” said Ken Kollar, a trader with Arbor Research & Trading Inc. in New York.  Yields on AAA tax-exempt debt due in 30 years are about 117
percent of those on comparable-maturity federal bonds, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The ratio, a measure of relative
value between the two asset classes, has averaged 103 percent
since 2001.  Declining yields are leading investors to buy longer-term
maturities for the higher  interest rates , said Hardy Manges,
head of muni trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities New York.  Municipal bond funds added about $837 million in the week
through July 18, the most since May, according to Lipper US Fund
Flows data.  Prices on the largest exchange-traded fund tracking
municipal bonds rose to a  five-month high . The iShares S&P
National AMT-Free Bond Fund ended at $111.57 yesterday, the
highest closing level since Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
