Taiwan’s overnight money-market rate
dropped to the lowest level since October on speculation the
central bank will cut borrowing costs to boost economic growth.
The currency snapped a two-week loss.  Export orders  fell 2.6 percent in June from a year earlier,
a fourth monthly decline, official data showed today. The
government and legislature will discuss stimulus measures next
week, a Cabinet official said yesterday, asking not to be named
because of a lack of authorization to speak. Policy makers left
 interest rates  unchanged at 1.875 percent last month, and are
scheduled to meet again in September.  The  lending rate  declined nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, this week to 0.39 percent as of 4:08 p.m.
local time, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Centre. That is the lowest level since
Oct. 19. It dropped one basis point today.  “Some bond traders are speculating on a rate cut,” said
George Pu, a bond trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. in Taipei.
“The overnight rate needs to slip below 0.4 percent to warrant
a drop in borrowing costs.”  First-quarter economic expansion was the slowest since
2009, and the statistics bureau cut its 2012 growth forecast to
3.03 percent in May from 3.38 percent.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.995
against its U.S. counterpart for the week, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It was little changed today. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, declined ten basis points to 3.12 percent today.  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2017 rose two
basis points during the five-day period to 0.875 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It touched 0.842 percent
on July 18, the lowest level for  benchmark five-year rates  since
October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
