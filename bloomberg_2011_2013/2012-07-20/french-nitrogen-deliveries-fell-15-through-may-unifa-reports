French nitrogen-fertilizer shipments
fell 15 percent from July through May to the least in three
years, industry association Unifa said.  Nitrogen deliveries dropped to 1.85 million metric tons in
the 11 months of the year that started July 1 from 2.18 million
tons a year earlier, Paris-based Unifa wrote in an e-mailed
statement today.  France  is the largest crop grower in the European Union and
its biggest user of crop nutrients, according to the
International Fertilizer Industry Association. Farmers apply
nitrogen to their fields to boost plant yields and protein
content in grains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
