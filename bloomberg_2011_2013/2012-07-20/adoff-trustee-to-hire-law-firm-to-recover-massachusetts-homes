The liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s
firm, who is trying to take possession of homes of the con man’s
family members and spouses that were allegedly bought with funds
from Madoff or his defunct brokerage, is seeking to hire a law
firm with special knowledge of Massachusetts law, where some of
the property is located, he said in the bankruptcy court filing
