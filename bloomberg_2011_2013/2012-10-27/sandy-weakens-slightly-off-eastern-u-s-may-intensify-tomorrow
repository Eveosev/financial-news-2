(Corrects state in second paragraph.)  Tropical Storm Sandy weakened
slightly in the Atlantic as it moved closer to the U.S.
Northeast, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane
Center just before 5 a.m.  New York  time today. The system still
“is expected to remain a large storm with widespread impacts
into early next week,” the center in Miami said on its website.  Sandy was moving north-northeast at about 10 miles per hour
and its maximum sustained winds had decreased to 70 mph from 75
mph earlier today, the center said. The eye of the storm was
located about 350 miles southeast of Charleston,  South Carolina .  The tropical storm may intensify late tomorrow, the center
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
