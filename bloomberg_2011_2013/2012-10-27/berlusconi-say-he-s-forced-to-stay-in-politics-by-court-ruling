Three days after announcing that he
would not seek the Italian premiership again, former Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said he feels “forced” to stay in
politics after a Milan court found him guilty of tax fraud in a
television-rights trial.  “There will be consequences,” Berlusconi said today in an
 interview  on the news bulletin of his  Mediaset Spa (MS) ’s Canale 5
when asked to comment on the verdict. “I feel forced to remain
in politics to reform the justice system, so that what happened
to me will not happen to other citizens.”  Berlusconi, who earlier this week said he wouldn’t run for
prime minister in coming national elections, was sentenced
yesterday to four years in prison and banned from public offices
for five years in a film-rights case involving Mediaset.  The former media tycoon turned Italy’s longest-serving
prime minister dominated the country’s politics for almost two
decades. It is unlikely that Berlusconi will serve any jail time
given his age, 76, and the Italian appeals process, which can
run out the statute of limitations. The court pardoned three
years of the sentence.  An Oct. 24 announcement that he would not run for election
next year eased speculation about his political future.
Berlusconi said then that the political movement he founded in
1994 should hold primaries in December to pick its candidate for
the premiership. Such a vote may pose a challenge to Angelino Alfano, the general secretary of the People of Liberty bloc, who
Berlusconi had previously chosen to run the party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
