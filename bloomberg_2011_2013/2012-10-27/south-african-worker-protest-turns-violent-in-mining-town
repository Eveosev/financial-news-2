One person was assaulted as labor
union members gathered to protest the dismissal of striking
South African mineworkers, a police spokeswoman said.  Police used rubber bullets and a stun grenade to disperse
non-unionized workers who clashed with union members in
Rustenburg today, Imelda Sethlako, a police spokeswoman, said by
phone. Seven people were arrested for holding an unlawful
gathering, she said.  “A group of disgruntled people standing outside the
stadium attacked me,” Billy Zulu, national coordinator of the
Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers’
Union, said by phone from Rustenburg. “They hit me hard on the
head with something. I got four stitches.”  Miners at South African platinum mines began a wildcat
strike in August that led to the killing of 44 people, including
34 shot by police near  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine on Aug. 16.
Stoppages spread to gold, coal and iron ore mines, with workers
demanding higher wages.  About 5,000 people attended the meeting arranged by the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, Sethlako said. The
meeting was called in solidarity with striking mineworkers fired
by platinum and gold mines recently.  To contact the reporter on this story:
