The pound strengthened the most in
more than three months against the euro after data showed
Britain’s economy expanded at a faster pace than analysts
forecast last quarter, pulling the nation out of a recession.  Sterling rose for the first time in five weeks against the
dollar as the strongest growth in five years prompted economists
at Barclays Plc and Investec Securities to abandon forecasts for
the Bank of England to boost its bond-buying program next month.
Gilts were little changed after Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King said the recovery is proceeding at a “slow and uncertain”
pace and a “zig-zag” pattern will probably persist.  “The spectacular bounce in U.K. gross domestic product
helped sterling and points at improving momentum in the
economy,” said  Valentin Marinov , head of European Group-of-10
foreign-exchange strategy at Citigroup Inc. in London. “That
greatly diminishes the chance of more bond-buying from the Bank
of England in November.”  The pound rose 1.2 percent over the week to 80.37 pence per
euro at 5:03 p.m. in London yesterday. That’s the biggest five-
day increase since the period ending July 6. Sterling climbed
0.6 percent to $1.6095.  The pound will probably strengthen toward 79 pence per euro
in the next three weeks, Marinov predicted.  Exceeding Estimates  U.K. GDP expanded 1 percent in the three months through
September from the previous quarter, the fastest growth since
2007, Office for National Statistics data showed on Oct. 25.
That exceeded the highest estimate, for a 0.8 percent increase,
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Sterling may weaken on Nov. 1 when analysts forecast a
survey of purchasing managers will show U.K. manufacturing
shrank for a sixth month in October. The Bank of England’s
Monetary Policy Committee will decide on Nov. 8 whether to
extend its asset-purchase program beyond 375 billion pounds.  The pound has advanced 0.2 percent in the past three months
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 3.1 percent and
the dollar dropped 2.6 percent.  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, in the past week to 1.87 percent. The 1.75
percent security maturing in September 2022 rose 0.11, or 1.10
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 98.945.  Gilts returned 1.9 percent this year through Oct. 25,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
2.5 percent and Treasuries earned 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
