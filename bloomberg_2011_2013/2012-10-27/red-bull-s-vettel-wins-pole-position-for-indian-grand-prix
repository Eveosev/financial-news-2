start,” Vettel, 25, said in a press conference. “We got a very
good result and now we look forward to the race.”  McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button will start on
the second row in front of Ferrari teammates Alonso and Felipe Massa. Lotus’s  Kimi Raikkonen , Sauber’s Sergio Perez, Williams’s
Pastor Maldonado and Mercedes’s Nico Rosberg rounded out the
top-10 qualifiers.  Vettel leads the standings with 215 points, six more than
Alonso, with four races remaining in the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
