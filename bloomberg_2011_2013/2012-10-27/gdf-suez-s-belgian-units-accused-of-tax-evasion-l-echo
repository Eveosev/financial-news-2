Belgium ’s tax authorities have
accused Electrabel SA and other Belgian units of  France ’s  GDF
Suez (GSZ)  SA of evading 285 million euros ($369 million) in taxes
between 2003 and 2008,  L’Echo  reported, saying GDF Suez
spokesman Kristof Scheldeman confirmed the allegations.  GDF Suez contests the accusations of tax evasion, which
allegedly took place via Electrabel subsidiaries in Luxembourg,
the Belgian newspaper said. Scheldeman didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail today from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  Another spokesman for GDF Suez, Guy Dellicour, confirmed
the accuracy of the newspaper report and said the company has
paid the sum sought by Belgium and has taken the matter to a
Belgian court in an effort to recover the money. He said a
decision by the court is due next year.  “There’s a long discussion about this case,” Dellicour
said by phone today in Brussels. “Belgian authorities think
they have to tax again what we declared in Luxembourg. We have
followed all rules. It’s a conflict of legal interpretation. We
await the court decision and are confident of the outcome.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
