Real Madrid manager  Jose Mourinho  is
urging club officials to increase their pursuit of Tottenhamâ€™s
 Gareth Bale , the Daily Mirror reported.  Mourinho wants to make a big signing with Real already
eight points behind Barcelona in the Spanish league, though any
move for Bale would likely come next summer, the Mirror said.  Bale signed a long-term contract with Tottenham in the
summer, but club officials are bracing for a fight to keep him,
the Mirror said. Mourinho wants to sell players to fund a 50
million pound ($81 million) bid, with both Kaka and Mesut Ozil
among those moving out, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
