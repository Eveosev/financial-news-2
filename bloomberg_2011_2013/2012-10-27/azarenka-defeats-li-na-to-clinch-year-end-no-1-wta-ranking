Victoria Azarenka defeated Li Na in
the WTA Championships match to clinch the year-end  world’s No. 1
ranking .  The Belarus tennis player defeated  China ’s Li 7-6 (4), 6-3,
to advance to the semifinals today where she will play Russian
Maria Sharapova, who beat  Australia ’s Samantha Stosur 6-0, 6-3
in Istanbul.  “It’s kind of difficult to believe that a little girl from
Belarus is on that list,” Azarenka told reporters yesterday.
“When I started to play tennis I had this big picture in my
head that I want to be there.  Back then it’s so far away.”  Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland advanced to the semifinals
when she topped Italy’s Sara Errani 6-7 (6), 7-5, 6-4. The
fourth-ranked Radwanska will play Serena Williams of the U.S.
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
