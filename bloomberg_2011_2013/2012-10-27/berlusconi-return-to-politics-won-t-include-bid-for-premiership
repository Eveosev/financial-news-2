Italian former Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  said he won’t be seeking the premiership again while
planning to return to politics after a Milan court found him
guilty of  tax fraud  in a television-rights trial.  “I won’t run for premiership at the next election” but
“will keep staying in politics,” Berlusconi said today at a
press conference near Milan. “My top priority will be the fight
to reform the justice system.”  Berlusconi, who earlier this week said he wouldn’t run for
prime minister in coming national elections, was sentenced
yesterday to four years in prison and banned from public offices
for five years in a film-rights case involving Mediaset.  The former media tycoon turned Italy’s longest-serving
prime minister dominated the country’s politics for almost two
decades. It is unlikely that Berlusconi will serve any jail time
given his age, 76, and the Italian appeals process, which can
run out the statute of limitations. The court pardoned three
years of the sentence.  An Oct. 24 announcement that he would not run for election
next year eased speculation about his political future.
Berlusconi said then that the political movement he founded in
1994 should hold primaries in December to pick its candidate for
the premiership. Such a vote may pose a challenge to Angelino
Alfano, the general secretary of the People of Liberty bloc, who
Berlusconi had previously chosen to run the party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
