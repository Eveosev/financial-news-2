Spanish government bonds had their
worst week since August amid speculation Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s regional election victory last weekend gives him more
room to delay seeking a bailout.  Spain’s 10-year securities snapped three weeks of gains
after a government report showed the jobless rate climbed to a
record in the three months through September and the central
bank said gross domestic product shrank for a fifth quarter.
German  bunds advanced  as a gauge of business confidence fell to
the lowest since February 2010, spurring demand for the region’s
safest securities.  “There’s now more uncertainty following the weekend’s
regional elections,” said  Peter Chatwell , a strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “The
market’s now bracing for the possibility there’s not going to be
any attempt to ask for aid for another month. Uncertainty is
something that a bondholder hates.”  Spain’s 10-year  yield  rose 22 basis points, or 0.22
percentage point, this week to 5.59 percent, the biggest
increase since the five days ended Aug. 31. The 5.85 percent
bond due in January 2022 fell 1.595, or 15.95 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,294) face value, to 101.795.  Spread Widens  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish
bonds instead of similar-maturity bunds widened 28 basis points
over the week to 405 basis points. That is still down from a
euro-era record 650 basis points on July 25.  Rajoy’s People’s Party extended its majority in the
premier’s northwestern home region of Galicia on Oct. 21. The
region was one of the first to implement an austerity program.  Unemployment rose to 25.02 percent last quarter from 24.6
percent in the previous three months, the National Statistics
Institute said yesterday. Gross domestic product shrank 0.4
percent, the Bank of Spain said on Oct. 23.  The European Central Bank has offered to buy the bonds of
the region’s most indebted nations to help cap borrowing costs,
though only if they request assistance.  Germany ’s  10-year bund yield  slipped six basis points this
week to 1.54 percent. The yield dropped to 1.51 percent
yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 16.  “The market didn’t get the OK data it was looking for,”
Credit Agricole’s Chatwell said. “That meant that core bonds
got bid up.”  Spanish consumer-price inflation quickened for a fourth
month in October, climbed 3.6 percent from a year earlier,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before the report on Oct.
30. Prices rose at an annual pace of 3.5 percent in September.  Italy  will sell a combined 7 billion euros of five- and 10-
year debt on Oct. 30. On the following day,  France  plans to
auction securities due between 2019 and 2035 and Germany sell 2
billion euros of 30-year bunds.  Spain’s government bonds have returned 2.7 percent this
year through Oct. 25, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bunds rose 2.5 percent, and Italy’s gained 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
