Grupo Pao de Acucar ,  Brazil ’s biggest retailer, said it isn’t
aware of any proposal involving its Via Varejo electronics and
furniture unit, according to a regulatory filing yesterday.  The company responded to a request from the  Sao Paulo  stock
exchange seeking comment after a report by  Valor Economico  on
Oct. 25 said the Klein family may sell its 47 percent stake in
Via Varejo should it not succeed in buying control of the unit.
