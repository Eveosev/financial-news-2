Brazil  may miss its primary surplus
target next year as tax collection won’t expand at a sufficient
pace even with 4 percent economic growth,  Folha de S.Paulo  said,
citing unidentified government officials.  The government won’t cut investments or raise taxes to
achieve its primary surplus target of 3.1 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013, the newspaper reported. Brazil has
room to reduce the target as its debt is under control,
according to Folha.  The primary surplus excludes interest payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
