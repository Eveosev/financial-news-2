China’s economy  will probably
rebound in the fourth quarter,  Jia Kang , a Ministry of Finance
researcher, said at a conference reviewing China’s economic
performance in Beijing today.  China will achieve its full-year growth target of 7.5
percent and “the rebound in the fourth quarter is likely to
extend into next year,” Jia said at the quarterly conference at
the China Center for Economic Research,  Peking University .  The median forecast in a Bloomberg news survey of 30
economists, which was published on Oct. 24, is for China’s
economy to expand 7.7 in the October-December period. Third-
quarter growth eased to 7.4 percent from a year earlier, the
seventh straight deceleration.  At the same time, some monthly data showed signs of a
pickup. Industrial production in September rose a more-than-
estimated 9.2 percent from a year earlier, retail sales climbed
14.2 percent, the most since March, and fixed-asset investment
excluding rural households for the first nine months of the year
increased 20.5 percent.  “For short-term growth prospects, there will be no big
problem,” Jia said. “China’s pro-growth policies will continue
to have effect.”  China’s budget deficit may also increase a little next
year, “but there will be no significant increase,” Jia said.
While China may also issue more local  government bonds  in 2013,
“overall local government debt risks are under control,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
