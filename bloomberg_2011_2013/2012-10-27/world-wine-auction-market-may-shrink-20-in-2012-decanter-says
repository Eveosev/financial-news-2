The global fine-wine auction market
may shrink by at least 20 percent this year, reflecting a drop
in prices for top-quality Bordeaux reds, Decanter.com said.  Leading auction houses are saying the market may decline
by as much as $100 million to $400 million, Decanter magazine’s
website said. Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 2009, one of the
benchmarks for top Bordeaux, is trading just above 7,500 pounds
($12,100) a case, according to Liv-ex’s register of market
prices, down from more than 14,000 pounds at the start of 2011,
Decanter.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
