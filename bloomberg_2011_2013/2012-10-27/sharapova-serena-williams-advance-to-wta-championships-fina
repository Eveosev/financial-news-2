Maria Sharapova  and  Serena Williams 
won in straight sets to advance to today’s final of the WTA
Championships in Istanbul.  Sharapova, the No. 2 seed, beat top-ranked Victoria Azarenka 6-4, 6-2 to reach the final of the season-ending
tournament of women’s tennis for the third time. The Russian won
the title in 2004 and was runner-up three years later.  “When you find yourself in a losing position a few times
during the year, you want to try to figure out how to change
those things around,” Sharapova told reporters yesterday. “I
certainly didn’t make as many mistakes today as I did in our
previous matches this year.”  Azarenka, who clinched the top spot in the year-end ranking
with her victory over China’s  Li Na  two days ago, said she
wasn’t going to make excuses for her loss yesterday.  “I give Maria all the credit today,” Azarenka of Belarus
told reporters. “She played really well and looks in great
form. I finished a loss with a smile for the first time. It
didn’t feel as bad today.”  Third-seeded Williams beat No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska of
Poland 6-2, 6-1 in the opening semifinal. The 15-time Grand Slam
winner will be playing in her fifth WTA Championship final,
having captured the title in 2001 and 2009.  Williams has won nine of 11 career meetings with Sharapova,
including a 6-0, 6-1 rout in the gold-medal match at this
summer’s  London  Olympics.  It was the first time since 2003 that the top four seeds
reached the WTA Championship semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
