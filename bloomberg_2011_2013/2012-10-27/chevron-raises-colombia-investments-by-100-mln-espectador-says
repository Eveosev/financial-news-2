Chevron Corp. (CVX)  will invest
$100 million more than initially planned in Colombia this year
to improve infrastructure in three natural gas fields and drill
two new exploratory wells,  El Espectador  reported.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-controlled oil company
Chevron’s partner in the Chuchupa, Ballenas and Riohacha gas
fields, will invest similar amounts, the Bogota-based newspaper
quoted Stephen Conner, head of Chevron’s Colombian operations,
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
