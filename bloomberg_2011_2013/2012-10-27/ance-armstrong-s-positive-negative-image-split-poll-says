Lance Armstrong , who was stripped of
his cycling titles after teammates claimed he used performance
enhancing drugs, still has a positive image among 37 percent of
people questioned in a Seton Hall Sports Poll.  The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency released a 202-page summary of
its investigation of Armstrong on Oct. 10, saying his cycling
career was “fueled from start to finish by doping.” The 41-
year-old athlete lost his titles, including his seven Tour de
France championships, and was banned for life from competing in
competitive cycling events.  Almost half of the people surveyed said their opinion of
Armstrong hadn’t changed since the USADA report was made public,
according to the poll. A negative opinion of the cyclist was
held by 36 percent, while 27 percent had no opinion or didn’t
know.  “We were surprised by this result given the almost daily
pounding of his reputation but he overcame cancer, raised
millions for  cancer research  and became an American hero,” said
 Rick Gentile , director of the poll. “The public hasn’t
forgotten that.”  Armstrong stepped down as chairman of the cancer charity,
known for its yellow Livestrong bracelets. The foundation has
raised more than $470 million since 1997, according to its
website.  The telephone poll was conducted among 878 randomly-
selected people in the U.S., the New York-based college said.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
