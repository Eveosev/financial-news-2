Arts organizations in the U.K. are
increasingly turning to the private sector to raise money in the
aftermath of government reductions in funding, the Financial
Times reported.  Leeds-based Northern Ballet raised over 70 percent of its
three-year funding target using initiatives like its “Sponsor a
Dancer” campaign, whereby donors meet individual dancers and
can watch them in rehearsal. Funding levels for the program
start at 2,500 pounds ($3,868) to sponsor an apprentice and rise
to 10,000 pounds for a first soloist, according to Northern
Ballet’s  website .  The  Almeida Theatre  in  London  invited corporate sponsors to
a poker game with the cast of a recent production, the FT said.
Almeida artistic director Michael Attenborough warned that arts
organizations may take fewer creative risks as they focus on
commercial success.  To contact the reporter on this story:
