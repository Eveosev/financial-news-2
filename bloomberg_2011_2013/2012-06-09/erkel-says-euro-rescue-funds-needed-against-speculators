Europe ’s rescue funds help protect
the euro area against investors who speculate against member
countries, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  “Europe’s stability is absolutely important for our own
economy and our own economic strength,” Merkel said in her
weekly  podcast  today. “And I am deeply convinced: We need long-
term, reliable instruments of solidarity also to gird against
speculation by the markets.”  While solidarity is needed to ensure Europe’s stability, it
requires countries that receive aid to do “something in
return” to overhaul their economies, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
