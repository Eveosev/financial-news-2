Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Sandoz unit doesn’t
need acquisitions in the biosimilars business, Finanz und
Wirtschaft reported, citing an interview with Jeff George, who
heads the unit.  George said he expects a “shakeout” in the market as some
smaller companies lack the technological abilities and
commercial understanding needed to bring about sophisticated
biosimilars, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
