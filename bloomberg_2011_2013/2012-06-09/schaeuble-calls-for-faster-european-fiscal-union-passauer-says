German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said Europe must work faster to achieve a fiscal union
and deeper political integration because of its sovereign debt
crisis,  Passauer Neue Presse  reported today, citing Schaeuble.  There is “no comfortable” path for Greece out of its
crisis as it isn’t competitive enough to support the  living
standards  expected by the Greeks, the newspaper cited Schaeuble
as saying.  The adjustment program agreed on with the European Union is
the best way for Greece to solve its problems in the coming
decade, within the euro zone, he added, according to Passauer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
