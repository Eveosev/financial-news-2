Kevin Millwood and five relievers
combined to throw a no-hitter in the Seattle Mariners’ 1-0
victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.  It was the fourth no-hitter of the Major League Baseball
season and the first since  New York  Mets pitcher Johan Santana
recorded his team’s first ever no-hitter on June 1.  The last multi-pitched no-hitter was June 11, 2003, when the
Houston Astros recorded an 8-0 victory over the New York Yankees
using six pitchers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
