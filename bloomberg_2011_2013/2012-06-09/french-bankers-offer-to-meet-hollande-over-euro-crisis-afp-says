Franceâ€™s banking trade association
sent a letter to President  Francois Hollande  offering to meet
him to discuss the banking industry in the euro area and also in
France, Agence France Presse reported.  The letter was sent to Hollande on May 22, a week after his
inauguration, the  news agency  said, citing an unidentified
spokesman for the Federation Francaise des Banques. The letter
was not a request for a meeting, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
