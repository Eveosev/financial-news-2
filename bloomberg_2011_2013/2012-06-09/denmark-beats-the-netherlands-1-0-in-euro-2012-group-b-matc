Denmark upset the Netherlands 1-0 in
the opening game of the European Championship of Group B.  Denmark took the lead in the 24th minute on a counter
attack. The ball deflected to Michael Krohn-Dehli, who slipped
the ball through Dutch goalkeeper  Maarten Stekelenburg ’s legs.
Twelve minutes later, Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen’s
attempted clearance went straight to Arjen Robben, whose shot
hit the left post and bounced clear.  The Netherlands dominated possession in the second half and
had chances. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar came on in the 71st minute,
joining  Robin van Persie  in the Dutch attack. Huntelaar
collected a pass just front of goal, but couldn’t chip the ball
over Andersen.  The Danes survived an appeal for a handball in the last
three minutes of the match.  Portugal and  Germany , the other teams in Group B, meet in
the second match of the day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
