International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  called on Europeans to find more
common ground in the crisis,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported in an
e-mailed preview of an article to appear today.  Lagarde spoke in favor of joint European bank supervision,
common guarantees for bank deposits, and a debt accord under
which all members will be responsible for a portion of the debt
others hold, the newspaper said, citing an interview with
Lagarde.  Lagarde added that jointly guaranteed debt would be a sign
to markets that Europeans take the issue seriously, SZ reported.
Uncertainty and doubts about the long-term vision of politicians
and the sustainability of the euro area are undermining efforts
to preserve the euro, Lagarde also told the newspaper.  An IMF delegation is now underway in  Spain , although Spain
so far hasnâ€™t asked the multilateral lending agency for
assistance, SZ cited Lagarde as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
