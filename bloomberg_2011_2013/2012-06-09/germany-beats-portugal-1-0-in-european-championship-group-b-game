Germany defeated Portugal 1-0 in
their opening game in Group B at the European Championship.  Mario Gomez  scored in the 72nd minute on a header that went
past Rui Patricio into the Portuguese goal, just as  Miroslav
Klose  waited on the touchline to replace him. Silvestre Varela
had a chance to tie the match but couldn’t chip it over Manuel
Neuer.  Portugal came closest to scoring in the first half as
Pepe’s shot from a corner hit the cross bar and bounced out as
 Cristiano Ronaldo  and others appealed to the referee.  In the other Group B match today, Denmark upset the
Netherlands 1-0. Michael Krohn-Dehli scored the only goal in the
first half at Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv, Ukraine. The
Netherlands dominated with 28 shot attempts, but only put eight
on target. All eight of the Danish shots were on target.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
