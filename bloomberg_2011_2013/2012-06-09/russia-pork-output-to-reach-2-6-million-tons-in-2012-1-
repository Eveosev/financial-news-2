Russia ’s pork output is expected to
reach 2.6 million metric tons this year and increase to 3.1
million tons in 2015, said Yuriy Kovalev, director of the
National Pig Breeders Union.  Pork production may rise to 2.8 million tons next year and
3 million tons in 2014, Kovalev said at an Agriculture Ministry
meeting in Moscow today.  Imports of pigs for slaughter may more than triple by 2015
after Russia’s accession to the  World Trade Organization ,
according to a presentation by Kovalev. Pig imports will may
rise to 200,000 animals in 2015 compared with 80,000 this year
and 55,600 last year, according to his presentation. Russia will
probably be able to meet 85 percent of domestic pork demand, or
23.5 kilograms a person by 2015, said Agriculture Minister
Nikolai Fedorov today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
