Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin led
West Indies to 280-8 in the third cricket Test with England as
several dropped catches allowed the visitors to bat out the day
at Edgbaston in Birmingham.  Samuels was trapped leg before wicket on 76 by  Tim Bresnan ,
who was 3-74. Ramdin, who is not out on 60 runs, was batting
with Ravi Rampaul at stumps. Graeme Onions was 3-56 for England.  Opening batsman Adrian Barath was dropped twice by  Ian
Bell , and went on to score 41 runs before Onions trapped him
lbw. Captain  Andrew Strauss  dropped Darren Sammy on 14 to leave
the Windies on 233-6, although he caught him off Steven Finnâ€™s
bowling two runs later.  The first two days of the Test were lost to rain. England
has already clinched the three-match series by winning the first
two Tests.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
