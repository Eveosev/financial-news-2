Euro-area finance ministers were to
discuss providing as much as 100 billion euros ($125 billion) in
support for  Spain ’s banks on a conference call today, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing an unidentified official from a
euro-region country.  A draft statement prepared ahead of the call by senior
officials of euro-region finance ministries mentions 100 billion
euros as the top figure Spain might get, the Journal said. The
exact amount and form of any aid weren’t specified in the draft
statement, the Journal said.  No disbursements of funds would be likely to occur before
the end of June, the report said, adding that Spain hasn’t yet
requested aid for its banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
