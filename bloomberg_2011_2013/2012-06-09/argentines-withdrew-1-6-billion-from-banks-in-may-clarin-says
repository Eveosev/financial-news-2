Argentines withdrew $1.6 billion from
banks in May after the government tightened controls on the
foreign exchange market, newspaper  Clarin  reported.  About $605 million was taken out of banks from May 28 to
June 1, while the pace of withdrawals slowed last week to about
$70 million per day, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said,
citing officials at the central bank it didnâ€™t identify.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  tightened controls
on the foreign exchange market in November to protect central
bank  reserves , as the country taps them to pay debt. Since then,
depositors have withdrawn a total of $4.4 billion, Clarin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
