French President  Francois Hollande 
will withdraw all of his country’s troops from  Afghanistan  by
the end of the year, Agence France Presse reported, citing
comments made earlier today at a ceremony in the central French
town of Tulle.  Earlier, the president’s office said four French soldiers
had been killed in an attack in the province of Kapisa in
northeastern Afghanistan. Eight-seven French soldiers have been
killed in Afghanistan since 2001, according to AFP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
