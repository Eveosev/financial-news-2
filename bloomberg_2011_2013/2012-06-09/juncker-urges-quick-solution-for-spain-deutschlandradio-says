Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs the group of euro-area finance ministers,
said a solution to  Spain ’s banking crisis will have to be found
quickly,  Deutschlandradio  said, citing an interview.  While Spanish banks are problematic, it doesn’t have a
macroeconomic reason for seeking aid from the euro-area’s rescue
fund, Juncker was quoted as saying in a summary of his comments
e-mailed by the German broadcaster late yesterday. Spain’s
situation isn’t comparable with that of Greece, which has a much
broader range of financial issues, Juncker was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
