Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable
company, said it isn’t considering an offer for  British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , disputing a report from the New York
Times that said  it was “mulling” a bid .  “This is complete rubbish, speculation and inaccurate,”
D’Arcy Rudnay, a spokeswoman from Philadelphia-based Comcast,
said of the Times story.  BSkyB, Britain’s largest satellite broadcaster, could
become available for purchase following  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s failed
attempt to buy the portion of the company it doesn’t already
own, the Times reported. News Corp. abandoned the deal after its
U.K. publishing unit hacked into the phones of politicians and
celebrities, drawing criticism from British lawmakers.  Julie Henderson, a spokeswoman for News Corp., declined to
comment on the  New York  Times report.  “We are standing by our story,” said Danielle Rhoades Ha,
a  New York Times Co. spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
