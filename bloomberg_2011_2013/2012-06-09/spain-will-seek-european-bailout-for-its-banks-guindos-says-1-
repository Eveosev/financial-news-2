Spain  will seek a European bailout
for its banks, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told a press
conference in  Madrid  today, following a conference call of euro-
area finance ministers.  Guindos said the aid to Spain will be provided on terms
“much more favorable” than what currently would be possible in
the financial markets. The amount of funding being provided will
be announced by euro-region finance ministers, Guindos said,
without specifying when.  The aid won’t carry any macro-economic or fiscal
conditions, he said. Banks getting aid will have to submit to
conditions, he said.  This is not a “rescue,” he said.  Reports by consultants analyzing the status of Spain’s
banks will be published this month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
