Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna is
expected to miss the start of next season as he continues to
recover from a second broken leg in seven months, the  Daily
Mirror  said.  Sagna broke his right leg in a Premier League match against
Norwich on May 5, an injury which will keep him from playing for
 France  at the European Championship, and is likely to be out
until mid-September, the Mirror said. He suffered a similar
injury against Tottenham in October which required surgery and
sidelined him four months.  Carl Jenkinson will be the likely replacement for Sagna
when Arsenal opens preseason training, the Mirror said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
