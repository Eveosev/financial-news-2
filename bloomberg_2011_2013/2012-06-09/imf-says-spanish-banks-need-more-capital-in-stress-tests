Spain ’s banking system would need 37
billion euros ($46 billion) in additional capital to cope with
worsening economic conditions, the  International Monetary Fund 
said in a report, which the country will use to help determine
what international support it may seek for its lenders.  “The team’s stress tests show that while the core of the
system appears resilient, vulnerabilities remain,” the IMF
staff wrote in a report assessing the stability of Spain’s
financial system released yesterday. While “the largest banks
appear sufficiently capitalized,” there is “a group of banks
where vulnerabilities seem highest and where public support
seems most critical,” according to the  report .  Spain may seek European aid as soon as today when finance
ministers from the euro region hold a conference call, said a
German official and a European Union aide, who declined to be
identified because the matter is confidential. A bailout would
make Spain, which is reeling from a recession and the bursting
of a real estate bubble, the fourth of the 17 euro nations
receiving aid after  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal .  “European banks are at the epicenter of our current
worries and naturally should be the priority for repair,” IMF
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said in a speech in  New York 
yesterday.  The IMF said the actual capital needs for Spanish banks
would be higher than 37 billion euros to include other costs
that may be later identified. “Some costs additional to
provisioning for potential losses may be unknown ahead of time
and are therefore not possible to incorporate in the stress
tests,” according to the report.  Adverse Scenario  The IMF used an “adverse” scenario for the tests that
would see the Spanish economy contract 4.1 percent this year and
1.6 percent in 2013. That compares with a “baseline” scenario
that foresees it shrinking 1.7 percent this year and 0.3 percent
in 2013, according to the report. It also considers that the
banks will need to comply with a core Tier 1 capital ratio
requirement, a measure of financial strength, of 7 percent.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said June 7 that he
will wait for the IMF report and the results of studies due by
June 21 by two consultants before choosing how to finance the
recapitalization of the banking system.  The IMF, which says its tests covered 96 percent of the
country’s domestic banking industry, categorized banks into four
groups. The most vulnerable banks are former savings banks that
have received state support.  Domestic Lenders  Spain’s access to markets is narrowing as the Treasury
increasingly depends on domestic lenders to buy its debt,
government data show. Foreign investors cut their holdings of
Spanish debt to 37 percent of the total in April from 50 percent
at the end of last year, weakening the government’s capacity to
backstop its banks.  The collapse of the Spanish property boom in 2008 left
lenders with more than 180 billion euros of what the Bank of
Spain calls “problematic” assets linked to real estate. The
government, in power since December, has passed two decrees
making banks recognize deeper losses on loans to the property
industry and foreclosed assets.  Spain’s credit rating was cut to within two grades of junk
by  Fitch Ratings  June 7. It said the cost to the state of
shoring up banks may amount to as much as 100 billion euros in
the worst case, compared with its previous estimate of 30
billion euros, as Spain will remain in a recession next year.  A bailout for Spain might hurt credit ratings as the threat
looms of a Greek exit from the single currency, Moody’s
Investors Service said yesterday.  Moody’s said it may review the ratings of several euro-area
nations because of developments in Greece and Spain, where
growing estimates of the cost of cleaning up banks may prompt a
downgrade of the nation’s A3 rating.  -- Editors: Gail DeGeorge, Brendan Murray  To contact the reporters on this story:
