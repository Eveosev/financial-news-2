Volker Kauder , parliamentary leader
of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s ruling Christian Democrats,
rejected setting up a debt-sharing fund for euro-area nations,
the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported .  “We cannot agree with” proposals for a debt redemption
fund that would pool part of the debt on the books of individual
governments, Kauder said in an interview, according to the
newspaper. That would amount precisely to the debt sharing
“that we don’t want,” he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
