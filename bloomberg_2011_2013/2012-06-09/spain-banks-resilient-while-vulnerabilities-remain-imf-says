Most of  Spain ’s banks are resilient
to shocks while vulnerabilities remain, the IMF said today in a
report.  Spanish authorities “have taken measures to address some
of the most problematic banks,” Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, deputy
director of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department,
said in a statement. “But the extent and persistence of the
economic deterioration may imply further bank losses.”  The fund tested Spain’s banks and found that “under the
adverse scenario, the largest banks would be sufficiently
capitalized to withstand further deterioration, while several
banks would need to increase capital buffers by about” 40
billion euros ($50 billion) in total to comply with capital
standards under the Basel III accords.  To contact the reporter on this story:
