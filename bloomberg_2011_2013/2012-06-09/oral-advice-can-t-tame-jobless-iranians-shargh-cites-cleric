Iran ’s youth needs prospects and jobs
amid high unemployment and poverty fed by the government’s
“weak management,” the  Shargh  newspaper reported senior
religious leader Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli as saying.  The country is rich in assets while suffering extensive
poverty, Javadi-Amoli said, according to the Tehran-based
newspaper. “We will one day be punished for it,” Shargh quoted
him as saying.  Unemployment and poverty shouldn’t be underestimated, and
moral and religious advice can’t be expected to “tame” poor
and unemployed young people, Shargh reported Javadi-Amoli as
saying at a meeting with politicians.  Javadi-Amoli also criticized infighting and the existence
of cliques within the government, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
