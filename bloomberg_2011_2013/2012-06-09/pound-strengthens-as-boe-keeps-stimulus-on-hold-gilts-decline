The pound has its first weekly
advance against the dollar in more than a month and U.K.
government bonds fell after the  Bank of England  kept its
stimulus program and benchmark  interest rate  unchanged.  Britain’s currency climbed from the lowest level in almost
five months against the yen after a report showed U.K. services
grew more than analysts estimated in May. While the decision to
refrain from expanding the bond-buying plan was predicted by 37
of 42 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Citigroup Inc. and
Deutsche Bank AG were among those that forecast an expansion.  “The Bank of England took a pause this week,” which
supported sterling, said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “The market is
looking for further easing ahead, so it’s a pause for the pound,
not a change. We anticipate the BOE will have to add more and
that will weaken the pound.”  The pound advanced 0.4 percent to $1.5423 at 4:20 p.m.
 London  time yesterday, climbing for the first week since the
five days through April 27. It reached $1.5601 on June 7, the
strongest level since May 30. Sterling rose 2.3 percent to
122.65 yen, after reaching 118.81 yen on June 1, the weakest
level since Jan. 19. The pound was little changed at 80.89 pence
per euro.  Sterling may fall to less than $1.50 in the next couple of
months, Hardman said. It last traded at that level in July 2010,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Gilt Yield  Policy makers held the bond-purchase program at 325 billion
pounds and kept their benchmark rate at a record-low 0.5 percent
on June 7. Minutes of the meeting, showing how officials voted,
will be published on June 20.  The 10-year gilt yield rose 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 1.64 percent. The yield reached a record-
low 1.439 percent on June 1.  The U.K. services gauge based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  held at 53.3, the same reading as the previous month,
 Markit Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said on June 7. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had
forecast a decline to 52.4. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion.  Sterling has gained 1.6 percent this year, the second-best
performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, after the dollar, as
investors sought U.K. assets as a haven from  Europe ’s debt
crisis. The U.S. currency rose 2.4 percent, and the euro dropped
1.8 percent.  Economists say data next week will add to evidence the U.K.
economy is faltering. Factory output fell 0.1 percent in April,
after rising 0.9 percent in March, according to a Bloomberg
survey before the government report on June 12.  Gilts have returned 2.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds rose 3.5 percent, and
 U.S. Treasuries  gained 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
