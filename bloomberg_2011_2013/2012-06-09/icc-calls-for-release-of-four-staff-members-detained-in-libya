The  International Criminal Court  in
The Hague called for the immediate release of four of its staff
members who have been detained in Libya since June 7.  The delegation was in Libya to meet with Saif Al-Islam Qaddafi, the son of the north African nation’s former leader
 Muammar Qaddafi , to discuss his legal representation in the case
brought against him, the ICC said in an e-mailed statement.  “We are very concerned about the safety of our staff in
the absence of any contact with them,” the court’s president,
Judge Sang-Hyun Song, said in the statement. “These four
international civil servants have immunity when on an official
ICC mission. I call on the Libyan authorities to immediately
take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security
and to liberate them.”  The ICC said it is communicating with the relevant
authorities of Libya to ensure their release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
