European officials are drafting a
proposal to issue joint euro-area bonds for countries running a
 budget deficit  if all of the region’s governments agree,  Der
Spiegel  reported, without saying how it got the information.  European Commission President  Jose Barroso , European Union
President Herman van Rompuy, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
are working on the blueprint for a “real fiscal union,” the
German magazine reported today.  Governments whose financing need exceeds revenue would have
to apply to the group of euro-area finance ministers to allow
extra spending, Der Spiegel said. If ministers decide the
deficit spending is justified, they could approve joint euro
bonds to finance the borrowing. A body of representatives of
national parliaments would be set up to have oversight over the
ministers, the report said.  While the financing option would apply only to new
borrowing, not existing debt, it amounts to debt-sharing that
the German government has rejected so far,  Der Spiegel  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
