Russian ports handled 5.2 percent
more cargo in the first five months of the year than in the same
period in 2011 as coal and metals exports increased, the
Association of Commercial Seaports said today.  Total turnover at the country’s terminals grew to 224.6
million metric tons, the Moscow-based organization said in an e-
mailed statement.  Coal shipments rose 12 percent to 34.7 million tons, while
iron ore dispatches increased 13 percent to 12 million tons.
Crude-oil loadings fell 4.8 percent to 79.4 million tons, while
oil-product shipments climbed 1.7 percent to 44.2 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
