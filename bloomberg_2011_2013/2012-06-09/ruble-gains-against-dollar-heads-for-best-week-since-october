The ruble showed the sharpest weekly
appreciation against the dollar in more than four months after
Urals crude,  Russia ’s biggest export, rallied yesterday.  The Russian currency gained as much as 0.5 percent before
closing little changed at 32.66 per dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow,
taking its rise this week to 3.1 percent, the biggest advance
since Jan. 29. The ruble lost 0.8 percent to 41.02 per euro and
0.4 percent to 36.422 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket.  Urals crude in northwest  Europe  gained 0.8 percent to
$98.24 per barrel by yesterday’s close and had its first weekly
gain since April 27. Oil and gas together contribute about 50
percent of Russia’s budget revenue, according to government
estimates.  Russia’s markets were open today before public holidays on
June 11 and June 12.  The country’s $3 billion of Eurobonds due 2042 fell,
increasing the yield by two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.334 percent. The rate on ruble-denominated domestic
debt due 2027 dropped eight basis points to 8.85 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
