German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the time isnâ€™t right to set up joint deposit
insurance as part of a proposed European banking union, the
Passauer Neue Presse  reported , citing an interview.  Joint liability would be unacceptable under current
circumstances, Schaeuble said in comments published today in the
newspaper. Taking on joint liability requires joint decision-
making, he said, according to Passauer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
