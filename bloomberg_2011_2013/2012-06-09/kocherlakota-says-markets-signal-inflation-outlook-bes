Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
President Narayana Kocherlakota said central bankers should use
prices in financial markets instead of statistical forecasts to
help them determine whether they are meeting their inflation
goals.  “My general argument implies that the appropriate outlook
for the central bank is not a statistical forecast of inflation,
but rather the risk-neutral expectation of inflation,”
Kocherlakota said in the summary of remarks given in Ann Arbor,
Michigan today. “This risk-neutral expectation can be measured
using inflation break-evens on assets like zero coupon inflation
swaps or TIPS bonds.”  The Minneapolis Fed chief, who was speaking at a symposium
hosted by the  University of Michigan , gave a similar speech on
June 3. He did not comment on the  U.S. economy  in the summary or
the slides of his remarks today.
