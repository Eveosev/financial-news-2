Euro-area finance ministers today
said that their support for Spanish banks could be as much as
100 billion euros ($125 billion).  “The loan amount must cover estimated capital requirements
with an additional safety margin, estimated as summing up to 100
billion euros in total,” the Eurogroup said in a statement on
the European Union website.  The statement added: ``The Eurogroup notes that  Spain  has 
already implemented significant fiscal and labor market reforms  
and measures to strengthen the capital base of the Spanish 
banks.''    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
