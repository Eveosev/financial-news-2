Robinson Cano  hit two two-run homers
as the  New York  Yankees defeated cross-town rival New York Mets
9-1 in a Major League Baseball interleague game tonight at
Yankee Stadium.  Hiroki Kuroda (5-6) had a no-hitter going for the Yankees
before Omar Quintanilla hit a double with two outs in the sixth
inning. He allowed one hit and struck out seven in seven innings.  Alex Rodriguez  scored on Cano’s home run in the second
inning to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead. The duo repeated the feat
in the third inning as Cano, Nick Swisher and Andruw Jones hit
back-to-back-to-back home runs, giving the Yankees’ 6-0
advantage.  Curtis Granderson scored on Rodriguez’s sacrifice fly to
center, Mark Teixeira added a run on Swisher’s ground-rule
double and Jones hit a run-scoring single in the seventh to cap
the Yankee 9-0 run.  Lucas Duda  doubled in the top of the ninth to send home
Quintanilla for the Mets’ only score.  Johan Santana, (3-3) who pitched the season’s third no-
hitter and the first ever for the Mets on June 1, gave up six
runs on seven hits in five innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
