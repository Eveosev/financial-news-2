Argentina ’s dollar deposits from
individuals and non-government businesses fell to the lowest
since April 2010 as President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
tightened controls on the exchange market.  Dollar-denominated deposits fell to $10.4 billion on June 1
from $11.95 billion a month earlier, the lowest since April 30,
2010, when deposits were $10.3 billion, according to the latest
data released by the  Banco Central de la Republica Argentina.   Dollar withdrawals have quickened since Fernandez, who was
re-elected in October, restricted purchases of foreign currency
to stem record capital outflow from draining central bank
reserves. Since late October, Argentines need tax-agency
approval to buy dollars or other currencies. Starting last
month, those who want to buy foreign currency to travel abroad
must submit details of the itinerary, estimated cost and purpose
of the trip.  “With the controls, the government managed to control
demand for dollars, but it generated panic and led people to
withdraw,” said  Camilo Tiscornia , a former central bank
economist who runs research company C&T Asesores Economicos in
 Buenos Aires . “The withdrawals are leading to a drop in central
bank  reserves , which the government needs to pay debt.”  Fernandez, who used $6.6 billion from central bank reserves
in 2010 and $7.5 billion last year to make debt payments, plans
to use $5.7 billion in 2012 for the same purpose. Bank
withdrawals led reserves to fall to $46.7 billion on June 8 from
as high as $52.6 billion in January last year.  Capital outflows accelerated last year to $21.5 billion
from $11.4 billion a year earlier on speculation that the
country would let the peso fall because rising inflation was
undermining the country’s competitiveness in foreign markets.  The peso, which has fallen 4.1 percent this year, was
little changed yesterday at 4.4845 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
