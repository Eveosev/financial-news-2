Comerica Inc. (CMA)  fell the most in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index after reporting that net
interest margin declined in the third quarter.  Comerica slumped as much as 12 percent, the most since
2009, after the Dallas-based company said its margin slid to
3.18 percent in the quarter from 3.23 percent in the same period
a year earlier.  M&T Bank Corp. (MTB) , the index’s third-worst
performer, dropped as much as 8.9 percent, the most since May,
as margin declined to 3.68 percent from 3.87 percent.  The slide in net interest margin, which is the difference
between what banks pay to borrow money and what they get for
loans and on securities, have squeezed profit at U.S. lenders as
 interest rates  remain near record lows. JPMorgan Chase Co., the
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, said last week that its margin
narrowed to 2.66 percent from 3.01 percent in the third quarter
of 2010.  “Comerica was disappointing,” Brian Foran, an analyst at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York, said today in a note to
clients. “A lot of investors were getting more positive on
Comerica into the quarter on the dual thesis of commercial loan
growth and rising Libor benefiting net interest margin,” he
wrote, referring to the London interbank offered rate.  M&T’s net income declined 7 percent to $164.7 million, the
Buffalo, New York-based bank said today in a statement.
Operating earnings per share, excluding one-time items, were
$1.53, compared with the average estimate of $1.71 by 25
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Net income at Comerica climbed 66 percent to $98 million,
or 51 cents a diluted share, which included a merger and
restructuring charge of 11 cents. The average estimate of 30
analysts, excluding one-time items, was 53 cents.  Comerica slid $2.72, or 11 percent, to close at $23.13 in
 New York  and earlier touched $22.85. M&T dropped 5.6 percent to
$72.79 after falling as low as $70.21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
