clause in his contract with Santos, the Mirror said.  Blackburn Summit  The Venky’s Group, which owns Blackburn Rovers, is flying a
group of fans to its headquarters in  India  to ask them about

charge of the club less than a year ago, the Mirror said.  Liverpool Target  Liverpool is interested in signing Bologna’s attacking

pounds in the January transfer window, the Sun said.  Modric Contract  Tottenham coach  Harry Redknapp  wants Luka Modric to sign a
new deal, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Redknapp said Modric is “just getting on with it” after a
