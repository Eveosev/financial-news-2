Egypt  canceled the sale of two- and
three-year bonds today after investors demanded yields that were
too high, a government official with knowledge of the decision
said.  The country’s central bank had sought bids for 4 billion
Egyptian pounds ($671 million) worth of the notes, according to
data it posted on Bloomberg. Investors asked for higher rates on
the two-year bonds than their three-year counterparts, the
official said on condition of anonymity because he’s not
authorized to speak to the media.  The Egyptian government’s need for cash as the first fiscal
quarter comes to a close this month pushed yields on treasury
bills in the last two weeks to the highest levels since 2008.
The yield on one-year securities surged 84 basis points, or 0.84
percentage point, this month to 13.822 percent. The rate on
nine-month bills advanced to 13.842 percent at an auction
yesterday.  Today’s cancellation is the third of a debt auction this
quarter, including two sales of treasury bills. Egypt withdrew
the sales of treasury bonds valued at 19.5 billion pounds in the
first half amid political unrest that ended President  Hosni
Mubarak ’s rule in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
