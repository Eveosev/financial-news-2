Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds fell,
pushing up yields the most in more than three months, as concern
 Greece  may be heading for default cut demand for emerging-market
assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 5.78 percent at 12:03 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the steepest
rise in yields since June 6 when they jumped 34 basis points.
The price fell 1.09 centimo to 114.11 centimos per sol.  Investors speculated Greece may not obtain rescue loans the
country needs to help it avoid default. International monitors
will assess today whether the Greek government can meet the
conditions for receiving the aid. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party lost a regional election in Berlin, stoking
concern she may adopt a harder line on resolving the euro-area’s
debt crisis.  “What’s happening in Greece is raising fears of another
credit crunch,” said  Roberto Flores , an economist at Inteligo
SAB, a Lima-based brokerage. “Foreign investors are moving to
safer assets without differentiating between the markets’
fundamentals. They’ll probably come back once those fears have
eased because there’s space for Peruvian bonds to strengthen
given the central bank’s message about possibly relaxing
monetary policy.”  The sol weakened 0.2 percent to 2.7385 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7320 on Sept. 16.  The yield on Peru’s 6.55 percent dollar-denominated bond
due March 2037 rose two basis points to 5.15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
