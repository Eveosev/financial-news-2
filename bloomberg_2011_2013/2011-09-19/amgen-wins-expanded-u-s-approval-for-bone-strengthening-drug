Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  won U.S. approval to
expand marketing of its bone-strengthening drug Prolia for
people using hormone therapy to treat prostate and breast
cancer.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cleared the drug, also
known as denosumab, to reduce fracture risks in breast cancer
patients taking drugs that halt estrogen production and prostate
cancer patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapies,
 Thousand Oaks , California-based Amgen said today in a statement.  Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, is
counting on denosumab to boost growth amid slowing sales of the
anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen, its core products. The drug won
FDA approval last year as a treatment for osteoporosis in
postmenopausal women. Sales of the drug may reach $1.17 billion
in 2014, according to the average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Bone loss and fractures are recognized adverse effects of
hormone ablation therapies but we have not had an approved
treatment option to prevent these problems for our patients,”
Matthew Smith, director of the Genitourinary Malignancies
Program at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in
 Boston , said in the company’s statement.  Amgen declined 18 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $56.53
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
