Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA)  fell
the most in almost four years in Nasdaq trading after U.S.
regulators approved a generic version of Sanofi’s Lovenox blood
thinner that competes with Momenta.  The Food and Drug Administration approved closely held
Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s Lovenox copy today, agency
spokesman Sandy Walsh said in an e-mail.  Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (WPI) , Amphastar’s partner on the drug, rose 3.1 percent in
trading.  Lovenox, also known as enoxaparin sodium, is given by
injection to help prevent blood clots that can cause strokes.
Momenta, of Cambridge,  Massachusetts , and partner  Novartis AG (NOVN) ,
of Basel, Switzerland, have sold generic Lovenox exclusively in
the U.S. since winning FDA approval in July 2010.  Momenta slid $5.45, or 31 percent, to $12.30 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the biggest drop since
Nov. 6, 2007.  Watson, of Parsippany,  New Jersey , gained $2.08 to $69.36
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after climbing to
$70.10. Novartis’ American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, declined 78 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $55.27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
