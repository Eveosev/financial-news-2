Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said its “very dangerous” to give the European Financial
Stability Facility a bank license because it could amount to
monetizing the debt of distressed governments.  “A bank license would mean monetizing state debt,”
Weidmann, who also sits on the European Central Bank’s Governing
Council, told a parliamentary committee in Berlin today. “And I
don’t see that the financing of states would be a bank
business.”  If the EFSF had a bank license, it could buy  government
bonds  and use them as collateral for loans from the ECB.
Weidmann said it’s important to avoid a situation where “under
the cloak of a bank licence, risks are shifted to the
Eurosystem.”            To contact the reporter on this story:
