Investors led by billionaire
Richard Caring reached a deal for a 330 million-pound ($518-
million) financing package to pay a loan held by Ireland’s
National Asset Management Agency and buy a building in London’s
Mayfair district,  CoStar Group Inc. reported .  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Deutsche Bank AG and Singapore’s
 United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB)  agreed to a 230 million-pound, three-
year senior loan, according to CoStar, which didn’t say where it
obtained the information. A fund managed by LaSalle Investment
Management and Geneva-based Safanad provided 100 million pounds
of mezzanine loans, it said.  The agreement clears the way for Caring’s group of
investors to repay NAMA and buy the U.S. Embassy’s former Naval
headquarters at 20 Grosvenor Square, which they intend to
convert into luxury apartments, according to CoStar. NAMA
acquired the original loan, secured by the property, from Allied
Irish Bank after there was a breach of certain terms, CoStar
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
