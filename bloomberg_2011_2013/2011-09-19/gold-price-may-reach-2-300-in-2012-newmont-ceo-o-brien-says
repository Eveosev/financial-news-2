Gold may rise to $2,000 an ounce by
the end of this year and $2,300 an ounce by the close of 2012
because of investors buying the metal as a haven amid turmoil in
financial markets,  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  Chief Executive Officer
Richard O’Brien said.  “We’re going to continue to be in a bullish gold-price
environment for the next five to seven years,” O’Brien said
yesterday in an interview at the 2011 Denver Gold Forum in
 Colorado  Springs, Colorado. “It’s going to take that long for
people to get their fiscal house in order.”  Gold climbed to a record earlier this month and is in the
11th year of a  bull market , the longest winning streak since at
least 1920 in  London . Gold for immediate delivery rose $23.95,
or 1.4 percent, to $1,802.63 an ounce at 7:31 p.m. in London
trading. It touched a record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6.  While the price of gold has advanced 25 percent this year,
Newmont, the largest U.S. gold producer, has increased 7.9
percent. The company said in April that it would link its
dividend to the gold price.  Newmont said yesterday it’s enhancing that policy and the
full-year payout now has the potential to climb to $4.70 a
share. The quarterly dividend will get an additional increase of
7.5 cents a share when the metal exceeds $1,700 and a further
2.5-cent boost if gold surpasses $2,000, the  Greenwood Village ,
Colorado-based company said in a statement.  Rising Costs  The company said in July that second-quarter production
costs advanced to an average of $588 an ounce, from $507 a year
earlier. Capital and operating costs are increasing as gold-
mining companies compete for a limited supply of workers and
inputs such as energy and building materials, O’Brien said
yesterday.  “Cost inflation is something we’re all going to have to
deal with,” he said. “When you have $15 billion-plus of
projects in  Australia , of which our projects might be less than
$1 billion, we have very little capacity to impact what it costs
to produce steel.”  Newmont increased $3.63, or 5.5 percent, to $69.90 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
