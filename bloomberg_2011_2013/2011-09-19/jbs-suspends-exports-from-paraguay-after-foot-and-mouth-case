JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said it suspended exports from its unit in  Paraguay 
after a case of foot-and-mouth disease was discovered in the
South American country.  The company’s operations in Paraguay will be dedicated
entirely to the internal market, while units in other countries
will cover the lost shipments abroad, JBS said today in a
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
