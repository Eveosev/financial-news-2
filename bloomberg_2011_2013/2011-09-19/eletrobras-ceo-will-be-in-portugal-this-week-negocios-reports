Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) 
Chief Executive Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto will be in
 Portugal  this week, Jornal de Negocios reported, without saying
how it obtained the information.  The Brazilian utility is waiting for the announcement of
the rules for the Portuguese governmentâ€™s planned sale of its
stake in Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA so that
it can make a decision about taking part in that privatization,
the Portuguese newspaper said, citing an unidentified person at
Eletrobras.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
