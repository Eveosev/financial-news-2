Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , a Brazilian company
that sells more than 180 different brands of  consumer goods , led
declines by stocks that depend on domestic demand amid concern
the fastest inflation in six years may hurt profits.  Hypermarcas slumped 5.5 percent to 11.31 reais at the close
of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the worst
performer on the Bovespa stock index. Lojas Renner SA,  Brazil ’s
biggest publicly traded clothing retailer, fell 4 percent to
54.70 reais. Apparel retailer  Marisa Lojas SA (AMAR3)  tumbled 4.4
percent to 21.70 reais, the biggest one-day drop since Aug. 8.  “Inflation is now the main risk to consumer stocks,” Caue
Pinheiro, an analyst with SLW Corretora, said in a telephone
interview from  Sao Paulo .  Analysts covering the Brazilian economy raised their
inflation forecasts for the fourth week. Consumer prices will
rise 5.71 percent in the next 12 months and increase 5.5 percent
next year, according to the median forecast in a Sept. 16
central bank survey of about 100 economists published today. The
forecasts were up from 5.66 percent and 5.4 percent respectively
the previous week.  This year, consumer prices will rise 6.46 percent, today’s
survey found, from a week-earlier forecast of 6.45 percent. The
central bank targets inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points. Consumer prices rose 7.23 percent in the year
through August, the highest since June 2005.  Hypermarcas dropped after BTG Pactual cut the stock to
“neutral” from “buy” and said increasing competition may
hurt the company’s profits.  “We don’t believe Hypermarcas’s organic growth will be as
good as other domestic consumer stories,” BTG Pactual analysts
including Fabio Monteiro wrote in a note to clients today.
“While Hypermarcas is reducing its marketing investments to
preserve cash and boost profitability, its multinational rivals
are taking the opposite route: upping advertising expenses and
launching new products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
