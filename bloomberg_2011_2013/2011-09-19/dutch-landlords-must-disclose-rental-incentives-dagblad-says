Dutch real-estate companies will be
forced to disclose rent incentives they give to boost occupancy,
 Het Financieele Dagblad  said, citing financial regulator AFM.  Rent-free periods and other measures that can affect the
property’s valuation must be disclosed, starting with 2011
annual reports, Ton Meershoek, head of AFM’s financial reporting
supervision unit, said according to the Dutch newspaper.
Companies that fail to provide the information in their reports
will be required to do in a separate release, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
