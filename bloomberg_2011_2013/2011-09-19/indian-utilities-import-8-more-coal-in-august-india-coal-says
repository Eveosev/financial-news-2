Electric utilities in  India 
increased coal imports in August to 3.19 million metric tons, up
8 percent from July, India Coal Market Watch said.  The Central Electricity Authority, a supervisory body, set
a target to import 4.6 million tons of coal for  power plants 
last month, said the newsletter, published by Kolkata-based
online trading company Mjunction Services Ltd.  Imports rose 81 percent from the year-earlier period to
17.9 million tons in the first five month of the year, India
Coal said. That compares with a government target of 35 million
tons, the newsletter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
