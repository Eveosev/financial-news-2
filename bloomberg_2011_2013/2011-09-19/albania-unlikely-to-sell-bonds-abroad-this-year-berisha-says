Albania is unlikely to sell bonds
in the overseas market this year as a deepening European debt
crisis erodes demand for emerging-market debt, Prime Minister
Sali Berisha said.  “If we need, we will go to the euro market, although the
climate is not the best,” Berisha said in an interview in  New
York  today.  Yields on Albania’s 300 million euros ($409 million) of 7.5
percent bonds due in 2015 jumped 69 basis points, or 0.69
percentage point, in the past month to a record 9.6 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The government sold the
securities on Oct. 28, 2010.  Albania’s debt is equal to 59.7 percent of the country’s
gross domestic product. Berisha said the government plans to
reduce the ratio by 2013. The economy will likely expand 5
percent this year and grow 5.5 percent in 2012, Berisha said.  The  European Central Bank ’s bond-purchase program is a
“concern” for Albanian policy makers because it’s weakening
the euro, Berisha said.  “The ECB buying bonds from different countries concerns us
very much,” Berisha said in an interview in New York today.
“It’s devaluing the euro. We are not a euro member country, but
we are a euro-fied economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
