Thunderstorms in the Atlantic
moving toward the Windward Islands have a 60 percent chance of
developing into a tropical cyclone within 48 hours, the National
Hurricane Center said.  The low-pressure area southwest of the Cape Verde Islands
is about 1,450 miles (2,330 kilometers) from the Windwards and
moving west at about 10 mph, the Miami-based center said today
in an 8 a.m. New York time website  advisory .  “Environmental conditions appear favorable for the
development of a tropical depression during the next couple of
days,” it said.  The center was also monitoring a low-pressure system 900
miles east of Martinique. “Environmental conditions are not
favorable for significant development,” the NHC said, giving
the area no chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in 48 hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
