U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
pledged the Obama administration’s support for using civilian
courts for trials of alleged terrorists and working within the
 United Nations  to combat terrorism.  “We have learned in the most painful of ways that our
security interests are intertwined, and that our counter-
terrorism efforts must be as well,” Holder said today at the
opening of a counter-terrorism symposium at the UN in  New York .
The U.S. is committed to “strengthening the capacity of
civilian courts around the world, which have time and again
shown their effectiveness.”  President  Barack Obama ’s administration this year reversed
its plan to put the self-proclaimed mastermind of the Sept. 11
attacks on the U.S. and his alleged conspirators on trial in
civilian court in New York. The administration agreed to send
the case to a military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after
lawmakers restricted the administration’s ability to bring
detainees to the U.S. for trial.  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon used today’s meeting to
announce the creation of the first UN global center for counter-
terrorism, to be established in  Saudi Arabia .  Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said his government
would contribute $10 million to the center, and that 60 nations
have agreed to participate in its formation and work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
