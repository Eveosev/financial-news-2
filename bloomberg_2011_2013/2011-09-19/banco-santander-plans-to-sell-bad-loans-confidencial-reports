Banco Santander SA (SAN)  plans to sell as
much as 5 billion euros ($6.8 billion) of non-performing loans,
 El Confidencial  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The sale would allow the lender to reduce provisions, El
Confidencial said.  A spokesman for Santander, who declined to be named because
of internal policy, wouldnâ€™t comment when contacted today by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
