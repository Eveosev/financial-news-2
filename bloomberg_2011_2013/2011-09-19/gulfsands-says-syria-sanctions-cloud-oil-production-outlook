Gulfsands Petroleum Plc (GPX) , a U.K.-
based oil explorer, said U.S. and European Union sanctions
against crude imports from  Syria  cloud production prospects.  Gulfsands’s output in the country rose to 12,050 barrels of
oil equivalent a day in August from 10,300 barrels in January,
the company said in a statement in London. It drilled four
exploration wells in Syria that yielded two discoveries,
bolstering net income by 87 percent to $31.2 million in the
first half.  Last month the company, which has operated in Syria since
2000, suspended payments to a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a state crackdown on dissidents killed thousands,
prompting the sanctions. Gulfsands also suspended the voting
rights of Rami Makhlouf, who owns 5.75 percent of the company
and is one of the officials subject to EU visa bans and asset
freezes.  “Uncertainty exists as to the production outlook for the
remainder of the year as the Syrian government adapts to the
sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the EU,” Gulfsands said in
the statement in  London .  The company said group working interest output rose to
10,923 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the first half from
9,689 barrels a year earlier. Gulfsands plans to drill two more
exploration wells in Syria this year and one in  Tunisia , and it
has pre-qualified to participate in bidding rounds for 12
exploration blocks in  Iraq .  To contact the reporter on this story:
