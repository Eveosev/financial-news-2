U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said there is a issue about managing the pay of people in banks
rescued by the taxpayer, as he called for an end to
“rewards for failure.”  “Clearly there’s an issue going forward about how we
manage the contracts of people in state-owned banks,” Cable
told BBC television in Birmingham,  England , where he will
address his Liberal Democrat Party’s annual conference later
today. “We don’t want to disadvantage the state-owned banks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
