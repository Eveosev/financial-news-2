South African Finance Minister
 Pravin Gordhan  said a challenge for policy makers is to reduce
the volatility of inflation expectations and make them more
forward-looking.  More stable expectations will help reduce the volatility of
inflation and interest rates, Gordhan said in a written response
to a parliamentary question, dated Aug. 19 and e-mailed today.  “Credible and forward-looking monetary policy can help to
keep inflation low and reduce the volatility of expectations,”
he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
