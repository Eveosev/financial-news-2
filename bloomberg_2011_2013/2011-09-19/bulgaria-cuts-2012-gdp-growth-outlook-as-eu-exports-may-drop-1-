Bulgaria cut its 2012 economic
growth forecast to between 3 percent and 4 percent as expansion
in western  Europe  is slowing, Finance Minister  Simeon Djankov 
said.  “We see that the German, French, Italian and the Dutch
economies, which are our biggest trading partners, are slowing
down in the second quarter and forecasts for the third quarter
are also lower than initial estimates,” Djankov said in an
interview with Bulgarian National Television in Sofia today.
“This will inevitably affect Bulgaria. We’ll see a certain
slowdown from the first quarter of next year.”  Bulgaria won’t have the 5 percent growth “we hoped for,
it’ll probably be between 3 percent and 4 percent,” he added.  Bulgaria’s economic recovery slowed to the weakest in three
quarters from April through June, mirroring easing growth across
the European Union amid the euroarea’s debt crisis. Some 60
percent of  Bulgaria ’s exports are shipped to the EU. Second-
quarter gross domestic product growth slowed to 2 percent from
3.3 percent in the previous three months, while seasonally
adjusted GDP advanced 0.3 percent in the quarter.  “There will be no recession neither this, nor next year,”
he said. The government’s economic growth estimate for 2011 is
3.6 percent.  Bulgaria will revise down its macro-economic estimates for
2012 in the forecast that will be released in mid-October, he
said without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
