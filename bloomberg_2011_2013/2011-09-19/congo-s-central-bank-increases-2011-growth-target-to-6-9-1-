Democratic Republic  of Congo’s
economy will probably grow 6.9 percent this year, the central
bank said, raising its forecast from 6.5 percent.  Annual inflation will probably accelerate to 17 percent for
the year, up from an earlier projection of 13 percent, the
bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said in a  statement  on its
website after a Sept. 15 meeting. It cited high global food and
oil prices for lifting the estimate.  Congo’s economy expanded about seven percent last year,
with an inflation rate of close to 10 percent, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  The mineral-rich country is emerging from more than 40
years of dictatorship and war that destroyed much of its
infrastructure and economy. It is in the second year of a three-
year, $561 million loan program backed by the IMF to reduce
poverty and increase growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
