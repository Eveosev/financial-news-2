Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor
Gaspar said the island of Madeira is likely to have only a
limited impact on the country’s 2011 budget deficit.  “We still don’t have estimates regarding the impact on
this year’s deficit,” Gaspar told reporters today in Lisbon.
“The impact that is likely to arise is very limited.”  Debts that weren’t reported earlier by Madeira will have an
impact on  Portugal ’s public debt of 0.3 percent of gross
domestic product, the central bank and the statistics institute
said on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
