BP Plc bought at least three
cargoes of ultra-low-sulfur diesel in northwest  Europe . Gasoil
traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange dropped as  Brent
crude  plunged.  Gasoline barges also decreased while the fuel’s crack, or
premium to Brent, shrank. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., also
known as Sabic, purchased naphtha at the lowest price in more
than a week. Libya is running two refineries at full capacity.  Light Products  Gasoline for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded
from $1,021 earlier in the day down to $998 a metric ton in the
afternoon session as crude oil fell, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with trades on Sept. 16 from $1,023 to $1,040 a ton.  Trafigura Beheer BV and Morgan Stanley purchased 2,000 tons
each of the 10,000 tons that changed hands. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc was the other buyer. Chevron Corp., Glencore International
Plc and BP Plc were the main sellers. The trades are for Eurobob
grade to which ethanol is added to make finished motor fuel and
are typically for lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack narrowed to $5.58 a barrel from $5.83 on
Sept. 16, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and
refined products broker in  London .  Sabic purchased the naphtha from Gunvor Group Ltd. at $941
a ton, according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring
the Platts pricing window which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.
That’s the lowest price since Sept. 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened to $3.57 a barrel from
$3.08 on Sept. 16, according to PVM.  Middle Distillates  BP bought diesel cargoes from Glencore and Mabanaft BV at a
premium of $34 a ton to October gasoil, priced for delivery to
the U.K., according to the survey of Platts. That’s $5 higher
than a deal on Sept. 14. The  oil company  purchased as much as
30,000 tons for delivery to its refinery at Castellon,  Spain  at
a $37 premium. It also bought a barge at a $21.50 premium to the
gasoil contract.  Total SA bought a jet fuel barge at a premium of $65 a ton
to October ICE gasoil, in line with Sept. 16 deals, according to
the survey.  Gasoil for October declined 2.1 percent to $930.50 a ton as
of 5:03 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The November
contract fell 2 percent to $927 a ton.  Low-sulfur gasoil for delivery in January traded at $946.50
a ton after rising as high as $972 a ton on the first day of
trading in London.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability,
widened to $14.86 a barrel from $14.73 yesterday, according to
ICE data. Brent plummeted 2.6 percent to $109.29 a barrel.  Gasoil barges traded at a discount of $1 and $2 to October
futures, the survey of Platts showed.  Residues  Low-sulfur fuel oil traded at $647 and $648 a ton, the

$655 a ton. The high-sulfur grade traded at $627 to $631 a ton,
lower than $636.50 to $641 concluded in the previous session.  Refineries  Libya ’s Tobruk and Sarir refineries are operating at full
capacity of 20,000 barrels and 10,000 barrels a day,
respectively, said an official at Arabian Gulf Oil Co., the
company operating the plants.  Total started units at its 115,000 barrel-a-day Feyzin
refinery in  France  following a fire on Sept. 17. The blaze,
