Croatia ’s main stock index fell the
most in almost six weeks as a decline in global markets and
fears of a new recession kept investors away.  The Crobex benchmark index closed at 1,929.38, 2.85 percent
down from its previous close. It was the index’ biggest decline
since Aug. 8, led by Podravka Prehrambena Industrija d.d, which
fell 4.61 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for the story: James M. Gomez
