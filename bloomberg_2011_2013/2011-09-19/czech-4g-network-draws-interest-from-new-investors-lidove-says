An auction of bandwidth that can be
used for a new generation mobile phone network in the  Czech
Republic  has drawn competition from as many as six Chinese and
other companies who want to provide the technology,  Lidove
Noviny   reported , citing company representatives.  Companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Nokia
Siemens Network, Telefonaktiebolaget Lm Ericsson and Alcatel
Lucent are lobbying the countryâ€™s current three mobile-phone
providers to provide new equipment for the 4G services after the
auction which is expected to be held in the second half of 2012,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
