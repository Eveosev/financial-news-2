Jasco Electronics Holdings Ltd. (JSC) , a
South African telecommunications company, surged the most in
three weeks after saying earnings excluding the purchase of
Spescom Ltd. rose as much as 30 percent in the year to June 30.  The stock added 10 cents, or 11 percent, to 1 rand as of
2:01 p.m. in Johannesburg, the biggest increase since Aug. 29. A
close at this level would represent the biggest gain since May
24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
