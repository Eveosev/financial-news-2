Airbus SAS said its first single-
aisle A320 planes outfitted with winglets, also known as
sharklets, will enter service in 2012 as scheduled.  The wingtips will increase range by improving the planeâ€™s
aerodynamic properties, Frank Vermeire, head of A320 product
marketing, said at a conference in  Barcelona , Spain, sponsored
by the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
