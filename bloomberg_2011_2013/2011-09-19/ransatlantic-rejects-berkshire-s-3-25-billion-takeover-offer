Transatlantic Holdings Inc. (TRH)  is
rejecting a $3.25 billion takeover offer from Warren Buffett’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  that was set to expire today.  “The Transatlantic board of directors does not believe the
all-cash proposal, at substantially less than book value, would
deliver fair value to stockholders and is therefore not
accepting it,” New York-based Transatlantic said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Berkshire’s National Indemnity renewed its $52-a-share cash
bid in a Sept. 16 letter and gave Transatlantic a three-day
deadline to accept the deal. Transatlantic’s book value, a
measure of assets minus liabilities, is $67.76 a share,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Transatlantic canceled a deal last week to merge with
Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings AG amid investor opposition
and has shunned an unsolicited offer from Validus Holdings Ltd.
By sticking to its initial bid, Berkshire can protect its
reputation for refusing to be pushed into less favorable terms,
said  Michael Yoshikami , chief investment strategist at YCMNet
Advisors, which invests in Buffett’s firm.  “It shows discipline,” Yoshikami said before
Transatlantic’s latest announcement. “They want to make sure
that they don’t undermine that discipline, because it actually
then will cause companies in the future possibly to try to
renegotiate.”  Transatlantic dropped 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.81 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
