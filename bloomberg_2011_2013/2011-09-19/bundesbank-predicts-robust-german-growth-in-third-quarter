Germany ’s Bundesbank said it
expects “robust” growth in  Europe ’s largest economy in the
current quarter.  “Overall, a robust expansion of the economy can be
expected in the third quarter of 2011,” the Frankfurt-based
central bank said in its monthly report today. For the time
thereafter, the “outlook has clouded more than previously
expected amid heightened uncertainty,” it said.  Germany’s benchmark DAX share index has slumped 24 percent
since early August amid a worsening debt crisis in the region’s
periphery that’s threatening to affect the real economy. While
industrial production surged the most in 16 months in July and
car sales, an indicator for private consumption, rose for the
first time in five months, business confidence last month
dropped to the lowest in more than a year.  The Bundesbank last month said it expects the economy to
expand “in the region of 3 percent” this year, reiterating its
June forecast. German growth slowed to 0.1 percent in the second
quarter from 1.3 percent in the first after  consumer spending 
slumped.  “After a considerable decline in the second quarter,
private consumption should rise markedly,” the Bundesbank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
