Angola ’s economy is poised to
expand by 6.3 percent this year and is likely to be “a lot more
robust” in 2012, the country’s central bank Vice-Governor
Antonio Andre Lopes said today.  His growth estimates are almost twice as high as those of
the government, which on July 13 reduced its 2011 economic
growth estimate to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent.  “The Angolan economy should grow, according to our
projections, 6.3 percent,” Andre Lopes said in an interview on
the sidelines of a conference in Lisbon. “Next year, although
the budget has not yet been approved, growth should be a lot
more robust.”  Andre Lopes said he expects the bank’s foreign exchange
reserves to remain above $20 billion at the end of the year, on
the back of higher oil exports. Angola is  Africa ’s second-
biggest oil producer after  Nigeria .  The central bank, also known as Banco Nacional de Angola,
is carrying out measures to ensure the stability of the
financial system, he said.  “Clearly, there are measures being taken to ensure the
stability of the financial system," said Lopes without being
specific.  Angola’s inflation rate slowed to 13.7 percent in August
from 14.1 percent the month before, the National Statistics
Institute said on Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
