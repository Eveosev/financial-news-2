Teucrium Trading LLC , which started
a corn exchange-traded product last year, launched products that
are linked to U.S. futures for  soybeans ,  wheat  and  sugar .  The three new funds began trading today, Stephanie Kuffner,
a spokeswoman for the  Santa Fe , New Mexico-based company, said
by telephone. The soybean and wheat funds each reflect weighted
averages of three contracts from the Chicago Board of Trade,
while the sugar product is tied to three prices from ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York .  Teucriumâ€™s corn fund, launched in June 2010, was up 18
percent this year before today. The company also has products
linked to crude oil and natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
