A leaky container ship has been
stabilized in the port of Hamburg after it collided with another
vessel, news agency DPA reported.  The Hanse Confidence, which flies the flag of Antigua and
Barbuda, was in collision with the Luxembourg-flagged Charlotta,
a larger container ship, DPA said. Firefighters pumped water out
of the vessel, and cranes removed its containers, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
