British lawmakers said a plan to
streamline the control rooms of firefighters was a “complete
failure,” costing taxpayers 469 million pounds ($735 million)
before it was canceled in 2010.  The government’s 2004 attempt to replace 46 regional fire
and rescue control rooms with nine high-tech hubs known as
FiReControl was “flawed from the outset,” Parliament’s Public
Accounts Committee said in a report published in  London  today.
Ministers tried to impose a centralized computer system without
involving local fire departments, the committee said.  “No one has been held to account for this project failure,
one of the worst we have seen for many years, and the careers of
most of the senior staff responsible have carried on as if
nothing had gone wrong,”  Margaret Hodge , an opposition  Labour
Party  lawmaker who heads the cross-party panel, said in an e-
mailed statement.  Plans to spend 84 million pounds to restart the program
should have clearly defined objectives and make sure those
implementing it are accountable, the lawmakers said. The
committee’s report didn’t disclose the companies involved in the
original project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
