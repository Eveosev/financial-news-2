Gold investment demand in  China  is
likely to top a record 200 metric tons this year, the World Gold
Council said.  The country’s investment demand surged 70 percent in 2010
to an all-time high of 187 tons, said Albert Cheng, the Far East
managing director at the World Gold Council.  China’s “investment demand has picked up exponentially,”
Cheng said yesterday in an interview in Montreal. “The
financial crisis has triggered people to be cautious of anything
they don’t understand,” boosting demand for bullion as an
alternative asset.  Gold futures have surged 29 percent this year, touching a
record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6. The metal climbed as
escalating debt woes in  Europe  and the U.S. boosted demand for
haven assets.  India  is the world’s top bullion buyer followed by
China. The two countries accounted for 54 percent of world gold
consumption in the second quarter, Cheng said.  The council has estimated demand from China may double in
10 years. The forecast may be “too conservative,” Cheng said.  “Investment demand has been a key driver and will remain a
key driver, because there’s not many investment options” in
China, Cheng said. “The price of gold has surged, and we
haven’t seen demand weaken. Chinese people say, ‘If I don’t buy
gold today, it will be more expensive tomorrow.’”  China’s gold consumption totaled 706 tons last year,
including 452 tons for jewelry, Cheng said. Jewelry demand may
climb 9 percent to 10 percent annually in the next five years,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
