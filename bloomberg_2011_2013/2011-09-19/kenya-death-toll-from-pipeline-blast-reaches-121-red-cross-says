The death toll from a Sept. 12
pipeline explosion near the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has risen
to at least 121, the Kenyan  Red Cross  said.  The Red Cross is providing shelter and food for 426 people
affected by the blast, Eddyson Nyale, group’s regional manager
for eastern  Kenya , said by phone today. About 146 people are
still missing, he said.  The explosion took place when leaking fuel from a pipeline
operated by state-run Kenya Pipeline Co. spilled into a storm
drain and ignited close to the Mukuru slum, about 11 kilometers
(7 miles) east of Nairobi. Police and the company are
investigating the cause of blast.  Kenya’s worst petroleum accident occurred in January 2009,
when 94 people died after a gasoline tanker overturned and burst
into flames at Molo in the Rift Valley province, about 167
kilometers northwest of Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
