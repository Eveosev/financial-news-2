Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD)  began talks with
 Telekom Networks Malawi Ltd. (TNM)  about buying a stake in the
company, the  Daily Times  reported, citing people it didn’t
identify.  Vodacom has previously expressed an interest in buying part
of the Malawian company and TNM has been streamlining its
operations to align with how Vodacom operates, the Blantyre-
based newspaper said, without providing further details.  TNM issued a cautionary announcement on Sept. 16 saying it
had received an expression of interest from a potential
strategic partner. No one answered the phone at TNM’s office
when Bloomberg called today seeking comment.  Richard Boorman, a spokesman for Vodacom, said he couldn’t
immediately comment when contacted on his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
