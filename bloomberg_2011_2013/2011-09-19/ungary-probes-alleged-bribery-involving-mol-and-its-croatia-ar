Hungarian authorities are
investigating allegations of bribery involving Mol Nyrt., the
country’s largest refiner, and  INA  Industrija Nafte d.d., its
Croatian subsidiary, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office said.  “No suspect has been named,” Gabor Nagy Szeplaki, a
spokesman at the prosecutor’s office, told Bloomberg News in a
phone interview today.  Hungary  began the inquiry after Croatia requested legal
help in July in connection with the case, Szeplaki said. He
declined to comment on how long the probe might take.  Poslovni Dnevnik, a Croatian newspaper, said last week that
Hungarian prosecutors were investigating Mol Chairman Zsolt Hernadi over allegations that he bribed former Croatian premier
Ivo Sanader to win control of INA. The newspaper cited Gabor
Ivan, Hungary’s ambassador to Croatia, as its informant.  Sanader, who is being held on suspicion of corruption and
abuse of power in several cases, protested his innocence last
month during a prison interrogation by  Croatia ’s Office for
Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime, Croatian newswire
Hina reported on Aug. 30.  Mol, which secured management rights at INA in a 2009
contract with the Croatian government, owns 47.47 percent of the
refiner, with an option to buy another 1.6 percent. The
government owns 44.84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
