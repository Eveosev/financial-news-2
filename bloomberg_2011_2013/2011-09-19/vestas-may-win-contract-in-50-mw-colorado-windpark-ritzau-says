Vestas Wind Systems A/S may win a
contract to deliver turbines to a 50 megawatt windpark in
 Colorado , Ritzau reported, citing local newspaper Pueblo
Chieftain. Colorado Springs Utilies has received 13 project
proposals, while Vestas is the only company that already does
business in Colorado, a factor that may prove decisive in
deciding the contract, Ritzau said, citing Pueblo Chieftain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
