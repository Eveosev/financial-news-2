Copper futures tumbled the most in
10 months on speculation that  Europe ’s escalating debt woes will
hinder the global economy, eroding demand for industrial metals.  European manufacturing contracted in September for the
second straight month, economists said before a report on a
purchasing-managers index this week. Europe’s economy is cooling
as governments extend spending cuts to narrow budget deficits.
In China,  home prices  in all 70 cities monitored rose for the
first time this year, the statistics bureau said yesterday.  “China property-price news over the weekend possibly
sparked fears of more Beijing tightening, or no loosening, as
some may have been factoring in,” said  David Thurtell , an
analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  Singapore . “Poor euro-zone
manufacturing PMI’s would obviously be a bad look” for
industrial metals, he said.  Copper futures for December delivery fell 14.9 cents, or
3.8 percent, to settle at $3.7825 a pound at 1:29 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the biggest drop for a most-active contract
since Nov. 16. Earlier, the price touched $3.7655, the lowest
since Nov. 30. The metal has dropped 15 percent this year.  The euro-zone purchasing managers manufacturing index fell
to 48.5 this month from 49 in August, according to the median of
34 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction. The Markit Economics report is
set for release on Sept. 22.  Sixty percent of equity investors see euro-area banking
issues as the greatest threat to their markets and 70 percent of
currency clients say euro developments will be the most
important drivers of their markets,  Barclays Capital  said,
citing a client survey. Europe consumes about a fifth of the
world’s copper, according to Barclays.  China  is the biggest
buyer.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell $332, or 3.8 percent, to $8,364 a metric ton ($3.79
a pound). Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also declined.  Inventories of copper in warehouses monitored by the LME
rose 0.7 percent to 469,125 tons, the most since July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
