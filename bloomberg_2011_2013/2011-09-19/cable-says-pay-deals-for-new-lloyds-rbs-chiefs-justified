U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
defended pay deals for the incoming heads of  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , as he called
for an end to “rewards for failure.”  “There’s a difference between people who’re coming in to
turn round a failed institution and people who failed
originally,” Cable told BBC Radio 4 in Birmingham, England,
where he will address his Liberal Democrat Party’s annual
conference later today. He said pay-offs to outgoing bosses
“shouldn’t have happened.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
