Suzano Papel & Celulose SA hired
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to manage a potential sale of its paper
business, Valor Economico reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  Suzano is considering selling the assets in three blocks,
with one comprising printing and writing paper, another
consisting of its cardboard assets, and a third including the
remainder of its paper business, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
said.  Suzano’s press office said it has hired banks to analyze
its business options but not in relation to the sale of its
paper assets, which it described as “pure speculation”, Valor
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
