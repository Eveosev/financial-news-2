Kenya ’s Cereal Millers Association
opposes plans by the government to regulate prices of basic
goods, saying the focus should be on increased production.  Kenya’s corn output lags behind demand by 10 million bags a
year, according to Diamond Lalji, chairman of the industry
group. Regulating prices may only result in shortages, he said.
The purpose of the regulation is to control cartels, said Romano
Kiome, permanent secretary in Kenya’s Ministry of Agriculture.  “Our priority should be to work on increasing supply,”
Lalji said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
