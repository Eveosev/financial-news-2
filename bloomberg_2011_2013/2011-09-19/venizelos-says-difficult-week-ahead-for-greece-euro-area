Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the euro area’s problems were “deeply
institutional” and that the region and  Greece  faced a
“difficult” week ahead.  “The decisions of July 21 aim at giving a definitive and
final response to the speculative games of the financial
markets,” he said. Venizelos spoke at a conference in  Athens 
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
