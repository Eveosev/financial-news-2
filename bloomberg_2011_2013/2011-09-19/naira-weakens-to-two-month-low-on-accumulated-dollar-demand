Nigeria ’s naira depreciated to its
weakest in almost two months against the dollar after the 20th
successive auction in which the central bank failed to meet
lenders’ demand for foreign currency.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
slumped 0.2 percent to 153.91 naira per dollar at the auction,
according to an e-mailed statement today by the Abuja-based
 Central Bank of Nigeria . It retreated 0.4 percent to 156.75
naira per dollar in interbank trading by 5:45 p.m. in Lagos, the
lowest level since June 23, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank sold $350 million compared with $467.6
million demanded by lenders, the central bank said. Africa’s
biggest oil producer uses its foreign currency reserves to keep
the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or below 150
naira per dollar at its twice-weekly dollar sales to help curb
inflation.  “The naira is under pressure to lose value from
accumulated dollar demand for petroleum and manufactured goods
imports,” Usman Onoja, chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Lovonus Trust and Investment Ltd., which trades in currencies,
said in a phone interview from Lagos. “The unmet demand at the
central bank auction is channelled to interbank trading, which
further weakens naira at that level.”  in quote in last -- The “naira is... (needs the) and maybe,
