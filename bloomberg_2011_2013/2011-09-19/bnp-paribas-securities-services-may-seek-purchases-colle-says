BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA’s securities
services unit, which includes the custody business of France’s
largest bank, may consider acquisitions in Europe and Canada as
it seeks to double revenue over five years.  “There are opportunities at the moment, especially around
the depositary-bank activity from smaller regional banks in
Italy, Spain and to some extent Germany,” Patrick Colle, the
division’s chief executive officer, said today in an interview
in Toronto. “There could also be opportunities from pure local
custodians, custodians in a country that just serves their own
country.”  BNP Paribas’s securities services unit, whose activities
also include clearing and settlement of transactions,
administration of funds and treasury management, is planning to
double revenue over five years and to increase the proportion of
sales coming from outside of  Europe . The division’s revenue in
2010 grew 5.4 percent to 1.21 billion euros ($1.65 billion).  The unit may also look at opportunities in Canada, Colle
said.  “At the moment our priority is Asia and  Latin America , in
particular Brazil, which we’ve just launched, but we’re looking
to Canada with friendly eyes and we’ve made no decisions yet,”
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
