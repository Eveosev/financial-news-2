RXR Realty LLC, a property
investment company run by Scott Rechler, agreed to purchase a
controlling interest in 620 Avenue of the Americas, an office-
and-retail building in  Manhattan ’s Chelsea neighborhood.  An affiliate of Uniondale, New York-based RXR will have an
option to buy the remaining stake in the 700,000 square-foot
(65,000-square-meter) property, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. The deal values the building, which houses the
flagship store of the  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY)  home-goods chain,
at $500 million, RXR said.  The building “offers us a great opportunity to buy an
irreplaceable asset at a significant discount to replacement
cost,” Rechler said in the statement. The top two floors,
comprising 152,000 square feet, are vacant, with renovations
planned, RXR said. The Midtown South office submarket, where the
building is located, had the lowest vacancy rate of any major
U.S. office district in the second quarter, Cushman & Wakefield
Inc. said in a July report.  The deal is the latest Manhattan purchase for Rechler, the
former chief executive of Reckson Associates Realty Corp. In
July, RXR bought the Starrett-Lehigh Building near the Hudson
River waterfront. Previous purchases include 340 Madison Ave.
and 1330 Avenue of the Americas.  The building at 620 Avenue of the Americas is owned by a
partnership that includes New York investor Joseph Chetrit,
according to city records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
