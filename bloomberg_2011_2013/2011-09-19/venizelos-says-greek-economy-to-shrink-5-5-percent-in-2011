Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the economy will shrink 5.5 percent this year and
will also contract “notably” next year.  Venizelos said there would be a primary deficit of 1.8
billion euros this year and that the government aimed at a
primary surplus of 3 billion euros next year “which is possible
if we implement everything we have to.” He spoke at conference
in  Athens  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
