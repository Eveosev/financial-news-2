President  Barack Obama  called for
$1.5 trillion in tax increases over the next decade to help trim
the deficit, saying U.S. prosperity depends on paying down the
federal debt.  In combination with cuts in spending, Obama said, his plan
would reduce the long-term deficit by $3 trillion beyond the $1
trillion that was agreed to as part of a deal to raise the U.S.
debt ceiling. The additional taxes largely would fall on the
wealthiest Americans.  “If we don’t act, debt will eventually crowd out
everything else,” Obama said this morning at the White House as
he unveiled his recommendations to the 12-member congressional
committee charged with finding ways to trim at least $1.5
trillion from the deficit. The panel has a Nov. 23 deadline to
reach a deal.  The proposal puts Obama in conflict with Republican
congressional leaders such as House Speaker  John Boehner , who
last week said his party wouldn’t accept tax increases and urged
the bipartisan supercommittee to focus on scaling back
entitlement programs such as the Medicare health-insurance plan
for the elderly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
