The  Tampa Bay Rays  pulled within
two games of Boston in the race for the American League’s wild-
card playoff berth by beating the division-rival Red Sox 8-5 in
the finale of their four-game series.  Matt Joyce had three hits and drove in three runs for the
Rays, who won three of four games at Boston’s Fenway Park. Tampa
Bay improved to 85-67 and begins a four-game series tomorrow
against the Yankees in New York.  The Yankees lost 3-0 to the Toronto Blue Jays yesterday and
hold a 4 1/2-game lead on the second-place Red Sox (87-65) in
the AL East. The Yankees are 6 1/2 games ahead of the Rays with
11 regular-season Major League Baseball games remaining.  The  Detroit Tigers , who already clinched the AL Central,
defeated the Oakland A’s 3-0 yesterday as Justin Verlander
tossed eight shutout innings for his 24th win. Verlander is the
first AL pitcher with 24 wins in a season since Oakland’s Bob Welch won 27 games in 1990.  The Texas Rangers shut out the Seattle Mariners 3-0 to
maintain a 4 1/2-game lead in the AL West over the Los Angeles
Angels. The Angels beat the Baltimore Orioles 11-2.  The Milwaukee Brewers, who lead the National League Central
by 6 1/2 games, beat the Cincinnati Reds 8-1 as Prince Fielder
and Carlos Gomez hit first-inning homers. The second-place  St.
Louis Cardinals  won 5-0 against the Philadelphia Phillies.  The Arizona Diamondbacks lead the  San Francisco Giants  by
five games in the NL West after a 5-1 win against the  San Diego
Padres . The Atlanta Braves lost to the  New York  Mets 7-5 and
lead the Cardinals by 3 1/2 games for the NL wild card, which
goes to the division runner-up with the best record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
