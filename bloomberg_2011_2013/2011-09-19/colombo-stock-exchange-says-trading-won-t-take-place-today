Colombo Stock Exchange trading
won’t take place today as system recovery from a hardware
failure, shortly after the open auction, was taking “much
longer than expected”, according to a statement on its website.  All orders entered and trades executed today will not be
valid, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
