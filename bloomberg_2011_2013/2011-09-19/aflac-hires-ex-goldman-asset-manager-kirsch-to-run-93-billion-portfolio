Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the largest
supplemental health insurer, hired Eric Kirsch to oversee its
$93 billion portfolio after posting losses tied to investments
in banks from Greece Ireland and Portugal.  Kirsch was previously global head of insurance asset
management at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  where he oversaw about
$75 billion for clients. Kirsch will be Aflac’s chief investment
officer and work out of  New York , replacing Jeremy Jeffery who
will serve as senior vice president of fixed income, according
to a statement today from Columbus, Georgia-based Aflac.  Kirsch will review hiring outside firms to help manage as
much as 10 percent of the company’s portfolio. The insurer,
which gets most of its revenue in  Japan , was burned by
investments in European banks that issue debt in yen.  “Income-oriented investors face challenges in the current
interest rate environment,” Kirsch said in the statement. “I
believe that we can maintain a favorable risk profile to the
portfolio, while improving returns by exploring new, yet
appropriate asset classes.”  Kirsch joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2007 after
overseeing more than $100 billion at Deutsche Bank AG’s
insurance asset-management business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
