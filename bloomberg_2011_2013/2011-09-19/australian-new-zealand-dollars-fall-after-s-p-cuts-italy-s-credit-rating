The Australian dollar rose against
its U.S. counterpart after the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  said
it’s well positioned to respond to economic risks, damping
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  this year.  Australia’s dollar pared a loss of 4 percent this month
against the greenback as RBA policy makers failed to discuss
lowering the central bank’s 4.75 percent overnight cash rate
target, according to minutes of a Sept. 6 meeting released
today. New Zealand’s dollar erased earlier losses against the
U.S. currency as stocks gained.  “Going into the RBA minutes last night, people had
anticipated the central bank to turn a little more dovish,”
said  Kathy Lien , director of currency research with the online
trading firm GFT Forex in  New York . “The fact that they didn’t
caused a lot of people to reverse their short Aussie dollar
positions.” A short is a bet the price of an asset will fall.  Australia’s dollar strengthened 0.7 percent to $1.0293 at
10:53 a.m. in New York, from $1.0222 yesterday. It gained 0.5
percent to 78.71 yen, from 78.29. New Zealand’s currency,
nicknamed the kiwi, was little changed at 82.46 U.S. cents. It
fell 0.2 percent to 63.06 yen.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of equities rose 1 percent.  “A key question for members was the extent to which recent
global and domestic developments would reduce capacity pressures
in the economy and, in due course, help to contain inflation,”
the minutes released by the RBA in Sydney showed. “Members
considered that the current setting of monetary policy left the
board well placed to respond to evolving global and domestic
economic conditions.”  Traders last week forecast as much as 155 basis points, or
1.55 percentage points, of interest-rate cuts by the RBA in the
next 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index.
They pared bets to 143 basis points today.  The  International Monetary Fund  today cut its forecast for
global growth, saying the world economy will expand 4 percent
this year and next, compared with June forecasts of 4.3 percent
in 2011 and of 4.5 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
