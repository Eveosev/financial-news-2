A rare case of Romanee-Conti 1990
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy sold for HK$2.32 million
($297,400) in  Hong Kong , a price auction house  Acker, Merrall &
Condit  said set a world saleroom record for that vintage.  The wine was sold to a Hong Kong collector bidding by
telephone, and capped a two-day auction ended Sept. 17 attended
by 400 buyers in which HK$91.87 million went under the hammer.  Demand for top Burgundy comes as wine auction houses have
seen buying interest this year from Chinese collectors for
Bordeaux first-growth wines such as Chateau Lafite-Rothschild,
even as prices for investment wine have cooled amid global
volatility in stock and bond markets. Leading Burgundies are
produced in much lower volumes, and so can command higher prices
per bottle for the best vintages.  “This fall is going to be all about Burgundy,” said John Kapon, Acker’s chief executive officer, in an e-mailed statement
after the sale in  China ’s wine hub.  A similar 12-bottle case of Romanee-Conti 1990 DRC sold for
126,500 pounds ($201,900) at Bonhams in  London  on Sept. 8.  Acker said producer records for their vintages were also
set by a case of 1988 Romanee-Conti DRC, which fetched HK$1.17
million, and a 1990 Vosne Romanee Cros Parantoux Henri Jayer,
which sold for HK$732,000.  Among Bordeaux wines on sale, a case of La Mission Haut-
Brion 1961 fetched HK $463,600, a price Acker also said set a
new high at auction for the producer from that vintage. A
similar case with some bin-soiled labels sold at Christie’s
International in  New York  on April 9 for $36,000, almost 40
percent less than the price achieved in Hong Kong.  The Liv-ex 100 Index of Fine Wines fell 4 percent last
month after a 1.6 percent drop in July as global stock markets
tumbled amid the debt crisis in  Europe  and the deficit battle in
the  United States . The index is up 2.5 percent this year.  New York-based Acker has now sold a total of $45 million of
wine at its four sales in Hong Kong this year, and $70.35
million worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
