Saudi Arabia ’s gasoline and jet-
fuel imports reached a 10-month high in July even as local
refining rose, government data showed.  The kingdom, the world’s largest crude exporter, imported
96,000 barrels a day of gasoline and jet fuel in July, according
to a posting on the  website  of the Joint Organization Data
Initiative. That’s the highest level since last September.  Gasoline output from Saudi refineries was 361,000 barrels a
day, compared with 359,000 barrels in June, the data showed. The
data initiative is overseen by the Riyadh-based  International
Energy Forum , an organization that promotes discussions between
86 producing and consuming nations on international energy
security.  Domestic demand for fuel is rising after the Saudi
population grew 3.2 percent annually from 2004 to 2010,
according to government data.  Saudi Arabia has capacity to refine 2.12 million barrels a
day of crude, according to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will add 1.6 million
barrels a day in capacity by 2015 from new refineries with
partners such as Total SA and  China  Petroleum and Chemical
Corp., known as Sinopec.  The Saudi company, known as Saudi Aramco, will invest $125
billion on projects over five years as it seeks to boost
capacity to 6 million barrels a day by building refineries at
home and in China,  Vietnam  and  Indonesia , Chief Executive
Officer Khalid al-Falih said in a speech in  Seoul  on April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
