The developer of London’s  W Hotel ,
a site that includes the European flagship store of Mars Inc.’s
M&M’s, agreed to sell the property for about 200 million pounds
($313 million.)  McAleer & Rushe  said the 10-story building on Leicester
Square will be bought by an unnamed investor based in Qatar,
according to a statement today from the Cookstown, Northern
Ireland-based company.  McAleer & Rushe acquired the former site of the Swiss
Centre in 2004 from British Land Co. for 47 million pounds. The
developer  built  a 192-bedroom hotel, luxury apartments, a
restaurant, gymnasium and 35,000 square-foot (3,252 square-
meter) M&M’s store on the land.  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. and Steerforth Partners advised on
the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
