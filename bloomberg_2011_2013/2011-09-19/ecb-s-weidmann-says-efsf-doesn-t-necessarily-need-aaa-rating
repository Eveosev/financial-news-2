Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said the European Financial Stability Facility doesn’t
necessarily need a AAA rating.  Weidmann, who also sits on the European Central Bank’s
Governing Council, told a parliamentary committee in Berlin
today that that a lower  credit rating  would result in higher
 interest rates  on aid for distressed countries, increasing the
incentive for them to run sound fiscal policy.  “It would have been worth considering limiting the
guarantee extension by achieving the targeted maximum lending
volume through lowering excess collateralization or abstaining
from a complete refinancing of the EFSF with AAA conditions,”
Weidmann said. The result would be “a somewhat weaker credit
rating and higher refinancing costs of the EFSF, and hence also
higher interest rates for aid-receiving countries.”  European leaders on July 21 empowered the region’s 440-
billion euro ($600 billion) rescue fund to buy the debt of
distressed euro nations in the secondary market, aid troubled
banks and offer credit lines to repel speculators.  “These decisions are another big step toward a collective
liability and reduce the disciplining function of capital
markets without strengthening control and influence on national
fiscal policies in return,” Weidmann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
