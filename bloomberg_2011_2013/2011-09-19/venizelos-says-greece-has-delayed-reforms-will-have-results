Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the country has delayed implementing reforms
pledged to international partners and must move ahead to achieve
results by shutting down government agencies, tackling surplus
staff and selling state assets.  “We can’t move along without real implementation of fiscal
reforms and we are late,” Venizelos said at a conference in
 Athens  today. “We must reach end December with a cash balance
result that’s within fiscal targets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
