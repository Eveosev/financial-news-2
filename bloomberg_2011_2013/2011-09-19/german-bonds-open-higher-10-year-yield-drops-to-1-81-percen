German bunds rose for a second day
as European Union and International Monetary Fund officials
prepared to assess whether  Greece  can meet the conditions for
its rescue amid concern the nation will default.  Two-year German yields fell below 0.50 percent as the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slumped 2.1 percent, boosting the appeal of the
region’s safest assets. Spanish and Italian bonds dropped even
as the  European Central Bank  was said to be buying the
securities. Greek debt declined after  Sweden ’s Finance Minister
Anders Borg said the Mediterranean nation hasn’t done enough to
meet its budget targets.  “The negative news flow is underpinning bunds,” said
 David Schnautz , a London-based fixed-income strategist at
Commerzbank AG,  Germany ’s second-biggest lender. “I expect
bunds to remain firm.”  German 10-year bund yields declined six basis points to
1.80 percent at 4:371 p.m. in  London , after falling to a record
low 1.679 percent on Sept. 13. The 2.25 percent security due
September 2021 rose 0.585, or 5.85 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,362)
face amount, to 104.070. Two-year yields dropped five basis
points to 0.47 percent, the lowest since Sept. 12 based on
closing prices.  The EU and IMF are reviewing whether Greece can meet the
conditions of its rescue loans and is eligible for the next
payment due in October and for a second package. They suspended
their assessment earlier this month after discovering a
shortfall in the budget.  Greek Crisis  Greece is struggling to meet budget targets amid a
deepening recession. The economy will shrink 5.5 percent this
year and contract “notably” next year, Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said today at conference in  Athens . EU and
IMF inspectors are due to hold a teleconference with Venizelos
at 7 p.m. in Athens.  Euro-area leaders plan to decide on Oct. 3 whether to
approve the next aid payment for Greece from last year’s 110
billion-euro rescue, Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said
Sept. 16. Approval of the payment on Oct. 3 would allow the
money to reach Greece by Oct. 14, according to Fekter.  The delay “increases significantly the odds of a Greek
default, because Greece has already announced it will run out of
cash by mid-October,” Alessandro Giansanti, a senior strategist
at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam, wrote today in a note to clients.  Greek 10-year yields rose 1.83 percentage points to 23.02
percent, and two-year rates jumped 6.25 percentage points to
61.38 percent. The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to
hold 10-year Greek securities instead of their German
counterparts widened 1.90 percentage points to 21.22.  Default Swaps  The cost of insuring European sovereign debt rose. The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-default swaps
on 15 governments approached a record. Swaps signal a 94 percent
chance of a Greek default within five years, according to CMA.  Italy’s 10-year yield increased nine basis points to 5.60
percent and Spanish 10-year rates climbed six basis points to
5.35 percent.  The ECB, which started buying debt of the two countries
last month, purchased the securities today, according to three
people with knowledge of the transactions who asked not to be
identified because the deals are confidential. A spokesman for
the central bank declined to comment.  The ECB said today it settled 9.79 billion euros of bond
purchases in the week through Sept. 16, down from 14 billion
euros the previous week.  Seven-Day Deposits  The ECB will take seven-day term deposits from banks
tomorrow to absorb the 152.5 billion euros of liquidity created
since its bond-purchase program started on May 10, 2010, a
practice it employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel
inflation. Since its program began, the ECB had spent 143
billion through Sept. 9.  The difference in yield, or spread, between French bonds
and German bunds widened as investors favored the region’s
safest assets.  The French 10-year yield rose one basis point to 2.61
percent, after sliding 11 basis points on Sept. 16. French debt
yielded 82 basis points more than similar-maturity bunds,
compared with 74 basis points last week.  German  government bonds  have returned 7.6 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained
8.1 percent, and Greek bonds have tumbled 34 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
