Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)  Chief
Executive Officer Ed Breen said outside pressure wasn’t a factor
in the planned breakup of the company, a move about which
investors had often inquired.  “There really was no external factor, no activist
shareholders whatsoever in the mix,” said Breen, who is also
chairman. “You’ve never read about it because there wasn’t
any.”  Analysts and investors often asked whether the makeup of
the company should be altered during shareholder meetings, he
said.  “It’s kind of nice we were able to take our time, really
walk our way through it with our board and come to the right
conclusion.”  He declined to say whether suitors had approached Tyco
about acquiring the three businesses the Schaffhausen,
Switzerland-based company plans to separate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
