Ethanol futures dropped for a fifth
day as crude oil declined on speculation demand is waning, and
as corn rose.  Futures fell 0.2 percent as crude dropped on concern  Greece 
won’t qualify for enough financial aid for it to avoid default.
Corn advanced on signs of increasing demand from  China .
Shipments inspected for export to the country totaled 4.835
million bushels in the week ended Sept. 15, representing the
first deliveries to China since Aug. 25. Ethanol is made from
corn in the U.S. and blended with gasoline.  “It’s all outside-market related,” said  Terry Reilly , an
analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 0.4 cent to
$2.639 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 23 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago slumped 7 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $2.63 a gallon and on the West Coast the fuel
lost 6 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.875, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slid 5.5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.75
a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel decreased 5.5 cents,
or 1.9 percent, to $2775.  Corn futures for December delivery increased 0.25 cent to
$6.9225 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Oil for October delivery declined $2.26 to $85.70 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
Aug. 26. The futures have lost 6.2 percent this year.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in Iowa is making
12 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
Illinois is banking 15 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
