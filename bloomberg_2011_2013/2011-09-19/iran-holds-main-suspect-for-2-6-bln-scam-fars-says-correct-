Iranian police detained the main
suspect behind a $2.6 billion bank fraud, one of the biggest 
in the country’s history, the state-run  Fars   news agency  reported,
citing  Iran ’s economy and finance minister Shamseddin Hosseini.  Seven state-owned and private banks were linked to the case
that entailed the forging of documents to secure credit, which
was then used to purchase state-owned companies, the news agency
said, in a report published today without giving further
details.  Prosecutor-General Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei said
yesterday that 19 people, including the main suspect, had been
arrested, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
