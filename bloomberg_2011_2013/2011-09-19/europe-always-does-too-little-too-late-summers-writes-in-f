European authorities, in the past
two years, have repeatedly done just enough to avoid an imminent
collapse, while never doing enough to establish a basis for
renewed confidence, said  Lawrence Summers , a former U.S.
Treasury Secretary and now a professor at Harvard.  Writing in the Financial Times, Summers said that
authorities who assert, in the face of all the evidence, that
Greece can service all its debts on time will enjoy little
credibility when they claim that the fundamentals are sound in
Spain and Italy.  After European bank stress tests that treat assets as risk-
free when credit default swaps exceed 500 basis points, markets
can hardly be blamed when they ignore regulators’ assertions
about financial institutions’ solvency, he said.  It’s clear that market discipline within European monetary
union isn’t powerful and credible enough to guarantee sound
finance; there now has to be a simultaneous increase in the
central authorities’ commitment to the financial stability of
member-states and a reduction in the latter’s autonomy, if the
euro is to survive, Summers said.  Christine Lagarde , the managing director of the
 International Monetary Fund , was right to point out that the
doctrine of “expansionary fiscal contraction” is discredited
and  Europe  needs a growth strategy, he said.  While eventual deficit reductions are necessary, Europe can
cope with its debts and contribute to a stronger global economy
only if it grows, and that will require both fiscal and monetary
expansion, Summers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
