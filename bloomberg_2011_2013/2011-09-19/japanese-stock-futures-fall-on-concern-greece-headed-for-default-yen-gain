Japanese stocks fell, driving the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average down for the first time in three days,
after  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of  Italy ’s credit rating
reinforced concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on the region for 20 percent of
its sales, dropped 4.1 percent as a slide in the euro cut its
earnings outlook.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s
biggest lender by market value, declined 2.9 percent on concern
Europe’s debt crisis will spill into the banking system. Tokyo
Electric Power Co. plunged 8.1 percent after  Kyodo News  reported
the utility will shelve a plan to raise power rates.  The Nikkei 225 declined 1.6 percent to 8,721.24 at the 3
p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index dropped
1.7 percent to 755.04. Japan’s stock markets were closed
yesterday for a public holiday, when the MSCI Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Index slid 2.8 percent on concern  Greece  is
moving closer to default.  “The market is extremely jumpy,” said Koichi Kurose,
chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd. “Europe’s crisis
is looking like it may spread.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent
today after Italy had its sovereign debt rating cut on concern
weakening economic growth and a “fragile” government mean the
nation won’t be able to reduce the euro-region’s second-largest
debt burden. The rating was lowered to A from A+, with a
negative outlook, S&P said.  Greek Bailout  The  S&P 500  closed down 1 percent in  New York  yesterday,
paring losses in the final hour of trading as Greece said
discussions with European officials about the country’s bailout
were productive. Prime Minister George Papandreou’s government
will hold another call with its main creditors today  Losses in stocks may have been limited on speculation
 Federal Reserve  officials will propose new measures to support
the  U.S. economy  when the  Federal Open Market Committee 
completes a two-day meeting tomorrow. Central bank Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Sept. 8 that policy makers have measures at
hand and are “prepared to employ these tools as appropriate.”  “Asian investors will remain risk averse at this time, but
may find short-term comfort from the news that discussions are
continuing, and more so from the upcoming Fed meeting,” said
 Angus Gluskie , who manages more than $300 million at White Funds
Management in Sydney.  Exporters Fall  The Topix has declined about 16 percent this year amid
concern U.S. growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will
damage the banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s
biggest export markets. The decline has cut the price of shares
on the index to 0.91 times estimated book value, near the lowest
since March 2009.  Exporters fell as the yen rose to 104.15 per euro today
from 104.82 yesterday in New York. The currency touched 103.90
on Sept. 12, the strongest level since June 2001. A higher yen
hurts Japan’s exporters because it cuts the value of their
overseas income.  Sony dropped 4.1 percent to 1,514 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 1.8 percent to 2,685 yen.  Banks dropped after shares of financial companies slid
yesterday in Europe and the U.S.  Mitsubishi UFJ slid 2.9
percent to 335 yen, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.,
the country’s No. 2 lender, fell 2.8 percent to 2,121 yen.  Shipping companies declined the most among the 33 Topix
industry groups after the Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
shipping rates for commodities, fell 2.8 percent yesterday.  Tokyo Electric Plunges  Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s biggest shipping line by sales,
dropped 6 percent to 219 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the
second-largest, fell 6.2 percent to 320 yen.  Tokyo Electric, operator of the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant, plunged 8.1 percent to 308 yen after Kyodo
News reported government and public criticism persuaded the
utility to abandon a plan to raise electricity rates by as much
as 15 percent.  Among stocks that gained,  Japan  Tobacco Inc., a cigarette-
maker half-owned by the Japanese government, advanced 5.4
percent to 368,000 yen. The increased likelihood the government
will cut its stake in the company may mean management can raise
dividends, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
