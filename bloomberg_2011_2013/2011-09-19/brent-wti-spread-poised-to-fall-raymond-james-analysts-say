Brent oil’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate should narrow as access improves to inventories in
Cushing, Oklahoma, the largest crude-trading and storage hub in
the U.S., said analysts at  Raymond James  & Associates Inc.  Pipelines expediting the movement of stockpiles from
Cushing, the physical delivery point for New York Mercantile
Exchange oil futures contracts, will be finished by 2013 and the
Brent-WTI spread “should soon begin to shrink,” J. Marshall Adkins, Cory J. Garcia, Darren Horowitz and  Pavel Molchanov  of
Raymond James said today in a research note.  “With Cushing inventories falling and pipelines in the
works, it seems obvious to us that the WTI-Brent price spread is
poised to fall,” the analysts said.  The U.S. Energy Department said Sept. 14 that Cushing
inventories, including floating and fixed tanks, were 32.2
million barrels as of Sept. 9, a 10-month low. For the first
time, the spread widened as Cushing inventories declined because
of macroeconomic variables tied to the  U.S. dollar , global stock
markets and perceived oil demand in China, the analysts said.  “Longer term, we remain fundamentally bullish,” the
analysts said. “As the global economy rebounds over time, we
project higher highs and lower lows for  oil prices  over the long
run, though of course with continued volatility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
