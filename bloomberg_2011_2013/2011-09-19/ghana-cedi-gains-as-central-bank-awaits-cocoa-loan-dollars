Ghana ’s cedi strengthened for the
second day in eight against the dollar as the country’s central
bank awaited an influx of the U.S. currency from a $1.75 billion
trade-finance loan for next season’s cocoa purchases.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest grower of the
chocolate ingredient appreciated 0.4 percent to trade at 1.5575
per dollar by 2 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  The cocoa loan “will help provide liquidity in the foreign-
exchange market in this time that we know importers demand
dollars to prepare for end-of-year festivities,” Collins Antwi,
assistant director of the Bank of Ghana’s treasury department,
said by phone.  Ghana, which will reap its next cocoa crop between October
and September 2012, borrows money from international lenders
before the start of each harvest to fund purchases of beans from
farmers. The 2010-11 season, which ended on Sept. 8, reached at
least 1.015 million metric tons, the Ghana Cocoa Board said
Sept. 12.  The cedi had weakened as demand for the  U.S. dollar  grew
amid a shortage of the foreign currency. Jacob Brobbey, a trader
with the local unit of Barclays Bank Plc, said Sept. 15 the
central bank hadn’t sold dollars in four weeks. Biggles
Amponsah, a trader at Access Bank Plc, said the bank sold
dollars today, along with mining companies and non-governmental
organizations. He declined to say how much was offered.  Bank of Ghana’s Antwi declined to say whether the central
bank sold dollars. “We consistently monitor the  currency market 
and provide support when we see the need for it,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
