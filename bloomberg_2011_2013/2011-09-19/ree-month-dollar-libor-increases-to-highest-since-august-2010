The rate at which London-based
banks say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose for
the seventh-straight day, reaching the highest level since
August 2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans climbed to 0.35250 percent from 0.35133 percent at the end
of last week, according to data from the British Bankers’
Association. That’s the highest rate since Aug. 16, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was little changed at 28.25 basis points as of 12:16
p.m. in London, from 28.38 basis points on Sept. 16, the widest
since July 28, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, increased to
35.25 basis points, the most since July 2010, from 35.13 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
