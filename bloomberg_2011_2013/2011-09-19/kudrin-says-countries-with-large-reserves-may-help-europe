Countries with large international
reserves of currency and gold may be able to help  Europe  ease
its debt crisis, Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said.  “The question of additional help will be discussed,”
Kudrin told reporters today after a government meeting in
Moscow. “I think countries with major reserves can consider
such suggestions, with certain conditions.”  Russia already participates in programs to help debt-
straddled Europe, including through its contributions to the
 International Monetary Fund , Kudrin said. It has also “nearly
reached” agreement with Cyprus on a loan, he said, declining to
give the amount because the transaction hasn’t been concluded.  “We currently don’t have any fixed position,” on whether
BRIC countries should participate in a new effort to help
Europe, Kudrin said. “We’re going to work from the collective
estimation and analysis that we conduct” during meetings of G-
20 finance ministers and the IMF in  Washington  this week, he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
