Hungary ’s largest lender OTP Bank
Nyrt. and peer Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt. may profit from a
government plan forcing banks to swallow losses on foreign-
currency mortgages, DZ Bank said.  “The most exposed Hungarian banks, OTP and FHB, may
actually be compensated by longer-term benefits,” DZ Bank said
in an e-mailed report today. The two banks are “in a good
position to take a leading role in offering new forint credit
once the market settles” as their clientele is large enough and
after the government pledged to support them, the lender said.  Hungarian lawmakers are set to vote today on a proposal
offering foreign-currency mortgage holders the chance of early
repayment at a fixed exchange rate of 180 forint per Swiss franc
and 250 forint per euro, provided they took out their loans
below these levels. The proposal stipulates that all losses must
be assumed by banks.  The plan may cause a “major realignment” within the
banking industry as some lenders may even decide to quit the
market,  DZ Bank  said.  The forint fell 2.4 percent against the euro to 291.66 by
4:24 p.m. in Budapest, its weakest level in 14 months. OTP
declined 3.5 percent to 3,610 forint.  “We believe that arguments are markedly stronger against
the plan than in favor of it” as economic damages caused by a
deterioration of investor sentiment toward Hungary will outweigh
the long-term rise in household consumption, DZ Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
