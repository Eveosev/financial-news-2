The following is a roundup of
stories from the 2011 Rugby  World Cup  in  New Zealand .  Hook Injury  Wales’s goal-kicking full-back  James Hook  will likely miss
his team’s remaining World Cup Pool D games after injuring a
shoulder joint in yesterday’s 17-10 win over Samoa, assistant
coach Shaun Edwards said.  Hook suffered grade one or two injury to his
acromioclavicular joint, which “usually means two or three
weeks” out, Edwards said in comments distributed by tournament
organizers. Wales faces Namibia in New Plymouth on Sept. 26
before concluding its pool schedule against Fiji on Oct. 2.  Flanker Dan Lydiate will have further tests after rolling
his ankle in the game, Edwards added.  Irish Hamstrings  Pool C leader Ireland will wait until the end of the week
to decide on the fitness of second-rower Paul O’Connell and
center Gordon D’Arcy for its Sept. 25 game against  Russia .  O’Connell and D’Arcy underwent scans today which showed
they suffered hamstring strains during Ireland’s 15-6 victory
over Australia two days ago. The players will be monitored over
the coming days before the team to face the Bears is announced
on Sept. 23, tournament organizers said.  Japan  Rings Changes  Japan coach John Kirwan made  10 changes  to his starting
team for the second straight match for the Brave Blossoms’ third
Pool A game against Tonga in two days.  Fly-half James Arlidge, who scored 21 points in Japan’s
tournament opener against France, returns at fly half after
being rested for the 83-7 loss to New Zealand on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
