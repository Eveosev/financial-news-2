Germany  must be ready to offer aid
to  Greece  if it meets debt-reduction targets to head off the
risk the country’s debt crisis poses to other euro-area states,
chief German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.  “It’s our fundamental conviction that the Greek debt
problem may pose a threat to the entire euro zone and that
therefore Greece must be helped, under conditions,” Seibert
said at a regular government news briefing in Berlin today.  Greece’s progress toward meeting conditions needed to
receive its next bailout payment “is not a matter of analysis
by the German government,” he said. That ruling must be made by
inspectors of the European Union, the  European Central Bank  and
the  International Monetary Fund , Seibert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
