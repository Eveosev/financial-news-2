Some emerging nations are seeking
an “escape hatch” on climate-protection measures because they
want their commitments to be dependent on finance and technology
support, said a U.S. climate envoy.  The U.S. was not prepared to enter into a climate-
protection agreement where some nations could make commitments
to curb emissions of  greenhouse gases  only if they receive the
support from developed nations, Todd Stern, who leads the U.S.
climate delegation, said today on a call with reporters.
“That’s what I mean when I say no escape hatches.”  The U.S. wants to change the basis of negotiations, which
have put developed nations against developing countries, he
said.  China ’s emissions are projected to be double those of the
U.S. by 2020, he said. The United Nations is planning its annual
conference in Durban,  South Africa , in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
