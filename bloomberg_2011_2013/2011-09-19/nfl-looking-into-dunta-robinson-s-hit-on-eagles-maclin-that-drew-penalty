The  National Football League  is
looking into a helmet-to-helmet hit by Atlanta Falcons
cornerback Dunta Robinson on Philadelphia Eagles receiver Jeremy Maclin last night for possible disciplinary action, league
spokesman  Greg Aiello  said.  “We review every play of every game for various reasons,
and any play of the nature of Robinson’s hit last night is going
to be reviewed for potential discipline,” Aiello said in an e-
mail.  Robinson, 29, was fined $50,000 for a similar collision
last year, after the cornerback left his feet and made a helmet-
to-helmet hit on Eagles receiver DeSean Jackson. The fine was
later reduced to $25,000.  Maclin caught a 17-yard pass over the middle from  Michael Vick  with less than seven minutes remaining in the third quarter
of the Falcons’ 35-31 victory last night. Robinson jumped to
make the tackle and hit Maclin with the crown of his helmet.  Robinson received a 15-yard personal foul on the play.
Maclin was slow to rise and stayed in the game.  To contact the reporters on this story:
