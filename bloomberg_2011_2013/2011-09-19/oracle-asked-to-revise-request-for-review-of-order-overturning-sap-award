Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  was asked by a federal
judge to consider revising its request to seek review of a court
order overturning a $1.3 billion damage award against SAP AG,
according to court records.  U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland,
California, on Sept. 1 granted SAP’s motion to throw out the
copyright-infringement verdict against it. She ruled that SAP
should get a new trial for damages if Oracle rejects her
decision to reduce the amount to $272 million, which she said
should be the maximum in damages based on the evidence at trial.  The jury award in November was a record for copyright
infringement. In the 11-day trial, Oracle accused SAP’s
TomorrowNow software-maintenance unit of making hundreds of
thousands of illegal downloads and several thousand copies of
Oracle’s software. Oracle said SAP’s aim was allegedly to avoid
paying licensing fees and to steal customers.  The case is Oracle Corp. v.  SAP AG (SAP) , 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
