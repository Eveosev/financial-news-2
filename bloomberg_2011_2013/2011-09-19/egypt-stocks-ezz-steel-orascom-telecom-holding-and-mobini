Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
climbed 1.9 percent, the most in more than a month, to 4,409.32
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The following shares rose or fell. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Ezz Steel (ESRS)   declined 3.7 percent to 6.77 Egyptian
pounds, the lowest level since February 2009. Egypt’s government
will require the country’s biggest publicly traded manufacturer
of the metal to pay 660 million pounds ($111 million) to allow
it to keep production licenses withdrawn by a court order last
week, Al Mal reported. Kamel Galal, Ezz’s head of  investor
relations , said the company is negotiating with the government.  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)   surged 7.2 percent,
the most since March 27, to 3.44 pounds. The Algeria unit of
North Africa’s biggest mobile-network operator has reportedly
been independently valued at $7 billion, said Ashraf Akhnoukh,
senior equity sales trader at Commercial International
Brokerage. The figure is about twice the amount the Algerian
government has said it wanted to pay.  Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services (EMOB EY), the country’s
second-biggest mobile-phone company by subscribers, climbed 8.6
percent to 96.07 pounds, the biggest gain since March 28. The
Djezzy valuation “may be raising valuations for telecom
companies across the region,” said Tamer Nigm, head of sales
and trading at Cairo-based Watheeqa Securities Brokerage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
