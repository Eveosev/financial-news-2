A drunken navigator was one of the
reasons a Tupolev-134 airplane crashed in northern  Russia  in
June, killing more than 40 passengers and crew, state
investigators said.  The navigator was “in a slight degree of alcoholic
intoxication” when the airplane crashed shortly before landing
in Petrozavodsk on June 20, the Interstate Aviation Committee in
Moscow said today in a statement on its website.  The number of air accidents in Russia in the first seven
months of this year soared 60 percent to 24 and the number of
fatalities jumped nine-fold to 72, Federal Statistics Service
data show. A chartered Yakovlev-42 plane carrying Russia’s
Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team crashed during takeoff on Sept.
7, resulting in the deaths of all bar one of the 45 crew and
passengers on board.  To contact the reporters on this story:
