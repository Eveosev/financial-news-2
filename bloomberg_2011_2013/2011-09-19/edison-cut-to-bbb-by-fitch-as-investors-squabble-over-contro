Edison SpA (EDN) ’s credit assessment was
cut to “BBB-” from “BBB” by  Fitch Ratings  after shareholders
delayed talks over proposals for Electricite de France SA to
take control of  Italy ’s second-biggest power company.  Long-term issuer default and senior unsecured ratings were
lowered, Fitch said in a note today. All of Milan-based Edison’s
ratings are being reviewed for possible downgrade, it said.  “Edison’s operating and financial performance is likely to
deteriorate further due to the protracted operational limbo and
lack of strategic and managerial direction,” Fitch said.  The generator postponed the deadline for its shareholders’
agreement for a second time, to the end of October. Negotiations
between Italian shareholders and EDF have slowed since an accord
reached in March was held up amid squabbling among the Italian
investors and government opposition to a foreign takeover.  Italian Industry Minister Paolo Romani and EDF Chairman
 Henri Proglio  have “a common intent to reach a positive
agreement,” they said in a Sept. 5 statement.  Delays “suggest that even if an agreement is reached by
the end of October, the execution of Edison’s restructuring will
likely last well into 2012,” Fitch said. Further delays in
talks would “put further pressure on Edison’s credit metrics
and liquidity management,” according to the ratings company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
