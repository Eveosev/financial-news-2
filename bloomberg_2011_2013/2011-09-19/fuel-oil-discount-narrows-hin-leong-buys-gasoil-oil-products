Fuel oil ’s discount in  Asia  to
crude shrank to the narrowest level since March 2010. Hin Leong
Trading Pte bought gasoil cargoes for a fourth day in Singapore,
the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian benchmark Dubai crude narrowed
$1.90 to $3.85 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the
smallest gap since March 10, 2010, meaning refiners lose less
money when they turn crude into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
gained 50 cents to $9.50 a metric ton, PVM said. A widening
viscosity spread means bunker, or marine fuel, has increased
less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil, or diesel, in
 Singapore  from Royal Dutch Shell Plc, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts
window. This brought its purchases since Sept. 14 to at least
eight cargoes totaling 1.23 million barrels. The Singapore
trader paid 40 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, a reduced
premium from 50 cents in the previous transaction.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose 36 cents to $17.15 a
barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM data. This
crack spread is a measure of refining profit.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rebounded 5 cents to $1.45 a
barrel, PVM data showed. This regrade narrowed for a third week
last week, indicating it was less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha was little changed at $18.30
a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
reforming margin has widened 6.1 percent from the end of August,
signaling it is profitable to make motor fuel over naphtha, a
petrochemical feedstock.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, or
the crack spread, was at $127.71 a ton at 5:35 p.m. Singapore
time, based on Bloomberg data. It was at $127.56 a ton at the
end of trading in Asia on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
