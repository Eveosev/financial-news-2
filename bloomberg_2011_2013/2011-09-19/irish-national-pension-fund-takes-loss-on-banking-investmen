Ireland’s National Pension Reserve
Fund lost a third of its investment in the country’s two biggest
banks last year, a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General
showed.  The Dublin-based fund took a 3.7 billion euro impairment
loss on the 11.35 billion euro investment on  Allied Irish Banks
Plc (ALBK)  and Bank of Ireland Plc.  “In 2011, the value of the directed investments has been
further impaired,” the Comptroller said. “By the end of July,
the value of ordinary shares held as part of the investments had
fallen from the end-December 2010 values by 67 percent (Allied
Irish Banks plc) and 72 percent (Bank of Ireland).”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
