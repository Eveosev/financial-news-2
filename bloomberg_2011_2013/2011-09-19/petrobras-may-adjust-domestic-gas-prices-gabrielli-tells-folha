Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-run oil producer, will adjust domestic gasoline prices in
the long term if oil remains at current levels, Chief Executive
Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli told Folha de S.Paulo.  He said gasoline prices in Brazil are currently below
international average levels, according to the newspaper.  Petrobras’s shares have been affected by the company’s
capital increase in 2010, Gabrielli told Folha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
