Anhanguera Educacional
Participacoes SA (AEDU3) ,  Brazil ’s largest education company by market
value, agreed to buy three rivals for 510.6 million reais
($294.6 million) as it taps into Brazil’s fast-growing education
sector.  Anhanguera bought three companies that own four Brazilian
colleges: Academia Paulista Anchieta Ltda., Uniao Pan-Americana
de ensino S/C Ltda. and Uniao Bandeirante de Educacao Ltda.,
according to a regulatory filing.  Valinhos, Brazil-based Anhanguera has been growing through
acquisitions as it rides a surge of Brazil’s middle class and
near-full employment in  Latin America ’s biggest economy. At
least 36 million people in the country of 190 million have risen
from poverty since 2003, President  Dilma Rousseff  said on June
6. Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to 6 percent in July, its
lowest level this year.  Anhanguera in April bought Guarulhos-based Faculdades
Integradas Torricelli for 39 million reais after raising 844.1
million reais in a share sale in December.  Its shares have lost 38 percent so far this year to trade
at 24.82 reais as of Sept. 16, underperforming the benchmark
Bovespa index’s 17.5 percent drop in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
