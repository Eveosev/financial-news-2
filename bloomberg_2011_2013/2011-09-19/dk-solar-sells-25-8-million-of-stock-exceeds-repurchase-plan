LDK Solar Co.,  China â€™s second-
largest maker of solar wafers, sold $25.8 million of ordinary
shares in a private placement.  The Xinyu City, China-based company sold 4.37 million
shares at an average price of $5.90, the company said in a
filing. The proceeds will be used for corporate purposes and to
compensate for spending too much on repurchasing its American
depositary receipts.  LDK Solar repurchased $110 million worth of its ADRs
between July 11 and Aug. 26, at an average price of $5.90, the
company said. That exceeded the amount the company was
authorized to spend by $12.8 million, according to the filing.  The ADRs dropped 40 cents, or 8 percent, to $4.60 at 10:54
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most
intraday since Sept. 6. Chinese solar companies including
JinkoSolar Holding Co., dropped today after JinkoSolar said it
closed a plant that may have polluted a river.  To contact the reporter on this story:
