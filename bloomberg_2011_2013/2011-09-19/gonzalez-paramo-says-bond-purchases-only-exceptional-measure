European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said the bank’s
purchases of government bonds are an “exceptional” measure and
could have been avoided with a stricter fiscal framework.  “These types of unconventional interventions can only be
seen as exceptional measures which would not have been necessary
in the presence of appropriate institutional arrangements and
credible rules for fiscal authorities,” Gonzalez-Paramo said in
a speech in  Frankfurt  today. “In light of the current crisis,
the next major challenge for the European Union will be to
design rules that are at the same time credible, effective and
enforceable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
