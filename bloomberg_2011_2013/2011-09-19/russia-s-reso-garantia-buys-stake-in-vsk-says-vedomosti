Russian insurer Reso-Garantia,
partly-owned by  France ’s AXA SA, agreed to buy a blocking stake
in domestic rival VSK, Vedomosti reported, citing the two
companies’ main owners.  The 25 percent plus one share stake cost $250 million, the
Moscow-based newspaper reported, citing a banker familiar with
the deal. Reso-Garantia may buy full control of VSK for another
$750 million, Vedomosti said, citing the same person.  To contact reporter on this story:
