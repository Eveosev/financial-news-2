Total SA (FP)  is seeking new business
opportunities in  Libya  as the country seeks to develop its oil
and gas industry,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview
with Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie.  Total could develop the liquified gas business in Libya or
help national oil and gas companies to tap reserves in a more
aggressive and structured way, De Margerie told the German
newspaper.  Total’s production sites in Libya are in “good condition
despite the conflict” and the company expects to restart
operations “very fast,” he said, according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
