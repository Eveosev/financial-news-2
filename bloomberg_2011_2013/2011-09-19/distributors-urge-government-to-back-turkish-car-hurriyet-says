The head of  Turkey ’s Automotive
Distributors’ Association called on the government to support
the development of a local car brand, Hurriyet newspaper
reported.  The government uses cheap credits to enable poor families
to buy homes built by the state-run developer Toki, Mustafa Bayraktar said in  Frankfurt , according to the newspaper. A
similar model could be used to support the development of a
small car for families that aren’t able to buy without financial
help, he said.  Turkey’s car industry would be able to make a small vehicle
that could sell for less than 20,000 liras ($11,200), Bayraktar
said, according to Hurriyet.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
