The International Monetary Fund’s
representative for  Greece  Bob Traa said there is foreign
interest in Greece’s state asset sales program.  “A lot of money is looking at Greece,” Traa said at a
conference in  Athens  today. “The privatizations program isn’t
just structural reform but also a way to bring in foreign direct
investment to get liquidity and capital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
