More than 50 of the most popular
New York  restaurants , including  Gramercy Tavern  and  Le
Bernardin , will be reviewed to determine if they are complying
with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said in an
e-mailed statement that his office will inspect New York City
restaurants voted “most popular” in the 2011  Zagat  guide.  “In New York city, arguably the restaurant capital of the
world, no one should be unfairly deprived of the opportunity to
enjoy the City’s world class dining offerings, and we will take
all reasonable legal steps to make sure they are not,” Bharara
said.  Spokesmen for Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns
Gramercy Tavern and other  Manhattan  restaurants, and Le
Bernardin didn’t immediately return phone calls seeking comment
on the review.  If inspectors discover violations, the establishment will
be asked to enter a voluntary compliance agreement, under which
it promises to upgrade its facilities, according to the
statement. If the restaurant refuses to enter an agreement or if
it fails to make improvements, it could face legal action by the
civil-rights unit of the U.S. Attorney’s office, according to
the statement. The restaurant initiative follows a review of
more than 50 Manhattan hotels that resulted in 33 voluntary
compliance agreements, Bharara said.  Union Square Cafe ,  Daniel  and  Nobu  are among the
restaurants listed by Zagat on its website as most popular in
Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
