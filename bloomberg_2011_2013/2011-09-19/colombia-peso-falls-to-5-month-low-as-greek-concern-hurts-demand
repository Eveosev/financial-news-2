Colombia’s peso fell to a five-
month low as concern  Greece ’s debt crisis is worsening hurt
appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso dropped 0.9 percent to 1,837.59 per dollar at
10:16 a.m. New York time, from 1,821.41 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,840.2, its weakest intraday level since April 19.  Greece’s ability to avoid default hangs in the balance as
international monitors prepare to assess whether Prime Minister
George Papandreou can meet the conditions of rescue loans.
European Union and International Monetary Fund inspectors hold a
teleconference today at 12 p.m. New York time with Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos, to judge whether the government is
eligible for an aid payment due next month and is on track for a
second rescue package approved by EU leaders July 21.  “The peso is responding to rising fears of a Greek
default,” said Jose Luis Alayon, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Acciones y Valores SA.  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent benchmark bonds due in
July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.33 percent. The bond’s price rose 0.177 centavo to 121.695
centavos per peso.  Colombia will carry out a  debt  swap tomorrow, buying back
as much as 39.5 trillion pesos ($21 billion) of peso securities
due April 2012, August 2012, April 2013, November 2013 and May
2014. The government will offer in return peso debt due October
2015, October 2018 and new bonds maturing August 2026.  To contact the reporter on this story:
