European central banks have added
0.8 of a metric ton of gold to their reserves so far this year,
according to  European Central Bank  and International Monetary
Fund figures, the Financial Times reported.  Itâ€™s the first time the banks have been net buyers of the
metal in more than 20 years and compares with average sales of
almost 400 tons a year since 1999, the newspaper said.  Mexico, Russia,  South Korea  and Thailand have also made
large purchases, as an alternative to the U.S. dollar, and
central banks globally are likely to buy more gold this year
than at any time since the end of the Bretton Woods system more
than 40 years ago, the FT said.  The change of course by central banks has helped to push
the gold price up more than 25 percent this year, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
