Chicago ’s Wrigley Building was sold
to a group of investors that include founders of online coupon
provider Groupon Inc.  Eric Lefkofsky, chairman of Chicago-based Groupon, and Brad Keywell, a co-founder of the company, along with BDT Capital
Partners and Zeller Realty Group bought the building for an
undisclosed sum from Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. The sale includes an
adjoining 1.5-acre (0.6-hectare) lot, Wrigley said in a
statement today. The 460,000-square-foot (43,000-square-meter)
Wrigley Building will keep its name.  “We are committed to the success and redevelopment of this
architectural treasure to ensure that it remains a vital part of
Chicago’s future economic progress,” Byron Trott, managing
partner and chief investment officer at BDT, said in the
statement.  Wrigley will lease space at the Michigan Avenue building
through the end of 2012 while it relocates its headquarters to
its campus on Goose Island in Chicago. Groupon has no
“immediate plans” to relocate to the Wrigley Building,
according to the statement.  Excavation of the two-tower property, whose architectural
shape is modeled after the Seville Cathedral’s Giralda Tower in
 Spain , began in 1920, according to the Wrigley Building  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
