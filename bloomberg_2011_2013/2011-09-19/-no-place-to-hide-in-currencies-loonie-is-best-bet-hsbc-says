Investors have “no place to hide”
in the  currency markets  as traditional havens such as the yen
and Swiss franc are closed off and alternatives fail to
convince, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  The appeal of the yen has been reduced after Japanese
officials said they will intervene to curb their currency’s
strength. The  Swiss National Bank  imposed a ceiling on the franc
against the euro earlier this month. Canada’s dollar is the
“next best option” based on inflation control, public finances
and current-account performance,  David Bloom , global head of
currency strategy, wrote today in a note to clients.  “The Canadian dollar does appear to come out on top but
only because of the issues facing the other currencies,” Bloom
wrote in the note. “The case for it is far from overwhelming.
The conclusion has to be that, in the foreign-exchange market,
there is no place to hide, and there will probably be further
upward pressure on the price of gold.”  The so-called loonie weakened 1.3 percent to 99.05 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 5.18 p.m. in London.  Canada’s dollar has strengthened 4.1 percent in the past
month among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has risen 4.1
percent, and the franc has weakened 8.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
