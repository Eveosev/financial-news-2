    Greece  should push through
structural reforms as well as lower tax rates to increase
spending by Greek consumers,  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  Chairman
Vassilios Rapanos said.  “The recession has been caused to a large extent by the
efforts for fiscal consolidation and the only way to
counterbalance this is to reduce tax rates and boost
consumption,” Rapanos said at a conference in Athens today. He
reiterated that the Greek banking sector is resilient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
