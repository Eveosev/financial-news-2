The Senate agreed to limit debate
on a trade-preferences program, a step toward clearing the way
for President  Barack Obama  to send Congress three stalled free-
trade agreements.  The procedural move was approved today 84-8. Senator  Harry Reid  of  Nevada , the Democratic leader, had scheduled the vote as
the first in a series of actions to renew tariff preferences on
goods from developing nations and extend a program that helps
workers who lose their jobs to overseas competition. Passing the
aid, known as Trade Adjustment Assistance, would meet a
condition Obama set for sending the trade deals to Congress.  Trade accords with  South Korea , Colombia and Panama have
stalled over disagreements tied to extending the worker aid. As
a first step to end the stalemate, the U.S. House on Sept. 7
voted to renew the Generalized System of Preferences, which
expired last year. The Senate, when it takes up the tariff
measure, will add the trade adjustment extension.  “This is the first step in a fairly long process to get
TAA and the FTAs all passed and signed into law,” Greg Mastel,
a lobbyist and former chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee
Chairman  Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat, said in an interview.
“The sequencing is complicated, and if any step were to break
down the whole process would be in danger. There’s a fair amount
of optimism the consensus is there to make this happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
