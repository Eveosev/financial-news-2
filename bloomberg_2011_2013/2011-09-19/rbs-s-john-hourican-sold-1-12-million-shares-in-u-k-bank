John Hourican, investment-banking
head at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , Britain’s biggest
government-controlled bank, sold 99 percent of his holding in
the lender.  Hourican disposed of the shares at 24.25 pence apiece on
Sept. 16, valuing the sale at 272,412 pounds ($426,324), the
Edinburgh-based bank said today in a statement. That leaves
Hourican with 9,063 shares, worth about 2,198 pounds.  The bank, which will have to insulate its consumer bank
from its investment bank under proposals announced by the
government-appointed Independent Commission on Banking on Sept.
12, said in August it would cut about 2,000 jobs.  A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
