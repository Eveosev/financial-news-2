Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 8.1 percent at an auction on Sept. 15 after supplies of the
beans increased, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for the benchmark Arabica AA dropped to
$322.05 per 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $350.51 at the
previous sale on Sept. 2, the board said today by e-mail from
Moshi, in northern Tanzania.  The grade sold for as much as $335.80 a bag, compared with
$357.40 at the previous sale, while supplies surged 79 percent
to 1,573 bags, it said.  Total supplies at the third auction of the 2011-12 season
more than doubled to 18,478 60-kilogram bags, from 6,289 bags at
the previous sale, the board said. Tanzania costs its coffee in
terms of 50 kilograms, while offers and sales are in terms of 60
kilograms.  Sales of the beans at the auction more than doubled to
18,432 bags, from 6,289 bags as buyers replenished their stocks
amid reports of lower yields, the board said. Output in the 12
months through June 2012 may fall 20 percent to 45,000 metric
tons from 56,247 tons last season after a drought reduced the
crop, Adolph Kumburu, the agency’s chief executive officer, said
on July 14.  Tanzania reaps its crop from April through August. Arabica
accounts for 75 percent of the country’s output, while robusta
accounts for the rest.  The following are details of Sept. 15 auction in U.S.
