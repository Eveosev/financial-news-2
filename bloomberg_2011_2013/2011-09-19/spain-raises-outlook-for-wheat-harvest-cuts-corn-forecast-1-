(Corrects durum wheat forecast in sixth paragraph.)  Spain  raised the outlook for the
country’s wheat harvest this year on increased yields and cut
its estimate for corn production.  Wheat output will rise 15 percent to 6.69 million metric
tons from 5.84 million tons a year earlier, and compared with a
August forecast of 6.53 million tons, the Agriculture Ministry
said in a  report  on its website today.  Spanish winter grains benefited from favorable winter and
spring conditions that boosted yields, with abundant rainfall
and relatively high temperatures, the European Union’s crop-
monitoring unit  reported in July .  “The production estimate for winter cereals is higher
than the previous campaign, whereas the surface declines,” the
ministry said.  Soft-wheat production will rise 17 percent to 5.72 million
tons from 4.89 million tons a year earlier, based on the
situation as of July 31, beating the 13 percent increase
previously expected, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Production of durum wheat, the hard variety used to make
pasta, will increase 1.6 percent to 967,100 tons as increased
productivity more than compensates for an 18 percent drop in
planting, government data show.  Spanish corn production will advance 13 percent to 3.71
million tons, compared with a previous forecast of 3.84 million
tons, the ministry said. The barley harvest is forecast to
climb 3.9 percent to 8.48 million tons, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
