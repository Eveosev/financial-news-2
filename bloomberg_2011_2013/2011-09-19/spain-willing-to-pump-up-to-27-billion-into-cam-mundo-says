Spain ’s banks rescue fund may cover
as much as 20 billion euros ($27.2 billion) of potential losses
at  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) ,  El Mundo  reported, citing
sale documents sent to potential buyers by the nation’s central
bank.  The cash injection would be through a so-called “asset
protection” program, which would protect the new owner of the
bank from losses due deterioration of asset value or defaults,
El Mundo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
