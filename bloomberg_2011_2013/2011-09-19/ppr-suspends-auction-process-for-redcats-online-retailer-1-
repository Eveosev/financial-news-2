PPR (PP)  SA, the French owner of luxury
brands such as Gucci, suspended a sale process for its Redcats
online retail business as the deepening European sovereign debt
crisis squeezes finances.  The sale isn’t canceled, Paul Michon, a spokesman for
Paris-based PPR, said today. Redcats, which sells home
furnishings as well as fashions, had initially attracted
interest from buyout firms including TPG Capital, BC Partners
Ltd. and CVC Capital Partners Ltd., people with knowledge of the
matter said in July.  PPR is shelving the sale partly because the sovereign debt
crisis has made it harder for buyout firms to borrow, said two
people familiar with the process. That could have weighed down
the price prospective bidders were willing to pay, said the
people, who declined to be identified as the deliberations were
private.  The deadline for indicative bids was Sept. 21, the people
said. Some buyout firms have had a harder time raising debt
financing to fund takeovers as investors stopped buying high
yield bonds, with companies raising the least amount of
leveraged loans last month since 2008.  Redcats’s brands include La Redoute and OneStop Plus. PPR
fell 2.95 euros, or 2.6 percent, to 110.60 euros today in Paris
trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
