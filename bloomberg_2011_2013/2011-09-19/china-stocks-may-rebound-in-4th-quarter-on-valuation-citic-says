China’s stocks may rebound in the
fourth quarter as current valuations have mostly priced in
negative factors and as inflation eases, according to Citic
Securities Co.  The Shanghai Composite Index may trade between 2,400 and
2,800 in the period and the government may “fine-tune”
tightening policies in November or December, analysts led by Xi
Feng at Citic Securities wrote in a report today.  The brokerage recommends low-valuation financial stocks and
companies in new emerging industries, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
