Sales at major South Korean
department stores rose 8.3 percent in August from a year earlier,
the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.  That compares with an 8.5 percent increase in outlays at
the three biggest chains in July. Discount-store sales rose 2
percent in August from a year earlier, after a 4.9 percent gain
in July, today’s report showed.  Spending growth at major department stores has moderated
from a record 24 percent pace in January, as elevated inflation
and higher  interest rates  curb purchasing power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
