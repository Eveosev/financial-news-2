Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said he’s critical of the  European Central Bank ’s bond
purchases.  “Secondary market purchases by the central bank have to be
judged very critically,” Weidmann, who also sits on the ECB’s
Governing Council, told a parliamentary committee in Berlin
today. He said the purchases risk crowding out private investors
and also blur the line between monetary and fiscal policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
