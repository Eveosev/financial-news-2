Gulf Coast  diesel fuel strengthened
after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut a crude unit at its McKee
refinery in Texas.  The company is working to start the unit, one of two crude
units at the plant, after it was shut yesterday for repairs,
 Bill Day , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. A
hydrocracker, hydrotreater and reformer, shut during the repairs
to the crude unit, will also be started after the crude unit is
running, he said.  The differential for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf
Coast versus New York Mercantile Exchange heating oil futures
rose 0.75 cent to a premium of 0.25 cent a gallon at 1:37 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
6.32 cents to $2.9407 a gallon.  Valero also released emissions yesterday at its Memphis
refinery in  Tennessee  because of a pump failure, Day said.
Production was not affected, he said.  The 195,000-barrel-a-day Memphis plant is more of a Gulf
refinery, though also supplies the Chicago hub, said Lewis Adam,
president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in Kansas
City.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago  narrowed 0.75 cent to 1 cent a gallon versus Nymex
gasoline futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
