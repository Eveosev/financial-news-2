Investors should buy shares of Thai
retailers because an increase in consumer spending will boost
their earnings, according to BBL Asset Management Co.  The Thai government’s plan to raise wages and spending will
stimulate domestic consumption, said Peerapong Jirasevijinda,
BBL Asset’s deputy managing director.  “The global economic slowdown has little impact on
domestic retailers,” Peerapong said at an investment conference
today in Bangkok.  BBL Asset, which oversees about $4.9 billion of
investments, is a unit of Bangkok Bank Pcl, the nation’s largest
lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
