Ferrostaal may reduce penalties
related to bribery allegations by half,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing unidentified people close to the negotiations with Munich
prosecutors.  The company, which is jointly owned by Abu Dhabi-based
International Petroleum Investment Co. and Munich-based  MAN SE (MAN) ,
was due to pay 277 million euros ($378 million) in fines, the
newspaper said. As part of the deal, two managers would have to
plead guilty on several counts, Handelsblatt reported.  Maria Lahaye-Geusen, a spokeswoman for Essen, Germany-based
Ferrostaal, didnâ€™t immediately answer a voicemail message
seeking comment outside business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
