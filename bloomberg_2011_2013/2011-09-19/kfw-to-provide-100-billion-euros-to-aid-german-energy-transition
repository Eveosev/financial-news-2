Germany ’s state-owned lender  KfW
Group  will provide more than 100 billion euros ($137 billion)
over the next five years to ease the country’s transition from
nuclear power to renewable-energy generation.  KfW will boost loans and guarantees for solar plants and
wind farms and set up low-interest lending programs for building
efficiency, regional power-grid growth, energy-storage projects
and clean fossil fuel-fired generators, it said today.  The funds will contribute to the “immense investment
needed” to realize the energy transition, Chief Executive
Officer  Ulrich Schroeder  said in an e-mailed statement.  Europe ’s biggest energy market got a record 20.8 percent of
its power from renewable sources in the first half of the year,
according to the country’s BDEW utility association.  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  plans to boost the figure to at least 35 percent
by 2020 and build fossil fuel-fired generators to make up for
lost capacity after Germany shut more than 25 percent of its
nuclear capacity in March and plans a complete exit by 2022.  KfW provided about 23 billion euros for energy projects in
2010, helping fund about 80 percent of  wind turbines  and 40
percent of solar panels installed in Germany. Turbine producers
including  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Nordex SE (NDX1) , and producers of solar
photovoltaic equipment such as Q-Cells and  Solarworld AG (SWV)  have
previously benefited from lending by the German state lender.  KfW will boost loans from 2012 under its standard renewable
energy program to 25 million euros from 10 million euros to fund
larger onshore wind farms, it said. Germany needs investment of
about 250 billion euros this decade for the transition, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
