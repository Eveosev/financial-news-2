Mali  is conducting a study on the
construction of an international airport in the eastern region
of Kidal,  National Radio of Mali  reported, citing Transport
Minister Hamed Diane Semega.  No further information was provided, the Bamako-based
state-owned broadcaster said. Kidal is situated about 1,200
kilometers (743 miles) northeast of the capital, Bamako.  The West African country recently completed an 8.8 billion-
CFA-franc ($18.2 million) upgrade of the Kayes Dag Dag airport,
about 480 kilometers northwest of Bamako, the broadcaster said.
The facility is now able to receive Boeing Co. 747-type
aircraft, after its runway was extended and widened, it said.  To contact the report on this story:
