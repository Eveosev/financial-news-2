Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  paid over 1 million
pounds ($1.57 million) to buy the silence of a female executive
unfairly passed over for the job of managing director for the
software company’s U.K. operations, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported, citing unidentified people at Microsoft.  Natalie Ayres worked at Microsoft for 15 years and was
widely tipped to become U.K. managing director in 2006; her
interview process was still under way when Microsft named Gordon
Frazer, general manager of Microsoft South Africa, to the post,
the newspaper said.  Ayres received a seven-figure payoff when she left at the
end of 2006; Microsoft said it didn’t comment on individual
employees and placed great importance on the core values of
diversity, the Telegraph reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
