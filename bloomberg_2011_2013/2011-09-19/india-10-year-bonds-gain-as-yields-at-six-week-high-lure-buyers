India ’s 10-year bonds advanced on
speculation yields near the highest level in six weeks will
attract investors.  Yields rose five basis points last week as the  Reserve Bank
of India  raised the repurchase rate by a quarter of a percentage
point to 8.25 percent on Sept. 16. The central bank, which has
boosted borrowing costs 12 times since the start of 2010, is
almost near the end of its interest-rate increase cycle, said
R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed-income and currencies at
 State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur.  “Probably these are good levels to buy if you are going to
hold long term,” said Mumbai-based Chauhan. “The broad
expectation is that bond yields will slide by December.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.33 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate was at 8.36 percent on Sept. 16, the
highest level since Aug. 4.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has raised
rates by a total of 350 basis points from March last year, the
fastest round of increases since the Reserve Bank was
established in 1935, Bloomberg data show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell two basis points to 7.94 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
