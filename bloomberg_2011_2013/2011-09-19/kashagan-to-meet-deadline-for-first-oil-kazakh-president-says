Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said the first oil at the Eni SpA-led Kashagan
offshore oil deposit will be produced on time, followed by
expansion, Kazinform reported.  “We are on the eve of the first oil production in the end
of 2012,” the state-run news service said,  citing  Nazarbayev on
Sept. 16 during a visit to the artificial D island, built to
help produce oil at Kashagan in the  Caspian Sea .  Kashagan output will increase to 75 million metric tons of
oil a year by 2018 or 2019, from a planned 50 million tons a
year in the first phase, Nazarbayev said, according to the
report. That will help turn Kazakhstan into one of the world’s
five largest oil exporters, Kazinform said.  The Kashagan partners have invested $33 billion in the
development of Caspian Sea oil deposit, Kazinform said.  Eni,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Total SA (FP) 
each hold a 16.8 percent stake in the field, as does KazMunaiGaz
National Co., the Kazakh state energy company, according to the
website of the North Caspian Operating Co. venture.
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  holds 8.4 percent and  Japan ’s  Inpex Corp. (1605)  has
7.56 percent.  -- Editors: Torrey Clark,  John Buckley   To contact the reporter on this story:
