SK Innovation Co.,  South Korea ’s
biggest refiner, agreed to invest $50 million in closely held
thin-film panels production company HelioVolt Corp. to obtain a
key technology for its solar batteries business.  The investment will help the company to test the
feasibility of commercial production of copper indium gallium
selenide, or CIGS, photovoltaic technology owned by Austin,
Texas-based HelioVolt, to lower the cost of producing solar
batteries, the SK Group unit said today in an e-mailed
statement. The investment will be made with affiliate company SK
Technology Innovation Center.  SK is open to additional investments “for the commercial
production of the technology,” depending on the feasibility
study, the Seoul-based company said in the statement. It didn’t
provide details on the stake it will have in HelioVolt in return
for the investment.  SK Group , which accounts for almost 10 percent of South
 Korea ’s gross domestic output, plans to invest 17.5 trillion won
($15.6 billion) by 2020 in alternative energy and new technology
as it seeks fresh sources of income. SK Group’s units are
involved in the production of polysilicon wafers and materials
for solar batteries.  SK Innovation rose 0.6 percent to 169,500 won as of 12:14
p.m. in Seoul trading, headed for the highest close since Aug.9.
Korea’s benchmark Kospi stock index fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
