A European Commission,  European
Central Bank  and International Monetary Fund team reviewing the
 Greek economy , the so-called troika, has asked the government to
halt payments to pensioners under 55 years old, To Vima said.  Professions that used to qualify for early retirement
included police officers, flight attendants and military staff
and the troika is asking that payments be halted until the age
of 55 is reached, the Athens-based newspaper reported, without
citing anyone.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
