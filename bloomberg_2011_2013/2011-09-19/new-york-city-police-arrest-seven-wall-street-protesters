The New York City Police Department
arrested at least seven protesters in the first three days of a
demonstration on  Wall Street  targeting financial firms.  Two protesters wearing masks were arrested for trying to
enter a building used by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and one was taken
into custody for jumping a police barrier, said Paul Browne, a
police spokesman, in an e-mailed statement. Four people were
arrested today for wearing masks in violation of a law that bars
two or more participants from doing so, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
