Portugal will begin selling state-
owned electricity, gas and oil companies by mid-November, Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said in an interview published in
Le Figaro newspaper.  The privatization drive that is part of the countryâ€™s plan
to wean itself off aid from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund, should be completed by the end of next year and
raise 7 billion euros, Coelho said, according to the newspaper.  Coelho also said that Portugal will meet its targets of
reducing the  budget deficit  to 5.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year, and achieving a surplus before interest
charges in 2012, according to Le Figaro.   To contact the reporter on this story:
