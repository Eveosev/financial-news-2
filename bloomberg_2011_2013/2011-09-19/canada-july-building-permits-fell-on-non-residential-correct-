(Corrects story originally published Sept. 8 to reflect
 Statistics Canada  changes to their figures.)  Canadian building permits fell 0.6
percent in July, led by non-residential work, the governmentâ€™s
statistics agency said.  The value of permits issued by municipalities fell to a
seasonally adjusted C$6.57 billion ($6.65 billion), Statistics
Canada said in Ottawa. Economists forecast a 1.5 percent decline
based on the median of 10 responses in a Bloomberg survey.  Building permits for non-residential construction fell 4.5
percent to C$2.71 billion, the first decline in three months.  The value of housing permits rose 2.4 percent to C$3.86
billion, with multiple-unit work gaining 1 percent and single-
family housing by 3.4 percent.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said its new
house price index rose 0.1 percent in July, led by increases in
Toronto. From a year earlier, new  home prices  increased 2.3
percent. The monthly figure was below the 0.3 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg economist survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
