Spanish opposition leader  Mariano Rajoy  said he would reduce the corporate-tax rate for small- and
medium-sized companies should his  People’s Party  win a general
election on Nov. 20 as polls indicate.  “I’ll focus on the taxes which can be useful to create
jobs,” Rajoy said in an interview on  Cadena Ser  today. “My
first move will be to reduce corporate tax for small and medium
companies” by 5 percentage points, he added.  Voters in  Spain , the euro region’s fourth-largest economy,
will head to the polls four months ahead of schedule as mounting
expectations of a Greek default fuel a surge in the country’s
borrowing costs. If elected, Rajoy will inherit an unemployment
rate of 21 percent and public finances that showed a shortfall
of 9.2 percent of gross domestic product last year, the region’s
highest after Greece and Ireland.  Rajoy said it would be “risky” to increase the rate of
value-added tax now, as  consumer spending  remains weak.  Promising to cut “superfluous spending,” Rajoy said he
“wouldn’t like” to reduce pensions and wouldn’t change income-
tax rates “for now.”  The PP would win 44.8 percent of the vote if elections were
held now, giving Rajoy an outright majority in Parliament, daily
El Pais reported on Sept. 12, citing a poll. The Socialists, who
have run minority governments since 2004, would win 30.7
percent, according to the poll, which had a margin of error of
3.2 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
