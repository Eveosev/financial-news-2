Serbia will tighten penalties for
 insider trading  by increasing fines and handing out prison terms
in an overhaul of regulations guiding financial markets and
services.  The new rules are expected by Nov. 17 in by-laws that will
complement a bill on capital markets that the Balkan country
adopted in May, said Zoran Cirovic, the head of Serbia’s
 Securities Commission . The stricter penalties will include the
possibility of prison terms of as much as five years, in
addition to fines which will also be increased to as much as 3
million dinars ($40,500) from some 200,000 dinars at present.  “The commission will have bigger competencies, especially
in supervision and control because we want more transparency and
better protection of small investors,” Cirovic told reporters
in Belgrade today. “The fines have been so small that violators
would pay them and keep doing what they did before.”  Serbia  has undertaken legislative changes as it aspires to
become an official candidate for European Union membership this
year. Cirovic said the new regulations will be “almost entirely
in tune with EU standards,” with further adjustments later as
the country moves close to the bloc.  The Securities Commission will also have “direct
electronic communication” with the Belgrade Stock Exchange to
request prompt suspension of  trading  in a security if the
commission detects “any irregularities, including attempts at
price manipulation,” Cirovic said.  The bourse itself may have until mid-February to adopt the
new, tighter regulations, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
