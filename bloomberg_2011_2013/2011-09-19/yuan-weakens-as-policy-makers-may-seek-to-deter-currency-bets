The yuan weakened, snapping a
three-day advance, as dollar gains prompted the central bank to
lower its reference rate.  The People’s Bank of  China  set the reference rate 0.08
percent weaker at 6.3848 per dollar. The Dollar Index, a six-
currency gauge of the greenback’s strength, jumped 0.6 percent
after Europe’s officials failed to offer a plan to halt the
region’s debt crisis. The greenback appreciated against 15 of
its 16 most-used counterparts today.  “I think the fixing just follows the dollar trend, the  U.S.
dollar  strengthened largely,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “In the short term, of
course, there could be two-way fluctuations even for the yuan.”  The yuan fell 0.05 percent to close at 6.3868 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency is allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either
side of the daily reference rate.  The central bank set its daily fixing at 6.3797 per dollar
on Sept. 16, the strongest level since July 2005. China needs to
keep monetary policy tight and balance growth with inflation,
International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director Zhu Min
said on Sept. 15 at the  World Economic Forum  in the northeastern
Chinese city of Dalian.  “We are still looking for a broad appreciation trend, we
look for 6.30 by year-end,” Hong Kong-based Cheung said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.22 percent
to 6.3403 per dollar, a 0.7 percent premium to the onshore spot
rate. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan weakened 0.23
percent to 6.3910.  To contact the reporter on this story:
