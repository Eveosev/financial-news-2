Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM) , the fifth-
largest Canadian gold producer by market value, agreed to buy
 Grayd Resource Corp. (GYD)  for about C$255.3 million ($257.8 million)
in cash and stock, gaining more mines in  Mexico .  Grayd investors can choose between receiving C$2.80 or
0.04039 of an Agnico-Eagle share plus 5 cents in cash for each
share they own, Toronto-based Agnico-Eagle said in a statement
today. The bid is 68 percent more than Vancouver-based Grayd’s
average share price in the 20 trading days through Sept. 16,
according to Bloomberg data.  Grayd’s La India project is located in the Mulatos Gold
Belt of Sonora, Mexico, and is about 70 kilometers (44 miles)
northwest of Agnico-Eagle’s Pinos Altos gold mine, according to
the statement. Grayd’s Tarachi gold prospect is located about 10
kilometers north of La India.  Agnico-Eagle will pay a maximum of about C$92 million in
cash for Grayd, it said. The deal value was calculated based on
the number of Grayd shares outstanding, according to Bloomberg
data.  Grayd rose 80 cents, or 41 percent, to C$2.75 as of 3:59
p.m. on the  TSX Venture Exchange .  Agnico-Eagle also agreed to issue Grayd a C$5 million loan
to fund exploration work at La India. Agnico-Eagle can receive a
C$10 million breakup fee if the deal fails under certain
circumstances.  TD Securities Inc. is Agnico-Eagle’s financial adviser on
the takeover. Canaccord Genuity Corp. is Grayd’s financial
adviser and Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP is its legal adviser.  The four largest Canadian gold producers ranked by market
value are Barrick Gold Corp., Goldcorp Inc., Kinross Gold Corp.
and Yamana Gold Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
