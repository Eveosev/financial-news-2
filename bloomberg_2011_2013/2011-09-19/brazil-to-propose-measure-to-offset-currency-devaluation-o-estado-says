Brazil plans to propose a so-called
anti-dumping mechanism to the  World Trade Organization  to help
countries offset currency devaluations, such as that of the U.S.
dollar, O Estado de Sao Paulo reported, citing Development
Minister Fernando Pimentel.  The measure would create an acceptable band of currency
fluctuation which, when exceeded, would permit countries to
charge an additional tax on imports to compensate for losses,
the newspaper said. The limits would be set by organizations
such as the  International Monetary Fund , according to O Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
