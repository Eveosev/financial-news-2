Russian stocks slid for a second
day as European policy makers failed to introduce a plan to stem
the region’s debt crisis, hurting investor appetite for riskier
assets.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of the
metal, fell 4.7 percent, as prices tumbled. OAO Rosneft, the
country’s biggest oil producer retreated 2.1 percent as oil
declined. Those movements led the 30-stock gauge down 1.2
percent to 1,493.19 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the
gauge’s lowest since Sept. 12.  Finance chiefs from the euro region said last week that
 Greece ’s 18-month debt crisis leaves no room for tax cuts or
extra spending to spur an economy on the brink of stagnation.
Crude traded in  New York  dropped as much as 3.4 percent $84.93 a
barrel, while London-traded oil slid 3 percent to $108.87. Oil
and natural gas contribute about 17 percent of  Russia ’s gross
domestic product.  Valuations on the Micex, which has lost 20 percent from its
2011 high reached on April 6 and trades at 5.5 times estimated
earnings, compare with 9.7 times earnings for companies on
 Brazil ’s Bovespa index and 14.1 times for the BSE India
Sensitive Index.  OAO Tatneft, the oil producer located in Russia’s Tatarstan
region, dropped 4.6 percent to 150.25 rubles. OAO Gazprom, the
world’s biggest natural gas exporter, fell 1 percent to 163.19
rubles, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel fell for a second day as nickel lost
1.5 percent to $21,199 a metric ton and copper, which the
company also produces, dropped 4 percent to $8,344.25 a ton.  Norilsk announced plans on Sept. 16 to fund a $4.5 billion
share buyback using international bonds that can be converted
into shares. The plan “raises concerns regarding the company’s
financials for 2011,” Alfa Bank analysts Barry Ehrlich and
Andrey Lobazov wrote in an e-mailed research note today.  The company won’t sell the bonds if the market remains
weak, Chief Financial Officer Dmitry Kostoev said today in a
statement on the company website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
