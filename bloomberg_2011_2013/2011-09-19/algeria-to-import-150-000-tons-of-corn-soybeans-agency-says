Algeria ’s animal feed agency ONAB
plans to ship in 100,000 metric tons of corn and 50,000 tons of
soybeans before the end of October, the head of its import arm
said.  The agency’s imports will reach 600,000 tons of corn and
soybeans by the end of 2011 compared with 200,000 tons in 2010,
Mustapha Zamoum, chief executive officer of the government-
controlled agency’s trading division, said today in an interview
in Algiers, the capital.  “We plan to achieve a market share of 30 percent in
2012,” Zamoum said, adding that the agency’s share of animal
feed imports now is 10 percent.  The animal feed import bill of the North African country,
where usage is estimated at 3 million tons a year, is expected
to reach 60 billion dinars ($816.04 million) this year, up 30
percent from 2010, Zamoum added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
