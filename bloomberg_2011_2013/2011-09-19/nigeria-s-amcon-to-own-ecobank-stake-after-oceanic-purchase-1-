Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria 
will own about 14 percent of Lome, Togo-based Ecobank
Transnational Inc. after its acquisition of  Oceanic Bank
International Plc (OCEANIC) , Ecobank said.  “Oceanic shareholders including Amcon will own 25 percent
of Ecobank after the conversion of preference shares,” David
Ellis, a spokesman for Ecobank, said today in e-mailed response
to questions. “It will take up to three years to fully
integrate the two banks.”  Before the conversion of preference shares, “Oceanic
shareholders and Amcon will hold 20.1 percent of the ordinary
shares of Ecobank, with 69.9 percent of that belonging to
Amcon,” Ellis said.  Ecobank agreed on July 30 to acquire and recapitalize
Oceanic Bank, which was bailed out by the  Central Bank of
Nigeria  in 2009 amid a lending crisis. That was part of a $4
billion rescue that involved the creation of Amcon to buy
nonperforming loans, enabling banks to rebuild their balance
sheets and resume lending. Oceanic was among eight lenders whose
chief executives were fired by Nigerian authorities.  The central bank gave lenders until Sept. 30 to
recapitalize or face liquidation or nationalization.  Following the acquisition of Oceanic, “Ecobank will take
over all its subsidiaries and will take a decision which
subsidiary will be sold and which will be integrated into
Ecobank,” Ellis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
