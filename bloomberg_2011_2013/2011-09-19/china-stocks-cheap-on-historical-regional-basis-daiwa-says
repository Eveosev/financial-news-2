Stocks traded on the MSCI  China 
Index look “cheap” on a historical basis and relative to
regional peers, Daiwa Securities Group said.  The 12-month forward price-earnings ratio of the MSCI China
Index has declined to 8.3 times, Colin Bradbury, an analyst at
Daiwa, wrote in a report dated Sept. 16. That’s the bottom end
of its historical range, 24 percent below its average since
2003, and at a trough 15.1 percent discount to MSCI Asia ex-
 Japan , he wrote.  While “we are not complacent about the issues facing
China at a macro and micro level, we continue to believe that
the risk-reward remains highly favourable,” the analyst wrote.
“Even with further significant earnings forecast downgrades –-
which do not seem imminent right now -– market valuations would
still be attractive.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
