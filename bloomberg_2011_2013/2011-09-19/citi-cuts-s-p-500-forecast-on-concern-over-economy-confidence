Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Tobias Levkovich
cut his year-end forecast for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to
1,325, citing disappointing global economic data and constraints
on investor confidence.  Levkovich, the chief U.S. equity strategist at the New
York-based firm, reduced his estimate for the end of this year
by 5.4 percent, from an earlier prediction of 1,400. He forecast
the S&P 500 would rise 3.8 percent in 2012 to 1,375.  Investors won’t pay higher multiples for stocks given
increased concerns over  Europe ’s credit crisis, damaged consumer
and corporate confidence from the U.S. debt ceiling debate and
the likelihood a third round of stimulus from the  Federal
Reserve  won’t boost the economy as much as it has in the past,
according to Levkovich in a note dated Sept. 16.  “The 1,400 projection for the  S&P 500  laid out last
December appears too optimistic at this juncture,” he wrote.
“While the S&P 500’s potential gains still look quite
attractive over the next six and 12 months on our metrics, the
investment community may not be as willing to bump up share
prices that vigorously.”  The S&P 500 slumped as much as 18 percent from its April
high to Aug. 8, sending the benchmark equity measure’s valuation
down to as low as 12.2 times earnings, the cheapest level since
March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Citi is the fifth Wall Street firm to lower its year-end
forecast on the index this month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Barclays Plc,  Wells Fargo & Co . and UBS AG have cut their year-
end forecasts for the S&P 500 this month, reducing the average
estimate of 12 strategists to 1,311. The index has slumped for
six of the past eight weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
