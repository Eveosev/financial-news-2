An Angolan court ordered the
release of 27 anti-government protesters arrested on Sept. 8,
said William Tonet, a lawyer for the group.  “They were all absolved,” Tonet said today in a telephone
interview from Luanda,  Angola ’s capital. “Nothing was proven in
the court.”  The arrests occurred as hundreds of people demonstrated in
front of the court, where proceedings were taking place against
21 people who were detained after Sept. 3 protests against
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and power and water shortages
in  Africa ’s second-biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
