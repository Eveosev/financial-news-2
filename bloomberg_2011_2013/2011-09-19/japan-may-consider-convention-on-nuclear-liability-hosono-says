Japan  may consider adopting a
international convention that defines liability in the event of
a nuclear accident, said Goshi Hosono, Japan’s minister in
charge of cleaning up the Fukushima Dai-Ichi reactor meltdowns.  “There is a need to look into the possibility of becoming
a party or concluding the convention on supplementary
compensation,” Hosono said in a press briefing at the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. “We should take
it up as an important political agenda item.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
