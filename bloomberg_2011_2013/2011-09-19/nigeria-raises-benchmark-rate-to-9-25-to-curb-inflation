Nigeria ’s central bank raised its
benchmark  interest rate  for the fifth time this year to help
stabilize the naira and keep inflation below 10 percent.  The monetary policy rate was increased by half a percentage
point to 9.25 percent, Governor Lamido Sanusi told reporters in
the capital, Abuja, today. The decision was in line with the
median estimate of 11 economists polled by Bloomberg. The
borrowing and lending rates rose by the same margin to 7.25
percent and 11.25 percent respectively.  The government of Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer,
more than doubled the monthly minimum wage to 18,000 naira
($115) last month, adding to price pressures. While inflation
slowed to 9.3 percent in August from 9.4 percent the previous
month, the core inflation rate, which excludes food, is higher
at 10.9 percent. The central bank targets inflation at less than
10 percent.  “Concerns remain about maintaining the present inflation
trend,” Sanusi said. The increase in the  minimum wage ,
increased liquidity through the recapitalization of commercial
banks by the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria and expansionary
fiscal policy may add to inflation, he said.  Nigeria’s naira has weakened as much as 3 percent against
the dollar this year and was at 156.75 by 5:40 p.m. in Lagos.
The  central bank  sells dollars to keep it within a range of
between 3 percent above or below 150 per dollar to help curb
inflation.  Reserves Rise  “Fiscal pressures are likely to remain significant,”
 Razia Khan , head of Africa economic research at Standard
Chartered Plc in  London , said in an e-mailed statement after the
decision. “It looks as though there is a clear intent to bring
real interest rates to positive levels, in order to shore up
support for the naira.”  The country’s foreign reserves rose to $34.85 billion by
Sept. 15 compared with $33.73 billion on July 21, Sanusi said.  Nigeria’s economy, the second-biggest in sub-Saharan Africa
after  South Africa , is forecast to expand 7.85 percent this year
after growing 7.72 percent in the second quarter, he said.  “Given the difficult and uncertain international
environment, it is important to ensure that the current trend in
growth is sustained and  price stability  is maintained, Sanusi
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
