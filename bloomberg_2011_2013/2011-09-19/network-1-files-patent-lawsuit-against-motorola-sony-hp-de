Network-1 Security Solutions (NSSI)  Inc.,
the New York-based company that received a patent settlement
from Cisco Systems Inc. last year, sued 16 companies including
Motorola Solutions Inc.,  Dell Inc. (DELL) , and  Sony Corp. (SNE)   The lawsuit, filed Sept. 15 in a federal court in Tyler,
 Texas , claims infringement of patents for delivering power over
Ethernet cables. Network-1 is seeking an order barring the
infringement, as well as financial damages and royalties.  “We have made repeated efforts, at considerable expense,
to license the Remote Power Patent on reasonable terms to
companies manufacturing and selling Power over Ethernet
technology,” Corey Horowitz, Network-1’s chairman and chief
executive officer said in a statement. “We hope that the
remainder of the industry will license our patented technology
rather than devote substantial resources to continued
litigation.”  Defendants also include: Alcatel-Lucent’s U.S. unit, Allied
Telesis Inc., Avaya Inc., Axis Communications Inc., GarrettCom
Inc.,  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , Huawei Technologies Co.’s U.S. unit,
 Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) ,  NEC Corp. (6701) ,  Polycom Inc. (PLCM) , Samsung
Electronics Co.,  ShoreTel Inc. (SHOR) , and Transition Networks Inc.  Network-1 in July 2010 settled similar litigation against
companies including Cisco, Adtran Inc., Enterasys Networks,
Inc., Foundry Networks Inc. and 3Com Corp.  The case is Network-1 Security Solutions Inc. v. Alcatel-
Lucent YSA Inc., 11cv492, U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas (Tyler).  To contact the reporter on this story:
