Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures fell to near a two-week low in  New York 
on speculation the European debt crisis will cut demand and
after OPECâ€™s secretary-general indicated consumption is rising
less than expected.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 43 percent at 1 p.m. in New York,
up from 38.2 percent Sept. 16.  Oil for October delivery fell $2.87, or 3.3 percent, to
$85.09 a barrel at 1:01 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures have fallen 7 percent this year. November
futures retreated $2.80, or 3.2 percent, to $85.38 a barrel.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
November $80 puts, with 2,540 lots changing hands. The options
rose 76 cents to $2.35 a barrel. November $105 calls, the next-
most-active options, slipped 4 cents to 13 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,086 lots. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
crude.  October options expired at the close of Nymex floor trading
Sept. 15.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  November $110 calls were the most active options traded in

volume of 4,961.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
