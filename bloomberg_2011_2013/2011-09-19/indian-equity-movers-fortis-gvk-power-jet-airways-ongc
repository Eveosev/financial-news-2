Shares of the following companies

percent to 16,745.35. The BSE200 Index lost 0.9 percent to
2,076.93.  Fortis Healthcare India Ltd. (FORH IN) dropped 1.8 percent
to 144.45 rupees, the lowest close since Feb. 24. The hospital
operator plans to invest $1 billion over three years to boost
growth in India and overseas, Chairman Malvinder Singh told
reporters in  New Delhi  today. The company also agreed to buy its
international unit from RHC Financial Services Ltd., according
to an e-mailed statement today.  Jet Airways India Ltd. (JETIN)  , the nation’s biggest
carrier, climbed 1.2 percent to 275.85 rupees, the biggest gain
since Sept. 7. The company increased its fuel surcharge by 200
rupees from Sept. 17, according to an e-mailed statement.  Kavveri Telecom Products Ltd. (KTPL)  , a telecom
equipment supplier, rallied 5.3 percent to 142.15 rupees, its
highest close since Aug. 4. The company signed a 10-year
agreement with an Indian mobile-phone operator for building
wireless solutions, it said in an exchange filing today.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  , which makes almost half
the cars sold in the country, advanced 2.8 percent to 1,140.75
rupees, the most since Aug. 10, after the Spiegel magazine cited
an unidentified Volkswagen AG manager as saying he doesn’t rule
out a purchase of Suzuki Motor Corp. if the tie-up between the
two carmakers ends. Suzuki, which owned 54.21 percent of Maruti
as of June 30, last week said they wanted to end the alliance.  “We’ve always said that Suzuki is an independent company
and an independent partner” VW spokesman Michael Brendel said
by phone yesterday, declining to comment on the Spiegel article.
“We are satisfied with our distribution of ownership in
Suzuki.”  Volkswagen AG has a 19.9 percent stake in Suzuki Motor.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC IN) declined 1.9 percent to
269.45 rupees, the most in two weeks. India’s government is
considering almost doubling ONGC’s share of fuel subsidy as it
takes steps to cut expenditure and reduce the fiscal deficit,
two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
