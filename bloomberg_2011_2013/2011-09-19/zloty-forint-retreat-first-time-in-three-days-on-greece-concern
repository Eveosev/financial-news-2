The zloty and forint tumbled versus
the euro as investors awaited a decision on whether  Greece  will
receive a payment that would help the country avoid a default.  The zloty lost 1.5 percent to 4.3403 per euro and the
forint retreated 1.2 percent to 288.23 against the European
common currency as of 8:57 a.m. in Warsaw. The decline halted a
two-day rally for both currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
