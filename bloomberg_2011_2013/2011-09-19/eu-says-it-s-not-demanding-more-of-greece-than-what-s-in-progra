The European Union isn’t demanding
more of  Greece  than what the government has agreed to in the
international aid program for the country, the EU said.  “There is no new austerity measure that has been put on
the table,” Amadeu Altafaj , spokesman for EU Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, told reporters today in
Brussels. “The only thing that is on the table is compliance
with agreed targets; no more, no less.”  Altafaj said “an important conference call will take place
this evening” between Greek Finance MinisterEvangelos Venizelos and the leaders of the so-called troika mission to
Athens by the EU, the International Monetary Fund and the
European Central Bank. “It will be only after that that we will
be in a position to communicate further on the next steps.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
