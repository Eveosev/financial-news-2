(Corrects name in headline.)  Thomas Waldrom will fly to  New
Zealand  as backup at the Rugby World Cup for England’s Nick
Easter, who is being treated for a sore back.  Waldrom was part of England’s preliminary training squad
for the tournament, and will arrive in New Zealand in two days,
England’s Rugby Football Union said today in an e-mailed
statement. The Leicester Tigers’ No. 8 isn’t an official
replacement for Andrew Sheridan, who flew home earlier this
month with a shoulder injury, England said.  “Nick Easter is still suffering from a sore back, so we
will be bringing Thomas out as a temporary cover,” manager
 Martin Johnson  said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
