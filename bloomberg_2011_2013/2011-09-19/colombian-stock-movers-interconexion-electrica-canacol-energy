The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.3 percent to 13,838.99, while the
Colcap Index fell 0.2 percent to 1,680.37.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE)  , the Toronto-based  oil
company  with fields in Colombia, fell 1.3 percent to 1,535
pesos. Oil fell to a three-week low in New York on speculation
demand will falter as the debt crisis in Europe worsens and
after OPEC’s secretary-general indicated that global consumption
is rising less than expected.  Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA)  , a Medellin-based
electricity and road company, rose 0.5 percent to 12,300 pesos.
The company was rated “buy” with a 2012 year-end target price
of 14,700 pesos as Interbolsa SA reinitiated coverage of the
stock.  Annuities from current businesses are “more than enough”
to expect the share price to rise, and the recommendation is
supported by “stable cash flows” from operations in  Brazil ,
Peru, Chile and Colombia, according to an e-mailed report by
analysts including Rafael Espana Amador.  To contact the reporter on this story:
