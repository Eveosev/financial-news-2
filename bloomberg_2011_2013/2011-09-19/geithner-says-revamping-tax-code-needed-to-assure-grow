Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said the Obama administration’s plan for “modest
reforms” in the tax code will help bring the  budget deficit 
down to sustainable levels and make the economy more
competitive.  Geithner said the deficit-reduction plan presented today by
President Barack Obama, which would increase taxes by $1.5
trillion over a decade, would make the system “more fair” by
raising revenue from the wealthiest Americans and by closing
corporate loopholes.  Geithner spoke at the daily White House briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
