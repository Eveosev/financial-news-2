Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said new taxes can’t be imposed and the revenue
collection mechanism needs to be fixed.  “We can’t impose further taxation and incessantly increase
taxes and wherever we did, it was under pressure, because of the
inefficiency of the tax collection system,” Venizelos said at a
conference in  Athens  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
