Vietnam ’s central bank increased
the term for one of its interest rates for the first time since
January, seeking to ensure banks have adequate funds.  The State Bank of Vietnam lent 2 trillion dong ($96
million) in open market operations for a term of 14 days, it
said in an e-mail today. That’s the first time since January 30
that the central bank raised the term to 14 days from seven
days.  “This increase is designed to support liquidity in the
banking system, especially small lenders,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, the head of fixed-income research at  Ho Chi Minh City
Securities Corp. (HCM)   Vietnam is struggling to contain the fastest inflation in
 Asia  while supporting economic growth. The economy is vulnerable
partly due to undercapitalized banks, rising debt and
deteriorating corporate profits, Credit Suisse Group AG said
Aug. 29. The outlook for banks is negative due to falling
profits and poor asset quality, Moody’s Investors Service said
Sept. 1.  The open-market operations rate, also known as the
repurchase rate, remains at 14 percent, today’s statement
showed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
