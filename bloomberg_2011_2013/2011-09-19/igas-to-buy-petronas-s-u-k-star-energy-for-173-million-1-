(Corrects to say deal excludes non-U.K. assets.)  IGas Energy Plc (IGAS) , a U.K. coal-bed
methane producer, agreed to buy U.K. oil onshore producer Star
Energy Group Ltd. from  Malaysia ’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. for
110 million pounds ($173 million).  The deal excludes some non-U.K. assets and the gas storage
business run by Star Energy, IGas said today in a statement in
London. The purchase, which exceeds IGas’s market capitalization
of 81 million pounds, will be funded by a $140 million debt
facility provided by Macquarie Bank Ltd. IGas’s London shares
were suspended.  IGas’s focus so far has been on exploration for coal-bed
methane, natural gas found in seams of underground coal. The
company said in July it’s trying to produce gas at commercial
rates after successful pilot projects.  “With this acquisition we will be creating a substantial
onshore oil and gas company in the U.K.,” IGas Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Austin said in a statement. “The enlarged group
is expected to have a growing production profile as IGas
Energy’s combined oil and gas resources are developed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
