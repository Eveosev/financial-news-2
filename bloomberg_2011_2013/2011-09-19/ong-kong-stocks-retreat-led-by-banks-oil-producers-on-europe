Hong Kong stocks, dragging the
benchmark Hang Seng Index to its lowest close in two years, as
concern mounted that Greece’s sovereign-debt crisis may be
coming to a head, threatening to halt a global economic
recovery.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank by market value,
slid 2.6 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the clothier that gets
most of its revenue from Europe, tumbled 20 percent, the most
since 1997, amid analyst downgrades after the company reported
last week that full-year profit plunged 98 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,
China’s biggest offshore oil producer by market value, declined
4 percent after crude prices dropped.  “The Greek situation could be coming to a head,” said
Khiem Do, the Hong Kong-based head of multi asset strategy at
Baring Asset Management, which oversees about $10 billion.
“Some hair cut might be needed for Greece if it doesn’t receive
additional funding. That could create a domino effect in
countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal. That’s what the market
is fearing.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 2.8 percent to 18,917.95 at the
close, the lowest since July 2009. The gauge extended last
week’s 2.1 percent decline as international monitors get set to
assess whether Greece can meet the conditions of rescue loans to
avoid a default. Greek leader  George Papandreou  canceled a U.S.
visit that was to begin yesterday, saying he needed to remain in
the country for a “critical” seven days.  All but four stocks declined in the 46-member Hang Seng
Index. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese
companies listed in Hong Kong sank 3.7 percent to 9,866.97.  Brink of Stagnation  Finance chiefs from the euro region said last week that the
18-month debt crisis leaves no room for tax cuts or extra
spending to spur an economy on the brink of stagnation. Economic
reports on Germany this week are forecast to show a decline in
investor confidence and a slowdown in manufacturing in Europe’s
largest economy.  HSBC Holdings slipped 2.6 percent to HK$62.90.  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s third-biggest lender by market value,
dropped 2.3 percent to HK$165.30. Esprit Holdings tumbled 20
percent to HK$9.80, the biggest decline since October 2007.  Chinese lenders dropped on speculation the government will
introduce measures to control inflation and further tighten
monetary policy after a report showed new-home prices increased
in all cities.  Critical Stage  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., China’s largest
lender, decreased 4.2 percent to HK$4.57.  China Construction
Bank Corp. (939) , the second-biggest lender, slipped 2.8 percent to
HK$5.52. Smaller rival  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  dropped 3.4 percent to
HK$2.82.  China’s measures to control its  property market  are at a
critical stage and the nation needs to focus efforts on curbing
price increases in less affluent cities after limiting home
purchases by each family in metropolitan areas including Beijing
and Shanghai, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on Sept. 1.  The Hang Seng Index tumbled 24 percent from its November
high on concern the global recovery will falter amid  Europe ’s
debt crisis and a slowing U.S. economy. Shares on the index
traded at 10.1 times estimated earnings, compared with 12.2
times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Raw Material Producers  Raw-material producers declined on speculation demand will
weaken as global economic growth slows. Cnooc declined 4 percent
to HK$13.30. PetroChina Co., China’s largest energy company,
dropped 3.2 percent to HK$9.53. Jiangxi Copper Co., the nation’s
biggest producer of the metal, slumped 6.8 percent to HK$17.40.  Crude oil futures headed for a one-week low in  New York ,
while copper for three-month delivery extended its decline for a
second day in  London .  Futures on the Hang Seng Index decreased 2 percent to
18,935. The HSI Volatility Index advanced 7.2 percent to 36.23,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 10 percent in the
Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
