A Hamburg court said it has
suspended a federal tax on companies that use nuclear fuel.  The German court said an unnamed power plant operator,
which asked it to suspend the tax, should be reimbursed the 96
million euros ($131 million) it paid on the levy, according to
the statement posted on the courtâ€™s  website  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
