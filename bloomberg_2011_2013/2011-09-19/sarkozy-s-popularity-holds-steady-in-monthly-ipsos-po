French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
popularity held steady in September, a poll showed.  Thirty-five percent of French voters rated Sarkozy’s
leadership favorably, unchanged from August, according to the
Ipsos poll for Le Point magazine today. The president’s
popularity reached a record low of 29 percent in April.
Confidence in Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  dropped three
percentage points to 44 percent.  Sarkozy’s popularity has recovered because of the
leadership he showed in helping to oust  Muammar Qaddafi  in
Libya, while Fillon has been hurt by being on the front lines in
announcing austerity measures, Ispos said in a commentary.  Ipsos questioned 940 people by telephone on Sept. 16-17. No
margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
