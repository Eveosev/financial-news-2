Redhill Biopharma Ltd. soared the
most on record after the Israeli biopharmaceutical company
agreed to buy the rights to a diagnostic test to help identify a
bacteria connected to Crohn’s disease.  The shares surged 19 percent, the most since the stock
started trading on Feb. 13, to 2.213 shekels at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  Tel Aviv .  The test, acquired from from the University of Central
Florida Research Foundation Inc., will be used in conjunction
with the RHB-104 Crohn’s drug Redhill is developing, Chief
Executive Officer Dror Ben-Asher said in a telephone interview.  “It gives us a level of independence so we don’t have to
depend on anybody to provide the diagnostic test,” he said,
adding that he hoped Redhill would be able to bring the test to
the market as a companion diagnostic with RHB-104.  Tel Aviv-based Redhill will make an upfront payment and
future net sales royalties of 7 percent to 20 percent to UCF,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
