Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the largest producer of
motor fuels from coal, along with Uzbekneftegaz and  Petronas Gas
BHD (PTG)  agreed with Uzbekistan to build a gas-to-liquids project.  “Under the investment agreement, the investors and the
gas-to-liquids project will enjoy investment protection and
fiscal benefits,” Johannesburg-based Sasol said in an e-mailed
statement today. Sasol and state-controlled Uzbekneftegaz each
hold 44.5 percent and Petronas 11 percent, the company said.  The project will boost Sasol revenue and cut Uzbekistan’s
dependence on fuel imports. It may have capacity of 1.4 million
metric tons a year and begin output of fuel such as kerosene,
diesel and naphtha in the second half of the decade, Sasol said.  Sasol uses proprietary Fischer-Tropsch technology to turn
coal or natural gas into motor and jet fuel. It runs a coal-to-
liquids plant in  South Africa  and gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar.  The company rose 0.5 percent to 344.74 rand by the 5 p.m.
close of Johannesburg trading, giving Sasol a market value of
222 billion rand ($29 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
