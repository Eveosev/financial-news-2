Angola  canceled the first passenger
train service on the repaired railway line between the port of
Lobito and Huambo for “technical reasons,” Radio Nacional de
Angola reported today, citing Carlos Alberto Gomes, chairman of
the rail company.  The line was reopened by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
on Aug. 29 after it was shut 27 years ago during the civil war
in the southern African nation, which ended in 2002.  The inaugural train service will be rescheduled “soon,”
the Luanda-based radio station cited Gomes as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
