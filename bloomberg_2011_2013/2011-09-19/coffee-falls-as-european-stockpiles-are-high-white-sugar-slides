Coffee fell for a fifth day in New
York, heading for the longest losing streak since July, amid
stable stockpiles before harvesting begins in Central America
and  Colombia . Cocoa slid.  Coffee inventories in  Europe  were 13.66 million bags on
July 31, according to the European Coffee Federation. The port
of Antwerp has the top global stocks, Wim Dillen, senior
business development manager, said in a Sept. 14 interview.
Central America will harvest its largest coffee crop since 1999-
2000, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show.  “Global stocks, which could have suffered a sharp fall
with reduced exports from  Brazil  in the last months, have been
stable,”  Rodrigo Costa , a contributor for Sao Paulo-based
consultancy Archer Consulting, said in a report yesterday.
Inventories are unlikely to be drawn down, he said.  Arabica coffee for December delivery dropped 2.9 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.575 a pound by 8:45 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . Robusta coffee for November delivery slid $40, or
1.9 percent, to $2,069 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Prices also retreated as commodities fell after European
policy makers failed to introduce a plan to stem the region’s
debt crisis. The S&P GSCI Spot Index of raw materials declined
as much as 1.1 percent, dropping for a second session. The
dollar strengthened, making commodities priced in the currency
more expensive in terms of other monies.  Bullish Bets  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in New York coffee futures in the week
ended Sept. 13, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Net-long positions, or bets on higher prices,
fell 3 percent from a week earlier, the CFTC’s Commitments of
Traders report showed.  Cocoa for December delivery retreated $37, or 1.3 percent,
to $2,755 a ton in New York. Cocoa for December fell 18 pounds,
or 1 percent, to 1,789 pounds ($2,809) a ton in  London .  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.32 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 26.63 cents a pound on ICE, rebounding from a 6.6
percent decline on Sept. 16. White, or refined, sugar for
December delivery gained $1.20, or 0.2 percent, to $688.40 a ton
on NYSE Liffe after posting a third straight weekly decline last
week.  “Heavy deliveries against the London white futures October
contract pressured prices and led to the selloff,” Paul Deane,
an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said
in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
