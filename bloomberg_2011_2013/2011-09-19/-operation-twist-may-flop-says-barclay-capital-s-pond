Any effort by U.S. Federal Reserve
policy makers to lengthen the duration of the central bank’s
portfolio and decrease long term  interest rates  may not succeed,
according to Michael Pond, co-head of interest-
rate strategy at  Barclays Capital .  “Its not clear that it will work,” Pond said of
“Operation Twist,” the name given to a Fed tactic to raise
interest rates on longer dated treasury securities in an attempt
drive investors into risker assets.  The U.S. Central bank tried the same tactic in the 1960’s
and “that wasn’t really successful,” Pond said in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Ken Prewitt and Tom
Keene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
