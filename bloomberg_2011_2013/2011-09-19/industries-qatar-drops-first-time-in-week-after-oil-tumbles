Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the Middle
East’s second-biggest petrochemicals company, fell for the first
time in a week as oil declined for a second day.  The shares lost 0.8 percent, retreating for the first time
since Sept. 12, to 125 riyals at the 1 p.m. close in Doha.  Saudi
Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) , the world’s largest petrochemicals maker,
decreased for a second day in Saudi Arabia, falling 0.8 percent
to 92.5 riyals.  Crude for October delivery declined to as low as $86.35 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Qatari and
Saudi markets were trading. The contract was at $85.79 a barrel,
extending the decline, at 9:40 a.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
