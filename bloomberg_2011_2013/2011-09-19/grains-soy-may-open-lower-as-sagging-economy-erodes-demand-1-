What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that
international demand for grain-based food, animal feed and fuel
will falter as the global economy sags and the debt crisis in
Europe escalates, Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said today in a
telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
on weaker demand and speculation that U.S. yields may be higher
than forecast by the government last week, Grow said. Soybean-
oil futures are expected to open down 0.5 cent to 0.6 cent a
pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $3 lower for
2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that demand for U.S. supplies is
slowing while rains aid planting of winter crops, Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
