Opposition leader  Mariano Rajoy 
said the re-introduction of the wealth tax is “crazy” as it
punishes saving and investment, which  Spain  should be
encouraging. Speaking in an interview on Cadena Ser radio, he
didn’t say whether he would get rid of the tax if he wins the
general election on Nov. 20, as polls show he will.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
