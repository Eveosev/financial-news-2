Poland ’s WIG20 Index declined
34.80, or 1.5 percent, to 2,263.72 in Warsaw, falling the most
in a week.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, fell
0.7 zloty, or 2.2 percent, to 31.2 zloty.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the financial-services group controlled by billionaire
Leszek Czarnecki, slid 0.4 zloty, or 5.3 percent, to 7.2 zloty
and Bank Pekao SA (PEO PW), majority-owned by UniCredit SpA,
lost 3.5 zloty, or 2.6 percent, to 132 zloty.  Banks dropped across  Europe  as investors speculated  Greece 
may not receive a payment that would help it avoid default. The
Polish zloty resumed its decline against the euro and Swiss
franc, reviving concern borrowers will default on mortgages
denominated in foreign currencies.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)   soared 0.33 zloty, or 7.9
percent, to 4.53 zloty, rising the most since Aug. 26, after
Reuters reported that BNP Paribas SA of  France , and Poland’s PKO
Bank Polski SA and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  are among bidders seeking to
buy the unit of Banco Comercial Portugues SA.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, sank 7.1 zloty, or 4.3 percent, to
158.4 zloty, the steepest drop in a week. PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW),
Poland’s biggest oil company, declined 0.8 zloty, or 2.1
percent, to 36.6 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-
largest refiner, retreated 0.15 zloty, or 0.6 percent, to 27.2
zloty, snapping a four-day advance.  Copper and oil led declines among commodities after
European policy makers failed to introduce a plan to stem the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis and boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
