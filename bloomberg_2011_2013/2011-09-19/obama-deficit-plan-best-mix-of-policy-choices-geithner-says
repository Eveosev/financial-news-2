President  Barack Obama ’s deficit-
cutting plan represents “the best mix of policies” for
promoting short-term economic growth and cutting the U.S.
government’s long-term debt, Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner 
said.  “We think they’re good ideas, we think they’re good
economics,” Geithner said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television.  “We think they’re better for the economy than the
alternatives and we’re going to try to get them done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
