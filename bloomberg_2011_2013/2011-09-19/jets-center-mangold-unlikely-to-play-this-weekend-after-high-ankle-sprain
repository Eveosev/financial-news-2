New York Jets center  Nick Mangold 
has a high ankle sprain and is unlikely to play this coming
weekend, coach  Rex Ryan  said today.  Mangold, 27, was injured in the first quarter of the
National Football League team’s 32-3 win against the
Jacksonville Jaguars yesterday at MetLife Stadium in East
Rutherford,  New Jersey . He had an MRI this morning that revealed
the sprain in his right leg.  “I don’t think it looks very good as far as playing this
week,” Ryan said at a news conference.  Rookie Colin Baxter, who filled in after the injury, will
start this weekend against the  Oakland Raiders  if Mangold
cannot, Ryan said.  Baxter, 24, said that he worked extra with coaches after
practice today and would spend a lot of time with Mangold as he
prepared for the Raiders.  “I’m definitely going to be in his ear this week, asking
him questions about techniques and plays and assignments,”
Baxter told reporters.  Mangold has been a Pro Bowl selection each of the last
three seasons. He has started 82 games in his six-year career,
spent entirely with the Jets.  “We’re losing a valuable part of our offensive line, a guy
that knows pretty much everything, makes all the calls, makes
things a lot easier,” wide receiver  Santonio Holmes  said today.
“We have to make sure we get our young guy in the lab and get
him everything he needs to know.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
