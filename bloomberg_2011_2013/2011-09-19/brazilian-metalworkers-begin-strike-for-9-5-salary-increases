More than 43,000 Brazilian
metalworkers including employees in the country’s auto-parts
industry began striking today in  Sao Paulo  state to demand
higher wages.  The metalworkers’ union in Sao Jose de Campos, which
represents workers in about 900 factories, is demanding raises
of as much as 9.5 percent, according to an e-mailed statement
sent yesterday after members voted to strike.  The strike will start today in a few factories in the area
and may grow to include other plants if workers and employers
don’t reach an agreement during the week, Adilson dos Santos, a
union representative, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
The strikes will be rotated so not all factories are affected at
the same time, he said.  Work stoppages have increased throughout  Brazil  in recent
months after inflation accelerated to a six-year high, stoking
fears that workers’ purchasing power is being eroded. Consumer
prices rose 7.23 percent in August from a year. It was the
fastest pace since 2005.  Sao Jose dos Campos  is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from
the city of Sao Paulo. Factories in the region make auto parts,
electronic goods and machinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
