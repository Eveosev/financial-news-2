South Africa ’s Department of Public
Works will bring criminal charges against officials after
finding that the ministry “improperly” awarded more than 3
billion rand ($390 million) of contracts,  Minister Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde said.  A departmental investigation, in partnership with the
police’s Special Investigation Unit, revealed “a number of
serious irregularities” in the allocation of more than 40
tenders by the department, the Pretoria-based ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “We know of irregular expenditure, what appears to be
false book keeping and have discovered evidence of corruption by
department officials,” Mahlangu-Nkabinde said. “I would like
to see the justice system send a message to corrupt officials by
handing down stiff penalties for those found guilty of white-
collar crime.”  Africa’s largest economy is ranked as the fifth least
corrupt country on the continent, behind Botswana, Mauritius,
 Cape Verde  and Seychelles, according to Berlin-based
 Transparency International .  South Africa’s graft ombudsman Thuli Madonsela said in a
July 14 report that Mahlangu-Nkabinde didn’t cooperate with
investigations into the leases entered into for police
headquarters worth a total of 1.8 billion rand over 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
