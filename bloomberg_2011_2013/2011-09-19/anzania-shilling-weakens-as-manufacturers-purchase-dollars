Tanzania’s shilling weakened
against the dollar as manufacturers purchased the U.S. currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy lost
as much as 0.6 percent at 1,645 per dollar, and traded down 0.1
percent at 1,636.5 by 1:44 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial
capital.  “We have seen this morning more demand for the dollar
coming in from the manufacturing sector, particularly food and
beverages,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of
Commerce Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone
from Dar es Salaam.  Tanzania’s current-account deficit expanded 76 percent to
$1.2 billion in the second quarter compared with the previous
three months, the Bank of Tanzania said in an e-mailed report
today. Imports increased 20 percent to $2.3 billion, while
exports dropped 14 percent to $964.2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
