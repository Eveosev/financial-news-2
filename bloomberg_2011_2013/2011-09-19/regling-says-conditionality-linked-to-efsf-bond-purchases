Klaus Regling, head of the European
Financial Stability Facility, said the European bailout fund
will only be able to purchase sovereign debt on the secondary
market if “strict” conditions are adhered to.   “If the conditions aren’t met, there will be no action on
the secondary market,” Regling told budget committee lawmakers
in  Germany ’s lower house of parliament today in Berlin. He said
the EFSF’s expanded powers won’t enable it to begin a market
intervention without conditionality.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
