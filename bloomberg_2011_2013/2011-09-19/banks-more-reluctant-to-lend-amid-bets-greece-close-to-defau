A gauge of banks’ reluctance to
lend to each other in  Europe  rose for the first time in a week
amid renewed concern Greece is headed for a default.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the three-
month euro interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps, was
at 79.1 basis points as of 4:18 p.m. in London, from 75.3 at the
end of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s within six basis points of the highest level since March
2009, reached Sept. 12.  The  International Monetary Fund  and European Union are
reviewing whether Greece can meet the conditions of its
international bailout after a two-day meeting of finance
ministers failed to result in new measures to support the
region.  Greece ’s economy will shrink 5.5 percent this year and
then “notably” in 2012, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos
said in  Athens  today.  The cost for European lenders to fund in dollars was little
changed, after the  European Central Bank  coordinated with its
counterparts around the world last week to provide unlimited
dollar loans until year-end.  The cost of converting euro payments into dollars, measured
by the three-month cross-currency basis swap, was 92.9 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, from 87.1 basis
points on Sept. 16. The cost was 112.5 basis points under
Euribor a week ago, when the swap was the most expensive since
December 2008.  One-Year Swap  The cost of one-year dollar funding climbed, with the
cross-currency  basis swap  for that period at 66.7 basis points
less than Euribor, compared with 64.7 at the end of last week,
Bloomberg data show. The difference widened to as much as 78.8
basis points Sept. 12.  “The basis swap spread is important as it adds to already
substantial bank funding costs,”  Philip Gisdakis , a strategist
at UniCredit SpA in Munich, wrote in a note. “Although the
spread has declined on the back of the ECB intervention, it is
still very high.”  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- was little changed at 1.536
percent from 1.535 percent. One-week Euribor climbed to 1.125
percent, from 1.111 percent.  The three-month  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, in
dollars rose to 0.3525 percent from 0.35133 percent at the end
of last week, according to the British Bankers’ Association.
That’s the highest rate since Aug. 16, 2010. The dollar Libor-
OIS spread rose one basis point to 29.1 basis points in London,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits. Banks parked 111.5 billion euros ($152 billion) with
the ECB on Sept. 16, compared with 98 billion euros the day
before and 197.8 billion euros on Sept. 12, the Frankfurt-based
lender said in data released overnight.  Credit-Default Swaps  The cost of insuring European bank bonds rose, ending last
week’s declines.  Credit-default swaps insuring the subordinated debt of 25
European banks and insurers climbed 33 basis points to 498,
after dropping a record 70 basis points last week, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. The senior note index rose 28 basis points
to 293, after the biggest weekly drop since March 2008.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in investor perceptions of  credit quality .  To contact the reporters on this story:
