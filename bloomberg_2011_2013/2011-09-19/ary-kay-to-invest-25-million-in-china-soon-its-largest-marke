Mary Kay Inc., the cosmetics seller
famous for rewarding top sales agents with pink Cadillacs, plans
to invest $25 million to build a distribution center in  China ,
soon to be its largest market.  Mary Kay, which sells skin care and color cosmetics through
600,000 independent saleswomen in China, will this year start
building a distribution center in Hangzhou, the site of its only
overseas plant, Chief Executive Officer David Holl said in an
interview. Construction will last 12 months, he said.  The door-to-door seller of cosmetics is benefiting from
increased consumer buying power. Urban per capita disposable
income rose 13.2 percent in the first half and rural cash income
climbed 20.4 percent, China’s statistics bureau said in July.
The nation’s beauty and personal-care products market may
expand 58 percent between 2010 and 2015, to 255 billion yuan
($40 billion), according to Euromonitor International.  “True growth is coming from third- and fourth-tier
cities,” Holl said yesterday in southeastern Chinese city of
Nanjing, where he addressed about 40,000 sales agents in
seminars. “We don’t need a shopping mall to sell, so we can do
extremely well in cities where they don’t have all the
infrastructure.”  Mary Kay, which has invested about $100 million in China
since 1995, expects sales to increase 30 percent this year,
compared with 20 percent last year, Holl said. Global sales may
rise to $3 billion from $2.5 billion, and will expand by “low
double digits” in 2012, he said.  ‘Billion-Dollar’ Market  “We expect China to be a billion-dollar business and
surpass the U.S. next year or the year after,” Holl said.  The cosmetics market may grow as much as 14 percent in
tier-three cities in China, exceeding tier-one and tier-two
markets, which will see growth of about 2 percent and
8 percent respectively, according to Holl.  Mary Kay, based in Addison,  Texas , had a 2.9 percent share
in China’s beauty and personal-care market in 2010, ranking
seventh, data from London-based Euromonitor show.  Procter &
Gamble Co . led with a 16.6 percent share.  China introduced a new direct-selling law in 2005 that
regulates agents’ compensation and the size of sales meetings,
according to the commerce ministry. There are 28 direct-sales
companies with approved licenses and verified business-service
network records, the ministry’s  website  showed.  Mary Kay, which awards top saleswomen in China with pink
Mercedes C- and E-Class cars, operates in all but six provinces
in the world’s second-largest economy. It has tailored products
to local-customer needs to help expand market share and reduce
reliance on the U.S. market, Holl said.  Standalone China  “Over the course of last five to eight years, we’ve
started to look at what China will need in five years,” said
Holl, 51. “We’ve managed the transition so that it’s no longer
all about the U.S.”  Holl, who took over as CEO in April 2006, has more than
doubled revenue and expanded into 14 new markets, bringing the
total to 35 worldwide.  The company, founded by Mary Kay Ash with $5,000 in savings
in 1963, has about 2.2 million saleswomen worldwide. It entered
 India  in 2007,  Singapore  in 2009 and  Armenia  in 2010, and is
looking at Vietnam, Thailand and  Turkey  as potential markets,
Holl said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
