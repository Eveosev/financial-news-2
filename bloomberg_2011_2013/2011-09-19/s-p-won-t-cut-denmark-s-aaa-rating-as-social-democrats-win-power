Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
said it won’t cut  Denmark ’s AAA rating after the government last
week lost re-election to the Social Democratic-led opposition,
which has pledged to raise taxes and spend more on welfare.  “We expect the yet-to-be-formed government will pursue a
strategy of containing fiscal imbalances, with an increased
emphasis on revenue-side measures,” the rating company said
today in a statement published from  London .   The new government, which will be led by Denmark’s first
female prime minister, has pledged to spend 21 billion kroner
($3.9 billion) more a year than the outgoing administration of
Lars Loekke Rasmussen to spur a turn-around in the economy.  Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who will form a government within
the next two weeks, campaigned on a platform of higher taxes for
banks and the rich and more spending on schools and hospitals,
policies that Rasmussen said will jeopardize Denmark’s AAA
credit rating. S&P said today additional spending could
undermine fiscal consolidation “over the medium term,”
especially if the economy grows less than the government
expects.  “That said, the ratings on Denmark continue to be
supported by a strong track record of commitment to fiscal
discipline and prudent macroeconomic policies, as well as a
prosperous and diverse economy,” S&P said.  The new government will show fiscal restraint and bring
down the country’s budget deficit down to 3 percent of gross
domestic product to meet European Union requirements, Morten
Boedskov, the Social Democrats’ finance spokesman, said in an
interview last week after the election.   To contact the reporter on this story:
