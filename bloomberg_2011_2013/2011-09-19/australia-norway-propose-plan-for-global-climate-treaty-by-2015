Australia and Norway proposed a
plan that would result in a new legally binding global climate-
protection agreement by 2015.  Developed and developing nations would “formalize”
targets and actions they are taking at a climate meeting in
November in Durban,  South Africa , the two nations said in a
joint  submission  to the United Nations Framework Convention on
 Climate Change  in Bonn.  Nations would then spend about four years updating those
targets and increasing their ambition, according to the report
published on the UNFCCC website. In 2015, nations would “embed
mitigation targets and actions into a new legally binding
protocol for all parties.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
