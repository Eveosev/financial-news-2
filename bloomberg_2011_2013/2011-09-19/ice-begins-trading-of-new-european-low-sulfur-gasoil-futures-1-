IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s
European unit began trading a new low-sulfur gasoil futures
contract today as the use of cleaner fuels increases in  Europe .  Low-sulfur gasoil for delivery in January fell $6.25 to
$959.50 a metric ton as of 2:04 p.m. London time on the ICE
Futures Europe Exchange after 1,004 contracts traded, ICE data
showed. Higher-sulfur gasoil for January fell $1 to $936.50 on
ICE, while the front-month October contract was down $11.25 at
$939.25.  The low-sulfur product is based on a diesel-barge
 specification  of 10 parts sulfur per million, or ppm, the
exchange said. ICE also introduced options and 13 over-the-
counter swap contracts related to the grade.  “The contract will meet long-term hedging requirements in
the global distillate market, and especially in Europe which is
increasingly moving toward a low-sulfur, 10 ppm diesel grade,”
David Peniket, president and chief operating officer of ICE
Futures Europe, said in a  statement  on Aug. 16.  ICE will keep its higher-sulfur gasoil contract, which has
a specification of 1,000 ppm, through January 2015, the bourse
said at the time.  Germany , Europe’s largest heating market, is encouraging
sales of gasoil with 50 ppm sulfur instead of grades with a
higher content of the pollutant. Gasoil is a category of fuel
that includes heating oil and diesel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
