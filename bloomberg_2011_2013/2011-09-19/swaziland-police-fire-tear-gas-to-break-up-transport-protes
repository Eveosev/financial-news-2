Swaziland’s police fired tear gas
to break up a protest by bus and taxi operators in Manzini, the
country’s commercial capital, said Mduduzi Gina, secretary-
general of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions.  About 1,500 operators burned tires in the city’s streets to
demand the government reverse an increase in traffic fines, Gina
said in an interview today. Thousands of commuters were left
stranded, he said.  The southern African nation, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s last
absolute monarchy, is in a fiscal crisis and struggling to meet
its expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
