A 2009 study by the Political 
Economy Research
Institute at the  University of Massachusetts  at Amherst finds 
that $1 billion spent on U.S. defense produces fewer jobs than 
the same amount invested in clean energy, health care, education
or tax cuts.  Bloomberg's Megan Hughes reports from Washington. Mark 
Crumpton also speaks. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 02:21
