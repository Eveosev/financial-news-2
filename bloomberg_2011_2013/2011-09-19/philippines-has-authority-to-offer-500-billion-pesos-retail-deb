The Philippines received the
“borrowing authority” from President  Benigno Aquino  to issue
as much as 500 billion pesos of bonds targeted to individuals or
so-called retail bonds starting next quarter, Treasurer  Roberto
Tan  told reporters today.  The size of the offering will depend on demand, Tan said,
adding the Treasury has “started sounding off” potential
arrangers for the planned bond sale. The government is seeing
some “normalization” in longer-maturity bonds and even in the
bills auctioned today, Tan said. Bids for 182-day notes were
“unreasonable,” he said. Problems in the euro zone and a
weakening peso led to higher borrowing costs today, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
