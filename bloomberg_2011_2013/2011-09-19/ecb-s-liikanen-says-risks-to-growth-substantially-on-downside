European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen said risks to economic growth in
the region are “substantially” on the downside.  “At its September meeting, the Governing Council of the
ECB decided to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged,”
the Bank of  Finland , which Liikanen heads, said in a statement
in Helsinki today. “However, the Governing Council changed its
view of the risks to economic activity in the euro area.”
Liikanen added: “The risks to economic growth are substantially
on the downside.”  The ECB’s Sept. 8 policy statement didn’t use the word
“substantially” to describe downside risks to growth. Liikanen
also said  Europe ’s debt crisis has taken on “systemic
dimensions” and that there’s a risk of the global economy
slipping into another recession. The bank of Finland said global
growth of less than 2 percent constitutes a recession.  “In order for the economic slowdown to remain temporary as
forecast, confidence must be boosted quickly,” Liikanen said.  The ECB this month kept its benchmark  interest rate  on hold
at 1.5 percent. At the same time, the bank lowered its 2011
growth forecast for the 17-nation currency bloc to 1.6 percent
from 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
