Corn declined, extending the
biggest weekly slump in three months, as investors reduced bets
prices will rise on concern that global economic growth may
weaken and damp demand for commodities.  December-delivery corn lost as much as 0.9 percent to $6.86
a bushel, the lowest-price for the most-active contract on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade since Aug. 10, and traded at $6.8625 a
bushel at 3:08 p.m. Singapore time, extending last week’s 6
percent loss, the most since the five days ended June 17.  Managed money cut their net-long positions in corn by 10
percent to 298,333 contracts in the week to Sept. 13, the lowest
level since Aug. 23, according to data from the U.S. Commodity
futures Trading Commission. Funds were net-short in wheat by
11,150 contracts, after being net-long by 13,495 contracts a
week earlier. Short positions are bets prices will decline.  “Wider concerns about the state of the global economy and
fears of sluggish demand for U.S. corn continue to weigh on
values,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, said in a report e-mailed today.  Finance chiefs from the euro region said last week that the
18-month debt crisis leaves no room for tax cuts or extra
spending to spur an economy on the brink of stagnation. Economic
reports on  Germany  this week are forecast to show a decline in
investor confidence and a slowdown in manufacturing in  Europe ’s
largest economy.  More Declines  Sixteen of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
Chicago on Sept. 16 forecast that corn will fall for a fourth
straight week, and 17 respondents said soybeans will drop after
last week’s biggest decline in six months.  While corn futures have fallen in the past three weeks,
they are still 35 percent higher than a year ago, curbing
profitability of poultry and livestock raisers.  High prices of feed grains have hurt margins for meat
producers in  Mexico , the U.S. Grains Council said in a Sept. 16
report e-mailed today. “We’ll need to see price breaks soon in
order to maintain demand,” it said. Mexico is forecast to be
the world’s second-largest corn buyer after  Japan  in 2011-2012,
 according  to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Wheat for December delivery declined as much as 0.7 percent
to $6.8325 a bushel, the lowest price for the most-active
contract in Chicago since Aug. 9. Soybeans for November delivery
fell as much as 0.9 percent to $13.4375 a bushel, the lowest
since Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
