European manufacturing production
rose 4.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
though output “was almost unchanged compared to the first
quarter,” the European Commission said.  “Manufacturing production in recent months has been
affected by supply disruptions stemming from the Japanese
tsunami,” the commission said today in a report.
“Manufacturing output is now some 14 percent higher than its
trough in early 2009 and still 8 percent below its peak in early
2008.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
