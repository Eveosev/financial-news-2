Sudan  expects income from tourism
to increase 20 percent this year due to increased stability and
following investment in the industry following the secession of
its southern region.  The African nation expects to earn $739 million from
foreign visitors this year, up from $616 million in 2010, Ali
Mahgoub Ata, an official at the Ministry of Tourism, told
reporters today in the capital, Khartoum.  “The relative political stability the country enjoyed
after southern secession and the instability the whole region is
witnessing due to the ‘Arab Spring’ have increased Sudan’s
opportunity as a tourist destination,” he said.  The number of foreign visitors is expected to climb from
550,000 in 2010 to 665,000 in 2011, according to Ata. There were
140,000 hotel visitors last year.  Sudan plans to expand  tourism industry  to regions like
Kassala in eastern Sudan and the Red Sea coast “to compensate
for revenue lost when the South seceded,” he said. Sudan, which
produces about 115,000 barrels a day of oil, lost control of
about 375,000 barrels of daily production to South Sudan when it
was declared independent.  More than 160 local and foreign companies invest in
Sudanese tourism, according to Ata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
