Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  Chairman Dumisa Ntsebeza
quit the board of the South African media company along with
two non-executive independent directors, Tom Wixley and Babalwa Ngonyama.  “Shareholders have interfered with the affairs of the
board,” Wixley said at the annual general meeting in
Johannesburg today. “It is their company, I acknowledge that.
But once a board has been put in place it must be allowed to run
the company,” he said, declining further comment.  Ntsebeza declined to say why he stepped down, while
Ngonyama, who was appointed in July, didn’t attend the meeting.
The three directors were up for reappointment and declined to
seek re-election. Avusa publishes  South Africa ’s Sunday Times,
has a stake in Business Day, distributes films and sells books.  The management of Avusa, which was the subject of a failed
buyout bid from a group led by private equity firm Capitau
Holdings Ltd., has had public disagreements with shareholder
 Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  over the media company’s acquisition last
year of Universal Print Group and Hirt.  Mvela, Avusa’s largest shareholder, had opposed the
transaction, citing dilution of its stake, which was 25.5
percent at the time. The deal, a combination of new shares and
cash, was approved by other shareholders, resulting in
Mvelaphanda’s stake dropping to 21.3 percent, according to the
company’s  latest annual report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
