The International Monetary Fund’s
resident representative in  Greece  said the country needed to
take additional measures going forward to reduce the  budget
deficit  to a sustainable level.  There is no doubt the immediate challenge is in the fiscal
area, the IMF’s Bob Traa said at a conference in Athens today.
Memorandums aren’t “written in stone” and new challenges come
along every day, he said.  He added that it was “appropriate and important” to
underline that the IMF disagreed with the view that the program
carried out by the government has been unsuccessful to date.  “Impressive fiscal consolidation has happened,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
