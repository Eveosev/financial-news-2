Most Danish home owners wouldn’t
use tax benefits given them by a new government to spend more
and would instead pay down their mortgages faster, newspaper
Politiken said, citing a survey conducted by realtor EDC.  Of those surveyed, 31 percent would pay down their debt
faster next year if they were given extra funds, 23 percent
would save or invest the money, while 22 percent would spend
more on consumer goods, Politiken said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
