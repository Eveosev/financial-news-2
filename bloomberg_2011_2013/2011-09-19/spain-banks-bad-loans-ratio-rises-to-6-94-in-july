Defaults as a proportion of total
lending at Spanish banks rose in July to the highest in 17 years
as a slowing economy made it harder for clients to repay loans.  The bad loans ratio rose to 6.94 percent, the highest level
since 1994, from 6.69 percent in June, the Bank of  Spain  said
today on its website. Defaults increased to 124.7 billion euros
($170 billion) from 121.6 billion euros, the regulator said.  Bad loans have piled up on the books of Spanish banks,
forcing them to set aside about 100 billion euros of provisions
since 2008 as the country struggles to emerge from a real-estate
crash that sparked the worst recession in 60 years. Inigo Vega,
a Spanish banks analyst at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux, said in a
Sept. 15 report he didn’t expect bad loans to peak “any time
soon” as corporate insolvencies keep growing.  Slowing growth in Spain as the European debt crisis pushes
up the country’s borrowing costs may mean bad loans continue to
grow in an economy where the  unemployment rate  tops 21 percent.
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said Sept. 14 that
Spain might miss its 1.3 percent growth target this year because
of the “situation of financial tension and economic
uncertainty, mainly because of  Greece .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
