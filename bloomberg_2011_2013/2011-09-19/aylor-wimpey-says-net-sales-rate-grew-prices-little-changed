Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K.’s
second-largest homebuilder by volume, said its second-half sales
rate is higher than a year earlier and prices are stable.  The average selling price of its homes will be little
changed and its operating margin will be more than 10 percent in
2012, the London-based company said in a statement today. The
company sold 14,272 homes last year.  “Net sales rates for the second half to date are above the
relatively weak 2010 comparatives, with encouraging signs of the
normal seasonal pick-up in sales rates over the last few
weeks,” Taylor Wimpey said. The company is hosting
presentations for analysts and investors today.  Home sellers in London raised asking prices by the most in
seven months in September as a lack of supply and investors
seeking safe assets bolstered values, Rightmove Plc said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
