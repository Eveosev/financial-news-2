Former commodities trader Ray Bartoszek, who considered investing in the  New York Mets , bought
a piece of the  New York Yankees  instead, a person familiar with
the transaction said today.  Bartoszek, formerly with Glencore International Plc.,
bought a piece of a minority owner’s share of the 27-time World
Series champions, said the person, who was granted anonymity
because he isn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  Bartoszek had been in talks to buy the minority share of
the Yankees for four to five months, said the person, who
declined to say how much of the team was involved or how much
was paid.  The Yankees are worth $1.7 billion, according to  Forbes ,
which first reported Bartoszek’s investment in the team. The
Steinbrenner family controls the majority ownership of the
Yankees.  Bartoszek backed out of buying a third of the Mets after
the team was unwilling to include of piece of its regional
sports network, SportsNet New York, in the transaction.  The Mets announced an agreement with hedge-fund manager
 David Einhorn , who later said the deal collapsed because  Fred Wilpon  tried to change terms. Wilpon owns the team with Saul Katz, his brother-in-law.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
