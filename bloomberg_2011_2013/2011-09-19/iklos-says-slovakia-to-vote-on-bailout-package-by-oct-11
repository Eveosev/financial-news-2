The Slovak vote on proposed changes
to  Europe ’s bailout mechanism should be linked to a confidence
motion against the government to secure their passage, Finance
Minister Ivan Miklos said.  The vote shall take place by Oct. 11, Miklos said at a
conference in Bratislava, Slovakia today. Freedom and
Solidarity, whose votes the government needs to secure a
parliamentary majority, won’t support the proposed measures,
Chairman Richard Sulik reiterated today.  The Slovak four-party ruling coalition remains divided on
whether to support the package, which includes bolstering the
eurozone’s temporary bailout fund and extending its powers.  Linking the vote to a confidence motion raises chances
Sulik’s party will approve the plan in order to keep the
administration of Iveta Radicova in power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
