The Czech Republic’s equity index
fell to the lowest in more than two years, led by declines in
banking stocks and  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s biggest power utility,
on concern that Europe can’t manage Greece’s debt crisis.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slid 4.2 percent, or 40.2, to
close at 910.3 in Prague, the lowest since July 13, 2009. The
benchmark has lost about 13 percent in the last month.  CEZ AS (CEZ CP) retreated 5.5 percent to 700 koruna, the
lowest since March 2009. Czech Premier Petr Necas in an
interview for Mlada Fronta Dnes criticized the utility’s past
foreign acquisitions, calling for a further management reshuffle
at the state-controlled company.  Czech Minister of Trade and Industry Martin Kocourek also
told Bloomberg News today the state will seek to build
additional nuclear reactors at CEZ’s Dukovany site in the coming
years as part of a new energy strategy proposal.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   declined 6.1 percent to 483.7
koruna. Erste Group Bank’s capital position is a “weakness” of
eastern Europe’s second-biggest lender’s  credit rating  and it
needs to strengthen its buffers against credit risk, Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services said today.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , a unit of France’s Societe
Generale, dropped 6.3 percent to 2,999 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
