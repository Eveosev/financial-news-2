Pennsylvania won’t take over
Pittsburgh’s pension system because the  retirement plan  can pay
62 percent of its promised benefits, a decision that will
forestall higher city payments.  Had the Public Employee Retirement Commission today deemed
the system under 50 percent funded, the Pennsylvania Municipal
Retirement System would have taken it over, as state law
requires. That might have meant higher costs.  To prevent loss of control, the City Council in December
pledged $736 million in parking revenue through 2041 to the
pension fund. As a result, the system’s assets hit $632 million,
said James McAneny, executive director of the retirement
commission, who cited figures from the fund’s custodian, PNC
Institutional Investments.  “This is extremely good news for the people of
Pittsburgh,” Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said in a statement. “This
is a critical step for us as we get closer to completing our
financial recovery.”  Pittsburgh, the state’s second-largest city by population,
is among municipal governments facing gaps between assets and
obligations to workers. National estimates on unfunded
liabilities vary depending on assumptions and range from $700
billion to more than $3 trillion.  Standard & Poor’s  in April revised its outlook on
Pittsburgh debt to negative from stable because of the rising
financial pressures tied to the pension system.  To contact the reporter on this story: Romy Varghese in
