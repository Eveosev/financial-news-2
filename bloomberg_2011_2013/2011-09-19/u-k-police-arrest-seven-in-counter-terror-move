Seven people were arrested in a
counter-terrorism operation in the central English city of
Birmingham, where Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg ’s Liberal
Democrats are holding their annual conference.  Unarmed officers arrested six men between 11:30 p.m.
yesterday and 1 a.m. today, and a woman was detained at 6:30
a.m. today, West Midlands Police said in a statement published
on its website.  “The operation is in its early stage so we are unable to
go into detail about the nature of the suspected offences,”
Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale said.  The police force said the arrests had no link with the
Liberal Democrat conference. The arrests were conducted under
the Terrorism Act 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
