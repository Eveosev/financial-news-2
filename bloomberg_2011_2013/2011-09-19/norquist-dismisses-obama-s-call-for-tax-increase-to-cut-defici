Anti-tax activist  Grover Norquist 
dismissed President  Barack Obama ’s proposed tax increase on the
wealthy, saying it amounts to “declaring war” on savings and
investments.  Norquist, head of the advocacy group Americans for  Tax
Reform , said the proposal Obama unveiled this morning was a
“campaign speech” and “isn’t going to happen” before next
year’s elections. Norquist’s comments came in an interview with
Bloomberg Television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
