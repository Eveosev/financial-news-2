China  may relax tightening policies
in the first or second quarter next year as the slowdown in
economic growth will likely exceed market expectations and the
inflation rate eases to the government’s target, according to
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  The Chinese economy may grow more slowly than expected
because of a slowdown in the global economy and government
measures to curb the  property market , analysts led by  Li Huiyong 
wrote in a report today.  Inflation rates may slow to around 4 percent in April next
year, it said. The government may first lower reserve
requirement ratios for small- and medium-sized financial
institutions and increase investment to “structural change”
areas of the economy, according to the report.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index may trade between 2,300
and 2,700 in the fourth quarter, Ling Peng, a strategist at the
brokerage, wrote in the report today. Shenyin & Wanguo
recommends consumer-related stocks and financial companies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
