California-blend gasoline’s premium
to futures slipped as demand for motor fuels slowed after the
summer driving season’s end.  The premium for Carbob in  Los Angeles  fell 4.5 cents to
13.5 cents versus gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 4:21 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery dropped 13.26 cents
to $2.8315 a gallon.  “We’re now post-Labor Day, so you see demand start coming
off quite a bit,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “When all the refineries are
running, there’s more than adequate product supply.”  The premium for Carbob in  San Francisco  fell 4.5 cents to
12.5 cents a gallon.  “According to California figures, gasoline demand is off
about 4 percent year on year,” Lipow said. “More often than
not we’ve seen this year that gasoline prices are under
pressure.”  California refiners were freed Sept. 15 from summer-blend
fuel requirements that cap the Reid vapor pressure, a measure of
volatility, on fuel made for use during the season.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland, Oregon, fell for the first day in four, dropping 2.5
cents to 27.5 cents versus futures. The premium strengthened
last week after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said it began a
maintenance turnaround at its Anacortes refinery in Washington
that will run through early November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
