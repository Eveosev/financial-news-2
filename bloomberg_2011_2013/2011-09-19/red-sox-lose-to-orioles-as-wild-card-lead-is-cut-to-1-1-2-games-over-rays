The  Boston  Red Sox lost to the
Baltimore Orioles 6-5 and had their lead in the American League
wild-card race cut to 1 1/2 games over the Tampa Bay Rays.  The loss was the third in a row and 10th in 12 games for
the Red Sox, who are 4-14 in September.  The game at Fenway Park in Boston was the opener of a day-
night doubleheader. The Rays are idle today before opening a
four-game series with the Yankees in  New York  tomorrow.  The wild-card playoff berth goes to the second-place team
with the best record.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
