LG Electronics Inc. is seeking to
triple its solar-panel manufacturing capacity by 2013 to become
one of the 10 biggest producers,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
Michael Harre, head of LGâ€™s European solar unit.  LG plans to increase annual production of solar cells and
modules at its plant in  South Korea  to 500 megawatts next year
and 1,000 megawatts by 2013, from 330 megawatts today, the
newspaper said, citing an interview with Harre.  The company also wants to expand into silicon output, the
raw material for photovoltaic products, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
