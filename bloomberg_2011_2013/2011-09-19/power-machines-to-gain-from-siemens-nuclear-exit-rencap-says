OAO Power Machines, Russian
billionaire Alexey Mordashov’s turbine manufacturer, will
benefit from  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s decision to stop production of
nuclear-power equipment,  Renaissance Capital  said.  Siemens said yesterday it will withdraw from nuclear power
production as Germany decided to abandon the atomic industry by
2022 after the Fukushima catastrophe in  Japan  earlier this year.
Siemens will drop plans to work with Russia’s Rosatom Corp.,
Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher told  Der Spiegel .  “The news is positive for Power Machines shares,” said
analysts Mikhail Sheplev and Mikhail Safin at RenCap in Moscow.
It “will leave a gap to be filled by its competitors,
potentially including Power Machines, which will allow the
latter to increase its market presence and order book.”  Power Machines may try to take Siemens’ place in Rosatom’s
projects to make, install and service equipment for nuclear
plants in  Russia  and abroad, the analysts wrote in a note. OAO
Severstal’s main owner and CEO Mordashov holds more than 70
percent of Power Machines and received Russian antitrust
approval on Sept. 15 to buy out stakes held by other owners,
including Siemens’ 25 percent holding in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
