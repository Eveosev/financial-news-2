An attack by suspected  Liberian 
mercenaries in the southwest  Ivory Coast  village of Zriglo left
23 people dead, according to Ivorian army Captain Alla Kouakou.  The fighting happened overnight on Sept. 15, Kouakou said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. The dead include 22 residents
of the area, he said. One army officer was killed and another
injured.  Suspected mercenaries from Liberia took part in violent
clashes in Ivory Coast following that country’s disputed
presidential election in November. In June, James Victor Gbeho,
president of the Economic Community of West African States’
commission, expressed concern about the fighters destabilizing
Liberia before its own election next month.  The  United Nations  and the Ivorian army plan to deploy more
troops to the area where the attacks took place, Kouakou said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
