Cargill Inc., the U.S.’s largest
closely held company, and Grupo USJ, a Brazilian sugar-cane
processor, plan to triple sugar-cane processing capacity in the
South American nation to 15 million metric tons by 2020.  The companies’ SJC Bioenergia venture has no immediate
plans for acquisitions, Marcelo de Andrade, Cargill’s director
for the sugar and ethanol business in  Brazil , said today in a
telephone interview from  Sao Paulo .  “We plan to invest money generated by our mills for future
expansions,” he said, without elaborating how much will be
invested.  SJC Bioenergia, where Cargill and USJ each hold 50 percent,
own two plants in Brazil’s Goias state that process 5 million
tons of cane a year.  Cargill has one mill in Patrocinio Paulista, Brazil, in
partnership with local producers that can process 3 million tons
of cane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
