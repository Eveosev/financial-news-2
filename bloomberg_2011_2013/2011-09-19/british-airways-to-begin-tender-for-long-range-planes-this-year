British Airways will begin a tender
later this year to evaluate replacements for its 55 aging  Boeing
Co. (BA)  747 jumbo jets, of which it’s the world’s biggest operator,
fleet manager Alexander Grant said today in Barcelona.  BA will assess the merits of Airbus SAS’s A350-1000, the
biggest version of the European company’s latest widebody, and
two Boeing offerings, the planned 787-10, a stretch of the new
Dreamliner, and the 777-9X re-winged development of the 777.  “We have a major challenge ahead of us in terms of
assessing the opportunities out there,” Grant said today at the
International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading conference.
“All of those aircraft are going to be in a competition which
we’ll be running later this year to really see what we can do.”  British Airways currently has 50 747s in service, plus five
in storage. Some of the planes will be displaced by the arrival
of 12 Airbus A380 superjumbos starting in 2013. The London-based
company also has 24 787-8s and -9s on order, though has yet to
agree delivery dates, according to spokesman Philip Allport.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, created in
January from the merger of BA and Iberia, announced its first
plane deal in March, ordering eight Airbus A330 aircraft worth
$1.8 billion at list price for the Spanish unit. Chief Executive
Officer  Willie Walsh  has earmarked fleet purchases as an area
where the combined company aims to achieve economies of scale.  Jumbo Successor  BA’s 747-400s, built to a four-decade-old design, currently
carry as many 345 people in a four-class seating configuration,
according to the company’s website. Grant didn’t mention the
747-8 Intercontinental, the successor to the jumbo which Boeing
aims to get certified and into service by the year’s end. The
carrier has orders for three freighter versions of the plane.  The 330-seat 787-10 could enter service by 2016,  Jim Albaugh , Boeing’s commercial airplanes chief, said in June at
the  Paris Air Show . He added that it would be a “surprise” if
the plane wasn’t built, though no decision had been made.  The larger Dreamliner would provide a rival for Airbus’s
A350-900 and steal a march on the -1000, which won’t be ready
until 2017, according to a schedule announced June 18. The A350
models will be able to carry between 250 and 400 passengers.  Boeing’s decision to re-engine its 737 single-aisle plane
rather than build an all-new model has freed up resources to
develop the 787-10, marketing chief  Randy Tinseth  said today.  “We’re seeing more and more interest from customers on what
the -10 might be able to do,” he said at the ISTAT event.  The 777-9X is the working name for a plane Boeing may build
to improve on the 777-300ER, offering as many as 415 seats.
There’s no rush to reach a decision on the project, with the
existing 777 outselling the newer A350-1000, Tinseth said.  “We continue to look at what the design-space would look
like for that next 777 product, whether it be minor improvements
or major improvements or a new airplane,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
