The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 8.5 basis points to
180.5 basis points as of 11:08 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. Thatâ€™s the first increase in five trading days
and puts the index on course for its biggest daily rise since
Sept. 12, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 7 basis points to 169.5 basis
points as of 9:08 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank prices show.  It is a public holiday today in Japan.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
