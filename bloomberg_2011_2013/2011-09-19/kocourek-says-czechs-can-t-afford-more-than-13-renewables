The  Czech Republic  can’t afford to
increase the share of renewable energy sources in its energy mix
beyond the 13 percent it pledged to have by 2020 as part of
European Union’s clean energy policy, Industry and Trade
Minister Martin Kocourek said today at a conference in Prague.  “We will fulfill our obligation to have 13 percent of
renewables by 2020, but I’m afraid we can’t afford to expand it
further in the future,” he said. The Czech government has “big
doubts” about expanding the capacity of biomass  power plants 
while the country has already fulfilled its potential for power
generation from other renewable resources, the minister said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
