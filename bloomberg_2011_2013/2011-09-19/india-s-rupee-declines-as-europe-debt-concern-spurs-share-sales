India ’s rupee fell, snapping a two-
day advance, after foreign investors pulled money from the
nation’s stocks on concern  Europe ’s debt problems will hurt
global economic growth.  The currency and local stocks declined the most in a week
after Europe’s finance chiefs said Sept. 16 that the region’s
weak public finances leave no room for tax cuts or extra
spending. Overseas funds cut holdings of Indian equities by
$211.5 million in the first four days of last week, exchange
data show.  “The main driver of the rupee is global  risk aversion ,”
said  Roy Paul , a Mumbai-based deputy general manager of fixed
income and currencies at Federal Bank Ltd. “We may see reduced
inflows and charts indicate the rupee may fall” further.  The rupee weakened 1.1 percent to 47.8075 per dollar at the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest decline since Sept. 12. The currency fell to
a two-year low of 48.02 on Sept. 14.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 48.45 in
three months, compared with expectations of 47.95 on Sept. 16.
