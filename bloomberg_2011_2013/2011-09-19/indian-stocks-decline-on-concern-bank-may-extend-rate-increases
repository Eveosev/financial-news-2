Indian stocks ended a three-day
rally on concern the central bank may extend a record series of
interest-rate increases to combat inflation even amid signs
growth is slowing.  Unitech Ltd. (UT)  fell after  Telenor ASA (TEL) , the biggest Nordic
phone company, said it has started a process to raise up to 80
billion rupees in its venture with  India ’s second-biggest
developer.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) , India’s biggest
drugmaker by market value, fell after saying the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration has resolved its warning letter after re-
inspecting the company’s plant in New Jersey.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 1.1 percent
to 16,750.24, the most since Sept. 12, according to preliminary
closing prices in Mumbai. The measure rose for a third straight
week in the five days ended Sept. 16. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on
the National Stock Exchange of India dropped 1 percent to
5,032.55. The BSE 200 Index fell 0.9 percent to 2,076.60.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised its repurchase rate Sept.
16 for a 12th time since March 2010, a move that contrasts with
Brazil and  Russia , which cut borrowing costs in the past month,
while  China  has paused rate increases since early July. Higher
food and fuel costs, and a weak rupee, may keep inflation at
more than 9 percent, a level breached in each of the last nine
months. Indian Oil Corp. raised the price of gasoline by 3.14
rupees a liter on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
