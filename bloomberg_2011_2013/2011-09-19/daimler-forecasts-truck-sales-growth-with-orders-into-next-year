Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest
maker of heavy-duty vehicles, expects truck sales to keep
growing, even as economies show signs of cooling, as customers
order vehicles into next year.  Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler sold 39,090 trucks in
August, the highest monthly level of deliveries since late 2008,
 Andreas Renschler , head of the Daimler Trucks division, said
today. Eight-month sales rose 18 percent to 259,618 units.  “The trend is unequivocally positive,” Renschler told
reporters at a briefing in Muensingen, Germany, where Daimler
presented a revamped version of its long-haul Actros model. “By
and large, signs we’re getting from customers are encouraging.”  Daimler forecasts its own truck sales will increase
annually by about 14 percent to over 500,000 vehicles by 2013 as
the company expands in  China ,  Russia  and  India , Renschler said.
The European market as a whole may grow 35 percent to 40 percent
this year, while the U.S. may expand 30 percent to 35 percent.  “So far we’re not feeling a strong impact” from slowing
economies, the executive said, noting that Daimler wants to
increase its return on sales to 8 percent by 2013 from 6.9
percent in the first half.  European sales of heavy trucks weighing 16 tons or more
surged 56 percent in the first six months to almost 120,000,
powered by growth in markets including Germany, France and the
U.K., the  European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association  said.  Renschler said Daimler’s position on  Fiat SpA (F) ’s Iveco
truckmaking unit is “unchanged,” noting that there are no
talks about acquiring Iveco as the German manufacturer has
“other interests.”  Larger Stake  Daimler may over time decide to expand its holding in OAO
KamAZ, depending on how conditions in Russia develop, the
executive said. Daimler currently owns 15 percent of the Russian
truckmaker.  “I cannot rule out that in ten years time we may perhaps
hold 60, 70 or 80 percent,” Renschler said.  Daimler expects to win final approval from the Chinese
government to start a joint venture with Beiqi Foton Motor Co.
by the end of this year. Cooperation with Beiqi Foton may allow
the truckmaker to build over 100,000 of the Auman truck per
year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
