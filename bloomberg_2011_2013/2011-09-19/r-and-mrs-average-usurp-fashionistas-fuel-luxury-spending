Fashion enthusiasts are cutting
back.  The shoppers that make up the top five percent of annual
purchases reduced spending on luxury apparel and accessories by
22 percent in  Japan , 14 percent in the U.K. and  Australia , 10
percent in  France  and 1 percent in  Hong Kong  in the first half,
American Express Business Insights said in a report.  Mainstream consumers stepped into the breach, shelling out
more on luxury goods and leading to a doubling of spending in
the U.S., according to the report published today.  “Average consumers have started to replace existing
clothes and accessories again, while enthusiasts are delaying
the purchase of new items,” American Express Business Insights
said in a statement. “Fashionistas step aside for Mr. and Mrs.
Average.”  In the U.K., mainstream shoppers lifted spending on luxury
fashion by 27 percent and on jewelry by 65 percent in the first
half. Consumers aged 18 to 29, or Generation Y, are showing
great appetite for luxury fashion, even though they are still a
minority group, the study shows.  The spending drop from the “enthusiast” group was led by
men, who “are shying away from luxury fashion spending in
2011,” the report said. They spent 11 percent less in the U.S.  The study is based on actual, aggregated spending data from
the first half, compared with the same period last year,
American Express Business Insights said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
