Kulczyk Investments, controlled by
Polish billionaire  Jan Kulczyk , and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  will
jointly search for gold in Afghanistan,  Puls Biznesu  reported,
citing a person close to the Polish company.  Kulczyk bought a stake in a company called Centar, taking
the post of chief executive officer, while JPMorgan’s Ian Hannam
was named his deputy, the newspaper said. Centar’s first
investment was to buy 50 percent of Afghan Gold & Minerals,
which has a license to prospect for gold, Puls reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
