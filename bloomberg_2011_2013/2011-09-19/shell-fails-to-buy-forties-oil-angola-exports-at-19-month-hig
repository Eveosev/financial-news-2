Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to buy
North Sea Forties crude at a lower premium to Dated Brent. Vitol
Group sought to buy Russian Urals oil in the Mediterranean
without success.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, plans to
increase its daily crude oil exports to the most in 19 months,
according to a preliminary loading plan obtained by Bloomberg
News.  North Sea  Shell was unable to buy Forties at $1.80 a barrel more than
Dated Brent for Oct. 3 to Oct. 6 loading, or a premium of $1.70
to the benchmark for Oct. 6 to Oct. 9, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window. The
grade was last bid at $2.00 more than Dated Brent on Sept. 15.  BP Plc failed to sell a shipment for Oct. 6 to Oct. 8 at
$3.10 more than the cash cost for  North Sea  crudes for November,
and Vitol didn’t manage to buy at a premium of $1.50 to Dated
Brent for Oct. 10 to Oct. 12, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days was at $2.10 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, down from the record high of $2.15 on
Sept. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for November settlement traded at $109.66 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, down from $112.02 on Sept. 16. The December contract was
at $108.61 a barrel, $1.05 less than November.  BP resumed operations at its North Sea Valhall oil and gas
field on Sept. 17 after being shut for almost two months
following a fire, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  “Exports from BP’s Valhall production and compression
platform restarted on Sept. 17 and will continue to ramp up over
the coming days,” said  Matt Taylor , an Aberdeen, Scotland-based
spokesman for the company. “All reviews and assurances were
completed successfully.”  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol failed to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for Oct. 4
to Oct. 8 delivery to the Mediterranean at parity to Dated
Brent, the survey showed. The grade was last sold at a discount
of 40 cents a barrel on Sept. 12.  No bids or offers were made for Urals in northwest Europe.
On Sept. 16, Shell sold 100,000 tons of Urals for Oct. 6 to Oct.
10 delivery to Rotterdam to Statoil ASA at a discount of 10
cents a barrel to Dated Brent.  West Africa  Angola will ship 57 cargoes totaling 54.4 million barrels,
or 1.81 million barrels a day in November, the highest since
April 2010, the plan showed. This is 10 percent more than 1.64
million barrels a day next month.  Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil producer, plans to increase
Qua Iboe crude shipments in November to 12 cargoes, one more
than October, according to a loading program.  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe was at a $3.78 a barrel premium
to Dated Brent, 10 cents less than Sept. 16, Bloomberg data
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
