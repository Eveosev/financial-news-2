BP Plc (BP/) â€™s talks with Azerbaijan on
the deepwater section of the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field may be
completed by the year-end, an Azeri energy official said.  The section holds 200 billion to 300 billion cubic meters
of natural gas, State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan First Vice-President
Xosbaxt Yusifzada said in an interview broadcast on Azeri news
channel ANS late yesterday.  Socar, as the company is known, will also begin exploration
drilling at Babak, another Caspian Sea block off Azerbaijan,
this year or in early 2012 as long as the producer is able to
obtain new offshore drilling rigs, Yusifzada said. Babak is
believed to contain 400 billion cubic meters of gas, he said.  By 2025,  Azerbaijan  will produce 50 billion cubic meters of
gas, with 11-12 billion cubic meters for domestic consumption
and the rest exported, Yusifzada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
