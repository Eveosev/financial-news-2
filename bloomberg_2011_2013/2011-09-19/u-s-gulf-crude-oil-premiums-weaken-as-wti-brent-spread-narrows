U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
after the benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s discount to its
European counterpart narrowed.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts grew
closer by 74 cents to $23.30 a barrel at 3:11 p.m. in  New York ,
after shrinking by as much as $1.22. The spread settled Aug. 19
at a record margin of $26.21.  When Brent declines versus WTI, it reduces the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased 50 cents to $28
over benchmark West Texas Intermediate at 2:10 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s
premium also fell 50 cents a barrel to $30.25.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend slipped $1.15 to $24.50 while Poseidon fell $1.30 to
$24.35 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium fell $1.75 cents to $22.50
a barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 15 cents to 75
cents below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium decreased $1.35 to $27
above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was slipped 75 cents to $11 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 40 cents to
$13.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
