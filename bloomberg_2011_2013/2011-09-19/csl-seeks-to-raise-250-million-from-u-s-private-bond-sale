CSL Ltd. (CSL) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of blood-derived therapies, started marketing a
$250 million bond sale to U.S. private investors.  HSBC Holdings Plc, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch are managing the sale, CSL spokeswoman Sharon
McHale said in an e-mailed response to a request for comment
from Bloomberg News. CSL, based in  Melbourne , is seeking to sell
debt maturing in 7, 10, 12 and 15 years, she said.  CSL said last month it planned to “modestly leverage” its
balance sheet through a U.S. private placement of bonds and new
bank loans, totaling about A$1 billion (($1.02 billion) in
aggregate. The company will use the proceeds to repay A$385
million of loans due in 2012 and may buy back as much as A$900
million of shares, it said in a results presentation.  CSL is the world’s second-biggest maker of medical
treatments derived from blood, behind Deerfield, Illinois-based
Baxter International Inc. So-called blood plasma products are
used to treat patients with immune deficiency disorders,
hemophilia, wounds and burns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
