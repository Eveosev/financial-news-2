Ezz Steel (ESRS)  plunged to the lowest
level in more than two years on a report the company will have
to pay the Egyptian government 660 million Egyptian pounds ($111
million) to keep production licenses.  The shares of  Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded steel
producer fell as much as 10 percent before trading 1.9 percent
lower at 6.9 pounds at 11:24 a.m. in Cairo, the lowest intraday
level since March 2009. That gave the company a market value of
3.75 billion pounds. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  advanced 0.7
percent.  Ezz is one of four steel manufacturers that will be
required to pay the government to avoid revocation of licenses
the court determined were not awarded legally, Al Mal newspaper
reported today, citing Trade and Industry Minister Mahmoud
Eissa. Kamel Galal, Ezz’s head of  investor relations , said today
the company is negotiating with the government. The talks are
private and have no set time-table, he said.  The company said yesterday it will finish building its
first direct-reduced-iron plant after an Egyptian court revoked
the license for the facility last week. The company said the
ruling will have a direct impact on future growth and it is
studying all legal options to counter it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
