Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei.  The Taiex Index fell 96.52 points, or 1.3 percent, to
7,480.88.  Acer Inc. (2353)  (2353 TT) retreated 4.9 percent to NT$34. Lenovo
Group Ltd., the world’s third-biggest maker of personal
computers, hired Gianfranco Lanci, Acer’s former chief executive
officer, as a consultant. Lanci left the Taipei-based company in
March. He had been president of Acer since 2005.  Barclays Capital  said in a report it expects Lanci to take
more responsibilities at Lenovo after the 1-year non-compete
clause in his Acer contract expires to significantly grow
Lenovo’s European PC market share by taking shares from
competitors, especially Acer’s.  TPK Holding Co. (3673 TT) slumped 5.5 percent to NT$659,
the biggest drop since Aug. 17. Balda AG, through investment
banks, distributed term sheets seeking orders for the stock. The
German maker of plastic components clarified it isn’t selling
its stake and said it will monitor the market situation and
coordinate closely with TPK to ensure a smooth exit process.  Insyde Software Corp. (6231)  (6231 TT) increased 6.3 percent to
NT$126. The company plans to sell as much as NT$300 million of
convertible bonds in a private placement to help boost working
capital, the company said in a statement to the Taiwan stock
exchange on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
