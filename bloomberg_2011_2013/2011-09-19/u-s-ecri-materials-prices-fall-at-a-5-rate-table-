U.S. industrial prices fell 0.32
percent today, according to the ECRI materials prices daily
report. The smoothed annualized growth rate, which is designed
to minimize fluctuations, fell 5 percent.  The index anticipates trends in companiesâ€™ pricing power
and is thought to be a leading indicator of corporate profits
and consumer price changes.  SOURCE:  Economic Cycle Research Institute  To contact the reporter on this story:
