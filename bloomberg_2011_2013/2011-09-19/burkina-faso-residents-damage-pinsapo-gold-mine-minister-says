Residents of the  Burkina Faso 
village of Peleguetenga destroyed equipment worth 3 billion CFA
francs ($6.2 million) in a protest against  Pinsapo Gold SA ’s
mine, according to Mines, Careers and Energy Minister Salif
Lamoussa Kabore.  About 300 residents protested on Sept. 14 over the use of
cyanide in the mine’s operation, Kabore told reporters in
Ouagadougou, the capital, today.  Output at the mine, which is about 150 kilometers (93
miles) from the city, began last month and has produced about 18
kilograms (635 ounces) of the metal, he said.  An unidentified person who answered the phone at Pinsapo’s
office in Ouagadougou declined to immediately comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
