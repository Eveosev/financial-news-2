Tax revenue in  California  missed
projections in August by $65 million, or about 1 percent, the
state Finance Department reported in a  bulletin .  The most-populous state now is $596 million behind
financial targets for the year that began July 1, or about 4.9
percent, the bulletin said. If California is $1 billion or more
behind revenue forecasts in December, the state would cut
funding for universities, social services and other programs
under a series of “triggers” written into the budget.  The Finance Department revenue estimate differs from
figures released by state Controller John Chiang 10 days
earlier. Chiang, a Democrat, said August revenue had come in
ahead of projections by 2.1 percent.  “Insurance tax revenues were $75 million below the month’s
forecast but this was due to a timing issue and that amount was
recouped in the first few days of September,” H.D. Palmer, a
Finance Department spokesman, said in an e-mail message
accompanying the bulletin.  To contact the reporters on this story:
