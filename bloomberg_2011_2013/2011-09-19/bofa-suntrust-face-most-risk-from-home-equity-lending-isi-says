Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  SunTrust
Banks Inc. (STI)  stand to lose the most on home-equity loans if
housing prices and employment continue to drop, according to a
report by International Strategy & Investment Group Inc.  Earnings may come under pressure because the Federal
Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency increased
scrutiny of home-equity portfolios to ensure they’re being
valued properly, and default notices rose in August, according
to analysts led by Ed Najarian.  “If employment weakens more and  home prices  drop more,
both the frequency of default and the severity of loss per
default on home-equity loans could easily exceed the amounts
assumed by banks in their current home-equity reserves and by
bank analysts,” the report said.  Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is most
vulnerable to home-equity losses among large banks, and SunTrust
has the most risk among regional firms covered by ISI, Najarian
wrote.  If home-equity losses increase by 20 percent, earnings at
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America could be reduced
7.5 percent in 2012, and Atlanta-based SunTrust’s could drop 8
percent, the report said.  Bank of America dropped 24 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $6.99
at 12:09 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.
SunTrust dropped 3.5 percent to $19.22, while the 24-company KBW
Bank Index slid 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
