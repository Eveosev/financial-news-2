Chinese stocks may weaken further
on the prospect of more initial public offerings, according to
Manop Sangiambut, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets’ head of China A-
share research.  “IPOs and placements have also been a factor that has
drained liquidity from the main board,” he said in a media
briefing in  Hong Kong . “We still believe there are many IPOs in
the pipeline so that may cause market weakness.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
