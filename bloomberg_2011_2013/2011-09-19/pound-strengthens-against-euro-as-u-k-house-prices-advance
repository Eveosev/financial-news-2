U.K. gilts rose for a second day
after European officials failed to offer a plan to halt the
region’s debt crisis and as  Greece  struggled to avoid a default,
spurring demand for the safest assets.  The two-year yield fell to within half a basis point of an
all-time low as European Union and International Monetary Fund
officials prepared to assess whether Greece can meet the
conditions for a planned bailout. U.S. Treasury two-year yields
dropped to a record. The pound strengthened versus most of its
major counterparts after a report showed U.K. house prices
increased in September.  “Gilts are moving in lockstep with Treasuries and German
bunds today on concerns over Greece,” said  John Wraith , a
fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
unit in London. “The safe havens, which certainly include
gilts, continue to benefit from  risk aversion . We’re still
heading into dangerous waters and yields can go lower.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell 11 basis points to 2.38 percent
at 4:07 p.m. in London. The 3.75 percent security due September
2021 rose 0.990, or 9.90 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,564) face
amount, to 112.110. The two-year yield dropped one basis point
to 0.53 percent, after reaching 0.492 percent. It declined to
0.49 percent on Sept. 12, the lowest since Bloomberg began
collecting data on the securities in 1992.  U.K. shares fell for the first time in five days, with the
 FTSE 100 index (UKX)  slipping 2 percent.  Annual Return  Gilts have returned 10 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German debt has gained 7.6
percent, and Treasuries rose 8.1 percent, the indexes show.  EU and IMF inspectors will speak today with Greek Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos to judge whether his government is
eligible for its next aid payment due next month and on track
for a second rescue package approved by EU leaders in July.  After a two-day meeting of finance ministers and central
bankers that ended Sept. 17, Sweden’s Anders Borg said Greece
hasn’t done enough to meet its budget targets.  The  Bank of England  said its 200 billion-pound bond-
purchase plan had “economically significant” effects. The
quantitative-easing program started in March 2009 may have
raised gross domestic product by 1.5 percent to 2 percent, and
increased inflation by between 0.75 to 1.5 percentage points,
the central bank said its quarterly bulletin released today.  Sterling rose for a second day versus the euro after a
report by Rightmove Plc showed house values gained 0.7 percent
this month, after a 2.1 percent decline in August.  The pound appreciated 0.4 percent to 87.07 pence per euro
after reaching 86.71 pence, the strongest since Sept. 14. The
U.K. currency dropped 0.9 percent to $1.5649, after falling to
$1.5633, the weakest level since Jan. 12.  The pound has depreciated 6.5 percent in the past 12
months, making it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-
market currencies after the dollar, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
