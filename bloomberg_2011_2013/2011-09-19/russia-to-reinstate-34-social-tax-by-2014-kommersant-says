Russia plans to reverse a cut in
the  payroll tax  by 2014, reinstating a 34 percent rate,
Kommersant reported, citing a government document.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  earlier this year ordered a
reduction in the tax, which goes toward the health-care and
pension systems, to 20 percent for small and medium-sized
companies and to 30 percent for everyone else. Finance Minister
Minister Alexei Kudrin estimated this would cost the budget 400
billion rubles ($13.02 billion).  On Sept. 21, Health Minister Tatyana Golikova will present
a 2012-2014 budget plan for the pension fund that assumes the
payroll tax will increase to 34% by 2014, Kommersant said,
without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
