Peru’s government approved a
stimulus package worth 1.29 billion soles ($471 million) to
protect the economy from a slowdown in global growth, Finance
Minister Miguel Castilla said today.  The spending will focus on house-building, highway
maintenance and other infrastructure projects, Castilla said in
a news conference in  Lima  today. The measures “are designed to
keep the economy growing and protect it from any external
shock,” he said.  A law that seeks to overhaul the mining royalty system and
is being discussed in congress today will help stimulate private
investment in the country, Castilla said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
