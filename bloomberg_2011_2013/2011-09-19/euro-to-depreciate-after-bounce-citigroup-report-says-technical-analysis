The euro’s gain last week against
the dollar won’t last and the currency may depreciate to a level
last reached in January, said Citigroup Inc., citing technical
indicators.  The 17-nation currency rose 1 percent last week after the
 European Central Bank  said Sept. 15 it will lend dollars to
euro-area banks, damping liquidity concern related to the
region’s sovereign debt crisis. The move won’t be sustainable as
the euro failed to climb above a key resistance level at
$1.3970, wrote  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical analyst at
Citigroup in New York, in a note to clients today.  “The bounce up/consolidation on euro-dollar seen last week
appears to have come to an end,” Fitzpatrick wrote. “Given the
underlying concerns with  Europe , we believe the overall trend in
euro-dollar is still down and the spike high seen on Thursday
was corrective.”  Fitzpatrick said he wasn’t available for further comment
when reached by telephone.  The euro dropped 1.1 percent to $1.3648 at 8:28 a.m. in  New
York , from $1.3796 Sept. 16. It has fallen 5.3 percent this
month.  The euro may drop to as low as $1.3150, a level last seen
in January, as the region’s sovereign debt crisis worsens.
European finance ministers and central bank officials failed to
offer a plan to halt the region’s crisis at a meeting ended
Sept. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
