Greece should begin an orderly
default and leave the Eurozone, in order to break a “vicious
cycle of insolvency, low competitiveness and ever deepening
depression,”  Nouriel Roubini , co-founder and chairman of
Roubini Global Economics LLC, writes in the Financial Times.  “A return to a national currency and a sharp depreciation
would quickly restore competitiveness and growth, as it did in
Argentina,” Roubini wrote. Greece “cannot return to growth
unless competitiveness is rapidly restored. Without a return to
growth, its debts will stay unsustainable.”  The current deal on offer to Greece from  Europe  is a “rip-
off,” Roubini wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
