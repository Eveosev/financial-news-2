Jaguar Land Rover, the luxury-car
unit of  India ’s  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , said it will spend 355 million
pounds ($558 million) building a plant in the U.K. to develop a
new line of four-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines.  The factory near Wolverhampton,  England , will create as
many as 750 jobs, Jaguar Land Rover said today in a statement.  The U.K. automaker is expanding as demand from emerging
markets boosts sales of models such as Land Rover’s Evoque
sport-utility vehicle and the Jaguar XJ car. The company is also
seeking to expand its range of smaller, more fuel-efficient
engines to bolster sales in European markets.  “As part of our long-term strategy for the JLR business,
we will design, engineer and manufacture a new family of
advanced engines” to help fulfill “the full global potential
of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands,” Chief Executive Officer
Ralf Speth said in the statement.  Tata Motors Chief Executive Officer Carl-Peter Forster
resigned Sept. 9, citing “unavoidable personal circumstances.”
Speth and Prakash Telang, managing director of the company’s
Indian operations, will represent their respective units on
Mumbai-based Tata Motors’ board. The company, which bought
Jaguar Land Rover from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in 2008 for $2.5 billion,
said on Sept. 13 that it’s not looking for a new CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
