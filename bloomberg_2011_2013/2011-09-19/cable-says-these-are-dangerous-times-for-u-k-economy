U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said these are “dangerous times” for the British economy and
will continue to be so as living standards suffer as a result of
the financial crisis.  “These are dangerous times for our economy,” Cable said
in a speech to his Liberal Democrat party’s conference in
Birmingham, central  England , today. “The truth is that there
are difficult times ahead, that Britain’s postwar pattern of
ever rising living standards has been broken by the financial
collapse,” Cable said, according to the text of his speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
