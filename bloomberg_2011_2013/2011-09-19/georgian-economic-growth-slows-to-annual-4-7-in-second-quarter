Georgia’s economic growth was the
slowest in five quarters in the April-June period, as output in
mining, quarrying and construction lost pace.  The economy expanded 4.7 percent on the year, the smallest
increase since the first quarter of 2010, compared with 5.8
percent in the first three months, the statistics office in the
capital Tbilisi said today.  Georgia is seeking to revive its $11.7 billion economy by
luring investments in energy and tourism. Gross domestic product
grew 6.4 percent in 2010 after shrinking 3.8 percent the
previous year and may reach 5.5 percent this year, matching the
central bank’s forecast, Economy Minister Vera Kobalia said by
phone today.  Output slowed in mining and quarrying and construction, the
office said, citing preliminary data.  Foreign direct investment reached $203.4 million in the
second quarter, 17 percent more than in the first, it said.
Investments in energy, communications, transportation, trade and
real estate led the way.  To contact the reporter on this story:
