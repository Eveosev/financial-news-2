Shopping-center construction in the
U.K. may fall to the lowest level since the 1950s next year as
developers struggle to raise money for projects, Cushman &
Wakefield LLP said.  About 18,500 square meters (199,132 square feet) of space
is scheduled to be completed in 2012, down from 264,000 square
meters this year, the New York-based real-estate broker said in
a  report  today.  Two properties are scheduled to open in 2012, in the
English towns of Newark and Dorchester, according to Cushman.
 Westfield Group (WDC)  Ltd.’s  Stratford City  mall in east  London , the
U.K.’s second-largest, opened last week and it will account for
two-thirds of this year’s new space, Cushman said.  “We predict an upswing in development activity towards
2015,” Toby Sykes, a partner of Cushman’s retail services arm,
said in the report. Cushman expects the shortage of new prime
retail space will help support rents in the months ahead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
