Gold prices fell as the dollar’s
rally eroded demand for the metal as an alternative investment
after the  Federal Reserve  said it will increase holdings of
longer-maturity Treasuries in a bid to bolster the U.S. economy.  Gold for immediate delivery fell $18.40, or 1 percent, to
$1,785.23 an ounce at 4:04 p.m.  New York  time after dropping as
much as 1.3 percent. At 2:20 p.m., just before the Fed
announcement, the metal traded at $1,805. The greenback rose as
much 0.9 percent against a basket of major currencies, erasing
earlier losses.  The Fed plans to buy $400 billion of bonds with maturities
of six to 30 years through June while selling an equal amount of
debt maturing in three years or less. That “should put downward
pressure on longer-term  interest rates  and help make broader
financial conditions more accommodative,” the Federal Open
Market Committee said in a statement.  “With the dollar rally, the flight to quality is not
building in gold at this moment,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at MF Global Holdings Inc. in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “Everyone wants to be in the dollar and
Treasuries,” after the Fed decision, he said.  In electronic trading, gold futures for December delivery
fell as much as $28.10, or 1.6 percent, versus yesterday’s
settlement on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the contract
settled down $1, or 0.1 percent, at $1,808.10.  Futures have jumped 27 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,923.70 on Sept. 6, on investor demand for a haven amid
escalating debt woes in Europe and the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
