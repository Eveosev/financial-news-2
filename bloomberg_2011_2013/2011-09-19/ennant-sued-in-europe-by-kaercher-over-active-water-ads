Tennant Co. (TNC) , a Minneapolis-based
cleaning solutions manufacturer, was sued in three countries by
German competitor  Alfred Kaercher GmbH  over advertising claims
for floor scrubbers.  Complaints were filed in  Belgium ,  Germany , and the U.K.,
over claims in Tennant’s advertising that its machines convert
tap water into “active water” giving it the same power as a
cleaning agent, Kaercher said in a statement.  “Tennant’s claims are misleading and totally untenable
scientifically,” Kaercher Chief Executive Officer Hartmut Jenner said. Tennant “is making a promise to customers that it
cannot possibly fulfill.”  Scrubber-driers are cleaning machines for wet cleaning of
hard floors, combining spreading the cleaning fluid, scrubbing
the floor and vacuuming waste water. In 2010, Kaercher reported
revenue of more than 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) and sold
more than 7.3 million pieces of equipment, the company said.  A person picking up the phone at Tennant’s German unit
declined to comment. Tennant didn’t immediately reply to a call
to its Antwerp office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
