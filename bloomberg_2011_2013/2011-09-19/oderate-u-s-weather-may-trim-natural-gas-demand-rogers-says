Temperatures should be moderate
during the next two weeks, with little to create any
“significant” demand for natural gas, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions will
be warmer than normal through Oct. 3, Rogers said in his 6- to
10-day and 11- to 15-day forecasts. Pockets of cooler air may
develop in Kentucky and Tennessee from Sept. 24 to Sept. 28 and
in the Pacific Northwest a week later, he said.  “With the primary warm ridging pattern shifting away from
the West and more toward southern  Canada , we do not see any
significant demand concerns this period,” Rogers, based in
Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a note to clients today.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
