Hog futures fell to the lowest
price in more than a week amid speculation the European debt
crisis is weakening economic growth and curbing demand for U.S.
meat. Cattle also declined.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of equities fell as much as 2.5
percent after European finance ministers ruled out using
stimulus measures to spur the economy last week.  Europe ’s debt
situation is increasing concern that the world economy is
slowing, which will curb meat demand, said  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa .  “The euro zone debt issues continue to be on the front
burner,” Roose said in a telephone interview. “The higher
dollar slows exports.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 1.1 cent, or 1.3
percent, to 81.675 cents a pound by 10:58 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after reaching 81.15 cents, the lowest for
the most-active contract since Sept. 7. Before today, the
commodity rose 3.7 percent this year.  The dollar rose as much as 1.2 percent against a basket of
six major currencies. A stronger dollar curbs the appeal of U.S.
exports for other monies.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  lowered its pork export
forecast 1.2 percent to 4.951 billion pounds (2.2 million metric
tons) this year, from the previous projection of 5.012 billion
pounds, the government said in a  report  on Sept. 12, citing
“smaller than expected” second-quarter shipments.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.675 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $1.18275 a pound on the CME. Earlier, the
price reached $1.17325, the lowest since Sept. 7. Before today,
the commodity jumped 9.8 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement declined 0.8
cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.36675 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
