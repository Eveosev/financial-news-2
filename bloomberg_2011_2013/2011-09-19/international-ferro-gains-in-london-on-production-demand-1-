International Ferro Metals Ltd. (IFL) , a
ferrochrome producer in  South Africa , had the biggest gain in
almost six weeks in  London  trading after saying it expects
demand and production to improve.  The shares advanced 6 percent to 17.75 pence at the 4:30
p.m. close in London, the biggest increase since Aug. 8.  International Ferro Metals, based in Sydney, said today it
expects global stainless steel demand to increase by 6.8 percent
a year through 2015. Ferrochrome is used in the production of
stainless steel to prevent corrosion.  “Negotiations for the next quarter are currently underway
and it is therefore very difficult to say at this stage” what
benchmark ferrochrome prices will be, Chief Executive Officer
Chris Jordaan said on a conference call. European warehouse
prices for low-carbon ferrochrome have been unchanged at $2.35 a
pound since June, according to Metal Bulletin data.  The company today reported a loss of 135 million rand
($17.9 million) for the fiscal year ended June, compared with a
loss of 85.8 million rand a year earlier. It expects production
to increase to 220,000 to 230,000 metric tons in the current
fiscal year from 195,000 tons as furnaces return to production
after scheduled maintenance to repair roof leaks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
