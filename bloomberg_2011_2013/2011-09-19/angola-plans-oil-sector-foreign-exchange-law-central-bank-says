Angola is working on a foreign-
exchange law for the petroleum sector that will require  oil
companies  to use local banks to pay sub-contractors in the
African nation, a central bank official said.  The new law is “unlikely” to be ready this year, Vice-
Governor Antonio Andre Lopes said in an interview in Lisbon
today. He did not provide further details.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , BP Plc and  Total SA (FP)  are among oil
companies operating in Angola, Africa’s biggest producer of the
fuel after Nigeria.  The new foreign exchange law has been submitted to Angola’s
council of ministers and is being finalized before it is
presented to Parliament, Angolan weekly newspaper O Pais
reported on March 28, citing central bank Governor Jose de Lima Massano.  To contact the reporter on this story:
