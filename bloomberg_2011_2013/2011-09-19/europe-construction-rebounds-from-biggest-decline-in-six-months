European construction output
rebounded in July from the biggest drop in six months, led by
increasing production in  Germany .  Construction in the 17-nation euro region advanced 1.4
percent from June, when it declined a revised 1.3 percent, the
European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the biggest gain since January. From a year earlier, July
output rose 1.2 percent after slumping 11.5 percent in June.  In Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy, July construction
output gained 3.2 percent from the previous month, when it
decreased 3.7 percent, today’s report showed. French production
slipped 0.1 percent in July, the third straight decline, while
the Netherlands reported a drop of 0.7 percent in the latest
month.  In the 27-member EU, output advanced 0.3 percent from June,
when it fell 1.1 percent. The statistics office had previously
reported a drop among euro-region states of 1.8 percent in June.
It didn’t provide monthly data for countries including  Greece ,
Ireland, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
