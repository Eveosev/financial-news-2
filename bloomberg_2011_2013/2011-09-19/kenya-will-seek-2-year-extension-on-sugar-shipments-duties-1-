Kenya, east  Africa ’s biggest
economy, will ask the  Common Market  for Eastern and Southern
Africa to extend a duty on sugar imports for two years, said
Romano Kiome, permanent secretary in the Ministry of
Agriculture.  The nation charges a duty of 10 percent on imports of the
sweetener exceeding a quota that is agreed every year with
COMESA and bought from the 19-member trade bloc, to help protect
local producers. The current agreement ends in February.  “Sugar reforms have not moved as fast as we would have
wanted,” Kiome told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital.  Sugar production is one of four activities the European
Union is supporting in Kenya under a program to boost
productivity, Bernard Rey, head of development co-operation at
the EU’s Kenyan office, said at the same briefing. The others
are horticulture, dairy produce and tea.  The EU will assist  Kenya , the world’s biggest exporter of
black tea, with a 60 million euros ($82 million) investment
program over three years, Rey said.  Sugar accounts for 15 percent of the country’s agricultural
output, according to the  Kenya Sugar Board , the industry
regulator. In the 12 months to June 2009, the industry produced
close to 520,000 metric tons compared with domestic consumption
of 700,000 tons, according to the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
