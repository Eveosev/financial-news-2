The  European Central Bank  said it
spent less on  government bonds  last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it settled 9.79 billion
euros ($13.3 billion) of bond purchases in the week through
Sept. 16, down from 14 billion euros in the previous week. The
ECB will take seven-day term deposits from banks tomorrow to
absorb the 152.5 billion euros of liquidity created since its
bond program started on May 10, 2010, a practice it employs to
ensure the purchases don’t fuel inflation.  The ECB last month started buying Italian and Spanish
government bonds after  Europe ’s debt crisis pushed their yields
to euro-era records. Policy makers are increasingly split over
the best way to fight the crisis. Juergen Stark on Sept. 9
announced he will resign from the ECB’s Executive Board in
protest at the purchases and Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said today they blur the line between monetary and
fiscal policy and “have to be judged very critically.”  Italian 10-year yields increased to 5.59 percent today. The
Spanish equivalent climbed to 5.33 percent and  Greece ’s jumped
to 22.9 percent.  Greece is struggling to meet budget targets amid a
deepening recession. The economy will shrink 5.5 percent this
year and contract “notably” next year, Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said at conference in  Athens  today.  The ECB’s bond purchases are an “exceptional” measure to
ensure transmission of monetary policy and could have been
avoided with a stricter fiscal framework, ECB board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
