Inversiones Baquedano Ltda., a
Chilean energy company, is seeking environmental permits to
build a 17.8-megawatt hydroelectric plant in the country’s Bio-
Bio region.  The Pasada Baquedano project will cost $56.3 million and
generate power from water flows that average 8.9 cubic meters a
second, Santiago-based Inversiones Baquedano said in a filing
yesterday with Chile’s environmental licensing agency Comision
Nacional del Medio Ambiente. The project also includes a 23-
kilovolt transmission line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
