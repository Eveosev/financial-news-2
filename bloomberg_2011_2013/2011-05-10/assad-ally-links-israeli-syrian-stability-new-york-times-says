The first cousin of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad, who is facing the gravest danger to his 11-year
presidency, linked  Israel ’s stability to that of Syria’s, the
New York Times reported today.  In an interview with the newspaper, Rami Makhlouf, a
tycoon, said Syria’s ruling elite will fight to the end as the
administration tries to quell anti-government demonstrations
that began in March.  “If there is no stability here, there’s no way there will
be stability in Israel,” Makhlouf said in the May 9 interview.
Indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria, mediated by
 Turkey , broke down in December 2008.  Makhlouf is one of 13 Syrian officials targeted by
European Union sanctions that include a visa ban and an asset
freeze.  To contact the reporter on this story:
