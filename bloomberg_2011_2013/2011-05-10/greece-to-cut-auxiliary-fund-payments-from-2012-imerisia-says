Greece ’s government plans to cut
pensions paid by supplementary funds by as much as 20 percent
starting in 2012,  Imerisia  reported.  The aim is to bring sums paid to pensioners in line with
contributions starting on Jan. 1, the Athens-based daily said,
citing  Athina Dretta , the Labor Ministry’s general secretary of
social security. Benefits at some pension funds amount to as
much as 60 percent of pensions paid, the newspaper said.  Additionally, 20,000 primary pensions that are higher than
the cap for the fund will be reduced, Imerisia reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
