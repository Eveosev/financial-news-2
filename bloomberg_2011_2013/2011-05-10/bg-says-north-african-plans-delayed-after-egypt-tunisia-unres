BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-
largest oil and gas company, delayed projects in North Africa
because of civil unrest and protests in  Egypt  and Tunisia.  Development projects at West Delta Deep Marine in Egypt,
due to start later this year, were postponed “by several
months,” BG said in a statement today. Gas demand in Egypt
experienced “significant disruption.”  BG is building a third pipeline and pursuing a compression
project in the West Delta, where it has 34 offshore wells,
according to its  website .  Oil rose as high as $114.83 a barrel in  New York  this year
as revolts that overthrew the governments in Tunisia and Egypt
raised concern that supplies from the Middle East would be
disrupted as protests spread. Fighting between rebels and forces
loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has shut 1.3 million
barrels a day of output in Africa’s third-largest producer.  The company’s modification and maintenance of its Hasdrubal
plant in Tunisia has been completed after delays, said BG Chief
Executive Officer Frank Chapman. The plant, which BG owns in
partnership with Tunisia’s state-owned Entreprise Tunisienne
d’Activites Petrolieres, had been stopped in the third quarter.  “Unfortunately we were not able to start the plant due to
civil unrest in Tunisia, which hampered access to the plant”
for start-up testing, Chapman told reporters on a conference
call. “The plant is now on stream performing very well and this
is something we have behind us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
