Daily exports of the four  North Sea 
crude grades that determine the price of Dated Brent, the
benchmark for more than half the worldâ€™s oil, are scheduled to
rise 4.6 percent in June from this month, according to loading
programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  Combined shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
grades will total 32.5 million barrels, or 1.08 million barrels
a day, next month, loading programs showed. That compares with
32.1 million barrels, or 1.04 million barrels a day, in May.  Including Stafjord, Gullfaks, DUC, Grane and Alvheim
grades, daily exports from the North Sea will rise 5.8 percent
from May to 1.78 million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
