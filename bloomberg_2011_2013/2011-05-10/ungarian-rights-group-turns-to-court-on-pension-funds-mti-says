The  Hungarian Helsinki Committee , a
human rights group, has filed a lawsuit at the  European Court  of
Human Rights on a government decision to funnel private pension-
fund portfolios to the state,  MTI  reported.  Hungary’s decision to strip those who decided to retain
their portfolios of their government pensions while requiring
them to continue paying pension contributions is
“discriminatory,” the Helsinki Committee said in a statement,
according to the state-funded MTI news service.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
