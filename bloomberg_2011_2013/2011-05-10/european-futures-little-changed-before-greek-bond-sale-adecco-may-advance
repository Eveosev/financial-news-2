European stocks climbed as
 InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  and  Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  posted
increased earnings, helping to reassure investors that the
global economic recovery remains intact.  InterContinental Hotels surged 3.9 percent after reporting
a 28 percent jump in first-quarter profit as travel recovered in
the Americas. Deutsche Post gained 1.3 percent after the world’s
biggest carrier of air and sea freight by volume reported first-
quarter earnings before interest and taxes that exceeded the
average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.9 percent to 282.92 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London  as more than six stocks climbed for every one
that dropped. The gauge has gained 7.9 percent from this year’s
low on March 16 as companies including PSA Peugeot Citroen and
Ericsson AB reported earnings that topped analysts’ estimates
and the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its pledge to keep
 interest rates  low for an extended period.  “The good thing for  Europe  is not that there are not
problems, but for the most part they’ve already been reflected
in prices,” said  Russ Koesterich , the global chief investment
strategist for the IShares unit of BlackRock Inc., which
oversees $3.65 trillion as the world’s largest asset manager.
“One of the factors supporting global equity markets, despite
all the headwinds, is the fact that global rates for the most
part are staying very low. That is going to continue for the
next few quarters,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Milan.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today. Germany’s  DAX Index (DAX)  advanced 1.2 percent
and France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  added 1.1 percent. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100
Index (UKX)  gained 1.3 percent.  Earnings Season  Per-share profit at the 234 companies that have reported
results in the Stoxx 600 index since April 11 has expanded 8.8
percent, with 59 percent beating analysts’ estimates, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.K., gauges of  house prices  and retail sales
climbed in April. The  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors
said its U.K. house-price gauge rose to its highest level in
nine months in April as demand for homes stabilized. The  British
Retail Consortium  said U.K. retail sales surged the most in five
years last month as public holidays and the warmest April on
record spurred spending.  China ’s exports increased 29.9 percent from a year earlier
to $155.7 billion in April and the  trade surplus  jumped to $11.4
billion, according to government data released today. The
surplus was more than triple the median forecast of $3.2 billion
in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  InterContinental, Deutsche Post  InterContinental Hotels  climbed 3.9 percent to 1,298 pence
as the owner of the Holiday Inn brand said first-quarter profit
rose 28 percent as travel recovered in the Americas, its biggest
market.  Deutsche Post rose 1.3 percent to 13.66 euros as it
reported that first-quarter earnings before interest and taxes

beating the average estimate of 588 million euros based on a
Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts. The company posted net income
for the period of 325 million euros, matching the 325 million-
euro average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

to 3.76 euros, its largest gain in three months. European
Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said
today that allowing a euro-area member state to default or
restructure its debt would be “wrong.”  The  International Monetary Fund  will arrange an 80 billion-
euro to 100 billion-euro aid package to replace Greece’s
existing bailout program,  Kathimerini  reported, without saying
how it got the information.  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  rose 3.1 percent to 2,224 pence
after the company said it will buy back 500 million pounds
($816.5 million) of shares a year. Europe’s second-biggest

for profit of 858 million kroner. Danske reported net income of
769 million kroner in the first quarter of 2010.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  slid 1.6 percent to 1,412.5 pence as the

to asset sales and long-term contracts.  JCDecaux SA (DEC)  added 1.1 percent to 23.41 euros. The world’s

23.4 percent to 11.3 million euros.  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  gained 1.8 percent to 248 pence as Europe’s

rose.  Carmakers Climb  Carmakers were among the best performers of the 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx 600.  Renault SA (RNO)  climbed 1.4 percent to 40.84
euros.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  gained 2.3 percent to 62.67
