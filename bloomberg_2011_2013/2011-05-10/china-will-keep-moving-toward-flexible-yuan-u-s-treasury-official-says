China  assured the U.S. that it will
continue moving toward a more flexible yuan  exchange rate , a
U.S. Treasury official said.  Chinese officials meeting with their U.S. counterparts in
Washington also agreed to allow U.S. and other foreign banks to
sell mutual funds and provide financial custodial services in
China, the official said in a telephone briefing with reporters
today.  No specific target or number for the yuan’s value will be
part of formal agreements between the two nations, the Treasury
official said.  The currency has been a focal point of the two-day talks
among U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner , Chinese Vice
Premier Wang Qishan and other officials. Geithner said yesterday
on the “Charlie Rose” program airing on PBS and Bloomberg
Television that China was “moving carefully” in appreciating
the yuan.  The U.S. also expects China to allow foreign insurers to
sell auto insurance there for the first time, the Treasury
official said. The official couldn’t be further identified under
rules of the briefing.  China also agreed to inspections to try to ensure that
Chinese companies are using only legitimate software, the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
