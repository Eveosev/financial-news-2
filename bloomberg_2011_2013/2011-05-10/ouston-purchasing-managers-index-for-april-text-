Following is the text from the
Houston purchasing managers report.  HOUSTON ECONOMY STEADY!
Lead Times, Purchased Inventory and Prices Paid were the Leading
Indicators  The Institute for Supply Management -- Houston reported
this month that the Houston Purchasing Managers Index PMI was
59.9 for April, 2011. Economic activity in the Houston area has
been positive for the last 19 consecutive months, but remained
the same as last month. This is continues to be higher than the
2010 peak of 59.0 in May 2010.  The PMI, which indicates likely shifts in Production volume
three or four months in advance, now shows a signal that
production is still continuing to move forward. The PMI has a
possible range of 0 to 100. Readings over 50 indicate production
gains over the near term; readings below 50 show coming
contraction.  The Houston PMI is based on diffusion indexes for eight
indicators. (A diffusion index is simply the percentage of
respondents reporting increases from the previous month less the
percentage reporting declines.) The Houston PMI which is based
on eight components had five categories reporting improvement
from March to April.  Lead Times were the outstanding indicator increasing 8
points to 33 PMI. This is the highest level Lead Times have been
through all of 2010.  Purchased Inventory, a reverse indicator,
fell from +5 to -3 PMI. A falling inventory shows demand over
the production levels. Prices Paid continued to climb to 58 PMI.
That is a sure indication of inflation in the manufacturing
arena.  Sixty percent of our participants responded that prices
increased from last month.  Again this is the highest throughout
2010.  Production, at 20 PMI, Employment, at 20 PMI and Purchases,
at 20 PMI all remained the same as last month. Sales fell 3
points from 23 to 20 PMI compared to the high of 33 in February.  The latest Employment numbers indicate that our
respondentsâ€™ employment remained the same, with only eight
percent reducing in staff in April. This total number indicates
employment is improving and is at the highest level for 2010-11.
Ninety-three percent of the respondents had the Same or
Increased Employment levels. This remains good news for those
looking for jobs at this time.  The Houston PMI has averaged 56.6 over the last 12 months.
There has been an improvement in the PMI number of 34.9 percent
since March 2009.  The  Institute for Supply Management  - Houston has published
the Houston Purchasing Managers Index monthly since January 1995
as a service to its members and the wider Houston business
community.  SOURCE: Institute for Supply Management
