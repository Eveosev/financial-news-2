The  International Monetary Fund  is
arranging an 80 billion-euro ($114 billion) to 100 billion-euro
aid package to replace Greece’s existing bailout program,
 Kathimerini  reported, without saying how it got the information.  The plan entails disbursing an additional 30 billion euros
to cover Greece’s funding needs through 2013 and would include
tougher conditions and more realistic targets than last year’s
bailout, the Athens-based newspaper said.  Greece would have to sell its entire stakes in  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO) , Public Power Corp SA and
Athens International Airport and provide state assets as
collateral for the loans, Kathimerini said. Other measures
include reducing the number of civil servants and additional
austerity measures of as much as 7 billion euros, the newspaper
added.  Under the current state asset-sales program, announced on
April 15, Greece will reduce its stake in PPC to 34 percent from
51 percent, sell a stake in Hellenic Telecom and extend the
operating concession for  Athens  International.  To contact the reporter on this story:
