Mexican President Felipe Calderon
said that the government is not considering selling shares in
state-run oil producer  Petroleos Mexicanos .  Calderon, in a statement, said Pemex is seeking to sell
bonds to Mexican citizens in a bid to raise capital.  Mexico â€™s Congress in 2008 approved the sale by Pemex of so-
called citizen bonds to the Mexican public to help the company
pay for investments to boost productivity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
