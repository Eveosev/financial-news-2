Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE)  was
found guilty of unfair trading by Guildford Crown Court in
southern England, the British Broadcasting Corp.  reported.   The energy provider was convicted today of using a
“misleading” sales script between September 2008 and July 2009
to persuade potential customers they were paying too much to
their then-suppliers, and prompt them to sign with SSE, the  BBC 
said.  Scottish & Southern said in an e-mailed statement today it
was “clearly disappointed with the verdict” and was
considering its legal options, “which includes the possibility
of an appeal.” The case “relates to sales aids used in
February 2009, which are not in use today,” Scottish & Southern
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
