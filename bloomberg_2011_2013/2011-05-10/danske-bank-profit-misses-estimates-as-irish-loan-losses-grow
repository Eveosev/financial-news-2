Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s largest
lender, said first-quarter profit fell 7.8 percent, missing
analysts’ estimates, amid continuing high loan impairment
charges in Ireland.  Net income slipped to 709 million kroner ($135.9 million)
from 769 million kroner a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Copenhagen-based lender. That missed the average 858
million-kroner estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Loan losses dropped 33 percent to 2.84 billion kroner while in
Ireland provisions rose 18 percent to 1.28 billion kroner.  Danish banks are under pressure from rising funding costs
after the country in February allowed Amagerbanken A/S to fail
as the first to test rules put in place in October, setting a
European Union precedent for senior creditor losses. Danske Bank
got 19.8 billion kroner ($3.8 billion) in net proceeds after
selling 232.9 million new shares in April, strengthening its
capital base. It said it had a core Tier 1 ratio of 12.4 percent
at the end of March.  “Recent macroeconomic indicators offer hope that the
business environment will gradually improve over the coming
year,” Peter Straarup, Danske’s chief executive officer, said in
the statement. “The Irish economy will continue to face
structural challenges, and because of the economic climate, the
level of future impairment charges is uncertain.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
