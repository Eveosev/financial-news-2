Spain  plans a five-fold increase in
annual subsidies for the production and consumption of renewable
power over the next ten years,  Cinco Dias  reported, citing an
Industry Ministry document.  The government plans to spend 18.5 billion euros ($26.4
billion) from 2011 to 2020, raising annual spending from 529
million euros this year to 2.65 billion euros in 2020, mostly
for producers from renewable sources including wind and sun
power, Cinco Dias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
