U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index higher for a third straight day, as
companies including  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  and  Fossil Inc. (FOSL)  forecast
earnings that topped analysts’ projections.  Dean Foods, the largest U.S. milk processor, jumped 12
percent, while Fossil added 7.1 percent.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper
& Gold Inc. (FCX)  rose 0.4 percent, pacing gains in raw-material
producers, as copper advanced for a third day before the release
of figures that may show weaker inflation in  China , the world’s
biggest user of the metal.  The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 1,349.79 at 9:32 a.m. in
New York. The benchmark gauge for American equities rose for a
second day yesterday as commodities rebounded from the biggest
weekly drop since 2008. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
advanced 21.49 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,706.17 today.  “The earnings season has been a pleasant surprise,” said
Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Philadelphia-based
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $53 billion. “There
wasn’t a great deal of optimism that earnings were going to beat
estimates with the vigor that we’ve seen. In addition, we’re
seeing this rebound in metals prices. Commodities will still
find support as long as the economic growth that we’ve seen
continues.”  Earnings Scorecard  The  S&P 500  fell 1.7 percent last week following a rout in
raw materials that knocked off $99 billion of market value from
commodities. The S&P 500 was still up 7.1 percent this year
through yesterday amid government stimulus measures and higher-
than-projected corporate profits. Earnings-per-share have beaten
analyst estimates at 72 percent of the 423 companies in the S&P
500 that reported results since April 11, Bloomberg data show.  Prices of goods imported into the U.S. rose more than
forecast in April, driven by gains in fuel and food that may put
pressure on some companies to raise prices.  The 2.2 percent increase in the import-price index followed
a revised 2.6 percent gain in March, Labor Department figures
showed. Economists projected a 1.8 percent increase, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices
excluding fuel advanced 0.6 percent.  Financial, technology and health-care stocks offer
“value,”  Bill Miller , the chairman and chief investment
officer of Legg Mason Capital Management Inc., wrote in the
Financial Times today. He said valuations in those industries
have been more expensive 90 percent of the time during about the
past 60 years.  Higher Commodity Prices  Miller, whose  Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust (LMVTX) 
fund outperformed the S&P 500 annually for 15 straight years
through 2005, said a lower  U.S. dollar  and higher commodity
prices will be “bearish not bullish” for stocks as the  Federal
Reserve  is set to end its asset-purchase program next month. The
fund was outperformed by 98 percent of peers in 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We believe now is a good time to buy what’s on sale, and
a bad time to buy what’s marked up,” Miller said.  Dean Foods jumped 12 percent to $12.25. The company
forecast full-year profit excluding some items of at least 67
cents a share. On average, the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated earnings of 57 cents.  Fossil rose 7.1 percent to $100.64. The Texas-based maker
of watches and jewelry forecast full-year earnings of at least
$4.44 a share on an adjusted basis, more than the average
analyst estimate of $4.37, Bloomberg data show.  Freeport, the world’s largest publicly traded copper
producer, gained 0.4 percent to $52.07. Copper rose for a third
straight day ahead of a report tomorrow that may show Chinese
consumer prices climbed 5.2 percent in April, slowing from 5.4
percent in March, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. Concern that Chinese demand may slow as authorities
move to tighten credit contributed to copper’s 7.1 percent drop
in March and April in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
