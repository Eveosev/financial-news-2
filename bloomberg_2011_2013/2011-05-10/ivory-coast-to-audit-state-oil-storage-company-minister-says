Petroliers de Cote d’Ivoire , a fuel-storage company in the West
African, will be audited and will stop selling petroleum
products, Mines and Energy Minister Adama Toungara said.  “Gestoci has been marketing petroleum products for a while,
which is not designated to do,” he said in an interview today in
Abidjan, the commercial capital, using the company’s acronym.  Gestoci has a storage capacity of 400,000 cubic meters (14
million cubic feet), according to its website. State-owned
energy company Petroci owns a 12.5 percent stake in Gestoci,
with the remainder owned by companies that sell petroleum in the
country, including the units of  Total SA (FP)  and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
