Vietnam ’s five-year bonds dropped on
speculation the prospect of an interest-rate increase is cooling
demand for the securities.  The State Bank of Vietnam lifted its repurchase rate to 14
percent from 13 percent on May 4, the fifth increase this year,
as it grapples with the fastest inflation in more than two years.
The government has lowered the target for credit growth and
ordered a tighter monetary policy as it strives to restrain
inflation and stabilize the nation’s currency.  “Buyers are requiring higher yields in order to compensate
for interest-rate risks,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at
ACB Securities Inc. in  Ho Chi Minh City . “Low liquidity in the
banking system seems to be another reason for the bond market’s
unattractiveness as lenders find it hard to invest in long-term
bonds.”  The yield on the five-year bond rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 12.77 percent, according to a daily
fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong strengthened 0.1 percent to 20,610 per dollar as
of 2:22 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the currency’s reference
rate at 20,703, compared with 20,708 yesterday, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the fixing.  The  consumer price index  rose 17.51 percent in April from a
year earlier, the most in 28 months.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes,  James Regan   To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
