Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) ’s John Strangfeld, chief executive officer of the second-biggest U.S.
life insurer, said regulators should distinguish between banks
and insurance companies when setting rules for financial firms.  “Much of that regulation is directly addressed to banks,
but clearly we are a major institution; it will have knock-on
effects to us as well,” Strangfeld said today at the annual
meeting of Prudential shareholders in Newark,  New Jersey . “To
simply superimpose the same template on a different type of
institution is worrisome.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
