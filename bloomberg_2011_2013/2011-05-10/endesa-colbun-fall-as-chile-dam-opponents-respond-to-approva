Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA
and  Colbun SA (COLBUN) ,  Chile ’s two largest generators by market value,
fell after opposition lawmakers and environmental groups vowed
to block their  HidroAysen  power project.  Endesa fell 1.2 percent to 878.54 pesos in Santiago
trading, while Colbun slid 0.5 percent to 142.42 pesos, giving
back ground gained yesterday when regulators prepared to vote on
the project.  “There was a lot of euphoria in the market,” Jorge Donoso, an analyst at Santiago-based brokerage Larrain Vial SA,
said by telephone. “It’s a valuable project, especially for
Colbun which is smaller than Endesa, but construction wouldn’t
actually begin until 2015.”  An environmental commission in the Patagonian region of
Aysen yesterday approved construction of five dams on the Baker
and Pascua rivers, sparking protests and violent clashes last
night with thousands of demonstrators and police. HidroAysen
still needs a permit to build a 1,900-kilometer (1,180 mile)
transmission line to feed the central grid that supplies
Santiago and surrounding cities.  Gabriel Silber, an opposition lower-house member, filed an
injunction against the vote in a local appeals court on the
grounds that some regulators have vested interests in the
project. While the court allowed yesterday’s vote to proceed, it
may overturn the result, Silber told reporters. Opposition
Senator Patricio Walker said “this fight continues.”  “There are risks for the project still,” Donoso said.
“It has never been a done deal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
