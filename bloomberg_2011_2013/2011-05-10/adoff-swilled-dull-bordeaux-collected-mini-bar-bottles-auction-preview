Bernard L. Madoff saved mini-bar
miniatures and showed little interest in finer wines.  “He was clearly not a connoisseur, or a serious wine
collector,” said Kimberly Janis, director at  Morrell & Co. Fine
Wine Auctions , which will offer for sale 58 lots from Madoff’s
booze collection on May 18.  One lot is a selection of 2-ounce bottles of Smirnoff
vodka, Bombay Gin and Grand Marnier liqueur. The estimate: $10
to $20.  “That’s hilarious actually,” Janis said. “Who knew
that’s what he’d collected?”  The auction house expects to raise about $15,000 from the
wine collection. It’s the latest sale of Madoff’s possessions,
which were seized by U.S. marshals to raise money for the
victims of his $65 billion  Ponzi scheme . His powerboats and a
Mercedes-Benz fetched $1.1 million in 2009. Last year, souvenir
hunters helped raise $2 million from the liquidation sale of
Madoff’s bed and his wife Ruth’s diamonds.  “He had some good Bordeaux,” said  Elin McCoy , who writes
about wine and spirits for Bloomberg News. “But I am surprised
that this is all there was. The guy was a gazillionaire.”  The top lot of the wine sale is a 12-bottle case of 1996
Bordeaux,  Chateau Mouton-Rothschild , with a presale estimate of
$3,200 to $3,800. The online bids already have surpassed the
range, with the latest one at $5,500.  A case of 1996 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild last month fetched
about $8,200 at Sotheby’s in  London .  Vintage Barolo  “He actually picked out a couple of interesting Italian
wines, though not many,” said McCoy.  She flagged the lot containing six bottles of vintage 1997
Antinori Tignanello, estimated to bring $850 to $1200, and two
bottles of 2000 Bruno Giacosa Barolo estimated at $140 to $200.  A case of nonvintage Veuve Clicquot Champagne, yellow-label
brut, may fetch $240 to $350, or $20 to $29 a bottle.  New York ’s
Chelsea Wine Vault sells one bottle of the bubbly for $40.  Although many lots look like bargains with multiple bottles
and low estimates, nothing is known about the storage
conditions.  “If the bottles are no good, that’s not a bargain,” said
McCoy.  Judging from the auction selection, Madoff’s drinks tray
was ordinary, with Cinzano and Irish cream liqueur as well the
expected Scotch. One exception: A bottle of 18-year-old Macallan
Scotch whisky distilled in 1984, priced at $120 to $150.  Murky Liquid  One of the odder lots is a crystal decanter filled with a
mysterious brown liquid, modestly estimated at $60 to $90.  How did the auction house price it?  “You just kind of guess,” said Janis. “It could be a
really expensive scotch, but it’s impossible to divine. He’s not
talking.”  Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison
after pleading guilty in 2009 to his decades-long scheme.  The overall quality of the offerings is secondary to the
notoriety of their former owner.  “There may be baby deals to be had,” said McCoy. “But
the best part of getting anything from this sale is that you can
say it was seized from  Bernie Madoff ’s cellar.”  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
