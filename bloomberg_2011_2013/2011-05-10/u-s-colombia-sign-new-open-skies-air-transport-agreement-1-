The U.S. and  Colombia  signed a new
Open Skies air transport agreement that will increase the number
of passenger and cargo flights between the two countries and
boost competition in the aviation market.  U.S. Under Secretary of State  William Burns  and Colombia’s
Foreign Minister Angela Holguin signed an accord in Bogota today
that would increase the number of companies in the Colombian
market by the end of 2012 and boost competition for carriers
like Avianca Taca Holding SA, owner of Colombia’s biggest
airline by sales.  “The Agreement will strengthen and expand our already
strong trade and tourism links with Colombia, benefiting U.S.
and Colombian businesses and travelers by expanding air service
and encouraging vigorous price competition by airlines, while
safeguarding aviation safety and security,” according to an e-
mailed statement from the U.S. State Department.  Open Skies agreements increase employment and economic
growth by removing government interference in decisions about
routes and pricing, “freeing carriers to provide more
affordable, convenient, and efficient air service,” the State
Department said on its  website .  Avianca Taca plans to use $260 million raised from an
initial public offering to help fend off expansion by Chile’s
Lan Airlines, Chief Executive Officer Fabio Villegas said in an
interview on May 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
