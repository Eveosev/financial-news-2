U.K. Employment Minister Ed Davey
will tomorrow announce changes to the country’s employment laws,
that will make it easier for companies to hire and dismiss
employees and will discourage “vexatious” discrimination
claims by employees, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, without
attribution.  The changes will include cutting compensation payments to
staff who sue their employers in employment tribunals, and
relaxing limits on companies looking to fire large numbers of
personnel, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
