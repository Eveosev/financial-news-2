New York ’s Nassau County will
announce plans tomorrow to pursue an American Indian casino and
build a sports-entertainment destination center.  Nassau County Executive Edward P. Mangano will unveil an
“economic development and job creation plan for the sports
center” at a press conference at 11 a.m. on May 11 at the
Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York,
according to an e-mailed statement. Mangano will “also announce
plans to pursue the construction of an Indian-gaming casino.”  The Shinnecock Indian Nation has been seeking to build a
casino in the New York area. The Shinnecocks, located on the
east end of  Long Island  adjacent to the Town of Southampton,
received Federal recognition Oct. 1.  “We’ll look at it when we see it,” New York Governor
 Andrew Cuomo  said today in a press briefing in Syracuse, New
York, when asked about the casino. “There’s a lot of
questions.”  Beverly Jensen, a spokeswoman for the  Shinnecocks , and
Katie Grilli-Robles, press secretary for Mangano’s office,
didn’t respond to calls seeking details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
