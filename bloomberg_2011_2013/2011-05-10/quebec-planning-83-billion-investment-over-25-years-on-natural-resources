Quebec  plans to attract investments
of C$80 billion ($83.3 billion) over 25 years to develop natural
resources and infrastructure in the northern part of the French-
speaking Canadian province.  The plan will create an average of 20,000 jobs a year,
Quebec Premier Jean Charest said yesterday in a  statement . The
development, called  Plan Nord , also will generate C$14 billion
in revenue for the government, he said.  “Plan Nord is one of the most ambitious projects that
Quebec has undertaken,” the provincial government said in the
statement.  Quebec is stepping up economic development of its northern
regions to help raise living conditions in the region and to
make better use of natural resources such as timber, minerals
and wind-generated electricity. An agency, Societe du Plan Nord,
will be created to carry out the plan, Quebec said.  The plan covers the part of the province north of the 49th
parallel, which comprises almost 1.2 million square kilometers
(463,000 square miles). The region has almost 500,000 lakes and
thousands of rivers and accounts for more than three-quarters of
the province’s hydroelectric generation capacity. Northern
Quebec also has  mineral resources  including nickel, cobalt, zinc
and iron ore, the province said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
