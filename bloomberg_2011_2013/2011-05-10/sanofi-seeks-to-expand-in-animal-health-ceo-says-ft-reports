Sanofi Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher said the French pharmaceutical company aims to expand
its  animal health  business, Merial, which will seek to make
acquisitions, though “probably not of significant size,”
following the unravelling of its joint venture with Merck & Co.
last month, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  Viehbacker said the company also plans to cut costs and it
sees scope for “synergy” in back office operations,
manufacturing, marketing and research and development, the FT
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
