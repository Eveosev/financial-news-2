The 20 highest-paid city employees in
California collected $9.8 million in 2009, an average of
$490,000 each or nine times the state average, data shows.  The top earner was  Robert Rizzo , the disgraced city manager
of Bell, receiving $1.17 million. His assistant city manager,
Angela Spaccia, was paid $562,538, according to data provided by
California Controller John Chiang yesterday. Three police chiefs
from different cities each earned more than $500,000, the data
show.  “It’s outrageous,” said Marcia Fritz, president of the
 California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility  in Sacramento, a
nonprofit group pressing for changes in public-employee
pensions. “They are getting compensated like they are top
executives of companies that have actual competition.”  Public employee pay has come under scrutiny as cities and
counties confront budget cuts amid declining revenue and less
money from the state, which itself faces what was a $26 billion
deficit.  California ’s 1.75 million local government workers
received $94.7 billion in wages and salaries in 2009, or an
average of $54,197, according to the U.S.  Commerce Department .  The Los Angeles Times reported last year that Rizzo earned
$787,637 to run a city where one in four of its 38,000 residents
lives below the poverty line, according to the Census Bureau.  Misappropriating Funds  Rizzo, Spaccia and two other Bell city officials were
ordered on March 10 to stand trial on charges of
misappropriation of public funds and conflict of interest for
allegedly taking $6.7 million in city funds. All have pleaded
not guilty. Chiang began collecting  salary data  in the wake of
the Bell scandal.  “These examples are indeed sensational, but they represent
the exceptions, not the majority of public servants who earn an
average $26,000 yearly pension,” said Steve Maviglio, spokesman
for Californians for Retirement Security, a union-backed
coalition. “California’s public employees support efforts to
clamp down on abuse of the pension system and have willingly
agreed to hundreds of millions in concessions to help repair
state and local budgets.”  The three highest-paid city officials from outside of Bell
all were high-ranking police who collected six-figure payouts
when they retired in 2009.  Police Chief Pay  Topping the list was Roy Campos, who retired as police
chief of Downey, a city of 108,000 in Los Angeles County.
Campos’ $593,999 payout was the result of about 30 years of
unused holiday, sick and vacation time, the  Orange County
Register  reported. The city manager’s office didn’t have an
immediate comment when called by Bloomberg News.  In Monterey Park, another Los Angeles County suburb, former
Police Chief Jones Moy took home $531,107 in 2009, according to
data from the controller’s office. The San Gabriel Valley
Tribune  reported  that $372,559 of Moy’s payout was for unused
vacation, holiday and sick leave at the time of his retirement
in September 2009.  In a telephone interview, Monterey Park City Manager Paul
Talbot said leaders of the city of 64,000 are exploring measures
to eliminate large one-time payouts to employees.  “It affects the city to come up with that kind of dollar
amount,” Talbot said. “The problem is, everything they have
currently is vested.”  He said the one-time payouts don’t apply toward employee
pensions.  Retired San Francisco Deputy Police Chief Charles Keohane
was paid $516,118 in 2009, with most of that coming from
vacation, sick and compensatory time upon retiring, the San
Francisco Chronicle  reported . The city controller’s office
didn’t have an immediate comment when called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
