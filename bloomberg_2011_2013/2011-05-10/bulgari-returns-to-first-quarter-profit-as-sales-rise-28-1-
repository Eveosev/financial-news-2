Bulgari SpA (BUL) , the jeweler being
acquired by  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , returned to
first-quarter profit and said it’s optimistic about its growth
prospects.  Net income was 9.3 million euros ($13.4 million), compared
with a year-earlier loss of 8.3 million euros, Rome-based
Bulgari said today in a statement after the market’s close. The
average estimate of three analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for
profit of 15.6 million euros. Revenue grew 28 percent to 254.7
million euros, Bulgari said.  LVMH, the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, agreed two
months ago to pay 4.3 billion euros including debt for Bulgari.
The 127-year-old jeweler, the world’s third-largest, will have a
“very material” improvement in profitability this year if
sales growth exceeds 10 percent, Chief Executive Officer
Francesco Trapani said in a March 24 interview.  “Bulgari is doing very well,” Trapani said today in a
telephone interview. Sales in April were roughly in line with
the first quarter and stronger than expected across all
categories, he said. Watch revenue improved “significantly” in
April and sales of fragrances are “booming,” the CEO said.  The deal with LVMH and the new products and communications
initiatives planned for the rest of the year “fill me with
enthusiasm about the long-term growth” of the jeweler, Trapani
said in today’s statement.  Bulgari raised prices in February. The company does not
expect to make further increases this year, Trapani also said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
