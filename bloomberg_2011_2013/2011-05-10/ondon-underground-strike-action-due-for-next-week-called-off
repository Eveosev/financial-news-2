The RMT union said the tube drivers
strike action, which was due to begin next week, has been called
off after talks with London Underground resulted in the re-
employment of a sacked driver and an agreement to hold further
talks about a second sacked driver, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
