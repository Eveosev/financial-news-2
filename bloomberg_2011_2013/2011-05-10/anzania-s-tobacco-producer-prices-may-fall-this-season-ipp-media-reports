Tanzanian tobacco growers will likely
see producer prices for the leaf fall about 25 percent this
year,  IPP Media  reported, citing Alcado Ilagila, chairman of the
Western Zone Tobacco Cooperatives Union.  A lower international price for tobacco could see prices in
the East African nation decline to as low as $1.60 a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) from $2.12 a year earlier, the Dar es Salaam-based
news service said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
