HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s biggest
bank, allocates 64 percent of its capital to operations that
fail to meet the lender’s return targets, according to analysts
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Profitability could be boosted by using more capital in
private banking and investment banking in Asia, the Middle East
and Latin America, while reducing capital provided to parts of
Europe and the U.S., analysts including Frederik Thomasen wrote
in a note to investors today.  “We expect HSBC’s strategy day to focus heavily on capital
allocation and returns,” said Goldman Sachs before the bank’s
meeting with investors and analysts in  London  tomorrow. The bank
may take “a more proactive approach to capital allocation
including a diminished willingness to subsidize underperforming
operations as well as increased capital allocation to businesses
offering high risk-adjusted returns.”  HSBC Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  will address
tomorrow’s meeting, describing how the bank will reach its
return on equity target for profitability of between 12 percent
and 15 percent. HSBC operates consumer banks in 39 countries
with fewer than 10 branches, and these may be restructured,
Goldman Sachs said.  The London-based bank’s units in Greece, Poland, Germany,
Kazakhstan, Ireland, Japan, Pakistan,  New Zealand , Iraq, Bahrain,
Oman, Lebanon, Armenia, Qatar, Jordan, Peru, Columbia, Uruguay,
Chile and Paraguay are “candidates for right-sizing,” in terms
of reallocating capital, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
