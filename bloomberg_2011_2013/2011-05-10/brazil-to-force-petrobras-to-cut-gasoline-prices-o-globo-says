Brazil’s government will force
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-controlled oil company, to cut
gasoline prices by reducing costs at its fuel distribution unit,
newspaper  O Globo  reported, citing Energy Minister Edison Lobao.  The government wants to encourage competition in the
gasoline retail business as it sees signs of a cartel being
formed, the newspaper said today. Brazil will fine or shut
gasoline stations that don’t comply, a measure that would help
to reduce prices, O Globo said, citing Lobao.  To contact the reporter on this story:
