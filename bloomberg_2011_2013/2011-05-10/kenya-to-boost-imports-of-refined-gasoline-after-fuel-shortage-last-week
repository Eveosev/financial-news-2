Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy,
will boost imports of refined gasoline due to lower output from
its refinery, Energy Ministry Permanent Secretary  Patrick Nyoike 
said.  The nation’s only refinery has been affected by frequent
breakdowns and unreliable power supply, Nyoike told reporters
today in the capital, Nairobi.  “The government has decided, as a policy, that  Kenya
Petroleum Refineries Ltd.  be converted from a processing to a
merchant refinery,” he said.  KPRL, as the refinery is known, has been supplying between
25 and 30 percent of demand for gasoline compared with a target
of 40 percent, Nyoike said. A shut-down on April 27 due to a
 power outage  led to a fuel shortage in Nairobi last week, Energy
Minister Kiraitu Murungi said May 5. A delay in delivery of a
shipment of 29 million liters of gasoline that was due on April
21 and an under-delivery of 7 million liters of gasoline in
March also affected supplies, Murungi said.  Kenya  will import 40 million liters of refined gasoline in
two shipments, Nyoike said. The first is expected on about May
22 while the second will arrive in June, he said.  The refinery will also be allowed to import its own crude
for processing rather than buying from oil marketing companies,
helping it reduce costs, Nyoike said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
