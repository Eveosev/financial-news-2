ALL America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3) ,
 Latin America ’s largest railroad company, declined as slower
growth in Brazil’s industrial production reduced the company’s
first-quarter profit.  ALL dropped 2.7 percent to 12.43 reais at the close of  Sao
Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time after earlier falling
4.2 percent. The Bovespa stock index gained 0.4 percent to
64,876.88.  Transported volume of industrial goods rose 1.7 percent in
the first-quarter from a year earlier, ALL said in a statement
published on its website. The volume of steel products
transported declined 14.2 percent due to “lower industrial
activity,” according to the statement.  ALL’s first-quarter net income fell to 500,000 reais
($300,000) from 35 million reais a year earlier, according to
the company’s statement. The result was “weak,” Barclays Plc
said.  “Weakness was broad-based, not only in the agricultural
commodities division impacted by harvesting delays and heavy
rains, but especially in industrial product,” Barclays analysts
including Daniel Spilberg wrote in a note to clients. “Growth
in the industrial segment is proving to be much more difficult
than anticipated.”  Brazil ’s industrial output fell 2.1 percent in March from a
year before, the first annual decline since 2009, the national
statistics agency said on May 3. Latin America’s biggest economy
is slowing after expanding 7.5 percent in 2010, the fastest in
two decades, the central bank said in the minutes to its April
19-20 policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
