Day-ahead electricity prices in
eastern  Europe  increased amid increased exports to  Germany  and
outages in Poland.  Czech day-ahead power rose 3.8 percent to 64.86 euros
($93.10) a megawatt-hour, as the equivalent contract in Germany,
a benchmark for eastern Europe, advanced 4.3 percent to 65.80
euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Polish electricity for tomorrow was little changed at
225.31 zloty ($82.33) a megawatt-hour, according to Polish power
exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hungarian electricity, traded on the Budapest-based power
exchange, gained 4.5 percent to 64.72 euros, according to the
bourse’s website.  The  Czech Republic  has 17,625 megawatts of capacity
installed, according to Bloomberg data. The country exported
1,439 megawatts of power to Germany from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. local
time today, according to  Entsoe , the European Transmission
System Operators transparency platform.  Poland  exported 652
megawatts to Germany at the same time, with 2,928 megawatts kept
off-line, according to data from the power grid operator.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
