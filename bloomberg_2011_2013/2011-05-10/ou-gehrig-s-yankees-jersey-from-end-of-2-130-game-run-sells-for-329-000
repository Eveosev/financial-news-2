The jersey  Lou Gehrig  wore at the end
of his streak of 2,130 consecutive Major League Baseball games
played sold for $329,000.  The jersey was purchased yesterday by  SCP Auctions, Inc.  on
behalf of a client who wants to remain anonymous, company
spokeswoman Liz McCollum said in a telephone interview. It was
purchased from  Robert Edwards Auctions .  Gehrig, a Hall of Fame first baseman for the  New York
Yankees  who was nicknamed “The Iron Horse,” wore the road
jersey in the last game before his streak of consecutive games
played ended after 15 years on May 2, 1939. Gehrig’s record
stood until 1995, when it was broken by Cal Ripken.  Gehrig may have also worn the jersey during the Yankees’
1938 World Series win, McCollum said.  It’s one of only four Gehrig jerseys to be verified by
 Memorabilia Evaluation and Research Services  and once hung in
the Manhattan restaurant owned by Al Schacht, who was known as
“The Clown Prince of Baseball.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
