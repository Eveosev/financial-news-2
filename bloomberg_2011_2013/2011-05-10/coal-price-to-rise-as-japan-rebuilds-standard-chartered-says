Asian benchmark coal prices may rise
5.1 percent next quarter as the biggest importer  Japan  rebuilds
ports and cities devastated by the March earthquake and tsunami,
increasing demand for the fuel,  Standard Chartered  Plc said.  Coal shipped from Newcastle, Australia averaged $120.85 a
metric ton in the week to May 6, according to data from
Petersfield, England-based researcher IHS McCloskey. That’s a 12
percent rise over the past 12 months. Prices may average $124
this quarter and $127 in the third, Raymond Chan, an analyst
with Standard Chartered in Singapore, forecast in a report
today.  “Japanese utilities have been asking J-Power to provide
more coal for summer demand,” Chan said. “As the rebuilding
program progresses, this should eventually support demand and
therefore Pacific coal prices.”  The March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled power plants
and caused the worst nuclear disaster, since the Chernobyl
accident 25 years earlier, at  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi facility.  Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said today he will
reconsider a plan to increase the country’s dependence on
nuclear energy.  “We should start from scratch,” Kan said at a press
conference in Tokyo. “We will need to make nuclear energy safer
and more strongly promote renewable energy.”  Electric Power Development Co., also known as J-Power, is
Japan’s biggest power wholesaler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
