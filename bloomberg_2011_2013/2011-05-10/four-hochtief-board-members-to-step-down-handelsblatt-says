Four supervisory board members at
 Hochtief AG (HOT)  will step down before the company’s annual
shareholder meeting on May 12,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  Hans-Peter Keitel, Wilhelm Simson, Heinrich von Pierer and
Detlev Bremkamp have not been nominated as candidates for the
supervisory board by Hochtief’s largest shareholder, Actividades
de Construccion y Servicios AS, and therefore will not make
themselves available for reelection, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
