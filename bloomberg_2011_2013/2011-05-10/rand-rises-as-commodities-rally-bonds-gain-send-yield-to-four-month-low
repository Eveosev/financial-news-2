The rand depreciated to the lowest in
more than two weeks against the dollar as  Greece  struggled to
repay its debt, prompting investors to sell riskier assets, and
on speculation the  Reserve Bank  won’t raise rates in 2011.  The rand declined as much as 0.9 percent to 6.8114 per
dollar, its weakest level since April 21, and traded 0.5 percent
weaker at 6.7887 at 4:08 p.m. in Johannesburg. It slipped 0.9
percent to 9.7530 per euro.  Greek bond yields soared to a record on speculation the
government will be unable to meet its refinancing needs under
the conditions of its current 110 billion-euro ($158 billion)
bailout package. Greece’s credit rating was yesterday cut two
levels by  Standard & Poor’s , which said further reductions are
possible as the risk of default rises.  “Greece’s credit rating is the big news,”  John Cairns  and
Nema Ramkhelawan, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in a research note. “This is affecting the
rand via both  risk aversion  and via the euro, which dipped all
the way to under 1.4300 yesterday.”  The Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee today started
a three-day meeting to set the benchmark interest rate. The MPC
is expected to hold borrowing costs at 5.5 percent on Thursday,
according to the median estimate of 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The outlook for growth and inflation “augurs well for the
Reserve Bank to retain a more dovish than expected stance and
for local interest rates markets to push out expectations of a
rate hike into 2012,” Tradition Analytics researchers led by
Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note.  Bonds Rally  The  European Central Bank  last month raised its benchmark
rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 percent, eroding the extra
yield of rand assets, and said last week it would monitor
inflation closely.  Government bonds  gained, driving yields to four-month lows.
The 6.75 percent bonds due March 2021 climbed 61 cents to 89.18
rand, driving the yield down 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage
point, to 8.38 percent, the lowest on a closing basis since Jan.
13. The 10.5 percent notes due December 2026 gained 42 cents to
116.95 rand, cutting the yield four basis points to 8.52
percent.  The Reserve Bank auctioned 1.5 billion rand ($221.8
million) of 6.75 percent notes at an average yield of 8.35
percent, the lowest since the auction on Dec. 20. Investors bid
for five times the amount of debt on offer at the weekly
auction, the Pretoria-based central bank said on its Bloomberg
page. The bank also sold 600 million rand of 6.5 percent bonds
maturing in 2041 at a yield of 8.81 percent. Investors bid for
2.7 times the amount offered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
