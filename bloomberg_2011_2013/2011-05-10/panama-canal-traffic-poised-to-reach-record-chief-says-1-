Shipments through the  Panama Canal 
are on pace to climb to a record this year, surpassing levels
set before the global economic slump, canal Chief Executive
Officer Alberto Aleman said.  Traffic volume increased about 20 million metric tons from
October through March from the same period a year earlier, a 13
percent gain, Aleman said. Shipments for fiscal year 2010 were
300 million metric tons, up from 298 million in 2009 and
trailing the record 312 million in 2007, according to the Panama
Canal Authority. In December, Aleman predicted 1.5 percent
growth for 2011.  “We’ve seen in every segment of the canal very positive
growth,” Aleman said today at an event in  Washington . “Panama
is becoming and will become the biggest logistics center of the
Americas.”  The 50-mile (80-kilometer) canal connecting the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans is spending $5.25 billion to expand, a
project that began in 2007, adding locks on both sides of the
canal and deepening the waterway.  The U.S., which completed  building the canal  more than 96
years ago, remains the biggest customer. Port authorities from
Houston to  New York  are jostling for business from ships able to
pass through a wider canal. The expansion may slash
transportation costs as vessels as long as the Eiffel Tower
carry Asian goods to ports in the U.S. South and East.  As much as 25 percent of shipping traffic may be diverted
from  Los Angeles  and Long Beach, California, the busiest U.S.
ports, once the canal can accommodate larger ships heading from
 Asia  to Atlanta and Baltimore,  Fitch Ratings  said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
