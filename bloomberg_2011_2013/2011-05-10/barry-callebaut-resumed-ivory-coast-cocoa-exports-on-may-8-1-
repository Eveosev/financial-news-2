Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the world’s
largest maker of bulk chocolate, resumed exports of cocoa
products from  Ivory Coast  on May 8.  The first vessel left the port of San Pedro and was
destined for Europe, Raphael Wermuth, a spokesman for the
Zurich-based company, said by e-mail today. Other container
shipments headed for the U.S., Mexico and Europe will leave San
Pedro and the port of Abidjan this week, he added.  Shipments from Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer of
cocoa, were disrupted as a disputed Nov. 28 presidential
election led to armed conflict and a ban on cocoa exports from
the country. The ban was lifted last month, and shipments have
started to flow as local banks reopen.  “The overall situation in Cote d’Ivoire is improving day
by day,” Wermuth said. “Most of the banks have resumed
operations, shops are being supplied with food and traffic is
getting busier every day.”  Barry Callebaut , which counts U.S. confectioner  Hershey Co. (HSY) 
among its customers, also said public security in Ivory Coast
was “still not completely back to normal yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
