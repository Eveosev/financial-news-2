China ’s daily net crude oil imports
rose 3 percent in April from a month earlier as refineries
increased fuel production to ensure supplies to factories in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Net imports reached 21.25 million metric tons last month,
or 5.2 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on  data posted  today on the website of the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs. Net inbound
shipments gained 1.3 percent from a year earlier.  Factories boosted April exports to a historic high of
$155.7 billion, spurring refiners including  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028)  and PetroChina Co. to produce more gasoline and
diesel. The government, which controls fuel prices to curb
inflation, raised tariffs on April 7, helping to offset the 8.9
percent increase in the price of imported crude last month.  “Demand looks good, with the data showing imports didn’t
go down because of higher  oil prices ,” Shi Yan, a Shanghai-
based analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by phone.  China paid an average $108.86 a barrel for the crude it
purchased last month, compared with $99.94 in March, Bloomberg
calculations based on today’s data show. New York crude futures
rose 6.8 percent in April from March, marking the longest streak
of monthly gains since the contracts began trading in 1983.  The Chinese government raised retail fuel prices by as much
as 5.8 percent on April 7 after global crude costs gained.
That’s the second increase this year.  Net imports of fuel, including gasoline and diesel, fell to
1.2 million tons last month from 1.3 million tons in March,
according to today’s data. Net purchases reached a 29-month high
of 2.07 million tons in December.  Exports of coal were 1.4 million tons in April. The customs
data didn’t include import volumes.  --Chua Baizhen. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Jane Lee .  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
