World Cup-winning captain and coach
 Franz Beckenbauer , the man heading a task-force responsible for
suggesting ways to improve soccer, didn’t show up for its first
meeting in Zurich today.  Brazil’s Pele and England’s Bobby Charlton, two other
leading figures in the sport, also didn’t appear. Germany’s
Beckenbauer was unwell, governing body FIFA said. It wasn’t able
to say why three-time World Cup winner Pele and 1966 champion
Charlton were absent.  FIFA’s Task Force 2014 is one of the core planks of Sepp Blatter’s bid to secure a fourth term as the organization’s
president. It was slated to include 22 members, made up of
former players and administrators.  Blatter set up the group after last year’s  World Cup  in
South Africa. The tournament attracted criticism as not matching
the level of performances seen in top European leagues and
competitions such as the Champions League.  Soccer’s 208 nations will vote June 1 whether to retain
Blatter or select his rival Mohamed Bin Hammam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
