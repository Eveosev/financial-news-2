Egypt ’s public prosecutor extended
the detention of former President  Hosni Mubarak  for 15 days as
part of investigations into allegations that his administration
was involved in corruption and attacks on protesters.  Investigators questioned Mubarak today at the Sharm El-
Sheikh hospital where he is being treated while under detention,
the prosecutor’s office said today in a statement. The former
leader was hospitalized for a possible heart attack last month
while investigators were interviewing him.  Mubarak’s detention was initially ordered for 15 days on
April 13 by the prosecutor’s office and was renewed for another
15 days on April 22. The prosecution of Mubarak was among the
main demands of protesters whose revolt prompted him to cede
power to the military on Feb. 11.  Prosecutors on April 22 quizzed Mubarak about attacks on
demonstrators during the uprising that ended his three-decade
rule and about a deal to export gas to  Israel . Mubarak and his
two sons, also in detention, were summoned for questioning about
alleged embezzlement of public funds and attacks on protesters,
the prosecutor said on April 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
