The 104,532-ton tanker Zaliv Baikal
tanker was diverted from Center Point Terminal Co.’s Port Allen,
Louisiana terminal because of concern that the ship wouldn’t fit
under the Interstate 10 bridge over the  Mississippi River .  There was less than a foot of clearance between the vessel
and the bridge near mile marker 229 on the Mississippi, as the
ship headed upriver, Larry Rase, director of the Louisiana River
Pilots Association, said in a telephone interview. He said he
received the information from the New Orleans to Baton Rouge
Steamship Pilots Association.  The tanker was carrying so-called black oil, Roger Lanier,
the Center Point terminal manager, said in a telephone
interview. The shipment was being delivered to a customer of the
terminal for storage, he said.  The tanker turned around because of concerns that it
wouldn’t be able to pass back under the bridge after discharging
and would have to wait until  Mississippi  River levels fell, Rase
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
