The halt in U.S. home foreclosures
means economic recovery will take longer than was expected a few
months ago, according to Iain Mackay,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s chief
financial officer, the Wall Street Journal reported.   The moratorium, imposed because of regulators’ concerns
over irregularities, is exerting “a direct downward pressure”
on  home prices , Mackay said yesterday, when HSBC presented
quarterly results, the newspaper reported.   The bank always expected a slow U.S. recovery and “we
expect it to be slower now,” the Journal cited Mackay as
saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
