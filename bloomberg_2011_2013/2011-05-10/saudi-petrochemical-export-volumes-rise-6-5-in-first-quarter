Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest oil
exporter, said petrochemical shipments grew 6.5 percent in the
first quarter of the year compared with the same period of 2010.  The country shipped 7.309 million metric tons of
petrochemicals from its ports from January through March, up
from 6.863 million tons during the same three months of last
year, the  Saudi Ports Authority  said on its website.  Saudi petrochemical makers, including  Saudi Basic
Industries Corp. (SABIC) , exported 2.659 million tons in March alone,
the data showed. This is 6.8 percent more than they shipped in
February and 6 percent more than in March 2010, according to the
authority’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
