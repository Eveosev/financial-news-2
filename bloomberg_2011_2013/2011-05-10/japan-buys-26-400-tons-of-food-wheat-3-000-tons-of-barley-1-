Japan  bought 26,400 metric tons of
food wheat and 3,000 tons of barley today through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Of the wheat purchases, 21,000 tons were from Canada, 3,000
tons were from  Australia  and the remaining volume was from the
U.S., the ministry said in a statement. All the barley was from
Australia for beer production, it said.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality. Shipments for
the grains must be made by July 31, according to Masafumi Otsuka
at the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
