Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ,  Europe ’s largest
mail carrier, faces an expanded state-subsidy investigation by
European Union regulators over payments from the German
government to cover workers’ pension costs.  Subsidies and an increase in regulated postage prices to
cover pensions for workers with civil-servant status may harm
rivals that may pay 10 to 15 percent more in contributions, the
European Commission said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  “We are still saddled with claims of overcompensation to
the former monopolies which, if proven, distorts fair and
healthy competition,” EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in the statement.  Deutsche Post called the EU allegations “baseless” and
said there have been no new facts since a related 2002 decision
was dismissed, Dirk Klasen, a spokesman for the Bonn, Germany-
based company said by phone. Deutsche Post said today that it
contributed 542 million euros ($778 million) to a pension fund
for the company’s civil servants in the first quarter.  The probe broadens the scope of an investigation that
started in 2007 into “all public measures, such as transfers of
public money and tariff income” granted to Deutsche Post and
its predecessor Postdienst since 1989. The prior probe was
prompted by complaints from Atlanta-based  United Parcel Service
Inc. (UPS) , the world’s largest package-delivery company, the EU said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
