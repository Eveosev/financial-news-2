Piraeus Port Authority SA , operator
of  Greece ’s largest harbour, said the number of cruise ships
docking at the port rose 5.1 percent in the first quarter after
the government raised restrictions on ship crews last year.  The overall number of passengers arriving in Piraeus on
cruise ships rose 58 percent to 139,692, while the number of
transit passengers, whose ships called at the port as part of a
bigger itinerary, increased almost 73 percent, the port operator
said in a statement on its website.  “The figures justify our predictions that even during the
winter there can be a recovery in the cruise-ship sector,”
Chief Executive Officer Yiorgos Anomeritis said in the
statement. Piraeus Port cut docking fees for vessels, including
 cruise ships , on March 21.  Greece is seeking to raise an additional $1 billion a year
from maritime tourism. The country last year lifted so-called
cabotage restrictions that required non-European Union ships
operating in Greek waters to employ Greek sailors.  Tourism is Greece’s largest industry, which will account
for just under 16 percent of economic output and almost one in
five jobs in 2011, according to the London-based  World Travel
and Tourism Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
