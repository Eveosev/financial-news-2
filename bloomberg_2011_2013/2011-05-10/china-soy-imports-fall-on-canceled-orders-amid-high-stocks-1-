Soybean imports by  China , the world’s
biggest buyer, fell for a third month after high stockpiles and
weak demand eroded crushing margins and forced some buyers to
cut or postpone shipments.  Inbound cargoes were 3.88 million metric tons in April,
down 7.6 percent from 4.2 million tons a year ago, according to
customs data. Shipments were 3.5 million tons last month,
customs records show.  “This is less than we expected and a confirmation that
imports are still slow,” said Wang Wenfei, analyst at Wanda
Futures Co., by phone from Beijing. “Crushers have canceled or
postponed many shipments from the U.S. and  South America  because
of mounting losses and high inventories of meal and beans.”  China’s soybean crushers canceled more than 10 cargoes of
the oilseed last month to cut growing processing losses, state-
affiliated researcher Grain.gov.cn said April 19. Slower demand
from China, which buys almost 60 percent of global exports, has
contributed to the commodity’s 4.3 percent decline this year.  Soybeans for July delivery rose 0.4 percent to $13.405 at
11:47 a.m. Beijing time on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Since the end of last year, about 6.5 million to 7 million
tons of soybeans have sat in ports across China, compared with
about the average of about 4.5 million tons last year, Wang
said. “There is no sign yet that inventory is falling,” he
said.  The government has privately sold about 3 million tons of
reserve beans, harvested in 2008, to large crushers in a move to
curb cooking-oil prices, and that will further erode demand for
imported soybeans, Wang said.  China is projected to import 57 million tons of soybeans in
the 2010-2011 marketing year, according to the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture , 13 percent more than the year before. Imports
this year as low as 51 million tons as the market worsened,
analyst Monica Tu of Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. said last
month.  --William Bi. Editors:  Richard Dobson ,  Matthew Oakley   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
