The following is the text of the
U.S. import and export price index report from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.  U.S. import prices increased 2.2 percent in April, the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today, after rising 2.6
percent the previous month. Higher fuel and nonfuel prices
contributed to the advances in each month. Prices for U.S.
exports increased 1.1 percent in April following a 1.5 percent
advance the previous month.  Imports  All Imports: Import prices rose 2.2 percent in April following
a 2.6 percent advance in March, the first time import prices
increased by more than two percent in consecutive months since
June 2008. The price index for overall imports recorded an
increase each month since October and rose 11.1 percent over
the past year. The 12-month advance in April was the largest
year-over-year increase since an 11.2 percent gain between
April 2009 and April 2010.  Fuel Imports: Import fuel prices advanced 6.7 percent in April
and accounted for approximately 80 percent of the overall
increase in import prices. In April, a 7.2 percent jump in
petroleum prices more than offset a 2.7 percent drop in
natural gas prices. Prices for import fuel rose 34.8 percent
for the year ended in April, driven by a 36.8 percent advance
in petroleum prices. In contrast, natural gas prices ticked
down 0.1 percent over the past 12 months.  All Imports Excluding Fuel: Nonfuel import prices increased
0.6 percent in April. The price index for nonfuel industrial
supplies and materials, up 1.7 percent in April was the
largest contributor to both the monthly and yearly advances in
nonfuel import prices. Each of the major finished goods
categories also rose for the month. Prices for nonfuel imports
recorded a second consecutive 12-month increase of 4.3 percent
in April, the largest year-over-year advances since a 4.8
percent rise for the year ended in October 2008.  Exports  All Exports: U.S. export prices advanced 1.1 percent in April,
after rising 1.5 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, in
March and February. Higher prices for agricultural exports and
nonagricultural exports contributed to the increases in each
of the three months. Export prices rose 9.6 percent over the
past year, matching the 12-month advance in March; those were
the largest year-over-year increases since export prices
jumped 10.2 percent in July 2008.  Agricultural Exports: Prices for agricultural exports rose 0.6
percent in April, the smallest monthly advance since the index
last recorded a decline in July 2010. A 2.6 percent increase
in corn prices and a 2.1 percent rise in meat prices more than
offset declining prices for nuts and a downturn in cotton
prices. Agricultural prices increased 35.3 percent over the
past year, the largest 12-month gain since the July 2007-08
period. The increase for the year ended in April was led by a
96.3 percent advance in corn prices and a 142.5 percent jump
in cotton prices.  All Exports Excluding Agriculture: The price index for
nonagricultural exports rose 1.0 percent in April, led by a
2.5 percent increase in nonagricultural industrial supplies
and materials prices. Each of the major finished goods
categories also advanced in April. Nonagricultural export
prices increased 6.9 percent for the year ended in April, the
third consecutive month where the 12-month advance was greater
than six percent.  Import Prices  Nonfuel Industrial Supplies and Materials: The price index for
nonfuel industrial supplies and materials rose 1.7 percent in
April following a 2.0 percent rise the previous month. Both
increases were led by higher chemical and unfinished metals
prices, which increased 2.4 percent and 1.7 percent,
respectively, in April. The rise in chemical prices was driven
by a 6.6 percent advance in plastics prices, and the largest
contributors to the rise in unfinished metals prices were
prices for gold and other precious metals.  Finished Goods: Each of the major finished goods categories
increased in April. Prices for  consumer goods  and automotive
vehicles each rose 0.4 percent for the month. Capital goods
prices ticked up 0.1 percent, as a 0.5 percent decline in the
price index for computers, peripherals, and semiconductors
partially offset a 0.4 percent increase in capital goods
prices, excluding computers, peripherals, and semiconductors.  Foods, Feeds, and Beverages: Foods, feeds, and beverages
prices advanced 1.8 percent in April after a 4.2 percent rise
in March. The April increase was driven by a 22.8 percent jump
in coffee prices.  Imports by Locality of Origin: Prices for imports from  China 
advanced 0.4 percent in April, following a 0.6 percent
increase the previous month. Import prices from China rose 2.8

American/Caribbean fares. The overall index for import air
