Iran ’s parliament has approved a
budget of 5,083 trillion rials ($480 billion) based on an oil
price of $81.5 a barrel for the current Iranian year, state-run
media including the  Mehr  news agency reported.  The budget for this calendar year, which started March 21,
is about 40 percent more than last year’s due to an increase in
global  oil prices  and the implementation in December of a
government spending program that involves phasing out energy and
food subsidies. President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s proposed budget
of 5,390 trillion rials, submitted to the parliament on Feb. 20,
was revised downward by lawmakers over concerns that it may fuel
inflation.  Of the lawmakers present yesterday, 144 voted for the
budget while 29 voted against and 12 abstained, the official
 Islamic Republic News Agency  said. The bill includes the
government or public budget as well as spending for state-owned
companies.  Iran’s inflation accelerated to 13.2 percent in the 12
months through the Iranian month of Farvardin, which ended April
20, from 12.4 percent in the previous month, according to data
published on the central bank’s  website . Lawmaker Ahmad Tavakoli, who heads the parliament’s research center, warned
that inflation may approach 40 percent this year, according to a
report today in the Tehran-based newspaper  Shargh .  Iran, which holds the world’s fourth-biggest oil reserves,
based last year’s budget on an average oil price of $65 a
barrel. Deputies agreed to increase the price used to calculate
budget from an initial $80 a barrel,  IRNA  said an April 27
report.  Crude for June delivery slid as much as $2.43 to $100.12 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $101.22 at 2:42 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract rose 5.5 percent to $102.55 yesterday, the most since
Feb. 22.  The budget must go for final approval to the Council of
Guardians, a body with the power to veto legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
