Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Bonny oil
terminal in  Nigeria  returned to normal after operational
problems, according to a company official.  “Bonny is operating normally,” the London-based official
said in an e-mail, declining to be identified in line with
company policy.  Five cargoes of Bonny Light were added to loading programs
for May and June, according to revised schedules obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Four 950,000-barrel shipments were added to the May plan,
bringing total exports for May to 10 cargoes, or 306,452 barrels
a day, the programs showed.  Exports of Bonny Light for June were revised up to eight
cargoes totaling 243,333 barrels a day after one 650,000-barrel
consignment was included, according to the programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
