Slovakia will meet its 2011 budget-
deficit target as improved tax receipts and savings offset
unplanned expenditures and unrealized revenue, Finance Minister
Ivan Miklos said.  Expenditures this year may rise by 300 million euros ($430
million) to finance health care and an overhaul of the state
railways, while higher-than-planned dividend payments from state
companies, savings on debt financing and co-financing of
European Union projects will trim the gap by the same amount, he
told a news conference in Bratislava today.  Slovakia’s budget deficit swelled in 2009 when the country
was hit by its first-ever full-year recession, prompting the
government to cut spending and raise indirect taxes to stabilize
public finances. The eastern European country aims to narrow the
budget shortfall to 4.9 percent of gross domestic product from
7.8 percent of GDP in 2010.  The government also doesn’t expect to sell its carbon
emission permits this year, leading to a loss of revenue
amounting to 70 million euros, Miklos said. The ministry also
expects tax receipts to exceed target, he said, though
the exact amount has yet to be calculated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
