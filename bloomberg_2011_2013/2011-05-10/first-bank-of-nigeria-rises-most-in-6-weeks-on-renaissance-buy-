     May 10 (Bloomberg)--  First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, rose the most in
six weeks after  Renaissance Capital  rated it “buy” in
reinitiated coverage.  The stock gained 66 kobo, or 5 percent, its biggest
intraday increase since March 22, to 13.92 naira by 12:24 p.m.
in Lagos.  Renaissance placed a “buy” recommendation on First Bank
and five other Nigerian lenders, saying April elections in
Africa’s most populous nation were “positive, and should shift
market focus away from political risk,” analysts David Nangle,
Adesoji Solanke and Armen Gasparyan wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients yesterday. “Credit growth has started to recover.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
