Tanzania’s economic growth will
probably accelerate to 7.2 percent next year from 6 percent in
2011 if the country has better rains after dry conditions this
year, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The East African nation will fall short of an “ambitious”
tax revenue target for the fiscal year through June and may need
to further reduce spending, the Washington-based institution
said in a statement on its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
