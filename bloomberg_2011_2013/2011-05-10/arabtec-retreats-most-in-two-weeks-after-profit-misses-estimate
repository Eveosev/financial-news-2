plunged 80 percent, missing analysts’ estimates.  The shares declined 3.6 percent, the most since April 25,
to 1.36 dirhams at 10:38 a.m. in Dubai. Dubai’s benchmark  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.3 percent.  Net income tumbled to 26.6 million dirhams ($7.2 million),
the company said in a statement to Dubai’s bourse today. That
compares with a profit of 134.5 million dirhams a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The median estimate of
seven analysts was for a profit of 70 million dirhams, according
