Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
criticized the Cabinet for failing to procure arms for the
military, saying defense-industry and government officials will
be held responsible for the delay.  “It is unacceptable when a decision is made at the highest
level, money is allocated and production is not delivered,”
Medvedev said today in remarks broadcast by state television.
“In previous times, half of those present here would be doing
active physical labor in the fresh air.”  He urged the overhaul of the military after a five-day war
with  Georgia  in August 2008, including an upgrade of Russia’s
nuclear deterrent and the renewed production of aircraft
carriers. The nation’s previous weapons-procurement program
failed, said Medvedev, who has pledged to earmark 20 trillion
rubles ($720 billion) to buy domestic arms in the next decade.  Today, he told the government to complete the placement of
weapons orders by the end of May and to present a new program
for development of the defense industry.  Medvedev said in November 2009 that  Russia  would add more
than 30 ballistic  missiles , five Iskander short-range missile
systems, 300 armored vehicles, 30 helicopters, 28 warplanes,
three nuclear submarines and a naval corvette in 2010.  Russian armed forces last year received 27 ballistic
missiles, 37 helicopters and 21 aircraft as well as 19 air-
defense systems including S-400s,  Export Vooruzheniy  magazine,
published by the Moscow-based Center for the Analysis of
Strategies and Technologies, reported in its April 28 issue.  ‘Set in Stone’  Russia has steadily increased its spending on arms
procurement, which last year reached 490.4 billion rubles,
according to the magazine. That included 318.8 billion rubles on
new weapons, 63.7 billion rubles on upgrades and repairs and
107.9 billion rubles on research and development works.  Arms procurement is set to increase to 726 billion rubles
in 2012 from this year’s 574.6 billion rubles, and top 1
trillion rubles in 2013, Export Vooruzheniy says.  Medvedev, who has said his words are “ set in stone ,” has
often complained about the government dragging its feet on his
decisions, most recently about measures to avoid a repeat of
last year’s forest fires, which killed more than 50 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
