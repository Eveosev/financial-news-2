IntelePeer Inc., a cloud-based
communications service provider, filed an initial public
offering for as much as $100 million with the Securities and
Exchange Commission today.  The  company  offers a service that helps businesses and
phone companies manage different voice and video connections
more efficiently, store phone numbers and design applications
for communications networks, it said in a filing.  IntelePeerâ€™s revenue has more than doubled since 2008 to
$111.5 million last year and the  San Mateo , California-based
company counts  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  and Qwest Communications
International Inc. as customers. The company will use the
proceeds of the share sale for working capital and general
corporate purposes, the filing said.  The global market for cloud-related services may more than
double to $148.8 billion in 2014 from $58.6 billion in 2009,
said Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner Inc. Cloud-based
computing services allow users to store software on the
Internet.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG, and Barclays Plc
are managing the IPO, along with Royal Bank of Canada and
William Blair & Co., according to the filing.  The biggest shareholders are  VantagePoint Venture Partners ,
the investment firm run by Alan Salzman, and entities affiliated
with private-equity company Kennet Partners Ltd., which each own
about 28 percent of the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
