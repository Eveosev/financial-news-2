Cogentrix Energy LLC , a unit of
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , received a $90.6 million conditional
loan guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department to build a solar
plant in  Colorado .  The 30-megawatt Alamosa Solar Generating Project will use
concentrating photovoltaic technology that focuses the sun’s
rays to increase output, according to a statement today from the
Energy Department.  The concentrating solar plant near the city of Alamosa will
have optical equipment and multijunction solar cells from Amonix
Inc. that boost conversion efficiency to about 40 percent, or
nearly double that of conventional photovoltaic panels, the
agency said. It will also use a dual-axis tracking system to
follow the sun’s movement throughout the day and maximize power
production.  Public Service Co. of Colorado, an  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) 
utility, will purchase all of the generated electricity, which
is expected to be enough to power more than 6,500 homes.  Cogentrix operates 17 power plants in the U.S. and one in
Turkey, fueled mainly by natural gas and coal. It expanded into
solar with the February 2009 purchase of two solar-thermal
facilities in Daggett, California, that have 43 megawatts of
capacity.  The Energy Department’s loan guarantee program has
committed more than $7.5 billion in loan guarantees for solar
energy projects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
