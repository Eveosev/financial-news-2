Endesa SA (ELE) ’s first-quarter profit fell
a less-than-expected 56 percent as the Spanish utility
controlled by Italy’s  Enel SpA (ENEL)  earned higher prices for
electricity and increased revenue.  Net income dropped to 669 million euros ($957 million), the
Madrid-based company said today in a  filing , beating the 608
million-euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of four
analysts. Endesa a year earlier earned 1.54 billion euros, with
881 million euros of that representing gains from transferring
its renewable-energy assets to Enel’s Green Power unit.  Revenue rose 8.7 percent to 8.36 billion euros, Endesa
said. It didn’t give its average sales price per megawatt-hour.
The stock climbed as much as 2.4 percent in Madrid and was the
No. 2 performer on the 23-member Bloomberg Europe 500 Electric
Index, trading 1.9 percent higher at 23.40 euros a share as of
11:40 a.m. local time. Enel and Endesa are the best and third-
best performers on the benchmark this year, up 25 percent and 21
percent, respectively.  Enel owns 92 percent of Endesa after gaining control of the
company in 2007. As part of that deal, Endesa also transferred
some renewable-energy units to builder Acciona SA and sold
assets to  Germany ’s E.ON AG. The company has been selling more
units to increase savings after the takeover.  Endesa’s net debt declined 17 percent to 12.66 billion
euros from Dec. 31. Of that debt, 6.14 billion euros, or 49
percent, represents money the company has borrowed to finance
the so-called tariff deficit. Under Spanish law, Endesa must be
repaid that money by power consumers over a period of years.  Endesa on March 31 said it agreed to sell its systems and
telecommunications business to an Enel unit for 250 million
euros, generating a gross capital gain of 170 million euros for
the Spanish company.  The utility had a capacity of 40,142 megawatts at the end
of December, of which 33 percent was hydropower, 23 percent
“oil-gas,” 18 percent gas-fired, 16 percent coal-fired and 9
percent nuclear.  To contact the reporters on this story:
