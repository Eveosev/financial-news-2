The Greek government and its
creditors should only consider a restructuring of the country’s
debt after other steps to revamp its finances and the economy
have been taken,  Germany ’s  BDB  banking association said.  Greece would run a deficit of 1.5 percent of gross domestic
product this year even if it didn’t have to pay any interest on
its debt, the BDB, which represents lenders such as  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , said in its monthly report. Any
restructuring would have to be voluntary to keep its “negative
consequences” small, it said.  “The loss of confidence in the cohesion of the monetary
union and hence the contagion effects on other countries would
be enormous in the case of a disorderly non-payment by a euro
country,” the Berlin-based BDB said. “The experience of the
past shows that non-cooperative investors are a small minority
when debtors negotiate in good will and constructively with
their creditors.”  Greece’s credit rating was cut two levels yesterday to B
from BB- by  Standard & Poor’s , which said further reductions are
possible as the risk of default rises. German banks’ claims
against Greek borrowers fell to $34 billion in the final quarter
of 2010 from more than $40 billion, Bank for International
Settlements statistics show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
