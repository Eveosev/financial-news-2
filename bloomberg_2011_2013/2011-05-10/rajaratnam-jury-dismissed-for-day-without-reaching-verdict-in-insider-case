Jurors in the insider-trading case of
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam ended their 11th day
of deliberations without reaching a verdict, sending a note or
indicating which way they are leaning.  The jury began deliberations April 25 and had to restart
the process on May 4, when a juror was replaced for medical
reasons. The panel will return tomorrow to  Manhattan  federal
court to continue weighing evidence. The trial began March 8.  Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial as part of the largest
crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
Prosecutors said he gained $63.8 million from tips leaked by
corporate insiders and hedge-fund traders about stocks including
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and Clearwire Corp.  Rajaratnam, who said he based the trades on research, faces
as long as 20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious
counts.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
