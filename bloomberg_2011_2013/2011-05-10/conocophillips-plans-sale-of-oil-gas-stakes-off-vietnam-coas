ConocoPhillips (COP) , the third-largest
U.S. oil company, said it plans to sell its stake in three oil
and natural gas assets off Vietnam’s coast.  The energy producer is seeking to dispose of its holdings
in the projects located in the  South China Sea , said John McLemore, a company spokesman.  The Houston-based company plans $5 billion to $10 billion
in asset sales over 2011 and 2012 as it seeks cash to fund share
buybacks and growth. ConocoPhillips sold about $7 billion in
assets last year through a program announced in 2009 and
intended in part to help reduce debt. The company expanded the
total sales target earlier this year to as much as $17 billion.  The company is marketing its assets in  Vietnam  as part of
the divestiture program, McLemore said in an e-mail yesterday.
ConocoPhillips’s Vietnam assets are valued at about $1.5
billion,  Paul Sankey , a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, said in an
April 27 note to clients.  ConocoPhillips holds a 23.3 percent stake in a cluster of
five fields in Block 15-1 in the Cuu Long Basin, according to
data on the Vietnam page of its  website . It has a 36 percent
share of the Rang Dong field in Block 15-2, also in the basin.
The fields produced 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day on
average in 2009, the data show.  The company also is offering its 16.3 percent stake in the
Nam Con Son gas pipeline, a 700 million cubic-feet-a-day link
that connects the Nam Con Son Basin with southern Vietnam.  Reducing its Stake  A sale would allow the company to reduce its stake in an
area that isn’t a significant part of its business, said  Jason Gammel , an analyst at Macquarie Capital  Europe  in  London  who has
a “neutral” rating on ConocoPhillips shares and owns none.  “It’s a pretty small piece of their overall production, so
there likely would be other parties who would find it of more
interest,” Gammel said. Potential buyers may include Chinese or
Indian parties, he said, although it’s unclear whether the
Vietnamese government would approve a sale to such owners.  ConocoPhillips has discussed the sale plans with  Vietnam
Oil & Gas Group , the state-owned company known as PetroVietnam,
which also has stakes in the assets, said two senior executives
who declined to be identified because the matter is not public.  The sale would require approval from PetroVietnam’s board
of directors and the  Ministry of Industry and Trade , one of the
company officials said. Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Le
Duong Quang declined to comment on the sale plan.  PetroVietnam  PetroVietnam has a 50 percent stake in Block 15-1, with
ConocoPhillips, Korea National Oil Corp., SK Corp. and Geopetrol
holding the rest, according to the U.S. company’s website.  Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co. has a 46.5 percent share of
Rang Dong field, while PetroVietnam holds a 17.5 percent stake.
ConocoPhillips owns the rest, data from the website show.  The Vietnamese state oil company has a 51% stake in the Nam
Con Son pipeline.  BP Plc (BP/)  in October agreed to sell its 32.7
percent stake in the pipeline to Moscow-based TNK-BP.
ConocoPhillips owns the remaining share.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
