Taiwan ’s dollar rose for a second day
after exports jumped to a record in April, boosting the outlook
for the island’s economic growth.  Official data showed yesterday that overseas shipments
climbed 24.6 percent from a year earlier to $27.3 billion,
compared with the median estimate for an 18 percent rise in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. The currency pared gains toward
the end of trading on suspected intervention by the central
bank, according to two traders who declined to be identified as
the monetary authority doesn’t disclose such details.  “Better-than-expected export figures supported the
currency,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Income from overseas will continue
to drive up the  Taiwan dollar .”  Taiwan’s currency advanced 0.1 percent to NT$28.725 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It was trading 0.6 percent stronger at
NT$28.584 one minute before the end of trading.  Government bonds  were little changed after the government
sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of 30-year securities at a
record-low yield of 1.889 percent.  The rate on the 1 percent note due January 2016, the most-
traded government debt, was 1.090 percent, unchanged from
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
