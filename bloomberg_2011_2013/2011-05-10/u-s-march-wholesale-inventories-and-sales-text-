The following is the text of
the U.S. wholesale inventories report from the Commerce
Department.  Sales  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that March
2011 sales of merchant wholesalers, except manufacturers'
sales branches and offices, after adjustment for seasonal
variations and trading-day differences but not for price
changes, were $392.0 billion, up 2.9 percent (+/-0.5%)
from the revised February level and were up 15.4 percent
(+/-1.2%) from the March 2010 level.  The February
preliminary estimate was revised upward $1.9 billion or
0.5 percent.  March sales of durable goods were up 2.3
percent (+/-0.9%) from last month and were up 13.6 percent
(+/-2.1%) from a year ago. Sales of lumber and other
construction materials were up 7.3 percent from last month
and sales of metals and minerals, except petroleum, were
up 6.7 percent. Sales of nondurable goods were up 3.4
percent (+/-0.7%) from last month and were up 16.8 percent
(+/-1.4%) from last year. Sales of petroleum and petroleum
products were up 7.9 percent from last month and sales of
chemicals and allied products were up 6.3 percent.  Inventories  Total inventories of merchant wholesalers, except
manufacturers' sales branches and offices, after
adjustment for seasonal variations but not for price
changes, were $442.9 billion at the end of March, up 1.1
percent (+/-0.2%) from the revised February level and were
up 13.3 percent (+/-1.2%) from a year ago.  The February
preliminary estimate was revised upward $0.1 billion. End-
of-month inventories of durable goods were up 0.4 percent
(+/-0.4%)* from last month and were up 8.8 percent (+/-
1.2%) from last March. Inventories of machinery,

month, while inventories of computer and computer
peripheral equipment and software were down 3.9 percent.
End-of-month inventories of nondurable goods were up 2.0

(+/-2.3%) compared to last March. Inventories of drugs and
druggists' sundries were up 3.0 percent from last month
and inventories of chemicals and allied products were up
2.7 percent.  Data in this report are based on a sample and,
therefore, are subject to sampling and nonsampling error.
