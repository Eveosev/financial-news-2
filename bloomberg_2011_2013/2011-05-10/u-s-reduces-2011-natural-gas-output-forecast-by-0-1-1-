The U.S. lowered its forecast for
natural gas output in 2011 by 0.1 percent and raised its outlook
for prices.  Marketed gas production will average 63.23 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, down from 63.32 billion estimated in April,
the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook , released today in  Washington . The estimate is up 2.3
percent from 61.83 billion produced in 2010.  Production in the  Gulf of Mexico  will average 5.56 billion
cubic feet a day, down from 5.62 billion estimated last month,
according to the report from the department’s Energy Information
Administration. Lower-48-state output is pegged at 56.63
billion, down from 56.65 billion.  The government agency said it expects production to “begin
modest month-to-month declines that could continue through the
year because of reductions in the number of active natural gas
drilling rigs.”  Total gas consumption will average 66.48 billion cubic feet
a day, down from 66.75 billion estimated in April.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $4.37 per million British thermal units, up from
the previous estimate of $4.10, according to the department.  “The decline in drilling activity this year and forecast
increase in consumption next year contribute to higher natural
gas prices next year and a turnabout in drilling activity during
2012,” the report said.  LNG imports will average 940 million cubic feet a day this
year, down from 1.05 billion forecast in April.  Demand for gas from power plants will average 20.29 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up from the previous estimate of
20.28 billion. Industrial demand will average 18.43 billion,
compared with 18.73 billion predicted last month.  Natural gas for June delivery rose 2.8 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $4.182 per million Btu at 12:30 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have declined 5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
