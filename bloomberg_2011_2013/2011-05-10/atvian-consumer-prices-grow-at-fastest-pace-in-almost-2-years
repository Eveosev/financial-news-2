Latvian consumer prices rose at the
fastest pace in 23 months and quicker than analysts’ expected in
April as the costs of food and fuel accelerated.  The inflation rate advanced to 4.5 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 4.2 percent increase in the previous
month, the Riga-based  statistics office  said on its website
today. The median estimate of five economists in a Bloomberg
survey was 4 percent. On the month, consumer prices grew 1.1
percent.  Inflation accelerated after the government raised the
value-added tax in January and the Baltic nation’s economy began
to rebound following deflation of 1.1 percent last year.
Consumer prices may rise more than 4 percent this year, Prime
Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said on the  Latvijas Radio  program
Krustpunkts on April 6.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.8
billion) loan in 2008 after the collapse of its second-biggest
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
