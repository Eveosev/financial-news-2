An outbreak of foot and mouth disease
could cost the Botswana Meat Commission and its farmers as much
as 450 million pula ($69 million) because of a suspension on
shipments to the European Union, the  Monitor  reported.  EU abattoir hygiene and animal traceability rules means
Botswana may not be able to ship beef to the region for at least
six months, the Gaborone-based newspaper said on its website,
citing Philip Fischer, chairman of the Botswana Cattle
Producersâ€™ Association. The Botswana Meat Commission is a state-
owned company that owns abattoirs in the African nation.  Botswana plans to slaughter 10,000 cattle to curb the foot
and mouth outbreak,  Mmegi reported  yesterday, citing Agriculture
Minister Christian de Graaf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
