Chalmette Refining LLC’s refinery at
 St. Bernard , Louisiana, had a release of benzene and hydrogen
sulfide because of a leak, possibly on the exchanger, according
to a filing with the National Response Center.  “We had a minor leak,” Kevin Allexon, an  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  spokesman based in Fairfax, Virginia, said in an e-mail.
“This has not affected production.”  The refinery is a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela
SA. The plant has a capacity of 200,700 barrels a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
