PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s largest
lender, said first-quarter profit rose 21 percent, missing
estimates that an executive called “too ambitious.”  Net income rose to 871 million zloty ($316 million) from
720 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said in
a regulatory statement today.  That missed the 941.5 million-zloty mean estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Bartosz Drabikowski called the PAP newswire’s consensus of 947
million zloty “too ambitious,” Elzbieta Anders, a spokeswoman
for the Warsaw-based bank, said by phone yesterday, confirming
remarks to the agency.  Net interest income rose to 1.72 billion zloty from 1.47
billion zloty. Net fee and commission income climbed to 737.2
million zloty from 725.4 million zloty.  PKO’s shares slumped after Drabikowski’s remarks yesterday,
ending the day with a loss of 2.3 percent after gaining as much
as 0.5 percent.  Bank executives are scheduled to discuss the earnings at a
news conference at 10 a.m. in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
