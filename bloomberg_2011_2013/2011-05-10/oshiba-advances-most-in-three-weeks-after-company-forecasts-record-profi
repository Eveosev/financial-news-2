Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the world’s No. 2
maker of flash-memory chips, rose the most in three weeks in
Tokyo trading after saying profit will climb to a record as
demand for storage chips offsets the impact of  Japan ’s March 11
earthquake and tsunami.  Toshiba added 3.2 percent to 449 yen as of 9:06 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed for the biggest gain since April
20. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
