Greece  approved plans to build an
international-standards racetrack that can be used for staging
 Formula One  car racing, the  Ministry for Regional Development
and Competitiveness  said.  The track near the western port city of  Patras  will cost
94.6 million euros ($135.8 million), the Athens-based ministry
said today in an e-mailed statement. It will be designed to host
other events as well, including world championship motorbike
racing and go-kart racing, the ministry said.  The three-year project, which requires parliamentary
approval, will boost tourism in the region and create 497 jobs,
according to the statement.  Racetrack Patras SA, a private  investment company  with 411
shareholders, will oversee the project. The state will provide a
subsidy of just over 28.9 million euros, or almost 31 percent,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
