The cost of protecting bonds in Asia
and  Australia  from non-payment was little changed, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was at 106 basis points as of 8:15 a.m.
in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was at 106.5 basis points
as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 122
basis points as of 9:17 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
