Cash premiums for soybeans shipped in
May to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as drier weather allowed farmers to focus on spring
fieldwork instead of transporting crops. The corn basis fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 58 cents to 68 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 58 cents to 65 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis fell to 55 cents to 56
cents a bushel, from 56 cents to 57 cents.  “During planting season, grain movement basically shuts
down,” said Scott Stoller, a merchandiser for Michlig
Agricenter Inc. in Manlius,  Illinois . “As soon as the planters
are parked, the grower will move more grain.”  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $13.38 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has gained 39 percent in the past year.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 0.25 cent to $7.0725 a
bushel on the CBOT. The grain is up 91 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
