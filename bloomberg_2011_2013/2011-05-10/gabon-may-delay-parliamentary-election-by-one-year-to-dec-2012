Gabon  may delay a parliamentary
election by one year to December 2012 in order to implement a
biometrics system for the electoral register, according to
statement from the presidency read on national radio.  The Constitutional Court must decide whether the
implementation of a biometrics system “can justify postponing
of the parliamentary elections,” President Ali Bongo Ondimba
said in the statement.  The announcement followed a meeting between the president
and other political and civil society leaders, according to the
