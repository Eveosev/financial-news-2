Safra National Bank of New York was
sued for at least $111.7 million by  Irving Picard , the trustee
liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s defunct investment firm.  Picard seeks to recover transfers made to Safra from so-
called feeder funds that invested with Madoff, according to a
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  Safra “knew or should have known of numerous irregularities
concerning investing” through Madoff given its background and
its own investments with the convicted Ponzi-scheme operator,
Picard said in the complaint.  Picard has filed hundreds of lawsuits to recover money for
victims of Madoff’s fraud. Madoff pleaded guilty to
masterminding the biggest Ponzi scheme in history and is serving
a 150-year sentence in a federal prison in North Carolina.  The case is Picard v. Safra National Bank of New York, 11-
01885,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
