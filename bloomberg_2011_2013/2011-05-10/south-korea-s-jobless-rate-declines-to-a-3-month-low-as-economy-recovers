South  Korea ’s  unemployment rate  fell
to a three-month low as an economic recovery spurred hiring at
manufacturers and health and social welfare service providers.  The jobless rate fell to 3.6 percent in April from
4 percent in March, Statistics Korea said today in Gwacheon,
south of Seoul. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
of 12 economists was for a rate of 3.8 percent.  An improving job market, combined with higher energy and
food costs that are fueling inflation at home, may compel the
 Bank of Korea  to raise its benchmark interest rate to 3.25
percent when it meets on May 13, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The central bank has already raised
rates twice this year to tame consumer-price growth running at
close to a 29-month high.  “The economy remains pretty strong and inflation has
stayed above the central bank’s target,” Yoon Yeo Sam, a fixed-
income analyst at Daewoo Securities Co. in  Seoul , said before
the release. “The central bank may increase the interest rate
again as early as this week.”  The won rose 0.1 percent to 1,082.38 against dollar at the
3 p.m. close in Seoul on May 9, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has risen 3.9 percent so far this year,
more than most Asian currencies. The benchmark Kospi stock index
dropped 0.4 percent. The financial markets were closed yesterday
for a national holiday.  Bank of Korea  The BOK kept borrowing costs at 3 percent on April 12 after
raising them in January and March, with inflation breaching its
4 percent ceiling in each of last four months. It will raise the
seven-day repurchase rate to 3.25 percent on May 13, 12 of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict.  Central Bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said the bank will
normalize  interest rates  neither too slowly nor too fast. The
bank projects economic growth of 4.5 percent this year, slowing
from a 6.2 percent pace in 2010, and forecasts inflation will
accelerate to 3.9 percent from 2.9 percent.  “Price stability and economic equity will top the
political and policy agenda” until the presidential election
late next year, Kwon Young Sun, a Hong Kong-based economist at
Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note on May 9. Kwon expects the
central bank to raise the interest rate in May and July to 3.5
percent.  The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate was 3.7 percent in
April, compared with 4.3 percent in March, today’s report showed.
The number of employed people increased by 379,000 to 24.3
million last month from a year earlier.  Employment in manufacturing climbed 2.9 percent from a year
earlier, while the number of people self-employed or working in
the public-service sector rose 2.7 percent.  The number employed in construction fell 3.2 percent, while
jobs in the agricultural, fishery and forestry industries
increased 0.8 percent.  The  finance ministry  projected in December that the annual
average unemployment rate will probably fall to 3.5 percent in
2011 from 3.7 percent last year, as the nation adds 280,000 jobs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
