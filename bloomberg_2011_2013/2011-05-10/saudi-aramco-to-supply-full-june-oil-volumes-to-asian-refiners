Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply
full contracted volumes of crude to Asian refiners in June,
according to refinery officials.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of cargoes sold under long-term contracts for a 19th
month, according to refiners in  Thailand , Malaysia,  China  and
 Japan  who requested anonymity, citing confidentiality agreements
with the Middle East’s biggest producer.  Saudi Aramco’s full export allocation comes before a June 8
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in
Vienna. The group, which produces about 40 percent of the
world’s crude, decided on Dec. 11 to leave output quotas
unchanged for the seventh time since 2008.  OPEC exceeded its targets by 975,000 barrels a day in
April, according to a Bloomberg survey of producers, analysts
and oil companies who follow the group’s output. That was
because the rebellion in Libya shut more than two-thirds of the
country’s production. Last month’s output surpassed targets by
1.09 million barrels.  Saudi Arabia  raised its production last month by 50,000
barrels a day to 8.5 million, the survey showed. That was about
499,000 barrels more than its target of 8.051 million. The March
figure was revised lower to 8.5 million from 9 million.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., the state-run producer in the
United Arab Emirates capital, plans to cut supplies of all four
of its export grades by 5 percent for June, the company said on
April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
