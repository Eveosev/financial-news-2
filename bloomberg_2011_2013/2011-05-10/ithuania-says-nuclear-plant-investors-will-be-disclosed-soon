Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said the government is having “successful” talks with
potential investors to build a nuclear power plant in the Baltic
state.  The names of the companies interested in the nuclear
project will be disclosed “soon”, Kubilius said in a radio
interview with  Lietuvos Radijas  today. The prime minister said
he expects construction to begin in 2014.  Lithuania, which is building the plant along with
neighbours Latvia, Estonia and  Poland , wants to replace the
Soviet-built Ignalina facility, shut at the end of 2009 to
comply with European Union commitments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
