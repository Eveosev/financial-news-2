U.S. gasoline futures advanced,
extending the biggest one-day gain in more than two months, amid
concern that the flooding of the  Mississippi River  will disrupt
fuel production and distribution.  Futures rose as much as 3.1 percent as the flooding
threatens refineries and shipping. A total of 11 plants,
accounting for 13 percent of U.S. fuel output, are located
between  New Orleans  and Baton Rouge, according to Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  “Concern about refineries must be the driving force in the
gasoline market at the moment,”  David Wech , head of research at
JBC Energy GmbH, said by phone from Vienna, where the consultant
is based.  Gasoline for next-month delivery added 5.92 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $3.3376 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
as of 8:16 a.m. local time. Futures closed up 6.1 percent
yesterday, the biggest daily rise since March 1.  A fire at Chevron Corp.’s Pascagoula refinery in
 Mississippi  is also supporting prices, JBC Energy said in an
report earlier today. The fire was extinguished yesterday,
Chevron said, declining to say whether the crude unit, a main
processing unit, was shut.  The European front-month gasoline crack, or premium to
Brent crude, advanced to $15.87 a barrel, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd. data on Bloomberg. That’s the most since
September 2008. The U.S. is an export market for European fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
