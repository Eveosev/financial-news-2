Iran ’s first nuclear power plant
hasn’t started operations and final tests are under way at the
site in southern Iran,  Shargh  reported, citing Gholamali
Miglinejad, a member of the parliament’s energy committee.  Fuel rods were unloaded from the reactor core and washed
and are being reloaded, the Tehran-based newspaper said.  Miglinejad’s comments comes after the state-run Fars news
agency reported yesterday that the Russian-built plant in the
city of Bushehr began operating after experts finished loading
fuel into the core of the reactor.  Tests have been carried out and the power plant will start
generating electricity in two months, Fars said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
