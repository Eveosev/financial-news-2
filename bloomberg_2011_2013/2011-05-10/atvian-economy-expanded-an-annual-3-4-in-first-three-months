Latvia’s economic growth unexpectedly
slowed to an annual 3.4 percent in the first three months of the
year, the  statistics office  said today in a preliminary
estimate.  The result compares with the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 8 economists for an expansion of 4.1 percent. The
economy grew 0.2 percent from the previous three months on a
seasonally adjusted basis.  Latvia’s economy began a recovery in the second half of
last year after suffering through  Europe ’s worst collapse during
the global financial crisis. The Baltic nation plans to sell
international bonds this year and forgo further installments of
its 7.5 billion-euro ($10.8 billion) loan from a group led by
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  Industrial production expanded an annual 9 percent in the
first quarter and exports increased an annual 35.5 percent in
February to 420.5 million lati ($851.4 million), the office
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
