Japan ’s bonds advanced, sending 20-
year yields to the lowest level in four months, after a
government report showed a leading index of the nation’s
economic health fell in March.  The composite of 12 indicators including inventories and
machine orders slid to 99.5, the lowest since November, the
Cabinet Office data showed today. The Ministry of Finance will
sell 2.2 trillion yen ($27 billion) of 10-year debt tomorrow.  “We can see few reasons to sell bonds,” said RuiXue Xu, a
strategist in  Tokyo  at RBS Securities Japan Ltd., a unit of
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and one of the 24 primary dealers
obliged to bid at government debt sales. “There’s concern about
an economic slowdown.”  Twenty-year yields fell 2.5 basis points to 1.91 percent,
the lowest since Jan. 5, at 3:30 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
Thirty-year yields slipped two basis points to 2.025 percent.
Ten-year yields retreated 1.5 basis points to 1.125 percent.  Bond futures for June delivery added 0.04 to 140.70 at the
3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock
Average rose 0.5 percent.  The previous sale of 10-year bonds on April 5 attracted
bids for 3.97 times the amount on offer, compared with an
average of 3.18 for the past 10 auctions. The debt carried a
coupon of 1.3 percent.  Ten-year yields may decline toward 1 percent next month
after breaking below its 200-day moving average of 1.126 percent,
Mizuho Investors Securities Co. said, citing trading patterns.  “The yield’s next target is 1.11 percent reached at the
end of December,” said  Akihiko Inoue , chief strategist at
Mizuho. If the yield falls below that level, “it may approach 1
percent in early June,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
