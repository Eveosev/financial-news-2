Brazilian real-estate developer
 Multiplan Empreendimentos Imobiliarios SA (MULT3)  headed to its biggest
advance in almost five months after posting better-than-forecast
first-quarter earnings.  Multiplan,  Brazil ’s second-biggest mall operator by market
value, jumped 3.8 percent to 34.49 reais at 2:30 p.m. New York
time, after earlier rising 4.9 percent, the most on a closing
basis since Dec. 21. The Bovespa index gained 0.1 percent to
64,680.27.  “Multiplan shares offer a short-term buy opportunity,
given better-than-expected first-quarter results” and a “more
benign outlook for pre-operational expenses for 2011,” wrote
Fanny Oreng and Carlos Peyrelongue, analysts at Bank of America
Corp., in a note to clients.  The company reported first-quarter net income of 64 million
reais ($40 million), a 34 percent increase from a year before,
according to a regulatory filing. Bank of America and Bradesco
Corretora had forecast net income of 61 million reais and 58
million reais, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
