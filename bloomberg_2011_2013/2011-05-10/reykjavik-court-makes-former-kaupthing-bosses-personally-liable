Reykjavik’s District Court has ruled
that two former executives at failed Kaupthing Bank hf should be
held personally liable for loans made to them by the lender.  Helgi Thor Bergs, the former head of Kaupthing’s investment
arm, is personally liable for a 642 million-krona ($5.6 million)
loan the bank gave him to purchase its shares, according to a
 ruling  yesterday. The court also said that Thordur Palsson, the
former director of Kaupthing’s business development unit, must
repay 10 percent of a 273 million-krona loan granted while he
worked at the bank.  Kaupthing’s board in a letter dated Sept. 28, 2008, had
sought to revoke personal guarantees on loans given to a number
of executives in connection with purchasing stock in the bank.
The decision was taken following a drop in the lender’s share
price. Kaupthing collapsed on Oct. 9, 2008, after it was unable
to secure the short-term funding needed to stay afloat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
