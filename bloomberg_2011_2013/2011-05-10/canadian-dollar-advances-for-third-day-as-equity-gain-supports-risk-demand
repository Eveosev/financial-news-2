Canada ’s dollar rose for a third
consecutive day against its U.S. counterpart as crude oil
advanced after dropping last week the most since December 2008.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is also known for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, climbed against the
yen and Swiss franc as a rally in commodities and U.S. stocks
encouraged demand for higher-yielding assets.  “One needs only look at commodities for the suggestion
Canada’s dollar is rising today,”  Jack Spitz , managing director
of foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada , said by phone
from Toronto. “Energy, metals, agricultural products, they’re
all rising and taking commodity currencies along for the ride.”  The loonie advanced 0.5 percent to 95.68 cents versus the
greenback at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 96.18 cents yesterday. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0452. The loonie touched 94.46 cents on
April 29, the strongest level since November 2007. The Canadian
dollar advanced 1.2 percent to 84.53 yen and gained 1.5 percent
to 91.94 centimes against the Swiss franc.  Crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, climbed to a four-day
high as concern increased that flooding of the  Mississippi River 
will disrupt refineries. Crude for June delivery increased 0.8
percent to $103.41 a barrel.  “Markets are watching closely what’s transpiring with oil
for the Canadian dollar,” said  Camilla Sutton , chief currency
strategist at the capital markets unit of Bank of Nova Scotia in
Toronto.  Gain in Gold  Gold futures rose 0.2 percent to $1,516.28 an ounce. Wheat
futures climbed 1 percent to settle at $7.9875 a bushel after
touching $8.165, the highest level since May 2. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.8 percent.  Canadian  government bonds  fell today, pushing the 10-year
yield up five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.23
percent. The price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in June
2021 declined 42 cents to C$100.16.  Yields on 10-year U.S. and Canadian government securities
are converging for the first time since December in a sign
investors expect the selloff in global commodities will keep the
 Bank of Canada  on hold longer.  Treasury notes maturing in 2021 yield 3.21 percent, five
basis points less than the equivalent-maturity Canadian debt.
They yielded 25 basis points more than Canadian securities as
recently as Feb. 8.  One-month bankers’ acceptances, a measure of interest-rate
expectations, were at the lowest level in almost two months.  Interest-Rate View  The June 2011 bankers’ acceptances contract yielded 1.33
percent, compared with 1.35 percent a week ago. So-called Bax
contracts average about 18 basis points above the central bank’s
overnight target, Bloomberg data since 1992 show.  Economists expect the central bank’s target rate for
overnight lending between banks to rise to 1.50 percent from 1
percent by the end of the third quarter, according to the median
forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey, compared
with an outlook for a 1.75 percent rate in March.  Canadian bonds have rallied less than  U.S. debt  after crude
oil tumbled last week, meaning inflation may be less of a
concern for the Bank of Canada. Policy makers next meet May 31
to determine  interest rates .  To contact the reporter for this story:
