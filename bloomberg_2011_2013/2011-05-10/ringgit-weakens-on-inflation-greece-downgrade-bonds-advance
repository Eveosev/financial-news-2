Malaysia ’s ringgit weakened after the
government raised sugar prices, adding to concern accelerating
inflation will slow spending and curb economic growth.  Sugar prices were increased today for a fourth time since
January 2010 to trim annual subsidies, the Star newspaper
reported. The currency dropped 1.4 percent last week as Standard
& Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating and  China  sought to rebuff
U.S. pressure for faster yuan appreciation. Malaysian bonds
advanced before an auction.  “The market is worried that slowing spending will hurt
growth, given the fact that the economy is relying more on
domestic consumption and less on exports,” said Godwin Chan, a
foreign-exchange trader at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala
Lumpur . “External factors like the lingering Greece crisis
could inflict more pain” to risky asset markets, he said.  The ringgit fell 0.2 percent to 2.9930 per dollar as of
4:25 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has declined 1.1 percent since reaching
2.9598 on May 2, the strongest level since September 1997.  Consumer prices in Malaysia rose 3 percent in March from a
year earlier, the most since April 2009. Bank Negara Malaysia
raised its overnight policy rate to 3 percent from 2.75 percent
on May 5, saying prices will face upward pressure in the second
half.  China’s exchange-rate reform has been “robust” from the
perspective of trade, Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said at an
annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue in  Washington  yesterday,
referring to declines in China’s total trade surplus over the
last three years and signaling a view that the yuan’s rise
shouldn’t proceed any faster.  The yield on Malaysia’s 4.012 percent bond due September
2017 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.72
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price increased 0.05,
or 50 sen per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 101.65.  Malaysia’s government will sell an additional 3.5 billion
ringgit ($1.2 billion) of the 2017 notes on May 12, the first of
two bond sales scheduled for this month. The notes yielded 3.71
percent in pre-auction trading, according to Amanah Butler Sdn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
