Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Chief Executive
Officer  Howard Schultz  told Sky News in an interview the coffee-
shop operator is experiencing “significant growth and
development” in the U.K., in spite of the economy both in
Britain and the U.S. being still “fairly fragile.”  While cost-cutting and the closure of under-performing
stores resulted in last year being the “best performing year”
in Starbucks’ history, you can’t “cut your way to prosperity,”
Schultz said to Sky. “You have to create growth and
opportunity,” he said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
