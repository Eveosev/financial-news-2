NetSuite Inc. (N) , a provider of online
accounting programs, demonstrated new Twitter Inc.-inspired
software today that brings the company into closer competition
with  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)   The software, called SuiteSocial, helps NetSuite users more
easily discuss business matters such as orders and invoices,
Chief Executive Officer Zach Nelson said. NetSuite developed the
product, unveiled today at the company’s  SuiteWorld conference 
in  San Francisco , with the startup Yammer Inc.  “This makes it simple for you to consume information,”
Nelson said in a televised interview on “Bloomberg West.”
“There’s lots of activity that happens in a NetSuite record,”
he said. “It would be nice, if you were interested in that, to
follow that record like you would follow a human in Twitter.”  Nelson aims to capitalize on growth in demand for online
tools that mirror Facebook Inc., Twitter and other social
networks to help employees interact. SuiteSocial, due to be
released about midyear, helps  San Mateo , California-based
NetSuite compete with Salesforce.com, which offers a social-
networking feature called Chatter as part of its online
customer-management software.  Groupon Accord  NetSuite also has signed a deal to supply its software to
Groupon Inc., the top provider of online daily discounts.
Groupon is running NetSuite’s OneWorld financial management
software in five countries and plans to use it to manage
operations in 26 within three months, Nelson said in a separate
interview before his TV appearance.  NetSuite rose $1.71, or 5.1 percent, to $35.21 today in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have more than
doubled in the past year.  Salesforce has said 80,000 companies use its Chatter
social-networking program. The company announced plans on March
30 to pay about $340 million for Radian6 Technologies Inc.,
whose software lets companies keep abreast of discussions on the
social Web.  NetSuite also is forging closer ties to  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , whose
CEO,  Larry Ellison , owns the majority of its shares. NetSuite
has purchased one of Oracle’s Exadata computer servers, which
will let it run the Oracle databases that underpin its online
software faster and more efficiently, Nelson said. Oracle Co-
President  Mark Hurd  spoke at NetSuite’s conference today.  “Anything that allows us to run Oracle faster reduces our
cost,” Nelson said.  Editors: Tom Giles, Stephen West  To contact the reporters on this story:
