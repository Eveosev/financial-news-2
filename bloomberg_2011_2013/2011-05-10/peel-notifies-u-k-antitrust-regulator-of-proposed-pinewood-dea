Peel Acquisitions Ltd. formally
notified Britain’s antitrust regulator of its plan to acquire
U.K. film-studio company  Pinewood Shepperton Plc (PWS) , the Office of
Fair Trading said today in a statement.  The competition watchdog will decide by June 7 whether to
investigate the deal following the voluntary notification,
according to the statement. Pinewood, where  James Bond  and
Harry Potter films were made, was valued at 96.1 million pounds
($157 million) in Peel’s latest bid, the companies said in a
 statement  last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
