The U.S.  Postal Service , which says
it will be insolvent by September without congressional
permission to delay a required payment, reported a widening
second-quarter loss as first-class mail volume declined.  The loss expanded to $2.6 billion in the three months ended
March 31 from $1.9 billion a year earlier, Louis Giuliano, the
chairman of the Postal Service’s board, said today at a meeting
in Washington. Revenue declined 2.8 percent to $34.1 billion.
First-class mail volume fell 7.6 percent.  The Postal Service, which reported a loss of $8.5 billion
in its 2010 fiscal year, is seeking to cut expenses by
eliminating Saturday mail delivery and restructuring labor
contracts. It’s also urging Congress to change laws requiring it
to pay now for health-care benefit costs of future retirees,
saying that it will otherwise run out of cash.  “Absent changes in the laws, the Postal Service will be
forced to default on some of its obligations to the federal
government,” Giuliano told the agency’s board. “The Postal
Service is facing challenges it has never faced before, and, as
a result, every aspect of Postal operations will need to
anticipate and accommodate changes.”  The agency would default on payments due the federal
government and would continue to pay employees and vendors,
James Miller, a board member, said at the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
