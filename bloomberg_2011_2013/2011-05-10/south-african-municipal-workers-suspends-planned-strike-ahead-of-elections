South African Municipal Workers Union
said it suspended plans for a national strike on May 13 over
demands for a pay increase.  The decision follows a commitment by the ruling  African
National Congress  that its demands will be looked into, the
Johannesburg-based union said in an e-mailed statement today.
 South Africa  will hold local government elections on May 18.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
