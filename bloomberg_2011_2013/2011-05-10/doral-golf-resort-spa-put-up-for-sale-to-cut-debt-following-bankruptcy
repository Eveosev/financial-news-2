The Doral Golf Resort & Spa in Miami
is being put up for sale after filing for bankruptcy this year
with other resorts.  The owner of the resorts decided to pursue a sale of the
Doral to reduce debt and help the business complete its
restructuring, according to a filing yesterday with the  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  A group of investors including hedge fund Paulson & Co.
took control of eight resort properties through foreclosure this
year. Five of the properties, including the Doral and the Grand
Wailea resort in Hawaii, then filed for bankruptcy.  The Doral sale could take a few months to complete,
according to the filing. The owners will seek to hold on to one
of five golf courses at the Doral, the White Course, according
to the filing.  Doral has hosted a U.S. PGA Tour event on its Dick Wilson-
designed Blue Monster course every year since 1962. The course
was redesigned in 1996 by Raymond Floyd and became the permanent
home to a World Golf Championship event in 2007.  In March,  Nick Watney  captured the WGC-Cadillac
Championship at the course, defeating  Dustin Johnson  by two
shots.  Tiger Woods , the winner of 14 major tournaments, has won
three times at Doral, including a head-to-head final round
battle with Phil Mickelson in 2005.  The case is In re MSR Resort Golf Course LLC, 11-10372,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
