Gleacher Shacklock LLP,  a privately
owned U.K. investment-banking firm, said it hired Daniel Morland
to head its new debt advisory group.  Morland, mostly recently a London-based managing director
at DC Advisory Partners, will look to build up his team with
several external hires, he said today by phone.  Gleacher Shacklockâ€™s new group provides services to
corporate and private equity clients on the structuring of
senior, high-yield and mezzanine products, ratings strategy,
private placement, and bank debt-covenant resets, the London-
based firm said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
