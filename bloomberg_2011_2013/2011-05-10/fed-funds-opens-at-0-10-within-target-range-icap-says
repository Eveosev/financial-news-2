Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.10 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.09 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.09 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.09 percent.  The central bank will acquire Treasury notes due from May
2015 to October 2016 today as part of its plan to purchase
$600 billion more Treasuries through June and reinvest its
maturing mortgage holdings. The Fed expects to reinvest
$250 billion to $300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed
debt and agency securities into Treasuries during that time.  The central bank plans to purchase $5 billion to
$7 billion securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
