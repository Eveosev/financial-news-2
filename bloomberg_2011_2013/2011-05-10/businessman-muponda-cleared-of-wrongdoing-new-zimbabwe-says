Gilbert Muponda, an exiled Zimbabwean
businessman, is free to return to  Zimbabwe  after being cleared
of breaking any laws by the country’s two home affairs
ministers,  New Zimbabwe  said, citing a government notice issued
by co-ministers Theresa Makone and Kembo Mohadi.  Muponda, who owns ENG Capital, a banking company, was
arrested by Zimbabwean police in 2003 before being specified the
following year, the Bromsgrove, U.K.-based news agency said on
its website. Under Zimbabwean law, specification places a
business or an individual’s assets under state administration.
ENG Capital has cleared all its debts in the southern African
nation, New Zimbabwe added.  Muponda has been in self-imposed exile in  Canada  since
2004, News Zimbabwe said. ENG Capital-controlled Zimbabwe’s CFX
Bank until Muponda was specified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
