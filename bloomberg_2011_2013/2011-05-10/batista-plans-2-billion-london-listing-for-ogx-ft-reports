Eike Batista , Brazil’s richest man,
said he plans to list in London about $2 billion of shares in
OGX Petroleo e Natural Gas Participacoes SA, his flagship oil
production and exploration company, the Financial Times
reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Batista said he wants
to add a London listing of OGX, which is already traded in Sao
Paulo, because London is “the Mecca for resources companies in
the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
