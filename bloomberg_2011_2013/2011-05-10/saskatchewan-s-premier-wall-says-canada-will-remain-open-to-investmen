Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said
 Canada ’s rejection of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s bid of Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan was a “rare” exception and wasn’t
“unreasonable.”  Wall, in comments at a Bloomberg Canada Economic Summit in
Toronto, said he can’t understand why Canadians are “beating
ourselves up” over the decision to reject the bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
