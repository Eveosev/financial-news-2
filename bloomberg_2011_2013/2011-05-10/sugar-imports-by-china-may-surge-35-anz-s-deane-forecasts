Sugar imports by  China , the world’s
second-biggest consumer after India, may jump 35 percent as
output trails demand, helping push global prices higher,
according to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  Purchases may rise to 2.7 million metric tons in the year
beginning Oct. 1, from about 2 million tons a year earlier, Paul
Deane, a senior agricultural economist, said in a phone
interview. The nation may produce 12.5 million tons in the year
from Oct. 1, while demand may be 15 million tons, Deane said.  “All the evidence points to the fact that there is no
stock of sugar left in China,” Deane, who has been an
agricultural economist for a decade, said yesterday, citing
domestic prices and sugar sales from state reserves.  Buyers in China may take advantage of a slump in prices
that has seen sugar plunge about 42 percent since reaching a
three-decade high on Feb. 2. Raw sugar for July delivery gained
2.4 percent to 20.96 cents a pound in  New York  yesterday.  Futures may average as much as 26 cents a pound in the
first quarter of 2012, or 24 percent higher than yesterday’s
closing price, as supply from Brazil and Thailand dwindles,
Deane said. Sugar may average 22 to 23 cents during the rest of
the year, he said.  Cooling Inflation  About 1.16 million tons of sugar was sold to the domestic
market from China’s state reserves between August and February
to cool prices, Deane said in a report last month.  China will be “happy” to see more imports after buying a
“substantial” amount to help curb inflation as output declines
for a third year, Liu Xiaonan, deputy head of the economy at the
National Development and Reform Commission, said April 25.  The country’s food-price inflation jumped 11.7 percent in
March, matching the rate in November, when prices advanced at
the fastest pace since 2008. Rising consumer prices have
prompted the central bank to raise lending and deposit rates
four times since mid-October.  The government sold 150,000 tons of sugar from reserves on
Feb. 28 at an average 7,424 yuan ($1,143) a ton, the industry
website gsmn.com.cn said in March, citing the China Sugar
Association. That’s equal to about 52 cents a pound.  The export price from Brazil or  Thailand  must be about 25
cents a pound to make it economical for China to purchase the
sweetener even with an import tariff of 50 percent, Deane said.  If the government removed the tariff, importers may seek as
much as 6 million tons from overseas to help rebuild stockpiles,
he said.  China’s output may rise to 12 million tons from 11.3
million tons in the year ending Sept. 30, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural Service  estimated  April 15 .
Demand was estimated to drop to 13.6 million tons, from a
revised 13.9 million tons in the current season, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
