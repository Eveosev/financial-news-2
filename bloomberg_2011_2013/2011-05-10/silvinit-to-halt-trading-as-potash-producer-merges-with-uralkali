OAO Silvinit,  Russia ’s second-largest
potash producer, will stop trading tomorrow ahead of its merger
with larger competitor OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the Moscow-based Micex and
RTS stock exchanges said today in two separate statements.  Uralkali agreed to acquire Silvinit for $7.8 billion in
cash and shares last December. The combined entity will have
capacity to mine more potash than Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan,
currently the world’s biggest producer. Potash is a form of
potassium used in fertilizers.  Silvinit will cease to exist as a separate entity, the
company said in a regulatory filing. Silvinit filed an
application today to the tax authorities in Perm region, where
it’s based, to de-register ahead of the merger, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
