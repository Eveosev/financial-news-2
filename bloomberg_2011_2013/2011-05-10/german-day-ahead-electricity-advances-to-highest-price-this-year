German electricity for next-day
delivery rose a second day to its highest price this year as
production of wind in  Europe ’s biggest market was forecast to
remain below the average for the time of year.  Output from  wind turbines , a less predictable source of
energy than nuclear, coal or gas-fired generation, will decline
tomorrow to about 1,000 megawatts from about 2,000 megawatts
today, according to a Thomson Reuters Point Carbon forecast. The
average for this time of year is about 4,000 megawatts,
according to the model. Wind produced 6.8 percent of  Germany ’s
power in 2009.  Baseload power for tomorrow gained as much as 2.70 euros,
or 4.3 percent, to 65.80 euros ($94.46) a megawatt-hour today,
according to broker prices from this morning’s over-the-counter
market on Bloomberg. The last time it traded higher was on Dec.
16. The corresponding contract was priced at 65.12 euros on the
Epex Spot SE exchange in Paris. Baseload is delivered around the
clock.  The year-ahead contract in Europe’s biggest market, a
regional benchmark, climbed a second day, rising as much as 0.5
percent to 59.15 euros a megawatt-hour.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
Group Inc. (GFIG) , ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition Financial
Services and Tullet Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
