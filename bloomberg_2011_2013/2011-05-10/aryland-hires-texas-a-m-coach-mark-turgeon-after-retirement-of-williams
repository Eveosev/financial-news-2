The  University of Maryland  hired
 Texas A&M  basketball coach Mark Turgeon to succeed Gary Williams, who retired last week after a 22-year tenure that
included the program’s only national championship.  Turgeon, 46, spent the past four seasons at Texas A&M,
compiling a 97-40 record and making four trips to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. The Aggies never got
past the second round.  Turgeon, a former point guard at the University of  Kansas ,
takes over a Maryland team that went 19-14 last season and
failed to make the NCAA tournament. The Terrapins had made 14
NCAA appearances in the previous 17 seasons under Williams and
won the national title in 2002.  “It was just too good an offer for me to pass on,”
Turgeon said, according to a transcript of comments posted on
Texas A&M’s  athletic website . “I just felt like  Maryland  was a
great opportunity for me and my family.”  Turgeon, the Big 12 Conference’s Coach of the Year in 2010
and 2011, has a 250-159 coaching record over 13 seasons at Texas
A&M, Wichita State and Jacksonville State. He started his
coaching career as an assistant at Kansas, where he won an NCAA
championship on Larry Brown’s staff in 1988.  “In Mark, we have brought one of the outstanding young
coaches in the country, and one who has a proven record of
achievement on and off the court,” Maryland Athletics Director
Kevin Anderson said. “We couldn’t be more excited.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
