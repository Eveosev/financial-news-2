Novacaixagalicia may accept bids from
investors valuing the Spanish savings group for at least 50
percent of its book value,  Expansion  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The lender expects to cover about 20 percent of its 2.62
billion euros ($3.74 billion) capital shortfall by selling
stakes to institutional investors, Expansion said.  About 10 potential investors would comply with the
valuation threshold, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
