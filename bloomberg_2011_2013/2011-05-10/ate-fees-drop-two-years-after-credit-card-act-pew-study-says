Two years after credit-card
legislation was signed, late payment fees have declined and
interest rates have stabilized, the Pew Charitable Trusts said.  Charges for late payments on U.S. bank-issued credit cards
decreased to a range of $25 to $35 from a median of $39,
according to the report released today by the Philadelphia-based
nonprofit. The study looked at about 300 consumer credit cards
offered online by the 12 largest banks and credit unions, and
compared terms for cards offered in March 2010 and January 2011.
Late fees were as common as they were in 2010, the study said.  The  Federal Reserve  approved rules that took effect in
August prohibiting card issuers in most cases from charging
first-time offenders more than $25 for paying their bills late.
The Fed set a maximum fee of $35 for  additional  late payments
within six months of the first delayed payment.  “Pew’s research shows that predictions that the
legislation would spark new charges and long-term interest rate
growth have not materialized,” Nick Bourke, director of Pew’s
Safe Credit Cards Project, which began studying how the industry
treats consumers in 2007, said in a statement.  The median highest advertised interest rate for credit
cards issued by banks was unchanged at 20.99 percent and the
lowest also stayed the same at 12.99 percent, the report said.
The average rate on existing credit-card balances fell to 13.44
percent in February from 14.67 percent a year earlier, Federal
Reserve  data  show.  Annual Fees  Annual fees stayed at a median of $59 for bank-issued
cards, the Pew study said. The percentage of bank credit cards
with annual fees increased to 21 percent from 14 percent.  U.S. revolving debt, which includes credit cards, increased
$1.9 billion in March, the second gain in four months, the Fed
said May 6.  President  Barack Obama  signed the Credit Card
Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act on May 22,
2009, calling the rules limiting fees and abrupt contract rate
changes “common sense reforms, designed to protect consumers.”
The provisions were phased in, with most taking effect Feb. 22,
2010, including prohibitions on interest-rate increases in most
cases during the first year an account is opened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
