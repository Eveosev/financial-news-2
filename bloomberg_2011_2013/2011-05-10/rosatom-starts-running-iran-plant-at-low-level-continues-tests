Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear reactor has
been started at the minimum controllable level, which will be
followed by more tests before full operation begins, said ZAO
Atomstroyexport, the atomic power plant building unit of
 Russia ’s Rosatom Corp. holding.  Iran’s first nuclear power plant, being built by the
Russian company in the southern city of Bushehr, initiated the
fission process, or criticality, which allows the atoms to split
by themselves in a reaction without interference from operators,
Atomstroyexport said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Russian builder plans to further test the reactor to
ensure its safety, including educating personnel to operate the
power unit, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
