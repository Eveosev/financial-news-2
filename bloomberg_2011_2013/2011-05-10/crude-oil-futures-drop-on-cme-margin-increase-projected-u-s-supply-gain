Crude oil rose to a four-day high as
concern increased that flooding of the  Mississippi River  will
disrupt fuel output and as equities climbed.  Futures advanced 1.3 percent as the flood moved south from
 Memphis , threatening refineries and shipping traffic before
emptying into the  Gulf of Mexico  in about two weeks. Stocks
strengthened as companies raised earnings forecasts, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up for a third day.  “The flood is impacting supply and will continue to put
upward pressure on prices,” said Phil Flynn, vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Crude oil for June delivery rose $1.33 to $103.88 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since May 4. The contract is up 35 percent from a year ago.  Futures climbed 5.5 percent to $102.55 yesterday, the
biggest gain since Feb. 22. Last week oil dropped the most since
December 2008.  Prices retreated from the settlement after the  American
Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles increased 2.95 million barrels to 367.2 million last
week, the highest level since Oct. 29. Oil for June delivery was
up 98 cents, or 1 percent, to $103.53 a barrel in electronic
trading at 4:32 p.m.  Prices slipped as much as 2.4 percent earlier when the CME
Group Inc. increased the amount of money traders must hold as
collateral for crude, gasoline and heating oil transactions. CME
Group, the Nymex owner, increased margins for crude trading to
$8,438 per contract from $6,750, effective after the close of
business today.  ‘The New $80’  “The market shook off the margin rate hikes and once again
is concentrating on the economic recovery,” said Carl Larry,
director of energy derivatives and research at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in New York. “People are thinking that $100 is
the new $80 and a bottom.”  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  futures advanced 1 percent to 1,359.26, and
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 95.51 points to
12,780.19 at 3:28 p.m.  Oil also climbed as the dollar dropped against the euro,
bolstering the appeal of commodities priced in the U.S.
currency. The dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.4401 per euro.  Gasoline futures climbed 3.1 percent as the rising waters
threaten refineries and shipping. A total of 11 plants,
accounting for 13 percent of U.S. fuel output, are located
between  New Orleans  and Baton Rouge, according to Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Valero Refinery  Valero Energy Corp. was forced to reduce operations at its
refinery in Memphis to between 80 percent and 85 percent of
capacity because of flooding, according to people familiar with
refinery operations. The plant has a capacity of 195,000 barrels
a day.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 10.13 cents to $3.3797 a
gallon in  New York , the highest settlement since April 29.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, dropped
0.9 cent to $3.951 a gallon yesterday, the fifth-straight
decline, AAA said on its  website . The price climbed to $3.985 on
May 4, the highest since July 24, 2008.  “Gasoline is up because of the potential for the
Mississippi to flood refineries,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “This reminds me of when prices rise ahead of a
hurricane because of the potential for damage. Prices often sell
off strongly after the storm passes with minimal damage.”  An Energy Department report will show that U.S. crude
stockpiles increased 1.5 million barrels from 366.5 million in
the week ended May 6, according to the median of 16 estimates
from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. That would leave
supplies within 1 percent of a two-year high.  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Chinese Imports  China ’s net crude imports rose 3 percent in April from a
month earlier as refineries increased fuel production to supply
to factories in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Net imports advanced to 21.25 million metric tons, or 5.2
million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg calculations based
on  data posted  today on the website of the Beijing-based General
Administration of Customs. Net inbound shipments gained 1.3
percent from a year earlier.  The U.S. and China are the world’s two biggest oil-
consuming countries, responsible for 32 percent of global demand
in 2009, according to BP Plc, which publishes its Statistical
Review of World Energy each June.  Brent crude  for June settlement rose $1.73, or 1.5 percent,
to end the session at $117.63 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Strikes on Tripoli  Oil has climbed 14 percent in New York this year as unrest
toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and spread to  Libya ,
Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Oman, Syria and Yemen. North Atlantic
Treaty Organization jets intensified strikes overnight on the
Libyan capital of Tripoli, including what the alliance
identified as “command-and-control” bunkers from which  Muammar Qaddafi  is carrying out a campaign against rebels.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 717,286
contracts as of 4:27 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 909,483
yesterday, 24 percent above the average of the past three
months. Open interest rose to a record 1.66 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
