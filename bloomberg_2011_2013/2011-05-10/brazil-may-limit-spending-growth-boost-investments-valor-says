Brazil   plans to slow current
expenditures while increasing investments in coming years,
Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin said, according to Valor
Economico newspaper.  The Treasury will also try to ensure that current
administrative expenditures, such as airplane tickets, office
supplies and refurbishments, grow at a slower rate than the
economy, while investments may outpace gross domestic product,
Augustin was quoted as saying.  The government doesn’t plan to deliver a primary  budget
surplus  above the target this year, Augustin said, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper reported. Brazil will not include special
investments as part of the primary surplus this year, he said,
according to the newspaper.  Brazil targets a 117.9 billion reais ($73.3 billion)
primary budget surplus this year, the central bank said in its
quarterly inflation report published March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:’
