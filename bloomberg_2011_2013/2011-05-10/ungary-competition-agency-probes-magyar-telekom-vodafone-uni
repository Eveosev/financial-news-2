Hungary’s competition regulator is
investigating Magyar Telekom Nyrt. and Vodafone Plc’s local unit
over potentially misleading commercials.  The two companies ran advertising campaigns at the end of
2010 and the beginning of this year claiming their mobile
Internet networks and services were the fastest available.  The commercials may have misled customers because the
claims can “probably not be justified satisfactorily,” the
authority said in an e-mailed statement today.  Magyar Telekom, majority-owned by  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said
its claim to the fastest service was based on data submitted by
companies to the  National Media and Infocommunications
Authority .  “That is the only source of data in the country on
broadband mobile networks which is based on a single measurement
methodology accepted by all mobile providers,” Magyar Telekom
said in an e-mailed statement.  Officials at Vodafone’s Hungarian unit didn’t immediately
answer a phone call from Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
