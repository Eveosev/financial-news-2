Benchmark European coal derivatives
fell, extending last week’s slump, on speculation prices will
decline further as demand weakens and competition from natural
gas increases.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year dropped 35 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$129.15 a metric ton by 11:41 a.m. in  London . The solid fuel
slid 3.6 percent last week. The price of gas delivered to the
U.K. in the third quarter has fallen 10 percent since March 16,
when it reached the highest level since November 2008.  “European coal prices are likely to be pressured by the
upcoming drop in seasonal demand and by competition from weak
gas prices,” Raymond Chan, an analyst with Standard Chartered
Plc in  Singapore , said in a report today. “We continue to favor
Pacific coal benchmarks over European coal as looming power
shortages in  Asia  should lead to further utilities buying.”  Power shortages in  China , which relies on coal for more
than 70 percent of its electricity, may escalate this summer as
fuel costs rise and the government caps utility prices, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said May 4. About 20 regions have started
rationing power, Xinhua News Agency reported last week. China
has the world’s biggest population.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
