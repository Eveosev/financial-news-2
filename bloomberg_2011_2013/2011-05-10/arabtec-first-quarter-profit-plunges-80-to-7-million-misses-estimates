Arabtec Holding PJSC said first-
quarter profit dropped 80 percent, missing analyst estimates, as
projects stalled for the United Arab Emirates’ biggest builder
and clients failed to pay bills.  Net income fell to 26.6 million dirhams ($7.2 million) from
134.5 million dirhams a year earlier, the company said today in
a statement. The median estimate of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for a profit of 70 million dirhams.  U.A.E. construction companies are struggling after
developers delayed payments and halted work on hundreds of
billions of dirhams in projects. Dubai property prices slumped
62 percent since mid-2008 and state-owned Dubai World, which
helped spearhead the construction boom through its Nakheel PJSC
unit, was forced to restructure its debt.  “The company won projects, but about half of the backlog
isn’t moving because of conditions in the region,” said Roy Cherry, senior vice president of real estate research at Shuaa
Capital PSC. “Over the long run, we still believe this is one
of the best contractors in the region.”  Arabtec’s first-quarter revenue fell to 1.24 billion
dirhams from 1.55 billion dirhams a year earlier, the company
said in the statement. Earnings per share fell to 2 fils from 11
fils.  The contractor in January announced plans to raise $150
million through convertible bonds and a share sale. The company
said in March it would delay both fundraising efforts “until
the market conditions become more favorable.”  Arabtec may need to make additional provisions for unpaid
bills by developers, Chet Riley, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst
who has a “hold” recommendation on the stock, said in a note
before the results were released. About 51 percent of Arabtec’s
work is in the U.A.E. and 27 percent of that is in Dubai.  Arabtec dropped as much as 4.2 percent in Dubai trading,
the most since April 25, and was down 2.1 percent at 1.38
dirhams at 11:11 a.m. That gives the company a market value of 2
billion dirhams. The shares, which declined 32 percent in the
past 12 months, peaked at 7.88 dirhams in July 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
