Citigroup Inc. (C)  has raised a $408
million loan fund to be managed by  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , according to
a person familiar with the deal.  The $259 million slice of the collateralized loan
obligation rated AAA by Standard & Poorâ€™s has a spread of 125
basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor is a rate banks charge to lend to each other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
