The Australian dollar strengthened,
paring earlier declines, after a government report showed the
trade surplus totaled A$1.74 billion in March, wider than
economists estimates for a A$500 million gap.  The currency climbed to $1.0789 as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0766 just before the data, reducing its drop from
$1.0807 yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
