Qatar shares rose the most in more
than a month, led by  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , on speculation
index provider MSCI Inc. may upgrade the Persian Gulf nation to
emerging market.  Qatar National Bank climbed to the highest since January as
its 12.7 billion-riyal ($3.5 billion) rights offer was fully
subscribed. Doha Bank, the country’s fourth-biggest lender by
assets, advanced 3 percent. The  QE Index (DSM)  surged 1.4 percent, the
most since March 20, to 8,665.42, at the 1:15 p.m. close in
Doha. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  advanced 1.2 percent. Tamweel PJSC,
the Dubai-based home finance company plunged 10 percent on its
first trading day in more than two years.  “MSCI upgrade speculation is beginning,” said Akram Annous, Middle East and North Africa strategist at Al Mal
Capital PSC in Dubai. “There was some chatter going around
today about a possible foreign ownership free-float raise to the
30 to 49 percent range from the current 25 percent level.”  Qatar and the  United Arab Emirates  are seeking to secure an
upgrade from frontier markets status at MSCI, which will revalue
its assessment in June. Foreign ownership limits on stocks and
“efficiency” are some issues that Qatar and the U.A.E. face,
Manuel Rensink, head of Middle East and North Africa at the
index provider, said on May 3. Size and liquidity are “not a
major hurdle for the U.A.E. and Qatar,” he said.  Saudi Gains  Qatar National Bank rose 3.2 percent to 143.5 riyals, the
highest since Jan. 31. Doha Bank increased to 54.2 riyals, the
highest since April 12.  Tamweel tumbled to 89.1 fils. The shares had been halted
since November 2008 pending the company’s reorganization. They
closed at 99 fils when they last traded on Nov. 20, 2008.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  and the  Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  advanced 0.4 percent in Riyadh. Kuwait’s SE Price
Index gained 0.2 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  lost 0.5 percent,
while  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  and Bahrain’s measure
