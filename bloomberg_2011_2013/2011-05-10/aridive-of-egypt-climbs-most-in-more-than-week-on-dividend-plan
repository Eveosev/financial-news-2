Maridive & Oil Services SAE (MOIL)  rose the

it plans to pay a cash dividend of 6 cents a share.  The shares surged 2.9 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since May 2, to $3.5 at 11:36 a.m. in Cairo. The benchmark  EGX
30 Index (EGX30)  advanced less than 0.1 percent.  The Cairo-based company will pay 3 cents on May 31 and the
rest on Sept. 29, it said in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
