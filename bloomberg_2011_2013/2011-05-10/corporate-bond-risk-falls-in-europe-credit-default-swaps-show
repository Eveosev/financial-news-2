The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate bonds fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 8 basis
points to 353, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 10:30 a.m.
in  London . The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps
on 15 governments fell 4.5 basis points to 191 basis point.  Swaps on  Greece  dropped after newspaper Kathimerini
reported the  International Monetary Fund  is arranging an 80
billion-euro ($114 billion) to 100 billion-euro aid package to
replace the nation’s existing bailout program. Greek bond yields
and default swaps rose to records yesterday amid speculation
about a debt write-off or an extension of repayment timelines.  “The Greek debt challenge continues to trouble credit
markets,” Markus Ernst, a strategist at UniCredit SpA in
Munich, wrote in a note to investors. “An actual debt
restructuring of Greece could in the end trigger a domino effect
in other countries.”  The cost of insuring Greek debt fell 26.5 basis points to
1,341 basis points, according to CMA. Contracts on Ireland
declined 10 basis points to 671 while  Portugal  was 7 lower at
652. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a five-year
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings declined 2.5 basis points to 96.25,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers fell 2.75 to 135 and the subordinated index
was 9 lower at 231.  Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
