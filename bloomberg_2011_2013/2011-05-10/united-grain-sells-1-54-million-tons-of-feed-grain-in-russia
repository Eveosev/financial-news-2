United Grain Co. , the state-owned
Russian grain trader, has sold 1.54 million metric tons of feed
grain to farms and foodstuff producers in almost 50 regions
across the country so far this year.  Sales of another 114,000 tons of feed grain are planned in
the next few days in five other regions, the company said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Russia , which banned cereal exports
last year after a drought, has 83 regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
