Brazil ’s government is lobbying the
telecommunications regulatory agency to speed up approval of
more than 1,000 permits for individual companies to offer cable
TV, Internet and telephone services, Communications Minister
 Paulo Bernardo  said, according to  Folha de S.Paulo  newspaper.  Bernardo said he sent a letter to the agency, known as
Anatel, requesting they also move ahead with the auction of new
frequencies and other measures as part of a government effort to
increase broadband access in the country, the newspaper said.  Agency members may vote on new rules to create incentives
for private investments, Anatel President Ronaldo Sardenberg
said, according to Folha.  An Anatel spokesman wasn’t immediately available to comment
when called by Bloomberg News. Telephone calls to the
Communications Ministry weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
