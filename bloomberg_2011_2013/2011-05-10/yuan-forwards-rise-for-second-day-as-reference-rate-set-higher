Yuan forwards gained the most this
month as the central bank set the currency’s reference rate at
the strongest level since 2005.  The contracts rose for a second day as the People’s Bank of
 China  set the rate 0.06 percent higher at 6.495 per dollar after
Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said China has “been growing accustomed
to the shifts in exchange rates over the years.”  Asia ’s largest
economy reported a trade surplus of $11.4 billion in April, more
than three times the amount forecast by economists, data showed
today. Exports surged 30 percent to a record $156 billion.  “One of the driving forces for today’s yuan rise is the
meeting,” said Christy Tan, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in  Singapore . “Although the
comments from the PBOC governor are quite clear that there’s
nothing new to add to the existing foreign-exchange policy,
they’ve expressed commitment to currency flexibility and using
the yuan to control inflation.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.07 percent
to 6.3455 per dollar as of 4:51 p.m. in  Hong Kong , reflecting
bets the currency will rise 2.3 percent from the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan gained 0.03 percent to 6.4919 per dollar,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency touched 6.4892 on April 29, the strongest level since
1993. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan strengthened 0.04
percent to 6.4805.  To contact the reporter on this story:
