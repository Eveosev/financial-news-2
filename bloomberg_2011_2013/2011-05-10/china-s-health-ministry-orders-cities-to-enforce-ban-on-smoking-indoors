China’s health ministry ordered
counterparts in cities across the nation to strictly enforce a
ban on smoking indoors, spokesman Deng Haihua told reporters.  Lighting up inside public buildings, banned by the
government earlier this month, is difficult to prevent, Deng
said at a monthly ministry media briefing in Beijing today. The
ministry is seeking the cooperation of other government
departments in implementing the anti-smoking measure, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
