A U.K. index of hiring strengthened
in April as demand for full-time workers increased, KPMG LLP and
the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said.  The gauge of permanent job placements reported by
employment consultancies rose to 60.6 from 59.7 in March, the
groups said in an e-mailed report in London today. Readings
above 50 indicate an increase in hiring. A measure of full-time
salary growth gained to a nine-month high.  The  Bank of England  releases new quarterly economic
forecasts today after keeping its key interest rate at a record
low last week to support the recovery. Officials are split on
the threat to the economy from the government’s budget squeeze,
which will eliminate about 300,000 public jobs, and inflation
that’s double the central bank’s 2 percent target.  “Permanent hires made in  information technology ,
construction and engineering suggest that employer confidence on
the whole is improving,” REC Chief Executive Officer Kevin
Green said. However, “public-sector employment is radically
slowing,” showing there is “a two-speed jobs market.”  An index of wage growth for permanent employees climbed to
56.1 in April from 55.3 the previous month, KPMG and REC said.
Pay for temporary staff increased at the fastest pace in a year.  A gauge of demand for temporary staff dropped to a four-
month low of 56.6 from 58.8 in March, partly due to weaker
demand from government-related employers, the report found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
