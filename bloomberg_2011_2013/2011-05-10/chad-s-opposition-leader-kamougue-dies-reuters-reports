Chadian opposition leader and former
defense minister, Abdelkader Wadal Kamougue, died in hospital
after a seizure yesterday,  Reuters  said, citing party member

the nation’s first president in 1975, the  news agency  said. He
served in the governments of four regimes and contested
elections against current President Idriss Deby in 1996 and
2001, the news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
