Asurion Corp. is seeking $3.57
billion in senior secured loans to refinance debt after pulling
a larger deal almost two months ago, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The private equity-owned provider of wireless handset
insurance and roadside assistance will host a lender call
tomorrow to discuss the transaction, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Asurion follows Tasc Inc. last week and  MetroPCS
Communications Inc. (PCS)  this week in reviving loan transactions amid
improved market conditions. The Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S.
Leveraged Loan 100 index closed yesterday at 95.9 cents, 1.06
cents more than a March 18 low.  On March 16, Asurion canceled a $4.64 billion loan
transaction due to market conditions, according to a person
briefed on the deal who declined to be identified because the
terms were private.  The Nashville, Tennessee-based company had proposed to pay
3.75 percentage points to 4 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate with a 1.5 percent floor on a $3.5
billion first-lien facility, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Asurion was offering the loan at 99 cents to 99.5
cents on the dollar.  Bettie Colombo, a spokeswoman for Asurion, didn’t
immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse AG,
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG
are arranging the deal, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
