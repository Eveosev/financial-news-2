Ugandan civil-society organizations
rejected proposed law that seeks to criminalize homosexuality
ahead of an expected vote on a revised version of the
legislation.  The bill infringes on fundamental human rights and elevates
its criminality to the level of terrorism and treason, the
Kampala-based Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and
Constitution Law said in a statement published today in the New
Vision newspaper.  “We therefore reject the original bill, together with any
attempt to amend it, in its entirety,” the group said. “We call
unanimously for the complete withdrawal of the anti-
homosexuality bill, whether in its original or amended form.”  Ugandan lawmaker David Bahati in October 2009 tabled a
private member’s bill that sought the death penalty and  life
imprisonment  for gay people in the East African country. Former
Ethics and Integrity Minister James Nsaba Buturo said in 2009
that homosexuality is considered “repugnant to the Ugandan
culture.”  Helen Kawesa, a spokeswoman for parliament, said the bill
is currently being debated by a committee of lawmakers, though
she didn’t know when it would be presented to parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
