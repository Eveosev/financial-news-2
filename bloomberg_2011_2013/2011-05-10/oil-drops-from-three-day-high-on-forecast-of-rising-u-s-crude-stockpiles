Oil fell from a three-day high in  New
York  on speculation U.S. crude stockpiles increased to near the
highest level in two years.  Futures dropped as much as 2.4 percent before an  American
Petroleum Institute  report on inventories today. The Energy
Department may say tomorrow supplies climbed for a third week.
CME Group Inc. raised margins, or the amount of money traders
must hold as collateral for their transactions, for futures
trading in New York. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said prices
will recover as conflict halts exports from  Libya .  “Demand in the U.S. is still a bit weak,” saidEliane Tanner, an analyst at Bank Sarasin & Cie. in Zurich. “But
demand from emerging markets is still strong. From a fundamental
point of view the correction was overdone as the supply
situation in Middle East-North Africa region is still not
resolved, so there’s a bit of upside for prices.”  Crude for June delivery slid as much as $2.43 to $100.12 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $102.02 at 12:45 p.m.  London  time. Oil rose
5.5 percent to $102.55 yesterday, the biggest gain since Feb.
22. Last week it dropped the most since December 2008.  Brent crude  for June settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell 0.3 percent to $115.53 a barrel.
Yesterday, it jumped 6.2 percent to $115.90.  Margin Increase  Brent, the European and African benchmark, traded at a
premium of $13.79 a barrel to U.S. futures, the highest since
April 18. The difference between front-month contracts in London
and New York surged to a record $19.54 on Feb. 21. It averaged
76 cents last year.  CME Group, the Nymex owner, increased margins for crude
trading to $8,438 per contract from $6,750, effective after the
close of business today. Heating-oil margins will rise to $8,438
from $6,413, and gasoline will climb to $9,450 from $7,763.  Crude also dropped as the dollar gained, damping the
investment appeal of commodities. The Dollar Index, a measure of
the greenback against six major currencies, climbed as much as
0.4 percent to 75.005.  The dollar and oil have moved in the opposite direction
about 86 percent of the time over the past month, according to
Bloomberg calculations of the two instrument’s correlation.  “As we continue to expect higher prices near-term, we view
the recent dip in oil as short-term buying opportunity,”
analysts led by New York-based head of commodities research
 Francisco Blanch  said. “With limited oil supplies and a
supportive demand environment in the short-run, Brent crude oil
prices should still trade close to an average of $122.”  Crude Stockpiles  U.S. crude stockpiles increased 1.5 million barrels from
366.5 million in the week ended May 6, according to the median
of 11 estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before
tomorrow’s Energy Department report. Gasoline inventories are
expected to have declined 750,000 barrels from 204.5 million.
The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will publish
its own data today.  China’s net crude imports rose 3 percent in April from a
month earlier as refineries increased fuel production to supply
to factories in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Net imports advanced to 21.25 million metric tons last
month, or 5.2 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on  data posted  today on the website of the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs. Net inbound
shipments gained 1.3 percent from a year earlier.  U.S. gasoline futures advanced, extending the biggest one-
day gain in more than two months, amid concern that the flooding
of the  Mississippi River  will disrupt fuel production and
distribution.  Futures rose as much as 2.4 percent as the flooding
threatens refineries and shipping. A total of 11 plants,
accounting for 13 percent of U.S. fuel output, are located
between  New Orleans  and  Baton Rouge , according to Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
