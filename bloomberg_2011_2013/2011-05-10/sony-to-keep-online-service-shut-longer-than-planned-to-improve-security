Sony Corp. (6758)  will keep some online
entertainment services closed longer than it had planned to make
sure its systems don’t fall prey to more hacker attacks, a
spokesman said today.  The maker of PlayStation Game consoles is still enhancing
security on its PS Network, Qriocity and Sony Online
Entertainment services, Shigenori Yoshida, a Tokyo-based
spokesman, said by phone. Sony shut down PS Network and Qriocity
on April 20, and had planned to bring them back online May 8.  Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics is still
aiming to restore full service, including purchases of games,
music and video, by the end of the month, Yoshida said.  Sony took down the PS Network and Qriocity because of
possible  data theft  on 77 million users. Sony Online
Entertainment, a U.S. unit that offers online games, also
shut its network May 1 after discovering personal information
from approximately 24.6 million accounts may have been stolen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
