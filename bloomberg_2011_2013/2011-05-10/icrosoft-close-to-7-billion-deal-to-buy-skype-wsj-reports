Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is close to an
agreement to buy Skype Technologies SA for more than $7 billion,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  An accord may be announced as early as today though the
deal may still fall apart, the Journal reported. The report said
that representatives for Microsoft and Skype declined to
comment.  The purchase amount would make Skype among Microsoftâ€™s
largest acquisitions in its 36-year history, the Journal
reported. Microsoft Chief Executive  Steve Ballmer  sees the
Internet as an essential battleground for Microsoft, which still
makes the majority of its profits from Windows and Office
software systems, the report said.  In 2007, Microsoft paid about $6 billion to buy online
advertising firm aQuantive Inc. and gave up on an unsolicited
$48 billion offer for Yahoo Inc. almost three years ago, the
Journal reported. Yahoo is valued at half that sum today.  Skype connects more than 663 million users worldwide via
Internet-based telephony and video, the report said. The company
was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis,
creators of the file-sharing technology called Kazaa.  EBay purchased the company in 2005 for $2.6 billion in cash
and stock. EBay gave up on Skype in 2007, taking a $1.4 billion
charge on the investment as it sold a 70 percent stake to a
group of technology investors including  Silver Lake Partners ,
venture capital firms Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz,
and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Those investors
would gain from the Microsoft transaction, the Journal reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
