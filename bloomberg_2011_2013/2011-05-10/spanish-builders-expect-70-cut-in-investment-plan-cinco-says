Spanish building companies fear the
Development Ministry will cut a 17 billion-euro ($24 billion)
infrastructure plan by 70 percent after local elections this
month,  Cinco  Dias reported, citing company officials it didn’t
identify.  The companies expect investment in the two-year program to
be 4 billion to 5 billion euros, a reduction of as much as 70
percent, the newspaper said.  A ministry spokesman who declined to be identified, in line
with government policy, said the program is continuing as
planned and the ministry has no knowledge of the industry’s
fears, which he said are unfounded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
