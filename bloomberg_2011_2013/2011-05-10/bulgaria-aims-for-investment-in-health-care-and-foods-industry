Bulgaria  aims to attract investment
in health care, the food industry, electronics and biotechnology
to boost long-term economic growth, Economy and Energy Minister
Traicho Traikov said.  Some 80 percent of last year’s foreign investment or 1.3
billion euros ($1.9 billion) went into industrial and energy
projects, which shows that Bulgaria has transformed from being
mostly a real-estate investment destination, Traikov said at an
investment conference in Sofia today. The global financial
crisis brought Bulgaria’s construction boom to an end, which cut
foreign investment.  “Bulgaria can use its natural potential and become a
recognizable health-care destination and food producer,”
Traikov said. “We also plan to develop clusters of so-called
clean technologies including electronics and biotechnology.”  The  European Union’s  poorest member by per-capita gross
domestic product is emerging from its deepest economic slump in
more than a decade. The government expects record exports to
boost economic growth to 3.6 percent this year from 0.2 percent
in 2010 and a 5.1 percent contraction in 2009.  Bulgaria’s Black Sea coast and mountains attract thousands
of tourists and the country needs to develop a spa and wellness
industry using its numerous mineral water springs, Traikov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
