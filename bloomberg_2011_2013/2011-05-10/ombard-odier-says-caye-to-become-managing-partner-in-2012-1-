Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch & Cie.,
Geneva’s oldest private bank, said Arthur Caye will join the
company in August and become a managing partner next January.  Caye, 41, will join from Capital Group in Geneva where he
was a partner and research director, Lombard Odier said today in
an e-mailed statement. He has an MBA from Stanford Business
School and worked from 1995 to 1999 at Cazenove & Co. in Bangkok
and  London , the bank said.  “The appointment of Arthur Caye will further strengthen
the next generation of partners,” Lombard Odier said in the
statement.  Caye will become the ninth managing partner at Lombard
Odier, which has 145 billion Swiss francs ($164.9 billion) of
assets under management. The bank said last September that
Frederic Rochat, the new head of its London office, will also
become a managing partner on Jan. 1, 2012. The partners
collectively own and run the bank, which was founded in 1796.  To contact the reporter on this story:
