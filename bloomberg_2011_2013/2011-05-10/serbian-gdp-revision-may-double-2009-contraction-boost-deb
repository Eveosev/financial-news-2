Serbia’s economy probably contracted
about double the previously reported 3.1 percent in 2009, the
statistics office said, boosting state debt levels close to the
Balkan nation’s credit ceiling.  The  office  will unveil a final assessment in September of
2009 gross domestic product, deputy head of the Statistics
office Miladin Kovacevic told reporters today.  The “decline in constant prices is apparently going to be
around 6.1 or 6.2 percent,” Kovacevic said, adding that the
drop, measured in current prices was 3.5 percent.  Serbia’s economy is emerging from a recession with GDP
projected to grow about 3 percent this year, according to the
central bank. The government turned to the  International
Monetary Fund  for 3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of financial
assistance in 2008 to keep its economy afloat.  With such a revision, Serbian “debt levels are likely to
have hit 42 percent or 43 percent of GDP,” said Stojan Stamenkovic, chief researcher at the Belgrade-based Economics
Institute. Crossing a self-imposed debt cap of 45 percent of GDP
would trigger budget measures.  The revised figure is “experimental” and takes into
account price distortions on the production and spending side,
Kovacevic said.  Serbia  has been working with IMF experts to
prepare the GDP report, he said.  Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said today he would
“personally raise the issue of GDP revisions at the government
session this week” as such “huge deviations affect the
government’s economic policy making.”  Serbia’s total public debt stood at 41.4 percent of GDP at
the end of 2010, up from 32.9 percent at the end of 2009,
according to Finance Ministry figures.  Under the terms of its international bailout loan, which
was completed last month, Serbia needs to keep its fiscal gap
under 4.1 percent of GDP this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
