Lebanon posted a budget deficit of
7.5 percent of gross domestic product last year, less than an
initial forecast of 8.9 percent, as the government trimmed
spending, the finance ministry said.  The deficit fell to 4.36 trillion pounds ($2.9 billion)
from 4.46 trillion pounds, or 8.5 percent of GDP, in 2009, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Spending declined 0.7 percent to 17 trillion pounds, the
ministry said. The country had 79 trillion pounds of debt at the
end of last year, or 137 percent of GDP, down from 146 percent
the previous year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
