Kazakhstan ’s economy expanded 6.9
percent from a year earlier in the first four months of the
year, Asel Torgautova, an official at the state statistics
agency, said by phone from the capital, Astana.  The growth figure was first announced by Prime Minister
Karim Massimov on his Twitter  account .  Kazakhstan increased its economic growth forecast to 7
percent this year and 6.9 percent in 2012 after gross domestic
product expanded 7 percent in 2010, Economic Development and
Trade Minister  Kairat Kelimbetov  said at a cabinet meeting today
in Astana, according to e-mailed remarks. Growth will average 7
percent through 2015, he said.  The central bank in January estimated Kazakhstan’s economy
would expand as much as 6 percent this year. President Nursultan Nazarbayev has ordered that the economy must grow at least 7
percent annually through 2015, Kelimbetov said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
