Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker operated by  Fiat SpA (F) , said global automobile sales in
April rose 20 percent from a year earlier as deliveries outside
North America increased at a faster rate than in March.  Global deliveries climbed to 160,380 last month, Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler said in an e-mail. Worldwide
sales this year through April rose 18 percent to 554,259,
trailing the 32 percent growth rate that Chief Executive Officer
 Sergio Marchionne  has targeted for this year.  Marchionne is seeking to refinance Chrysler’s debt to repay
U.S. and Canadian government loans this quarter, allowing Fiat
to exercise an option to raise its stake in the U.S. automaker
to 46 percent from 30 percent. He also is pushing Chrysler to
sell 2 million vehicles this year and turn its first annual net
profit since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009.  Sales outside of  North America  rose 8.7 percent to 13,053
in April, Ann Smith, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said in an e-mail
yesterday. That’s faster than the 1.6 percent gain in non-North
America sales the company posted in March.  Chrysler’s best-selling vehicle outside of North America in
April was the Dodge Journey, Smith said.  Sales in  Canada  rose 16 percent last month to 23,837 and 18
percent to 6,265 in  Mexico , she said. The company previously
reported U.S. sales rose 22 percent in April to 117,225.  To contact the reporter on this story:
