Peru’s central bank will raise its
benchmark lending rate by a quarter point to 4.25 percent on May
12 to slow rising inflation, said Walter Bayly, the head of the
country’s largest financial-services company, Credicorp Ltd.  Bayly, speaking at a news conference in  Lima  today, also
said he expects policy makers “will be firm” on monetary
policy and will push the overnight rate up to 5 percent to 5.5
percent by year-end.  Additionally, he said that concern about the outcome of the
country’s June 5 presidential election is prompting Peruvians to
pull out of mutual funds and switch into savings accounts. Peru
faces three months of slowing growth due to what he called
uncertainty over the election.  Candidates Ollanta Humala and  Keiko Fujimori are tied in
the latest poll ahead of the second-round vote. The election is
delaying investment “in every industry,” Bayly said.  The sol rose for a fifth day, strengthening 0.1 percent to
2.7905 per dollar at 12:02 p.m. New York time from 2.7925
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
