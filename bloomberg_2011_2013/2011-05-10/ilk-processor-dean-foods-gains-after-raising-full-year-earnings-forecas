Dean Foods Co. (DF) , the largest U.S. milk
processor, gained the most in five months in New York trading
after raising its full-year earnings forecast and posting first-
quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Full-year earnings will be 67 to 75 cents, up from a
previous prediction of 55 to 65 cents, the Dallas-based company
said today in a statement. First-quarter net income fell 41
percent to $25.3 million, or 14 cents a share, from $43.2
million, or 24 cents a year earlier. That beat the 6-cent
average estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales
increased 3 percent to $3.05 billion from $2.96 billion.  Dean’s Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar dairy business’s
earnings have declined after commodity costs rose, retailers
pressed for price concessions and consumers bought cheaper store
brands. Dean said today it’s cutting costs and pursuing new
business to offset the “soft” volumes in the milk unit.  “Overall, the business is off to a stronger start than we
had anticipated and we are somewhat encouraged as we look to the
balance of the year,” Dean Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Gregg Engles said in the statement. “While we have a long way
to go at Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, I am cautiously
optimistic that the trajectory of our business is upward.”  Dean climbed $1.26, or 11 percent, to $12.24 as of 4:15
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
one-day gain since Dec. 9.  Second-quarter earnings will be 15 to 20 cents a share, the
company also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
