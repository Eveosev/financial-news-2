Ethanol futures advanced on
speculation demand for the fuel to be blended into gasoline will
gain as flooding threatens to curb refinery output.  The gasoline additive increased as flooding on the
 Mississippi River  moved south of  Memphis , Tennesse, potentially
harming crude oil refineries. Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
swelled to 80.47 cents, the largest since April 29, providing
blenders an incentive to use more to pocket the spread and the
45-cent tax credit provided for each gallon mixed into the motor
fuel.  “That’s because these refineries are in jeopardy,” said
Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in
Dallas. “The river is not to be trifled with even when it’s
low. This is probably going to affect the market for awhile.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.575 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 8.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  added 2 cents,

data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago advanced 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
