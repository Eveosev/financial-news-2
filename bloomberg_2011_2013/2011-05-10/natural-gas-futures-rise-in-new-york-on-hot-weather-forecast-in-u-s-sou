Natural gas futures rose, snapping a
six-day losing streak, as forecasts showed hotter-than-normal
weather in the U.S. South, boosting demand for the power-plant
fuel for air conditioning.  Gas gained 2.2 percent as forecasters including MDA
EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said temperatures
will be as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the
South and Midwest this week. Gas tumbled 12 percent in the
previous six days on concern economic growth will slow, crimping
fuel use.  “It’s very hot in the southern U.S. so there will be more
air-conditioning demand,” said Peter Linder, president of the
DeltaOne Energy Fund in Calgary. “The correction was overdone
and traders are getting back in.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 9.2 cents to settle at
$4.246 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 1.8 percent from a year ago.  “At $4.20 gas is cheap,” Linder said. “Prices may get
back to the $4.40-to-$4.50 range.”  U.S. gas stockpiles rose 72 billion cubic feet in the week
ended April 29 to 1.757 trillion cubic feet, 1 percent below the
five-year average level, the Energy Department reported last
week. Storage levels were down 11 percent from a year earlier.  Houston will have a high of 89 degrees Fahrenheit (32
Celsius) today, 5 degrees above normal, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. Jacksonville,  Florida , will
have a high of 87 degrees.  Weather and Prices  “We’ve had six days of declines so any sign of hot weather
could raise prices,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG
Economics, an energy research firm in  London , Arkansas.
“Storage is below the five-year average, which means we may
have reached the balance between supply and demand.”  Scheduled gas deliveries to U.S.  power plants  rose 2.6
percent to 15.1 million dekatherms (14.7 billion cubic feet),
according to a sampling of gas pipeline nominations compiled by
Bloomberg. Scheduled shipments to Florida for electricity
generation rose 4.2 percent to 3.29 million dekatherms.  Power plants use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies
according to the Energy Department.  Output Estimate  U.S. gas production in 2011 will average 63.23 billion
cubic feet a day, down from 63.32 billion estimated in April,
the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook .  Gas prices at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , will
average $4.24 per million Btu this year, up from $4.10 estimated
in April.  Gas production will have month-to-month declines “through
the year because of reductions in the number of active natural
gas drilling rigs,” the department said in the report.  U.S. gas rigs gained 8 to 890 last week, according to
Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count is 6.6 percent
lower than a year ago.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
231,986 as of 2:39 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 316,000. Volume was 309,561 yesterday. Open interest was
977,380 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
943,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
