China’s  iron ore  imports, down 11
percent in April from the month before, are unlikely to rise
from current levels in May and June as the world’s biggest
steelmaker curbs output, Arctic Securities ASA said.  China imported 52.9 million metric tons of iron ore in
April, down from 59.5 million tons in March, according to data
from the country’s General Administration of Customs. Buyers
were deterred by higher prices, Hu Kai, an analyst with
researcher Umetal.com, said. Import prices at Tianjin port rose
5.3 percent in April, according to Steel Business Briefing
Commodities Research.  “We expect iron ore imports in May and June to remain at
lower levels due to closure of  steel mills  as some regions
struggle with electricity shortages,” Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an
Oslo-based analyst with Arctic, said in an e-mailed note today.
 China ’s annualized imports are 690 million tons, “on par” with
Arctic’s expectations of 694 million tons, he said.  China aims to cut 26.27 million tons of outdated steel
production capacity this year, according to a statement from the
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  posted on the
central government’s website. The country accounted for 46
percent of global crude steel output in March, according to the
World Steel Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
