Bulgaria ’s anti-monopoly watchdog
said it fined Dalkia Varna EAD 232,242 lev ($170,500) for abuse
of its dominant market position.  Dalkia SA runs the heating utility in Bulgaria’s  Black Sea 
of Varna and has violated Bulgarian laws by trying to sell its
services directly to customers, rather than through a licensed
intermediary company, the Sofia-based Fair Competition
Commission said on its  website  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
