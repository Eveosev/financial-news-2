New York Mets pitcher Chris Young has
a torn anterior capsule in his throwing shoulder that may force
him to miss the rest of the season.  Young, who had a 1-0 record and 1.88 earned run average in
four starts, suffered the same injury last season with the  San
Diego Padres  and also pitched in only four games.  The former Princeton University pitcher had surgery to
repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder in 2009 and was
limited to 14 starts. He hasn’t made more than 18 starts in a
Major League Baseball season since 2007.  Mets doctors haven’t decided whether Young, 31, will
undergo surgery or a lengthy rehabilitation process, Assistant
General Manager John Ricco told reporters last night in Denver.
Mets pitcher  Johan Santana  had the same injury and has been out
the past eight months after opting for surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
