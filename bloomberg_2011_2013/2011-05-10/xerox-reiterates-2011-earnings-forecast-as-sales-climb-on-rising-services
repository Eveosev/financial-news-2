Xerox Corp. (XRX) , the printer maker that
bought Affiliated Computer Services Inc. last year, boosted its
2012 earnings forecast as it adds more services.  Per-share profit, excluding some items, will be $1.18 to
$1.28 next year, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said
today in a statement before its investor briefing in New York.
Analysts, on average, estimated $1.23, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  Chief Executive Officer Ursula Burns is trying to squeeze
costs and boost sales while integrating her $6 billion purchase
of Affiliated Computer Services, the company’s largest ever.
Sales will grow at least 4 percent in 2012, the company said.  “We’re focused on expanding our business globally,
particularly with services,” Burns told investors at the
briefing at the  New York  Stock Exchange.  Xerox had previously forecast 2012 per-share profit of
$1.10 to $1.20, excluding some items.  The company maintained this year’s earnings forecast,
excluding some items, of $1.05 per share to $1.10 per share,
with sales growth of 3 percent to 5 percent. On that basis,
sales would be at most $22.7 billion, compared with analysts’
average estimate of $22.9 billion.  Xerox climbed 28 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $10.46 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
dropped 9 percent this year.  Cost Cutting  Services sales will grow at least 6 percent by 2012, the
company said. Revenue in its technology unit will climb 1
percent to 3 percent next year, as Xerox expands distribution
and companies print more color pages.  Xerox reduced costs by $100 million in 2010, and plans to
cut another $120 million in expenses this year, as it uses
services from ACS, which handles accounting, benefits and other
administrative tasks for customers, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said at the investor briefing. Burns also eliminated
about 5,000 jobs last year.  The company also reiterated its plan to begin repurchasing
shares this year, after halting buybacks following the ACS
acquisition. The company will spend at least 70 percent of its
available cash, which should total $1 billion to $1.2 billion,
on the repurchases, starting in the third quarter, Maestri said.  “It’s a huge deal -- massive, massive,” said Ananda Baruah, an analyst with Brean Murray Carret & Co., of the
repurchases. “It’s as big a reason that people are in the stock
as anything else.” Baruah recommends buying the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
