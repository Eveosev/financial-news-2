Bond funds holding 1 trillion euros
($1.44 trillion) of assets in  Europe  are increasing “short-term
volatility” in debt markets, according to  Fitch Ratings .  “Mutual funds investors are more active than pension funds
and insurers, which are buy-and-hold investors,” analysts
including Aymeric Poizot wrote in a report. “It is therefore
likely that mutual funds represent a more significant force in
daily flows, adding short-term volatility to the market.”  The funds play an important role in the high-yield debt
market as they attracted as much as 15 billion euros in new
money last year, equivalent to between 25 percent and 30 percent
of issuance, according to Fitch.  To contact the reporters on this story:
