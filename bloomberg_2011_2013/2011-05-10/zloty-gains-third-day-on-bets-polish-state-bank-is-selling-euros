The Polish zloty advanced for a third
day on speculation state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego will
continue to convert euros on the  currency market .  The zloty advanced 0.3 percent to 3.9233 per euro as of
12:53 p.m. in Warsaw. It has appreciated 0.8 percent in a three-
day rally that yesterday sent the currency to an 11-week high.  Poland began converting euros received from the European
Union on the market, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said last
week, following up on the plan announced on April 21. Bank
Gospodarstwa, which the ministry tasked with exchanging euros,
also sold U.S. dollars in the past two days, two Warsaw-based
traders involved in the transactions said yesterday.  “People are afraid to push the zloty lower,” said Marcin Turkiewicz, chief foreign-currency trader at BRE Bank SA in
Warsaw. “They know BGK is somewhere out there and it will try
to curb the decline.”  The government will this year exchange as much as 14
billion euros ($20.2 billion) for the zloty, Deputy Finance
Minister  Dominik Radziwill  said on April 21. The sales “may
ease pressure to increase interest rates,” reduce volatility
and absorb liquidity on the  interbank market , Rostowski said at
a conference on the same day.  The plan to sell euros to combat inflation through stronger
zloty will probably convince policy makers to keep the main
interest rate at 4 percent when they end a meeting tomorrow,
according to 24 of 31 economists survey by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
