Aareal Bank AG (ARL) , the German
commercial-property lender that tapped the country’s Soffin
rescue fund during the financial crisis, said first-quarter
profit increased 88 percent after loan losses fell.  Net income rose to 30 million euros ($43 million) from 16
million euros a year earlier, the Wiesbaden, Germany-based
lender said in a statement today. Loan-loss provisions dropped
to 18 million euros from 32 million euros, the bank said.  Aareal, which provides property financing in more than 25
countries in  Europe , Asia and  North America , on April 14 raised
its outlook for this year, predicting a “significant increase”
in operating profit compared with 2010. The bank reiterated that
forecast today. Aareal last month raised 269.6 million euros
through a rights offer to help repay state aid, strengthen its
capital base and finance future growth.  “We are confident that we can grow profitably in the
coming years and further expand our market position,” Aareal’s
Chief Executive Officer Wolf Schumacher said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
