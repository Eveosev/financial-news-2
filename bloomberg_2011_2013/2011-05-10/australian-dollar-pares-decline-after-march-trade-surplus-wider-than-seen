New Zealand ’s dollar weakened against
most of its major counterparts after the  International Monetary
Fund  said it may be as much as 20 percent overvalued.  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, snapped a two-day gain
versus the greenback after the Treasury Department said New
Zealand’s budget deficit was wider than forecast in the nine
months through March. Australia’s dollar fell earlier as
Treasurer Wayne Swan cut spending for the 12 months ending June
30, 2012, to fight inflation.  “It’s interesting to see sort of a knee-jerk reaction” to
the IMF report, said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist
at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. “That suggests maybe short-
term traders are a little bit nervous about holding long kiwi
positions at the moment.” A long position is a bet an asset
will strengthen.  The  New Zealand dollar  slipped 0.3 percent to 79.34 U.S.
cents at 11:54 a.m. in  New York , from 79.55 yesterday. The kiwi
rose 0.2 percent to 64.01 yen, from 63.93.  Australia’s dollar was little changed at $1.0802 after
earlier falling as much as 0.7 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since May 5. It closed yesterday at $1.0807. The Aussie
gained 0.4 percent to 87.23 yen, from 86.84 yesterday.  Part of the New Zealand dollar’s overvaluation reflects its
large interest-rate advantage, which may erode when major
central banks eventually start tightening monetary policy, the
Washington-based IMF said as part of an annual review of the
country’s economy.  Benchmark interest rates are 2.5 percent in New Zealand and
4.75 percent in  Australia , compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and  Japan , attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets.  Cash Shortfall  New Zealand’s cash shortfall was NZ$12.4 billion ($9.8
billion) in the nine months ended March 31, or NZ$102 million
wider than forecast in December’s fiscal update, the Treasury
said today.  The kiwi and Aussie pared losses as global stocks rose
after the Athens newspaper Kathimerini reported the
International Monetary Fund is arranging an 80 billion-euro
($114 billion) to 100 billion-euro plan, without saying how it
got the information.  Euro-area countries are readying a further “two-digit”
billion-euro loan for Greece, the German newspaper Handelsblatt
reported, citing unidentified “euro-zone sources” in Brussels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
