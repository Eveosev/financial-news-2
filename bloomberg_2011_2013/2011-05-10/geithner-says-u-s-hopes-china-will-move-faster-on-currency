U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said he hopes  China  “moves to allow the exchange rate
to appreciate more rapidly and more broadly against the
currencies of all its trading partners.”  Geithner, speaking at the closing of two days of U.S.-China
talks in Washington today, also said China agreed to no longer
use government procurement preferences for “indigenous
innovation products at any level of government.”  “This is important to make sure, of course, that U.S.
technology, U.S. firms, can compete fairly for business
opportunities in China,” Geithner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
