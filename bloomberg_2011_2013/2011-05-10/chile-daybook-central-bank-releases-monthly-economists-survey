The central bank discloses results of
its monthly economists survey at 8:30 a.m. New York time.
Finance Minister Felipe Larrain and Economy Minister Juan Andres Fontaine will discuss food price increases during a special
session of the lower house of Congress at 4 p.m.  ECONOMY:
*The  trade surplus  rose to $1.58 billion in April as exports
grew 30 percent and imports climbed 31 percent from the previous
year, the central bank said. The median estimate of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a surplus of $1.6
billion.  EQUITIES:
*The Ipsa index rose 0.2 percent to 4,821.66. The  MSCI Chile (MXCL) 
index dropped 0.9 percent to 2,827.48.
*Colbun SA, the third-largest power producer, advanced 1 percent
to 143.15 pesos as authorities prepared to vote on its
HidroAysen power project. Approval gave Colbun and its partner
in the project Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA an
environmental license for what’s designed to be  Chile ’s biggest
power plant. Endesa advanced 1.4 percent.  MARKETS:
*Chilean swap rates declined to the lowest in a month as the
falling dollar cut the cost of Chilean imports and relieved
inflation concerns, boosting expectations the central bank will
slow the pace of rate hikes.
*One-year interest-rate swaps fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.52 percent. Two-year swaps fell five
basis points to 5.63 percent.
*The peso gained 0.1 percent to 467.4 per  U.S. dollar  from
467.97 on May 6.
*Two-year breakeven inflation fell four basis points to 3.62
percent.
*Foreign investors in the Chilean forwards market increased bets
against the peso by $399 million to $2.4 billion on May 5, the
highest since April 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
