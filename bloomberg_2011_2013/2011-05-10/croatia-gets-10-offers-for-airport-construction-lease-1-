Croatia  received 10 preliminary bids
from companies interested in building a new terminal at the
international airport in Zagreb and leasing the facilities for
30 years, officials said.  The  government  will begin a second round of the tender on
May 19 and expects to choose a winner by September, Tomislav
Mihotic, state secretary in the  Ministry for Transportation ,
told reporters today in Zagreb. The contract would take effect
in the second quarter of next year.  The winner will have the right to operate the existing
terminal while a new facility is built. There is a three-year
deadline for building the new terminal, officials said.  The new airport would boost tourism, which accounts for
about 20 percent of the gross domestic product in the Adriatic
Sea nation, said Zdeslav Santic, chief analyst at  Societe
Generale  - Splitska Banka d.d.  “The new airport would also provide a chance for Croatia
to become a regional hub in the western Balkans,” Santic said
today in a phone interview.  The first phase of work, during which a new terminal and
runways will be built, is estimated at 192 million euros ($275
million). After traffic through the airport exceeds 5 million
travellers, compared with 2.1 million in 2010, another 29
million euros will be invested, Mihotic said. He also said the
target figure of 5 million travelers is “still being discussed
and could be changed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
