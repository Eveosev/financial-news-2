European Central Bank Executive Board
member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said an excessive focus on
domestic economies may endanger the global financial system and
exacerbate future crises.  “The economy is global, so policies cannot remain local,”
Tumpell-Gugerell said in a speech in Zurich today. “An
excessive focus on the domestic economy may exacerbate global
economic and financial imbalances, ultimately making future
global crises more likely and more severe. This is all the more
true for systemically relevant countries, which have a special
obligation for international cooperation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
