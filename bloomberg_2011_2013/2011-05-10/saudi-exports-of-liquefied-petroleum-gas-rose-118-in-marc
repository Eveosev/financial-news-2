Saudi Arabia ’s exports of liquefied
petroleum gas including propane and butane rose 118 percent in
March from a year earlier, according to official data.  LPG exports from ports managed by the Saudi  Port Authority 
increased to 184,344 metric tons from 84,618 tons a year
earlier, according to data posted yesterday on the authority’s
 website .  First-quarter LPG exports fell 4.9 percent to 471,469
metric tons from 495,547 metric tons a year earlier.  The figures don’t include Saudi Aramco’s exports of LPG
from its own ports, which are operated separately from those run
by the port authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
