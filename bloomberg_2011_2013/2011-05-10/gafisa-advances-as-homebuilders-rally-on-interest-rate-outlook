Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  advanced, rebounding from
its lowest in almost two years, as homebuilders rallied on
speculation higher borrowing costs may not curb the industry’s
profits as much as previously expected.  Gafisa climbed 3.4 percent to 8.85 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. Shares earlier
plunged 4.7 percent after the company reported first-quarter
earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates. The BM&FBovespa Real
Estate Index rose 1.8 percent.  “It seems that a tighter monetary policy won’t have that
big of an impact over the company’s profits,” said Joao Pedro Brugger, helps oversee 70 million reais at Leme Investimentos in
Florianopolis,  Brazil . “Overall, homebuilders have reported
good first-quarter results. There were some exceptions, like
Gafisa, but even in this case shares had already fallen
significantly this year, so probably there wasn’t much room for
further declines.”  Gafisa said first-quarter net income fell 79 percent from a
year earlier to 13.7 million reais ($8.5 million), according to
a regulatory filing. The average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 64.9 million reais.  Gafisa tumbled 28.9 percent this year through yesterday.
The Bovespa index slid 6.8 percent in the same period.  Brazilian central bankers have raised the benchmark
overnight lending rate by 125 basis points, or 1.25 percentage
points, this year to 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
