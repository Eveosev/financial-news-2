Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, said today that it is “more than happy” to
recognise labor unions where unions are relevant, Vice President
Andrew James Bond said.  Bond was speaking in Pretoria under cross-examination at a
hearing by South Africa’s Competition Tribunal into Wal-Mart’s
proposed acquisition of a 51 percent stake in  Massmart Holdings
Ltd. (MSM) , a South African retailer.  “The fact that low numbers of our U.S. workers are
unionized must be seen against the fact that less than 5 percent
of retail workers in the U.S. are unionized,” Bond said. The
South African government and some trade unions have opposed the
acquisition, saying it may result in job losses if allowed to go
ahead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
