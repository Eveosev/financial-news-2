Water levels at Tanzania’s Mtera
hydropower dam have reached a level that can only support power
generation for less than a month, the Dar es Salaam-based
 Guardian  reported, citing an unidentified government official.  The facility has an installed capacity of 80 megawatts, the
newspaper said.  Tanzania Electricity Corp. yesterday announced it will
ration the use of electricity to 15 hours a day from May 19
because of maintenance work at natural gas-fired power plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
