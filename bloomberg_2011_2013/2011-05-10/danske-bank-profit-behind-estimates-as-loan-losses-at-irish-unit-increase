Danske Bank A/S,  Denmark ’s largest
lender, said first-quarter profit fell 7.8 percent as loan
impairment charges in Ireland rose, sending its shares down the
most in three months.  Net income slipped to 709 million kroner ($135.9 million)
from 769 million kroner a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Copenhagen-based lender. That missed the average 858
million-kroner estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Loan losses dropped 33 percent to 2.84 billion kroner, while in
Ireland, where Danske bought  National Irish Bank  in 2005,
provisions rose 18 percent to 1.28 billion kroner.  Danish banks are under pressure from rising funding costs
after the country in February allowed Amagerbanken A/S to fail
as the first test to rules put in place in October, setting a
precedent for senior creditor losses in  Europe . Danske Bank got
19.8 billion kroner in net proceeds after selling 232.9 million
new shares in April, strengthening its capital base. It said it
would have had a core Tier 1 ratio of 12.4 percent at the end of
March with proceeds from its share sale.  “Recent macroeconomic indicators offer hope that the
business environment will gradually improve over the coming
year,” Peter Straarup, Danske’s chief executive officer, said
in the statement. “The Irish economy will continue to face
structural challenges, and because of the economic climate, the
level of future impairment charges is uncertain.”  2011 Expenses Level  Danske’s report was “very weak,” said Robert Matulin, an
analyst at Swedbank AB in  Stockholm . Net interest income,
expenses and loan losses “all surprised on the negative side,”
he said.  Danske Bank shares fell as much as 5.7 percent and were
down 3.3 percent, or 3.9 kroner, to 113 kroner at 9:57 a.m. in
Copenhagen trading, the biggest decliner on the Bloomberg Europe
Banks and Financial Services Index, which was up 0.7 percent.  Net interest income during the three months ended March 31
fell 16 percent to 8.04 billion kroner, while expenses rose 16
percent to 7.4 billion kroner. The lender said this year’s
expenses would be level with last year’s.  Danske suffered the largest loan impairments of any Nordic
bank in 2009 because of an economic slump in Denmark, Ireland
and the Baltic states.  To contact the reporters on this story:
