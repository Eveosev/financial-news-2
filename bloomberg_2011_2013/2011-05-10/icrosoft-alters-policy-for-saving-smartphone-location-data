Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , responding to
privacy concerns raised against makers of smartphone software,
said it will stop logging and storing location data that can be
traced back to specific handsets.  Microsoft, which today announced an $8.5 billion
acquisition of Web-calling service Skype Technologies SA, said
in a  blog post  yesterday that it’s taking steps to eliminate the
use and storage of the so-called unique device identifier from
smartphones using its Windows 7 operating system. The number
serves as an ID for the gadget.  “Without a unique identifier or some other significant
change to our operating system or practices, we cannot track an
individual device,” Andy Lees, president of Microsoft’s mobile
communications business, said in yesterday’s post.  U.S. lawmakers have increased scrutiny of how consumer data
is collected from smartphones and tablet computers.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  defended how they gather location data from
mobile devices today at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing
on the topic.  Microsoft, like Apple and Google, said it doesn’t collect
location information unless a user consents. The data are used
for services such as maps, directions or to deliver targeted
advertising.  To contact the reporters on this story:
