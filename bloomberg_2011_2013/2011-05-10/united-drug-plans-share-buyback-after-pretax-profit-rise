United Drug Plc (UDG)  said it plans to buy
back as much as 5 million shares after the company reported an
increase in pre-tax profit in the six months through March.  Pre-tax profit before amortization rose 4 percent from a
year earlier to 32.7 million euros, United Drug said in a
statement today. The company said it still expects operating
profit for the year through September to be “ahead of last year
on a constant currency basis.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
