Neil Back quit as head coach of Leeds
Carnegie after the team finished last in English rugby union’s
Premiership.  Back, a former England and British & Irish Lions flanker,
resigned with “immediate effect,” Leeds said today in a
statement on its website. A final-day defeat at Northampton on
May 7 left Leeds bottom of the 12-team Premiership standings on
points difference.  “I feel I have taken Leeds as far as I can,” Back, 42,
said in the statement.  Leeds’s relegation fate won’t be confirmed until May 18
following the completion of a two-game promotion playoff between
Worcester and Cornish Pirates. Should the Pirates win, Leeds
would retain its Premiership status because Worcester is the
only one of the two teams that meets the elite league’s entry
criteria.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
