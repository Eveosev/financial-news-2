Cotton rebounded from a three-month
low on concern that flooding in the lower  Mississippi River  will
hurt crops in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  Orange
juice  also advanced.  At least 130,000 acres were flooded in Missouri, and even
more land may be under water in  Tennessee  and Mississippi, state
officials and farmer groups have said. Combined planting in the
three states was forecast at 1.36 million acres this year out of
12.6 million in the U.S., government data showed.  “There is some concern over the flooding in the
Mississippi Delta,” said  Andy Ryan , a senior risk-management
consultant at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee.
“People are cautiously waiting to see what happens.”  Cotton for July delivery rose the exchange limit of 6
cents, or 4.1 percent, to settle at $1.514 a pound at 2:42 p.m.
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the most-active
contract touched $1.43, the lowest since Jan. 18. The price has
climbed 87 percent in the past 12 months.  Planting in Texas, the biggest U.S. grower, was estimated
at 6.12 million acres this year, followed by Georgia at 1.45
million, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. Mississippi
was fifth at 530,000 acres, followed by Tennessee at 470,000.
Missouri was ninth at 360,000.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery gained 3.35 cents,
or 2 percent, to $1.707 a pound, snapping a four-session slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
