U.S. nuclear-power production rose
for a second day as operators boosted reactors in  New Jersey ,
Florida, Texas,  Nebraska  and Arizona, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 401 megawatts from
yesterday to 73,759 megawatts, or 73 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-seven of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  raised output from the
1,130-megawatt Salem 2 reactor in New Jersey to 83 percent of
capacity from 65 percent yesterday.  Another unit at the site, the 1,174-megawatt Salem 1, is
operating at full power. The plant is located about 18 miles (29
kilometers) south of Wilmington, Delaware.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  increased output from the 839-megawatt
Saint Lucie 2 reactor in Florida to 60 percent of capacity from
45 percent yesterday.  Another reactor at the plant, the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie
1, was operating at 93 percent of capacity. The station is
located about 45 miles north of  Palm Beach .  South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Co. boosted the
1,410-megawatt South  Texas  1 reactor to 80 percent of capacity
from 56 percent. It is ramping up after a maintenance and
refueling outage that began April 4.  South Texas 2, another 1,410-megawatt unit at the plant,
located 80 miles southwest of Houston, was operating at full
power.  Cooper Reactor  The Nebraska Public Power District increased power from the
830-megawatt Cooper reactor in Nebraska to 47 percent of
capacity from 17 percent yesterday. It returned from a refueling
and maintenance outage that began March 14.  The unit is near Brownville on the Missouri River 64 miles
south of Omaha. Nebraska Public Power is based in Columbus,
Nebraska.  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  increased output from the
1,335-megawatt Palo Verde 2 reactor to 85 percent of capacity
from 69 percent yesterday. The unit was shut for refueling and
maintenance on April 4.  Units 1 and 3, which have the same capacities as Unit 2,
are operating at full power. The plant is located about 45 miles
west of Phoenix.  Thunderstorm  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) ’s 545-megawatt Prairie Island 2 reactor in
Minnesota tripped offline at 7:22 a.m. yesterday probably
because of a thunderstorm, Mary Sandok, a spokeswoman for the
plant, said in an e-mail.  “Operators were investigating the cause but it appeared to
be weather-related,” Sandok said. “The outage was not expected
to be lengthy,” she said. “No injuries occurred and there was
no release of radioactive material.”  The unit was operating at 100 percent of capacity before
the storm while the 551-megawatt Prairie Island 1, another
reactor at the site, was shut for refueling on April 29, Sandok
said.  The plant is located about 40 miles southeast of
Minneapolis, where Xcel is based.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  slowed the 852-megawatt FitzPatrick plant in
 New York  to 50 percent of capacity from 59 percent yesterday.
The plant is located 6 miles northeast of Oswego.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
