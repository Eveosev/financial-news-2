At least 174 people have been killed
along  Ivory Coast ’s western shore by militias and Liberian
mercenaries retreating toward neighboring Liberia, the Ivorian
Defense Ministry said.  The government of President  Alassane Ouattara  urged
international human rights officials to go the area “to
investigate the abuses,” according to a statement e-mailed by
the ministry yesterday.  The killings took place on May 5 and May 6 in several towns
and villages in the cocoa-producing southwest region, according
to the statement. About 30 of the militiamen and mercenaries
were killed by pro-Ouattara troops, it said.  Militias loyal to ex-President  Laurent Gbagbo , who was
captured on April 11 following a four-month post-election
crisis, fled a northern suburb of Abidjan, the commercial
capital, last week following two days of fighting. Ouattara’s
troops declared the area liberated on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
