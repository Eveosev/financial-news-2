Germans are more likely to own their
homes than rent them,  Bild  reported, citing an Allensbach survey
carried out for German rental-deposit insurance company Deutsche
Kautionsgemeinschaft AG.  About 46 percent of German citizens over the age of 16 live
in rented accommodation, the newspaper said. As many as 43
percent plan to move in the next few years, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
