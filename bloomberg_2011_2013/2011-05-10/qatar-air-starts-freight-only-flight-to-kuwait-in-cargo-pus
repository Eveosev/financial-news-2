(Corrects type of aircraft used in first paragraph of
story published yesterday.)  Qatar Airways Ltd., the Middle East’s
second-biggest carrier, said it started a cargo-only flight to
 Kuwait  using an Airbus A300 freighter, as part of a plan to
boost freight operations in the Gulf region.  The Kuwait City route will join freighter services to
Riyadh, Dubai and Bahrain, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The new service provides an opportunity to add business in
the carrier’s home region, Chief Executive Officer Akbar al Baker said in the statement.  The airline is pushing ahead with expanding its cargo unit,
as it plans to convert 15 Airbus A330 passenger jets into
freighters and acquire a 33 percent stake in Cargolux Airlines
International SA,  Europe ’s biggest freight-only carrier.  The airline’s cargo operations will move to the $14.5
billion New Doha International Airport when it is operational,
the carrier said. Adding  Kuwait City  increases the company’s
cargo network to 30 cities, it said.  In April, the company launched cargo flights to Bangalore
and Kozhikode in India and Hanoi in Vietnam. In 2010, Qatar Air
started its first cargo operations to  North America  with a
freighter to Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
