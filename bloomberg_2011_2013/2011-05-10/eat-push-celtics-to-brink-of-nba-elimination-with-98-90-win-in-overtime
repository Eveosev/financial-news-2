The Miami Heat pushed the  Boston
Celtics  to the brink of elimination from the National Basketball
Association playoffs with a 98-90 win in overtime.  The Heat lead the Celtics 3-1 in the best-of-seven-game
series and can advance to the Eastern Conference finals with a
home win on May 11.   The series winner will play the  Atlanta Hawks  or the
 Chicago Bulls  for a place in the NBA Finals. That series resumes
tomorrow with the teams tied at 2-2 in games.  Also tonight, the  Memphis Grizzlies  take a 2-1 lead into
their home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The winner of
the Western Conference series will play the  Dallas Mavericks ,
who yesterday swept the two-time defending champion  Los Angeles
Lakers .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
