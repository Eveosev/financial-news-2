Poland ’s WIG20 Index advanced 33.83,
or 1.2 percent, to close at 2,869.32.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB)   fell for the sixth
day, losing 1.2 zloty, or 1 percent, to 117.1 zloty as
shareholders of Poland’s only publicly traded coal producer
approved a 2010 dividend payout of 1.4 zloty a share. The motion
for a dividend payout ran counter to a March 21 recommendation
by Bogdanka’s management board not to pay a dividend for last
year.  CEZ AS (CEZ)   jumped 2.9 zloty, or 1.9 percent, to 153.1
zloty, snapping a two-day decline in Warsaw trading after the
largest Czech power producer reported first-quarter profit that
exceeded analyst estimates.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, climbed 5.1 zloty, or 2.8 percent,
to 188 zloty, rising for the first time in five days. Copper
rose before the release of figures that may show weaker
inflation in  China , the world’s biggest user of the metal.  Kruk SA (KRU PW) jumped 2.01 zloty, or 5.1 percent, to
41.71 zloty as Poland’s biggest debt-collecting company started
trading on the Warsaw bourse. The company sold 369.2 million
zloty ($135 million) of shares at 39.7 zloty each in an initial
public offering last month.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, slipped
for a second day, sliding 0.62 zloty, or 1.4 percent, to 43.99
zloty. First-quarter net income was 871 million zloty, below the
941.5 million-zloty estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
