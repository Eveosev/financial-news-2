Larry Bird  will remain with the
 Indiana Pacers  next season as president of basketball operations
after meeting with team owner Herb Simon, who said he’s pleased
with the direction of the franchise.  Bird’s contract was set to expire at the end of July. He
took over the Pacers’ basketball operations in 2003 after
coaching the team from 1997 to 2000.  The Pacers made the National Basketball Association’s
postseason for the first time in five years after finishing this
season with a 20-18 run under interim coach Frank Vogel. Indiana
went 37-45 overall and lost to the  Chicago Bulls  in the first
round of the playoffs. Vogel took over as coach when Jim O’Brien
was fired in late January.  “The past few months have been the most enjoyable since I
took over,” Bird said in a statement. “To see our young
players develop, to see us make the playoffs and then to see us
compete in a hard-fought series with  Chicago  are indications we
are headed in the right direction. It has made me even more
determined to help this team improve further and go to the next
level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
