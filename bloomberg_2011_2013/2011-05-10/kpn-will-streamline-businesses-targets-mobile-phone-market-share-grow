Royal KPN NV, the largest Dutch phone
company, will streamline its portfolio of businesses as it aims
to defend mobile-phone market share in the Netherlands and
increase its share of the German market by 2015.  The company will further integrate Getronics, the computer-
services provider it acquired in 2007, and is reviewing the
options for operations in France and  Spain , Chief Executive
Officer Eelco Blok, who took the helm last month, said in a
conference call today.  KPN, which relied on the Netherlands for almost 70 percent
of revenue in 2010, said last month it will eliminate 4,000 to
5,000 jobs in the country through 2015, after total revenue at
the Hague-based company declined in seven of the previous nine
quarters.  The  workforce reduction  will probably trim annual costs 100
million euros ($144 million) by 2012, and “this will increase
over time,” Blok said in today’s call. Shifting work to  India 
will account for 1,800 to 2,200 of the Dutch job cuts.  KPN, based in  The Hague , aims for more than 45 percent of
the Dutch mobile-phone market in 2015, measured by service
revenue, compared with the current 47 percent, it said in a
statement.  In  Germany , KPN targets market share in 2015 of more than
20 percent, up from 16 percent now, with earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization equal to 35
percent to 40 percent of sales, it said.  Simplifying Business  “We are committed to simplifying our business and
significantly improving our quality, to underpin customer
satisfaction,” Blok said in the statement.  Thorsten Dirks will become head of the Mobile International
division in addition to his current role as CEO of the German
wireless division, E-Plus.  KPN shares fell 3 percent to 10.40 euros as of 1:55 p.m. in
Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 15.9 billion
euros and bringing its decline for this year to 4.8 percent.  The targets for market share in the Dutch wireless division
and Germany are positive,  Victor Bareno , an analyst in Amsterdam
at SNS Securities, said in a note to investors. The lack of
company-level financial targets for 2015 raises questions about
KPN’s ability to sustain Ebitda and free  cash flow  and to
continue share repurchases after its current 1 billion-euro
buyback program.  The company reiterated the outlook for Ebitda of more than
5.3 billion euros this year, compared with last year’s 5.5
billion euros, and said free cash flow in 2011 should grow from
the 2.4 billion euros in 2010.  Dividends per share on 2011 profit will exceed 85 cents,
after KPN paid out 80 cents a share on 2010 profit, it said. The
payout will reach 90 cents a share for 2012 and 95 cents for
2013, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
