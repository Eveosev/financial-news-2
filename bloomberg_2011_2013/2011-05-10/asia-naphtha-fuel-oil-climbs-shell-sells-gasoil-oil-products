Asia naphtha and  fuel oil  rose for a
second day. Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold gasoil and jet fuel at
reduced premiums in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading
center.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  climbed
3.5 percent to $1,025 a metric ton, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Yesterday, prices increased 5.3 percent, the most
since Feb. 24. Benchmark 92-RON gasoline ended a four-day losing
streak, rising 3.8 percent to $128.55 a barrel.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent crude 
traded in  London , or the crack spread, rose to $159.42 a ton
from $143.56 at the end of Asian trading yesterday.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha advanced 75 cents to $16.60 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A wider reforming margin
indicates that the profit from turning naphtha into gasoline is
rising.  In  Singapore , Trafigura Beheer BV sold 25,000 tons of
naphtha for first-half July delivery to Shell at $1,028 a ton,
traders said.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur gained $1.40, or
1.1 percent, to $126.60 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.
Jet fuel rose $2.20, or 1.8 percent, to $127.90. Each product
increased for a second day.  In Singapore, Shell sold 150,000 barrels of 0.5 percent
sulfur gasoil to Total SA at 25 cents a barrel over benchmark
quotes, traders said. That’s a reduced premium from 35 cents
yesterday. Shell also sold 250,000 barrels to Hin Leong Trading
Pte at parity to quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude dropped
$1.02 to $17.75 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, was at the lowest since Feb. 28.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil climbed 20 cents to $1.35 a
barrel, the highest in four days, PVM said. A widening regrade
means it’s more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Shell sold 100,000 barrels of jet fuel to Hin Leong at 5
cents a barrel over quotes, traders said. Hin Leong yesterday
paid a premium of 10 cents.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose $10.25, or 1.6
percent, to $651.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The
price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel,
climbed $10.75, or 1.7 percent, to $642.50. Each variety
advanced for a second day.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened for the first
time in seven days, to $7.27 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data.
Yesterday, refiners’ losses from turning oil into residual
products were the least since March 16.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 50 cents to $9.25 a ton, Bloomberg data showed.
This viscosity spread is at the narrowest since April 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
