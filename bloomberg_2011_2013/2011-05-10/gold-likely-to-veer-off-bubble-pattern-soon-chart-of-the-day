Gold is due to depart from “the
classic bubble pattern” that the precious metal has followed
since 2002, according to Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market
strategist at LPL Financial Corp.  The CHART OF THE DAY illustrates the pattern by comparing
gold’s advance during this period with earlier surges in oil,
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Homebuilding Index and the Nasdaq
Composite Index, as Kleintop did yesterday in a report.  Assuming that gold kept following these precedents, the
price would peak early next year at about $2,600 to $3,200 an
ounce, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s about
double the closing price of $1,503.20 an ounce in New York
trading yesterday.  “We do not believe gold is in a bubble,” in part because
a falling dollar has contributed to the metal’s gains, Kleintop
wrote. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the U.S. currency’s value
against six major counterparts, tumbled 36 percent from the end
of 2001 through yesterday. Gold futures surged fivefold during
the same period.  Growing demand from China and  India , purchases by central
banks in  Mexico ,  Russia  and  Thailand  this year, and declining
production also indicate that gold may avoid a boom-and-bust
scenario, the report said.  “While gold’s popularity is returning, it does not seem
‘over-owned,’” Kleintop wrote. He cited data showing that the
value of gold mined since 1900 is equivalent to 3.9 percent of
the market value of stocks, bonds and cash worldwide, below the
12.1 percent reading in 1980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
