Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  reiterated that the re-elected Conservative government
will eliminate the countryâ€™s deficit in the fiscal year that
begins in April 2014.  Speaking at the Bloomberg Canada Economic Summit, Flaherty
said the government would re-introduce the budget that was
rejected by opposition parties before the May 2 election that
gave Prime Minister Stephen Harper a majority in the House of
Commons, according to his prepared text. The move to balance
budgets will help keep taxes low, he said.  Consumer confidence  has improved significantly from 2008,
Flaherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
