Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the world’s biggest
theme-park operator, said second-quarter profit fell 1.2
percent, missing estimates, as a shrinking box-office, a park
shortfall and the Japanese tsunami overshadowed gains in TV.  Net income decreased to $942 million, or 49 cents a share,
in the quarter ended April 2, from $953 million, or 48 cents, a
year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a
statement. Profit missed the 58-cent average of 14 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit at Disney’s theme-park unit, which collects
licensing revenue from the resort in  Tokyo , fell by 3.3 percent
following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. U.S. parks were
hurt by this year’s later Easter break. The Disney film studio
failed to match last year’s results from “Alice in
Wonderland,” with income down 65 percent.  “The noisy elements, the studio and  Japan , clearly were
the problem and they are hard to predict,” said  Matthew
Harrigan , a Wunderlich Securities analyst in Denver who
recommends investors buy Disney shares. “The good news is that
the core of this company, ESPN and its TV business, still
performed very well.”  Advance bookings at Disney parks are down 2.5 percent from
a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a
conference call.  Room rates have increased by a double-digit percentage,
reflecting Disney’s decision to phase out discounts as the
economy improves, Rasulo said. Excluding the impact of the
timing of the Easter holiday, domestic theme park attendance
increased by 2 percent from a year earlier, he said.  ‘Mars Needs Moms’  Disney fell $1.23, or 2.8 percent, to $42.68 in extended
trading. The shares rose 81 cents to $43.91 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and have added 17 percent
this year.  The March 11 release “Mars Needs Moms” weighed on the
studio. The film cost $150 million to make and generated $20.9
million in U.S. ticket sales, according to Harrigan. Last year,
DVD sales benefited from Pixar’s film “Up.”  Disney’s total sales rose 5.8 percent to $9.08 billion,
trailing the $9.19 billion average of 20 analysts’ estimates.
Revenue was $8.58 billion a year earlier.  “Our revenue was up nicely but we had $170 million of
factors, basically, that had an impact on where we were and
where the Street thought we would be in terms of our earnings,”
Robert Iger, Disney’s president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview on CNBC.  Network Revenue  Revenue at Disney’s media networks increased 12 percent to
$4.32 billion, buoyed by advertising and affiliate revenue at
cable networks such as ESPN. Profit rose 17 percent to $1.52
billion, with cable earnings up 15 percent.  ABC broadcasting posted a 4.5 percent increase in revenue
to $1.5 billion on advertising growth and higher affiliate fees.
Profit gained 36 percent to $167 million.  Profit in consumer products increased 6.8 percent to $142
million as sales expanded 5 percent to $626 million.  Disney’s Interactive unit saw its loss more than double to
$115 million on a 2.6 percent gain in revenue. Results included
a $34 million cost linked to how the company accounts for the
purchase of Playdom, Iger said.  The company will continue to take charges for the 2010
acquisition of the social game startup.  “That was unexpected and we’d like to hear more about
that,” said Robin Diedrich, an analyst with St. Louis-based
Edward Jones & Co., who recommends investors buy Disney. “But
it’s a small segment of the company. The main segments --
advertising and its parks -- are doing well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
