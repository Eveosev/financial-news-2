The best value in the U.S. equity
market today resides in assets about which investors are
unenthusiastic, that have no price momentum and are cheap,
according to  Bill Miller , the chief investment officer of Legg
Mason Capital Management Inc.  Writing in the Financial Times, he said three areas stand
out: financials, technology and health care, all of which are in
the bottom tenth of their historical valuation ranges, having
been more expensive 90 percent of the time in the past 60 years.  The  Federal Reserve  is likely to end its quantitative
easing program this summer, so the subconscious, reflexive view
that Fed policy means higher commodities and a lower dollar will
be weakened, Miller said.  Now is a good time to buy what’s on sale and a bad time to
buy what’s been marked up, he concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
