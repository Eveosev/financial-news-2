CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  had a flange fire at
a reformer at its Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery, that will shut
the unit for several days.  The fire will “probably trim rates for the next several
days,” CVR Chief Executive John Lipinski said on a conference
call today. One employee received minor injuries in a fall
during the incident.  The incident won’t significantly reduce second-quarter
throughput at the plant, he said. Lipinski said he had just been
informed of the incident before the call. Coffeyville has a
capacity of about 120,000 barrels a day.  The refinery will continue to run and can receive hydrogen
from CVR’s nearby fertilizer plant, Lipinski said. The fire was
allowed to burn itself out, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
