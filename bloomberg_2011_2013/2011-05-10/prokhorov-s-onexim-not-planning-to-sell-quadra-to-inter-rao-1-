Billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s
Onexim Group has no plans at present to sell its controlling
stake in the OAO Quadra power generator to  Russia ’s OAO Inter
RAO UES, said Onexim Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Razumov.  “Onexim received a proposal on the sale from an investment
bank and is considering the idea theoretically,” Razumov said
today by phone in Moscow. “We don’t see any sense in such a
deal at present.”  Razumov was responding to a report in the Vedomosti
newspaper that Onexim is seeking to sell its stake in the power
generator, which was formerly known as TGK-4.  Onexim is willing to consider good terms for divesting its
stake in Quadra, as it would for any assets, Razumov said.  Inter RAO is interested in all generation assets being
offered, including Quadra, and is considering various proposals,
the state-run utility’s press service said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
