The European Union can meet its
emissions targets using a mix of natural gas, offshore wind and
 carbon capture  technology, according to  Statoil ASA. (STL)   “A combination of natural gas, offshore wind and, in the
long term, carbon capture and storage at gas-fired plants can
allow Europe to meet its environmental emissions targets quickly
and affordably,” Rune Bjoernson, vice president of natural gas
at Statoil, said today at the Flame conference in Amsterdam.  There’s a danger that the EU “could decide on a dogmatic,
rigid and unnecessarily costly way to reach the overall climate
targets,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
