OAO  AvtoVAZ (AVAZ)  gained to its highest in
over a week after the Russian carmaker returned to profit last
year as the government encouraged new car sales with a rebate
program.  The stock advanced 2.7 percent to 27.034 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest level since April 29.  Net income was 3.6 billion rubles ($129.7 million) after a
loss of 49.2 billion rubles in 2009, AvtoVAZ,  Russia â€™s biggest
automaker, said today in an e-mailed statement. Revenue climbed
more than 57 percent to 137.6 billion rubles, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
