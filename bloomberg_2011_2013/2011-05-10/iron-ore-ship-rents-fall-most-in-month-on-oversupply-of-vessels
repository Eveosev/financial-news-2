Rents for capesize ships that haul
 iron ore  fell the most in a month on excess vessel supplies.  Hire rates fell 5.4 percent to $6,359 today, data from the
 Baltic Exchange  in  London  show. That’s the biggest decline since
April 8 and leaves rates 86 percent lower than a year ago. The
fleet’s carrying capacity will grow 16 percent this year,
Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker, estimates. Demand to haul
iron ore, their primary cargo, will expand 7 percent, it says.  “The cape market looks oversupplied with few fresh cargoes
seen yesterday getting a lot of attention from owners,” Wilhelm
Gedde-Dahl, an analyst with Pareto Securities AS in Oslo, wrote
in a note today. The market is “somewhat more balanced” for
owners of smaller panamax ships that compete for iron ore and
coal cargoes and also carry grains, Gedde-Dahl said.  Companies ordered too many ships in 2007 and 2008, when the
Baltic Dry index, a measure of commodity shipping costs,
averaged 6,730 points. The gauge today fell 0.3 percent to 1,344
points today, the first drop since April 26.  Daily rents for supramax ships, used to carry Indian iron
ore to  China , gained 0.4 percent to $14,666. Panamaxes, the
second-biggest tracked by the index after capesizes, gained 1.3
percent to $14,641 and handysizes fell 0.2 percent to $11,721.  -- Editors: Claudia Carpenter, Sharon Lindores  To contact the reporter on this story:
