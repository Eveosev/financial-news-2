G4S Plc (GFS) , the security provider for
 London ’s 2012 Olympic Games, said first-quarter sales rose 4.7
percent at constant exchange rates, led by gains in emerging
markets.  Sales increased 3.8 percent at actual exchange rates, the
Crawley, England-based company said in a statement today. Profit
was above last year’s levels, while overall margins were
“slightly lower” as cash-transportation volume dropped in
developed markets, G4S said.  G4S, the world’s biggest security company, is seeking more
business in emerging markets, where the economy is growing
faster than in developed ones. India and Saudi Arabia sales
gained by 10 percent or more, Chief Executive Officer Nick Buckles said in a telephone interview.  “In Egypt, we gained quite a bit of one-off business” as
unrest led to a change in government, Buckles said. Half the
Saudi business is managing facilities such as universities, he
said. G4S doesn’t have significant operations in Tunisia or
 Libya , he said.  Buckles said G4S expects to generate 100 million pounds
($164 million) to 130 million pounds from next year’s London
Olympics and Paralympics contract. The company hopes profit will
be similar to its usual 7 percent group operating margin, he
said.  In  Greece , sales have dropped about 15 percent in the
country’s economic crisis, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
