Greek government bonds rose after
Athens-based newspaper Kathimerini reported that the
 International Monetary Fund  is arranging an aid package to
replace Greece’s existing bailout program.  The 10-year bond yield fell 42 basis points to 15.29
percent and the two-year note yield dropped 71 basis points to
24.90 percent as of 8:59 a.m. in  London .  The IMF is arranging an 80 billion-euro ($115 billion) to
100 billion-euro package including additional cash to cover
Greece’s funding needs through 2013, Kathimerini reported,
without saying how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
