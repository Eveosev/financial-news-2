The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
will seek comment on a measure that would govern banks’ off-
exchange foreign currency transactions with retail customers,
part of the agency’s rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act.  FDIC board members voted 5-0 at a meeting in  Washington 
today to seek comment on the proposal, which would impose
requirements for foreign currency futures and options that would
be prohibited as of July 16 in the absence of a rule. The FDIC
proposal would cover retail transactions involving individuals
with $10 million or less to invest, the agency said.  “These are retail customers who don’t meet a sophisticated
investor standard,” FDIC Vice Chairman Martin Gruenberg said at
the meeting.  The measure wouldn’t apply to foreign currency forwards or
spot transactions that banks engage in with business customers
to hedge foreign exchange risk, according to the FDIC’s notice
of proposed rulemaking.  Today’s vote by the FDIC board approves sending the measure
out for public comment for 30 days after its publication in the
Federal Register.  To contact the reporter on this story:
