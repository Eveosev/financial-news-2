Colombian coffee growers, the world’s
second-largest producers of arabica beans, are able to ship
their product to port despite rainstorms,  Colombia ’s National
Association of Coffee Exporters said.   Main roadways to ports used for coffee shipments are open,
said Jorge Botero, executive president of the group, in a
telephone interview today in Bogota.  The geographic diversity of farms across the nation has
helped to avert widespread transport stoppages, he said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
