Telefonica O2 Czech Republic AS (SPTT) , the
largest Czech telecommunications company, may say first-quarter
profit fell as customers cut spending on fixed-line calls and
the Telefonica SA unit cut prices for mobile services to offset
increased competition.  Net income probably dropped to 1.8 billion koruna ($107
million) from 2.01 billion koruna a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg survey of six analysts. Revenue likely slid 5.7
percent to 13.03 billion koruna.  Telefonica O2 plans to deploy a new optic network and start
rolling out LTE, or long-term evolution, to offset declining
revenue from traditional fixed-line calls and cater to increased
data usage from television and movie websites.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
