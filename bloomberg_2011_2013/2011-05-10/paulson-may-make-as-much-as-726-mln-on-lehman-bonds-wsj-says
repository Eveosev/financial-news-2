Paulson & Co., a U.S. hedge fund firm
run by John Paulson, may make a profit of $350 million to $726
million on debt of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  that it bought
at greatly discounted prices during the past two and a half
years, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The newspaper said those figures are based on plans being
looked at by a federal  bankruptcy court  in New York and its own
analysis of investment disclosures related to the case.  Paulsonâ€™s fund bought more than $7 billion worth of Lehman
bonds at an average price of 13 cents on the dollar, the Journal
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
