For the 25 percent of Americans who
don’t have credit or debit cards, a startup called  PayNearMe
Inc.  wants to make paying utility bills or transferring money as
easy as buying a Slurpee at 7-Eleven.  PayNearMe, based in  Mountain View , California, announced a
partnership today with 7-Eleven and  Ria Financial Services  to
let consumers pay bills and wire funds using cash -- with lower
fees than those of money orders and  Western Union Co. (WU)  transfers.  U.S. consumers used cash to make about $1.2 trillion in
purchases last year, according to research firm Aite Group.
Still, Americans without bank cards face hassles trying to pay
bills, shop online or make travel reservations. PayNearMe’s
technology can be used to buy everything from bus and concert
tickets to books on  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  by walking into the nearest
7-Eleven store.  “The ‘underbanked’ is a giant underserved market,” Danny Shader, who founded PayNearMe in 2009 after selling his previous
companies to Motorola Inc. and Amazon.com, told Bloomberg
Businessweek.com. “We’re making it better, faster and cheaper
for them to transact.”  Amazon.com is already working with PayNearMe, and the
startup announced partnerships today with travel company
Greyhound Lines Inc. and  Sochitel UK Ltd. , which lets consumers
add minutes to prepaid phone plans.  Name Change  Shader started the company with the name Kwedit Inc.,
aiming to help players of Facebook Inc. games buy virtual
currency with cash by printing out a receipt and taking it to 7-
Eleven. He soon discovered that there was greater demand from
more traditional offline merchants.  He changed the name to PayNearMe last year and has been
working with 7-Eleven to attract industries such as
entertainment and financial services. The convenience-store
chain offers the service in almost 6,200 U.S. locations.
PayNearMe is no longer working with Facebook.  Khosla Ventures  led a $16 million investment in PayNearMe
in November, in part to help the company expand its roster of
merchants. Other investors include August Capital, True Ventures
and Lotus Development Corp. founder Mitch Kapor.  “There isn’t a company on this planet that wouldn’t
appreciate 25 percent more market,” said David Hornik, a
partner at August Capital in  Menlo Park ,  California , who’s been
investing in payment startups for a decade. “The big
opportunity is to enable a set of transactions that nobody else
has enabled.”  Large Volumes  For the business to work, it will have to process hundreds
of millions -- if not billions -- of dollars in transactions a
year, because PayNearMe only takes a small cut of each, Shader
said. The amount varies by type of product and customer.
Sometimes the cost is absorbed by the merchant and other times
by the consumer, said Shader, who didn’t provide specifics.  The costs consumers pay to send bills and wire money using
PayNearMe is cheaper than the expense for money orders or
transfers through Western Union, he said. Ria Financial, a unit
of Leawood, Kansas-based  Euronet Worldwide Inc. (EEFT) , will handle the
money transfer and bill payment services for PayNearMe.  PayNearMe faces competition from Green Dot Corp. and
 Netspend Holdings Inc. (NTSP) , which provide reloadable prepaid cards
that consumers can purchase in supermarkets and convenience
stores. Both companies held initial public offerings last year.  Logo on Bill  Shader says the ability to pay bills is the biggest
advantage to PayNearMe. Some 3,000 billers have signed up to use
the system, he said. The bills will have a 7-Eleven logo on the
bottom next to a barcode with directions on how to pay with
cash. Customers can take the bill to a store, have the checker
scan the barcode and then make the payment. The money is
automatically remitted to the biller through the payment network
that PayNearMe built.  The same is true for buying merchandise online from
Amazon.com or bus tickets from Greyhound. Rather than going to
the local station, waiting in line and risking the bus being
overbooked, travelers can book a trip online, print a PayNearMe
slip and take it to 7-Eleven, where they pay in cash and use the
receipt as the bus ticket.  “PayNearMe will ultimately enable us to add thousands of
ticketing locations, so that our customers can easily get
tickets any time of day,” Dave Leach, chief executive officer
of Dallas-based Greyhound, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
