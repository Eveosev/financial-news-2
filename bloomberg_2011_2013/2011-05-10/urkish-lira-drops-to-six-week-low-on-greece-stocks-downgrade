The Turkish lira dropped to the
lowest in six weeks as foreigners sold stocks on a Citigroup
downgrade and neighboring  Greece  struggled to repay its debt.  The lira declined 1.1 percent to 1.5640 per dollar at 5:50
p.m. in Istanbul, the weakest since March 29. The main ISE
National 100 share index lost 1 percent to 67,260.00. Yields on
benchmark two-year bonds increased 10 basis points to 8.44
percent.  “There’s been profit-taking in emerging markets in general
because of Greece and other currencies have fallen,” Turgut Keles, chief of local market trading at West LB in Istanbul,
said by telephone. “Recent underweight recommendations are also
affecting things.”  Greece sold 26-week bills today to yield 4.88 percent, up
from 4.8 percent at a previous auction on April 12.  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the country’s sovereign-debt rating two notches to B
yesterday, citing the increased likelihood that it may need to
carry out some type of restructuring to avoid defaulting on the
euro-region’s biggest debt burden.  Citigroup Inc. cut Turkish stocks to “underweight” from
“neutral” yesterday, saying the country’s “economic
vulnerability remains very high” because of the current-account
deficit and the central bank’s “unorthodox policy” of cutting
rates and raising banks’ reserve requirements. Investors should
invest in Russian stocks instead, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
