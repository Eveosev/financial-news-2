Gold rose on concern that  Europe ’s
debt crisis will drive the euro lower, spurring demand for
precious metals as alternative assets. Silver had the biggest
two-day rally in six months after plunging 27 percent last week.  Standard & Poor’s yesterday downgraded Greece’s credit
rating for the fourth time since April 2010, signaling that the
region’s debt crisis is escalating. Gold advanced for the third
straight session.  “Economic uncertainties in the monetary union and fears
over peripheral debt were returning to the focus yet again,”
Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital in London, said in
a report. “In the short run, bullion is likely to remain well-
supported, also helped by physical activity picking up in  Asia 
amid seasonal demand.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $13.70, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at $1,516.90 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The price has climbed 2.4 percent in three days after
tumbling 4.9 percent from May 3 to May 5. The metal reached a
record $1,577.40 on May 2.  S&P lowered Greece’s credit rating to B from BB-, saying
that further reductions are possible. Another cut would make
Greece the lowest-rated nation in Europe.  “Given the regional issues still facing the global
economy, which include sovereign debt, massive budget deficits,
raised geopolitical unrest, currency debasement and inflation,
gold is likely to remain sought after by a wide range of
investors,” analysts at ScotiaMoccatta said in a report.  Gold may reach $2,000 by January, Hal Lehr, Deutsche Bank
AG’s managing director for cross-commodity trading, said in an
interview in  Buenos Aires .  Silver Rebounds  Silver futures for July delivery rose $1.37, or 3.7
percent, to $38.486 an ounce, bringing the two-day rally to 9.1
percent, the most since early November.  Last week’s plunge followed an 84 percent increase in
margin costs announced by  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the Comex owner, over
two weeks. The metal reached a 31-year high of $49.845 on April
25.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $3.65, or 0.5
percent, to $732.65 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery gained $5.80, or 0.3
percent, to $1,800.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
