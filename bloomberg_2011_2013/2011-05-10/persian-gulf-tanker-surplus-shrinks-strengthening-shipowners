A surplus of supertankers competing
to haul Middle East crude oil shrank, bolstering shipowners’
chances of securing better charters for loadings from the
world’s largest export region.  There are 13 percent more very large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, than there are likely cargoes over the next 30 days,
according to the median estimate from six shipbrokers and two
owners surveyed by Bloomberg News today. The excess was 23
percent last week.  While vessel supply appears “slightly tighter” as some
owners delay their ships’ return to the  Persian Gulf  by cutting
speeds, there is still “ample tonnage” for oil companies to
choose from, said Halvor Ellefsen, a shipbroker at SeaLeague A/S
in Oslo.  Returns from VLCCs on the industry’s benchmark  Saudi Arabia 
to Japan route jumped more than sevenfold yesterday to $4,585 a
day after fuel costs plunged, according to the Baltic Exchange
in  London . That’s still below the $12,777 that London-based
Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd. estimates owners need to pay
crew, insurance repairs and other running costs for VLCCs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
