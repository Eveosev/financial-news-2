Alan Faneca, a Pro Bowl guard who
played for the Pittsburgh Steelers,  New York Jets  and Arizona
Cardinals, retired from the  National Football League  after 13
seasons, saying it’s “time to move on to the next chapter.”  Faneca, 34, missed only two games since being drafted by
the Steelers in the first round of the 1998 NFL draft. He’d
started 144 straight games dating back to the 2002 season, the
third-longest active streak for any offensive lineman.  “I can’t wait to spend more time with my family,” Faneca
said in a statement received by the  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette .
“Playing in this league for as long as I did takes sacrifice,
not only by me, but by each of them.”  Faneca spent his first 10 seasons with the Steelers, making
seven Pro Bowl appearances and winning a  Super Bowl  after the
2005 campaign. He was a Pro Bowl selection with the Jets in 2008
and 2009 and spent last season in Arizona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
