     May 10 (Bloomberg) -- Capcom Co., a video-game developer
and amusement-center operator, surged the most in eight weeks in
Tokyo trading amid speculation it will direct cost savings to
its expansion into faster-growing online and social games.  Capcom gained as much as 6.5 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since March 16, and traded 4.5 percent higher at 1,662 yen
as of the 11 a.m. break on the Tokyo stock exchange. The
benchmark Topix index fell 0.2 percent.  The Osaka-based publisher of “Monster Hunter” is likely
to post cost savings of 2 billion yen ($25 million) this fiscal
year, said Hirotoshi Murakami, an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co., citing the company. The increased
focus on social and online games generated 10 billion yen in
sales in the two areas the past fiscal year, Murakami said.  “It is a good sign to see highly profitable operations
have been expanding,” Murakami said.  Capcom’s full-year profit jumped 258 percent from a year
earlier to 7.75 billion yen, the company said May 6. Net income
in this fiscal year will probably fall 9.7 percent, according to
the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
