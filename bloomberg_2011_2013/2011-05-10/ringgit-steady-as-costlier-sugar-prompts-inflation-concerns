Malaysia ’s ringgit was little changed
after the government raised sugar prices, adding to concern that
accelerating inflation will slow spending and curb the nation’s
economic growth.  Malaysia’s government raised sugar prices today for a
fourth time since January 2010 to trim its annual subsidies, the
Star newspaper reported. The currency weakened 1.4 percent last
week as Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating and China
sought to rebuff U.S. pressure for faster yuan appreciation.  “The market is worried that slowing spending will hurt
growth, given the fact that the economy is relying more on
domestic consumption and less on exports,” said Godwin Chan, a
currency trader at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .
“External factors like the lingering Greece crisis could
inflict more pain” to risky asset markets, he said.  The ringgit traded at 2.9870 per dollar as of 9:24 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, compared with 2.9876 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 2.9598 on May 2, the strongest
level since September 1997. The currency may trade between 2.99
and 3 per dollar today, Chan said.  Consumer prices in Malaysia rose 3 percent in March from a
year earlier, the most since April 2009. Bank Negara Malaysia
raised its overnight policy rate to 3 percent from 2.75 percent
on May 5, saying prices will face upward pressure in the second
half.  China ’s exchange-rate reform has been “robust” from the
perspective of trade, Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said at an
annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue in  Washington  yesterday,
referring to declines in China’s total trade surplus over the
last three years and signaling a view that the yuan’s rise
should not proceed any faster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
