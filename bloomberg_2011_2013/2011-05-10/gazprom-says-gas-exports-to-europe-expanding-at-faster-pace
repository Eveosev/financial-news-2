OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export
monopoly, said shipments to Europe are expanding at an
increasing pace as demand recovers.  Gas exports jumped 20.5 percent in April from a year
earlier, compared with 12 percent growth in the first quarter,
Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  said today. Annual growth
in the first 10 days of May accelerated to 28 percent, he said.  “It’s May now, but Gazprom’s export volumes are about the
same as winter levels,” Miller said in an e-mailed statement.
“Requests for today are at almost 500 million cubic meters.”  The Moscow-based producer, which meets about a quarter of
European gas demand, benefited from the unrest in  Libya  and
 Japan ’s nuclear crisis.  Brent crude  has climbed 45 percent in
the year, meaning Gazprom’s prices, which are tied to oil and
refined products with a lag of up to nine months, may continue
to rise this year.  Gazprom expects its gas prices for  Europe  to reach to $500
per 1,000 cubic meters in December, Miller said last month. The
average European price was $346 in the first quarter.  “We can say demand growth for Gazprom’s gas is becoming a
steady trend in 2011,” Miller said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
