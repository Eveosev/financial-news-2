U.S. Gulf oil grades gained as the
spread between the U.S. benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate and
Brent widened for the third consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased 47 cents to $13.83 a barrel at 2:36 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 40 cents to
$14.90 a barrel at 2:24 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 85
cents to $16.25 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 90 cents to $8.40 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium strengthened 95 cents to $8.60.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained $1.05 to $13.75 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium strengthened $1.20 to
$6.60 a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained $1.65 to $14.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 20 cents to
$17.55 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
