Ugandan police arrested the leader of
the opposition Democratic Party today after he attempted to hold
a rally in the central business district of the capital,
Kampala, in defiance of the force’s ban, his party said.  Norbert Mao was arrested with two other opposition
politicians as he approached the designated venue for the rally,
Paul Kenneth Kakande, the party’s deputy spokesman, said by
phone from Kampala. He is detained at a police station in the
capital, he said.  “He was arrested by the police who said the rally was an
illegal assembly,” he said. “Police used tear gas to disperse
people who were going for the rally.” The gathering was to be
addressed by leaders from different opposition groups on the
prevailing economic conditions in the country, said Kakande.  Police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba didn’t answer her phone
when Bloomberg sought comment, while her deputy Vincent Ssekate
said he didn’t have any details.  Uganda opposition groups have for the last month
participated in twice-weekly so-called “walk-to-work” protests
against rising inflation in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
