The yen maintained losses against
most of its major counterparts as signs the global economic
recovery is picking up supported stocks and commodities, damping
demand for  Japan ’s currency as a refuge.  The dollar snapped a two-day loss against the euro before
data forecast to show initial jobless claims dropped and retail
sales rose. The Australian dollar pared gains after  China  said
today that inflation surpassed its target level for a fourth
month, spurring expectations the nation will take more measures
to cool growth.  South Korea ’s won surged after a report showed
the nation’s unemployment rate fell to a three-month low.  “The data are showing the global economy is looking very
strong,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP
Australia Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest interdealer broker.
“Against this backdrop, safe-haven currencies such as the yen
and the Swiss franc are likely to be sold.”  The yen was at 116.44 per euro as of 6:40 a.m. in  London 
from 116.54 in  New York  yesterday, when it fell 1 percent. The
dollar was little changed at 80.91 yen after touching 81.09, the
highest since May 4. The greenback was at $1.4392 per euro from
$1.4409. It rose to $1.4255 per euro on May 9, the strongest
since April 19. The Swiss franc was little changed at 87.98
centimes per dollar after falling 0.9 percent yesterday.  Stocks, Commodities  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares rose 0.6
percent today. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials climbed 1.3 percent yesterday after losing 9 percent
last week in the biggest drop since December 2008.  Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits declined by
44,000 to 430,000 last week, and sales at retailers advanced 0.6
percent in April, according to Bloomberg News surveys of
economists before data due tomorrow. Treasury 10-year yields
rose six basis points to 3.21 percent yesterday. They were
little changed today.  “U.S. yields have rebounded in a risk-on mode, with stocks
and commodities rising,” said  Koji Fukaya , chief currency
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in  Tokyo . “The dollar is
bound to climb against the yen.”  The dollar is down 5.3 percent this year in a measure of
the currencies of 10 developed nations, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The yen has lost 5.1
percent, while the euro has gained 2.6 percent.  China’s Inflation  China’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a
year earlier after gaining 5.4 percent in March, the National
Bureau of Statistics said, showing that inflation had exceeded
Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s 4 percent target each month this year.
Separate reports showed China’s industrial production advanced
13.4 percent last month and retail sales grew 17.1 percent.  “Today’s data suggests China’s authorities have more
policy tightening to do and we think some of that will come
through exchange-rate appreciation,” said Grant Turley, a
senior currency strategist at  Australia  & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. in Sydney. “This isn’t going to weigh too heavily on
Aussie and the currency tends to appreciate in line with the
yuan as well.”  The Australian dollar was at $1.0861 from $1.0837 after
rising as much as 0.3 percent. It fetched 87.85 yen from 87.66,
after reaching 88.01 earlier. China is the biggest buyer of
Australia’s raw materials exports.  The won surged 0.8 percent to 1,074.80 as South Korea’s
jobless rate fell to 3.6 percent in April from 4 percent in
March, Statistics Korea said today. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 12 economists was for a rate of 3.8 percent.  Taiwan ’s Dollar  Taiwan’s dollar touched a 13-year high on optimism China’s
pledge to increase demand will benefit the island’s exports.  The local dollar gained for a third day after global funds
bought $173 million more local stocks than they sold yesterday,
according to exchange data. China said yesterday it will seek to
boost  consumer spending  and increase imports, according to a
statement released following the annual Strategic and Economic
Dialogue with U.S. officials.  “ Asia  will benefit if China imports more and the regional
currencies will rise if the Chinese government accelerates
appreciation,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency
trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan. Breaking through NT$28.50 is
“a big psychological level,” he said.  Taiwan’s currency advanced 0.7 percent to NT$28.523 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$28.495 earlier, the strongest level since October 1997.  To contact the reporters on this story:
