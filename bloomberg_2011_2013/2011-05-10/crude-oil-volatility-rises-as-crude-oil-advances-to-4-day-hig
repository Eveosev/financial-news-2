Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures sank below $100 and gasoline tumbled the most
in more than two years after an Energy Department report showed
that U.S. supplies surged and fuel demand slipped.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 38.5 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 35.7 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for June delivery fell $5.67 to settle at $98.21
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
June $95 puts, with 5,459 lots changing hands. They rose $1.02
to $1.23 a barrel. June $90 puts, the next-most active option,
gained 34 cents to 41 cents a barrel with 4,097 lots trading.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
