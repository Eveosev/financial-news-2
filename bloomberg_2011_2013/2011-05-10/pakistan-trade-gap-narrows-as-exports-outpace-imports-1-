Pakistan ’s trade deficit narrowed for
the fourth straight month in April as overseas shipments grew at
a faster rate than imports.  The trade gap narrowed 33.8 percent to $870 million in the
tenth month of the country’s financial year ending June 30, from
$1.3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to a
statement posted on the  website  of the Islamabad-based  Federal
Bureau of Statistics . Overseas sales rose 39.7 percent to $2.4
billion, while imports increased 7.7 percent to $3.2 billion.  Pakistan is seeking to boost exports to sustain growth in a
country where the  World Bank  estimates a quarter of the
population lives on less than a dollar a day.  Export growth in April was slower than the 41 percent in
March, and import growth was higher than the 3.95 percent
increase in the previous month.  The  trade gap  narrowed 1.9 percent to $12.2 billion in the
10 months ended April 30, according to the statement. Exports
rose 27.8 percent to $20.2 billion, while imports rose 14.7
percent to $32.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
