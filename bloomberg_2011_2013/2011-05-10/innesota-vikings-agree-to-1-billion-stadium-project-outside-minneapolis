The  Minnesota Vikings  have
agreed to help fund a proposed $1 billion, retractable-roof
stadium project in Ramsey County’s Arden Hills, the latest
attempt by the National Football League team to get a new
home after the Metrodome’s roof collapsed last season.  The Vikings would commit $407 million to the project,
or about 39 percent of the total cost, the team said
yesterday in a news release. The team didn’t say how the
remainder of the stadium would be financed.  “Reaching an agreement with Ramsey County as our
local partner is a major milestone in our efforts to
finalize a long-term stadium solution,” Vikings owner Zygi Wilf said in the release.  While the team appreciates other proposals made by
 Minneapolis  and Hennepin County, “We believe the Ramsey
County site offers the most benefits to our fans, the team
and the state and is the ideal site for a new stadium,”
Wilf said.  The 260-acre site of the former Twin Cities Army
Ammunitions Plant is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from
Minneapolis and  St. Paul , the release said.  The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which
owns the Metrodome, said in February it will spend about
$18.1 million to replace the stadium’s damaged roof before
the start of the 2011 football season.  The roof, which comprises 10 acres of Teflon-coated
fiberglass, collapsed Dec. 12 under the weight of 17 inches
(43 centimeters) of snow, forcing the Vikings to relocate
their final two home games of the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
