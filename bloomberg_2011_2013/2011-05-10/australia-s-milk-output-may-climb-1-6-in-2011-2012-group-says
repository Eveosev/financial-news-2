Milk production in  Australia , the
world’s second-largest dairy exporter, may rise next season amid
favorable weather conditions in the nation’s east and lower feed
costs, according to an industry group.  Output in the year to June 30, 2012, may increase 1.6
percent to 9.25 billion liters, according to a report from  Dairy
Australia  today. Production may increase less than 1 percent to
9.1 billion liters this year amid flooding and cyclones in
Australia’s north, the report said.  Australia exports about 45 percent of its milk, mostly in
the form of cheese, butter and powder, according to Melbourne-
based Dairy Australia. Demand for dairy products across  Asia  has
been increasing, led by sales in  China , as higher incomes boost
consumption, Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. said last month.  “There may be some further upside in this forecast, should
seasonal conditions continue to be favorable in most regions,”
the group said. “Southern regions should post strongest growth,
while some further contraction can be expected in northern
regions,” the report said.  All regions except  Western Australia  will benefit from wet
conditions and lower feed costs in the season from July 1, 2011,
according to the report. Australia’s  Bureau of Meteorology 
last month forecast a 60 percent to 75 percent chance of a
wetter-than-normal period from May to July in eastern regions.  Milk production in the 2013-2014 season may be between 9.2
billion liters and 9.5 billion liters, according to the report.  Fonterra, the world’s largest shipper of dairy products,
exported a record volume in March on emerging-markets demand,
according to statement from the Auckland, New-Zealand based
group on April 27.  To contact the reporter for this story:
