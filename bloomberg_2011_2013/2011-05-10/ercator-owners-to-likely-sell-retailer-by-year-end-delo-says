Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. and other
owners of  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. will probably organize
another sale of the Slovenian retailer by the end of the year,
Delo newspaper  reported , citing Finance Minister  Franc Krizanic .  “Owners should also bear in mind that Mercator is an
important network company that a lot of agriculture and food
companies in Slovenia depend on,” Krizanic was quoted as saying
by the Slovenian newspaper.  Krizanic said a “hostile takeover” of Mercator would
threaten loans of some companies and would increase interest
rates. He suggested Mercator be bought by a “strong and
strategic” company, according to Delo.  Pivovarna Lasko on May 4 rejected an offer for a 23 percent
stake in Ljubljana-based Mercator by its Croatian rival Agrokor
d.d. The decision followed a move by the competition protection
office which forbid Lasko to freely dispose of Mercator shares
on the grounds of possible “high concentration” in the retail
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
