Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan
set up commission of inquiry into violence in seven northern
states that killed more than 600 people following the April 16
presidential election,  Vanguard  reported.  At least 75,000 people were forced to flee their homes as a
result of the violence, the National Emergency Management Agency
said on April 28. About 55,000 of them are in camps for the
displaced, while the remaining 20,000 have been taken in by
family members or friends, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
