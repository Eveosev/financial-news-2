Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
Inc. (HOT) , owner of the  St. Regis  and W brands, sold the W Chicago -
City Center to  Chesapeake Lodging Trust (CHSP)  for $128.8 million, or
$350,000 per room.  Starwood, based in White Plains, New York, will continue to
operate the hotel and signed a 40-year management agreement, the
company said in a statement today.  Starwood, whose brands also include Westin and Sheraton,
has been selling assets to focus on management. The company last
year sold two of its W properties in Manhattan and the luxury
St. Regis hotel in Aspen, Colorado.  “We continue to look for opportunities to sell high-
quality assets like W Chicago - City Center as we complete our
transition to an ‘asset light’ hospitality company,” Frits van Paasschen, president and chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  The W  Chicago  - City Center is in the city’s financial
district. Room rates for the week of May 9 started at $345,
according to the  hotel website .  Chesapeake, based in Annapolis, Maryland, said the hotel’s
revenue per available room increased 19 percent in the first
four months of the year from the same period in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
