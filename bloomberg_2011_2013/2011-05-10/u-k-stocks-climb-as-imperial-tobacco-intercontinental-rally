U.K. stocks rallied the most in two
weeks as a rebound in commodity prices sent mining companies
higher and both  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  and  Imperial
Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  reported higher earnings.  Rio Tinto Group jumped 2.4 percent as copper climbed for a
third day. InterContinental, owner of the Holiday Inn brand,
climbed 3.9 percent while Imperial Tobacco,  Europe ’s second-
biggest tobacco company, rallied 3.1 percent.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 76.2, or 1.3 percent,
to 6,018.89 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , rebounding from
yesterday’s 0.6 percent decline. The gauge last week posted its
biggest weekly drop since March after a slump in commodities
prices dragged energy and mining companies lower. The FTSE All-
Share Index gained 1.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
rose 1.1 percent.  “Investors hunted heavyweight mining equities, helping to
lift the FTSE 100 to trade back above the 6,000 level,” said
London-based Joshua Raymond, a market strategist at  City Index .
“Chinese trade surplus and export data has been the key trigger
and convinced traders into buying mining stocks.”  Rio Tinto  led a gauge of mining shares higher, rallying 2.4
percent to 4,235.5 pence as copper advanced in London.  Xstrata
Plc (XTA)  advanced 1.6 percent to 1,442 pence, while  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) 
rose 1.4 percent to 1,220 pence.  Copper Advances  Copper advanced for a third day in London after a drop in
Chinese imports alleviated concerns that there is an oversupply
of the base metal in  China , the world’s largest user. Zinc, lead
and nickel also advanced.  InterContinental jumped 3.9 percent to 1,298 pence after
the hotelier reported a 28 percent jump in first-quarter profit
to $69 million as travel recovered in the Americas, its biggest
market. That beat the $62.3 million average analyst estimate.  Imperial Tobacco  rallied 3.1 percent to 2,224 pence after
the company announced a 500 million pounds ($816.5 million)
share buyback as first-half earnings advanced.  Adjusted operating profit advanced 1.9 percent to 1.48
billion pounds in the six months through March, beating the
median analyst estimate on that basis of 1.49 billion pounds.  Tesco Plc paced a gauge of retail shares higher after U.K.
retail sales surged the most in five years last month as public
holidays and the warmest April on record spurred spending.  Marks & Spencer  Tesco, the U.K.’s largest supermarket company, climbed 1.8
percent to 411.3 pence, while smaller rival J Sainsbury Plc
advanced 1.9 percent to 355.8 pence.  Schroders Plc (SDR)  jumped 5.6 percent to 1,750 pence after Numis
Securities Ltd. raised its recommendation for the U.K.’s biggest
publicly traded fund manager to “buy” from “add” saying an
11 percent selloff last week was overdone.  The stock sank the most since January 2009 on May 5 after
earnings missed some analysts estimates.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  paced declining shares, dropping 1.6 percent
to 1,412.5 pence. The U.K.’s third-largest natural-gas producer
reported a 38 percent drop in first-quarter net income to $597
million on higher North Sea taxes and a charge related to asset
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
