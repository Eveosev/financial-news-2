Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA (CPR) ,
Portugal’s biggest cement company, plans to invest an estimated
190 million euros ($272 million) in a new cement and clinker
plant in Cerrado Grande, in the Brazilian state of Parana.  The new plant will have a production capacity of about 1.2
million tons of cement a year, Lisbon-based Cimpor said today in
a regulatory filing. Construction work will begin in “early”
2012 and production will start in 2014, according to Cimpor.  “This new cement production plant will allow Cimpor to
benefit from the forecast growth of the south and southeast
markets of  Brazil , as the present units are operating at full
capacity,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
