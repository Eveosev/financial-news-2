BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-
largest natural gas producer, said it plans to drill more wells
off Tanzania to find enough reserves to underpin development of
a two-unit land-based plant to liquefy the fuel.  The company has already discovered more than 500 million
barrels of oil equivalent in three wells off the East African
nation, said Chief Executive Officer Frank Chapman. It has
conducted seismic studies in the area and plans to start a new
drilling campaign later in the year.  “We’ve got our sleeves rolled up, the guys are working up
a bit of a sweat and we’ll see where it goes,” Chapman told
analysts on a conference call.  Reading, England-based BG is exploring for East African oil
and gas to supply clients in  Asia . In March, it secured
interests in two Kenyan blocks, the company said today in a
statement.  Separately, Chapman today said BG may delay one of two
exploration wells in  Egypt  into next year because of unrest in
the country.  The company’s second exploration well in  China  has failed,
he said.  “We are currently analyzing the implications of that
failure and we are planning to drill yet another well in China
later this year,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
