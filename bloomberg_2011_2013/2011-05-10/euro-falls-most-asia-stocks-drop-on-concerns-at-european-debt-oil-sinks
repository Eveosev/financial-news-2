Stocks rose amid improving earnings,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up for a third day,
while gasoline surged as flooding along the  Mississippi River 
threatened to cut supplies. Greek bonds rallied as speculation
grew the nation will avoid a debt restructuring.  The  S&P 500  advanced 0.8 percent to 1,357.16 at 4 p.m. in
New York. Gasoline jumped 3.1 percent and oil rose 1.3 percent
to $103.88 a barrel in New York, erasing early losses. Greek 10-
year yields fell 28 basis points to 15.43 percent. The yen
weakened versus 15 of 16 most-traded peers and the Swiss franc
depreciated against all 16 as investors pursued riskier assets.
Treasuries fell following an auction of three-year debt.  U.S. equities extended their rebound from last week’s
slump, the worst for the S&P 500 since March, as companies
including  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  and  Fossil Inc. (FOSL)  raised earnings
forecasts. Deutsche Post AG, the world’s biggest carrier of air
and sea freight, surged in  Frankfurt  after reporting results.
The  International Monetary Fund  is arranging a package of as
much as 100 billion euros ($144 billion) to replace  Greece ’s
existing bailout, Athens-based Kathimerini reported.  “Corporate earnings continue to surprise on the upside,”
said Alex Tedder, who helps manage about $13 billion in global
stocks at American Century Investments in New York. “There’s
been a lot of noise and uncertainty with oil and Greece in
particular, but investors are being pragmatic and they’re
rewarding solid corporate fundamentals.”  Three-Day Gain  The S&P 500 capped its first three-day rally in two weeks.
Dean Foods, the largest U.S. milk processor, jumped 11 percent
for the biggest gain in the index. Fossil, the maker of watches
and other accessories, rallied 13 percent to $105.97, the
highest price on a closing basis since the company went public
in 1993. Earnings-per-share have exceeded analysts’ estimates at
72 percent of the 423 companies in the S&P 500 that reported
results since April 11, Bloomberg data show.  Stocks also gained amid optimism that corporate takeovers
will continue to help fuel the two-year rally that sent the S&P
500 up as much as 102 percent from its bear-market low in 2009.
About $884 billion in deals have been announced globally so far
in 2011, 26 percent more than at the same time last year,
Bloomberg data show.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said today it agreed to buy Skype
Technologies SA for $8.5 billion in cash to gain the world’s
most popular Internet calling service and its 663 million
customers. Microsoft shares slipped 0.6 percent while  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ,
which owns part of Skype, rose 2.5 percent.  Miller Chases Value  Financial, technology and health-care stocks offer
“value,”  Bill Miller , the chairman and chief investment
officer of Legg Mason Capital Management Inc., wrote in the
Financial Times today. He said valuations in those industries
have been more expensive 90 percent of the time during about the
past 60 years. S&P 500 financial companies are currently trading
at 13.6 times reported operating earnings, while technology
stocks are trading at 15.6 times and health-care shares are
selling at a multiple of 13.2.  Miller said a lower  U.S. dollar  and higher commodity prices
will be “bearish not bullish” for stocks as the  Federal
Reserve  is set to end its asset-purchase program next month.
Miller’s Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust fund
outperformed the S&P 500 annually for 15 straight years through
2005. It was outperformed by 98 percent of peers in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dollar, Commodities  The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against six
peers, has fallen 16 percent from its peak on June 7, 2010, and
helped propel a 49 percent rally in the S&P GSCI Index of raw
materials over the same period.  Gasoline for June delivery jumped 3.1 percent to $3.3797 a
gallon after rising 6.1 percent yesterday, the most since July
2009, as high water levels on the  Mississippi  caused docks to
shut down and threatened further interruptions to supplies. The
potential opening of a spillway along the Mississippi to relieve
flooding may “significantly” reduce operations at two
refineries, according to a statement from Governor Bobby Jindal’s office. Inventories are at a 22-month low before the
start of summer driving season.  Sugar, silver and cotton also climbed more than 3.4 percent
to lead gains in 22 of the 24 commodities tracked by the S&P
GSCI Index. Only coffee and corn fell. The S&P GSCI rose 1.4
percent, adding to yesterday’s 3.6 percent rebound.  Commodities Rebound  The gauge of commodities sank 11 percent last week, its
biggest tumble since 2008, as oil slid 15 percent after U.S.
forces killed  Osama bin Laden , leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist
network, and silver plunged 27 percent as the CME Group Inc.
raised margin requirements for trading the metal on its
exchange.  Wheat climbed as much as 3.3 percent to $8.165 a bushel.
Drought has left the Kansas crop in the worst shape since 1996
and dry spells are threatening harvests in  France , Western
 Australia  and  China .  Almost seven shares gained for each that fell in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  rose 1.3 percent, and
InterContinental Hotels Plc, owner of the Holiday Inn brand,
rallied 3.9 percent.  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  jumped 3.1
percent after saying it will buy back 500 million pounds ($818
million) of shares a year. Per-share profit at the 238 companies
in the European benchmark that reported results since April 11
rose 8.7 percent, with 58 percent beating analysts’ estimates.  Treasury Auction  Treasuries fell, with three-year note yields rising for the
first time in nine days, after the U.S. government’s auction of
$32 billion of the debt. The notes drew a yield of 1 percent,
compared with the average forecast of 1.01 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Federal Reserve’s 20
primary dealers. The yield on the current three-year note
climbed five basis points to 0.97 percent.  The difference in yield between Greek 10-year bonds and
benchmark German bunds narrowed 30 basis points to 1,231 basis
points. Allowing a euro-area member state to default on or
restructure its debt would be “wrong,” European Central Bank
Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said today.  German bunds snapped a three-day gain, pushing the 10-year
yield up two basis points to 3.12 percent. The Portuguese-German
yield spread widened to 659 basis points.  The cost of protecting U.S. company bonds from default
declined to the lowest level in a week. The Markit CDX North
America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, decreased 0.9 basis point to a mid-price of
88.48 basis points, according to index administrator Markit
Group Ltd.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 0.5 percent. China’s
Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.6 percent as the government
said exports increased by a bigger-than-estimated 30 percent to
a record in April.  The yen weakened 0.9 percent against the euro and 0.6
percent versus the dollar. The euro was 0.3 percent higher at
$1.4407. The Swiss franc depreciated more 1 percent against the
dollar and 1.3 percent versus the euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
