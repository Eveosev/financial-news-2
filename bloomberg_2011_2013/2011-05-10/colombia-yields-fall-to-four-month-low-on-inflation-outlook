Colombia ’s bonds rose, pushing yields
to their lowest level in four months, after April inflation
trailed forecasts and as investors stepped up bets that proceeds
from  government securities  maturing this month will be
reinvested in debt.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, to 8.18
percent at 2:15 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. That’s the lowest since Jan. 13. The bond’s
price climbed 0.528 centavo to 114.315 centavos per peso.  “Inflation is a clear driver in the trend” for lower
yields, said Francisco Chaves, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA. “Expectations of the
liquidity that will come from payments for maturing debt is also
helping.”  Colombia’s annual inflation slowed to 2.84 percent in April
from the same month a year earlier, lower than the 3.08 percent
median forecast among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  About 10 trillion pesos ($5.6 billion) of peso bonds, known
as TES, are maturing this month. Finance Minister Juan Carlos
Echeverry has said the government will use funds it is keeping
in the central bank to pay for securities coming due in May.  “There is a good environment to invest in TES,” said
Chaves who predicts the yield on the benchmark bonds due in July
2024 will fall to 8 percent this month.  Peso Weakens  The peso erased earlier declines, gaining 0.1 percent to
1,787.10 per  U.S. dollar  from 1,787.98 yesterday. The peso is up
6.8 percent this year, the best performance among six Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The local currency earlier fell as much as 0.5 percent amid
speculation the government is buying dollars in the  spot market ,
according to Chaves.  In a bid to ease gains in the peso, Echeverry on April 29
announced that the government would create an overseas fund with
as much as $1.2 billion from dollars bought in the local spot
market through the end of 2011, and would forgo repatriating
funds from abroad for the rest of the year. That comes on top of
the central bank’s plans to buy a minimum of $20 million daily
until at least June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
