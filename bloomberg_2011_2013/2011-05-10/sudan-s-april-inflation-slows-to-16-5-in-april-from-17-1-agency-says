Sudan ’s inflation rate fell to 16.5
percent in April from 17.1 percent the month before, the first
decline since September, as food costs eased, the  Central Bureau
of Statistics  said.  The price of food and non-alcoholic drinks, the biggest
component in the  consumer price index , rose 18.8 percent, down
from 20.4 percent in March, the Khartoum-based agency said in an
e-mailed statement today. In the month, overall prices rose 0.4
percent.  Sudan is targeting inflation of 12 percent and economic
growth of 5 percent for this year, according to Finance Minister
Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul. Inflation averaged 13 percent in 2010,
according to the statistics agency, compared with the target for
that year of 9 percent to 11 percent.  Inflation in the education sector accelerated to 57.7
percent in April from 54.2 percent in March, while the cost of
restaurants and hotels rose 18.7 percent, up from 15.5 percent,
