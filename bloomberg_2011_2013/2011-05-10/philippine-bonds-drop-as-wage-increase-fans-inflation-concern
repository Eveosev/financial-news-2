Philippine five-year bonds dropped
for a second day after an increase to the minimum wage in  Manila 
fueled inflation concerns.  The yield climbed to its highest level in almost a month
after the capital’s wage board added a 22-peso ($0.51) allowance
to the minimum daily pay of 404 pesos. Consumer prices increased
4.5 percent in April from a year earlier, after a 4.3 percent
gain in March, the government said on May 5. The median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey was for a 4.4 percent rise.  “Inflation pressures are creeping up,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , a strategist at Banco de Oro Unibank Inc. in Manila.
“Interest rates will have to normalize.”  The yield on the 9.125 percent debt due September 2016
advanced 2.5 basis points, or 0.025 percentage point, to 5.28
percent as of 4:19 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  Deputy Governor  Diwa Guinigundo  said today the increase in
the minimum wage is within the central bank’s 25-peso assumption.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 42.965 per dollar, according
to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency touched 42.640 on May 2, the strongest level since Nov.
5.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 4.50 percent on May 5, the
second increase this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
