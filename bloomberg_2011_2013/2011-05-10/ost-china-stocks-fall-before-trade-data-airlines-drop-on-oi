Most  China  stocks fell before the
release of trade data that will likely show export growth slowed
and add to concern that measures aimed at taming inflation are
also hurting the economy.  China Southern Airlines Co., the country’s biggest airline,
slid more than 2 percent after  oil prices  jumped in New York.
Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. led an advance for coal producers after
the price of the fuel climbed for a sixth week to the highest in
more than two years.  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2 percent to
2,866.16 at 9:52 a.m., as three stocks dropped for every one
that rose. The CSI 300 Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,123.44.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s
stock market is shut today for a holiday.  Economic data scheduled for today will show exports
probably rose 29.5 percent in April, slowing from growth of
35.8 percent the previous month, according to a survey by
Bloomberg News. Consumer prices may have risen 5.2 percent last
month based on a survey of economists by Bloomberg News. The
inflation figures are scheduled to be released tomorrow.  The Shanghai Composite has declined 6.2 percent from a
five-month high on April 18 amid concern the government will add
to 10 increases in lenders’ reserve-ratio requirements and four
rises in  interest rates  since early last year to cool inflation.
The losses pared the gauge’s advance this year to 2.1 percent.  Crude oil for June delivery jumped 5.5 percent to settle at
$102.55 a barrel yesterday in  New York , the biggest one-day gain
since Feb. 22. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals
including copper and aluminum advanced for a second day, rising
0.4 percent yesterday.  The People’s Bank of China may suspend decisions to
increase interest rates or reserve ratio requirements if goods
and home prices stop rising or drop on a month-on-month basis
for three consecutive months, China Business News reported today,
citing an unidentified PBOC Shanghai branch official.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
