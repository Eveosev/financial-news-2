Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  has reduced oil
production near Norman Wells in  Canada ’s Northwest Territories
after Plains Midstream Canada LP shut its Rainbow pipeline in
 Alberta , a local city official said.  Imperial is attempting to get certified two tanks to store
oil that haven’t been used in years, in order to extend
production another 10 days, said Ian Fremantle, the town
manager. If the company doesn’t get the necessary
certifications, storage space will run out by May 13, he said.  Norman Wells, a town of about 850 people, uses natural gas,
a by-product from the oil production, for heating and cooking,
according to Fremantle.  Jon Harding, a spokesman for Imperial, said the company
ships crude oil on Plains’ Rainbow pipeline that was shut after
a leak April 29. “We have access to storage at Norman Wells and
have been using it since the Rainbow line was shut,” he said.  Harding declined to comment on whether production has been
curtailed. The daily production capacity at Norman Wells is
about 17,000 barrels a day, according to Harding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
