Iran ’s Oil Minister Masoud Mir-Kazemi
and other officials will probably step down following planned
mergers by a number of ministries,  Arman  reported.  Industry and Mines Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian and Welfare
Minister Sadegh Mahsouli may also leave the cabinet, the Tehran-
based newspaper said.  Iran said yesterday that the oil and energy ministries will
be combined to cut the number of government departments to 17
from 21 and boost the administration’s efficiency. The
Industries and Mines Ministry will be combined with the Commerce
Ministry and the Welfare Ministry with the Labor Ministry.  President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s government will have to
nominate the ministers for the merged ministries to the
parliament and seek votes of confidence, Arman reported, citing
senior parliamentary member Hossein Sobhaninia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
