Resolution Ltd. (RSL) , the U.K. insurance
buyout firm founded by Clive Cowdery, said first-quarter sales
rose 52 percent after buying Axa SA’s U.K. life insurance
division and Bupa Health Assurance Ltd.  Revenue was 270 million pounds ($442 million) in the first
three months of the year compared with 178 million pounds in the
same period in 2010, Guernsey, Channel Islands-based Resolution
said today in a statement. That missed the 275 million-pound
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by the company.  Resolution has risen 19 percent in the last six months,
nearly twice as much as the  FTSE ASX Life Insurance (FALIFE)  Index, after
saying it’s unlikely to raise more capital for acquisitions. The
firm, founded in 2008, is aiming to achieve “mid teens” annual
returns from merging  Friends Provident , Axa U.K. life and Bupa
Health and selling the combined group within the next three
years.  The “U.K. Life Project remains on track to deliver the
targeted mid-teen returns with on-going progress on integration
and delivery of targets” announced in February, Resolution said
in the statement.  Cash available to shareholders was 1.05 billion pounds at
March 31 compared with 1.07 billion pounds at Dec. 31,
Resolution said. The fall was due to interest payments and fees
for professional services, it said.  The company is “confident” that it will meet is target of
generating 400 million pounds of cash available for distribution
after interest costs in 2011, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
