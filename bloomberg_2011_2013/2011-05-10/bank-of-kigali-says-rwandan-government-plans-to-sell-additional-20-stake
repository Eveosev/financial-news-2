Bank of Kigali Ltd. ,  Rwanda ’s biggest
lender by assets, said the government will sell a 20 percent
stake to private investors in an initial public offering
scheduled for June.  The sale will be in addition to the 25 percent being
offered by the lender, Chief Operating Officer Lawson Naibo said
in an e-mailed response to questions today from the capital,
Kigali.  Rwanda doubled the size of its economy in the nine years to
2010 as it recovers from a genocide in which 800,000 mainly
ethnic Tutsis died in 1994. The government is selling assets to
private investors as it seeks to attract more foreign investors
to the East African country.  The sale of the additional stake in the bank is aimed at
catering for an anticipated surplus in demand for the stock,
Finance Minister John Rwangombwa told reporters today in Kigali.
In November, the government sold 25 percent of Brassieries et
Lemonaderies du Rwanda SA, a unit of  Heineken NV (HEIA) , in an offering
that was 174 percent oversubscribed, he said.  The government’s intention is to sell its entire stake in
the lender, Rwangombwa said. The state currently owns 66.3
percent of the bank, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
