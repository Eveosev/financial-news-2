Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced for a
third day on optimism economic growth in  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest economy is attracting funds.  The currency has strengthened 0.2 percent so far this month
as official data showed last week gross domestic product rose
6.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier after
having increased 6.89 percent in the previous three months.
Overseas investors bought $171 million more Indonesian stocks
than they sold this month through yesterday, boosting net
purchases this year to $1.9 billion, according to exchange data.  “The overall picture for the rupiah is positive,” said
Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in
Jakarta. “Bank Indonesia has also made it clear that it will
allow gains in the currency to control imported inflation.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 8,553 per dollar as of
3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank Indonesia  is allowing the rupiah to strengthen,
Bambang Brodjonegoro, head of fiscal policy at the  finance
ministry , said last week.  The yield on the benchmark 8.25 percent bond due July 2021
fell one basis point to 7.71 percent, according to mid-day
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  Overseas investors raised holdings of Indonesia’s debt by
12 percent this year to 220.8 trillion rupiah ($25.8 billion) as
of yesterday, according to data from the Debt Management Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
