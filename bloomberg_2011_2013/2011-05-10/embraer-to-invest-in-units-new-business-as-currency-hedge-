Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, is making investments in efficiency, units
abroad and new business in  Brazil  to combat the effects of the
rising value of the Brazilian real, Cynthia Benedetto, vice-
president of finance said.  The airline aims to invest in new factories in the U.S. and
Portugal, and to renovate a plant in  China . Embraer also hopes
to boost military and security sales in Brazil, including
selling border surveillance systems to the government, Benedetto
said in yesterday in an interview in Rio de Janeiro.  Embraer takes stock in U.S. dollars and accounts for real
highs as a cost. The real appreciated by 43.4 percent from the
start of 2009 to May 9, the biggest rise against the dollar from
25 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Contracts such as border surveillance systems “increase
sales in reais a bit, which works as a currency hedge,”
Benedetto said. The government should take currency measures to
prevent “deindustrialization,” she said.  Embraer fell 1 percent to 13.49 reais a share in Sao Paulo
trading at 2:17 p.m. New York time. The shares have risen 14.4
percent this year, compared with a 6.5 percent drop in the
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
