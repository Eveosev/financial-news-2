Handsets running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android software captured 57 percent of  Japan ’s smartphone
market last fiscal year, cutting the share of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone,  MM Research Institute Ltd.  said.  Shipments of Android phones rose to 4.91 million units in
the year ended March 31, Tokyo-based MM Research said in a
statement today. That compares with sales of 250,000 units, or
11 percent of the market, a year earlier when devices running
Google’s software started to be widely available in Japan.  Apple shipped 3.23 million iPhones in Japan in the last
fiscal year, accounting for 38 percent of the nation’s
smartphone market, the report said. The company, whose mobile
phones are offered exclusively by  Softbank Corp. (9984)  in Japan,
shipped 1.69 million of the devices for a 72 percent share a
year earlier, according to the report.  The Cupertino, California-based company remains the most
popular handset maker in Japan, according to MM Research. Sharp
Corp., which introduced its first Android model in June 2010,
was second with a 24 percent share of shipments, followed by
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB’s Xperia with 9.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
