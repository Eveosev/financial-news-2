The U.K. will force landlords of the
country’s most drafty buildings to make them more energy
efficient from 2018, Energy and Climate Change Secretary  Chris Huhne  said.  From 2016, landlords of homes and offices won’t be able to
deny tenants’ requests for “reasonable” improvements to the
energy efficiency of a building, Huhne said today in Parliament.
From 2018, landlords won’t be able to rent out buildings with an
energy efficiency rating of F or G, the two lowest on an A-
through-G scale, he said.  The regulations, added to the government’s Energy bill
that’s being debated in Parliament, will ensure 682,000 homes
are made more energy efficient, Huhne said. The centerpiece of
the bill, dubbed the  Green Deal , lays out incentives to insulate
the nation’s 26 million homes.  “For those landlords who don’t take up the Green Deal, we
will get tough so that by 2018 the poorest performing rented
housing stock is brought up to a decent standard,” Huhne said
today in an e-mailed statement. “Our proposals provide a voice
for tenants living in poorly insulated, drafty homes”  To contact the reporter on this story:
