South Africa  sold 10-year bonds at
the lowest yield this year amid speculation the central bank
won’t raise  interest rates  in 2011.  The Reserve Bank auctioned 1.5 billion rand ($221.8
million) of 6.75 percent notes due March 2021 at an average
yield of 8.35 percent, the lowest since the auction on Dec. 20.
Investors bid for five times the amount of debt on offer at the
weekly auction, the Pretoria-based central bank said on its
Bloomberg page. The bank also sold 600 million rand of 6.5
percent bonds maturing in 2041 at a yield of 8.81 percent.
Investors bid for 2.7 times the amount offered.  Demand for the 10-year bonds “was particularly strong,”
Citibank NA analysts  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall said in a
research note. “This strong result was despite the MPC rates
decision this week, showing confidence in the bullish view.”  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee will leave its
benchmark rate at a 30-year-low of 5.5 percent on Thursday, even
as rising food and oil prices may lift the inflation rate to
near the upper limit of the 3 to 6 percent target range,
according all 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “While the risks to the inflation outlook have certainly
increased to the upside, macroeconomic conditions seem similarly
placed at the time of the MPC meeting,” Seamus Vasey, a
Johannesburg-based analyst at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in
a research note. “We therefore believe the  Reserve Bank  may
keep rates on hold until further evidence of an increase in
economic activity.”  The 10-year bonds gained 58 cents to 89.16 rand in the
secondary market as of 1:58 p.m. in Johannesburg. The yield was
10 basis points lower than yesterday’s close at 8.38 percent.
The 30-year notes climbed 15 cents to 75.57 rand, driving the
yield down 2 basis points to 8.83 percent compared with
yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
