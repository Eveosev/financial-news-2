Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) , the maker of
chips used in cars and consumer electronics, won its U.S.
International Trade Commission case against  Dover Corp. (DOV) ’s
Knowles Electronics over microphones in digital devices.  The commission today said Knowles and Mouser Electronics
Inc. violated a patent owned by Analog Devices and said the
products that infringe the patent should be barred from the U.S.
It upheld a judge’s findings from December.  Each company has accused the other of infringing patents
related to microphones that are made on silicon chips, which
render them smaller than traditional microphones and provide
higher-quality recording. Knowles lost its case after the
commission found no violation by Norwood, Massachusetts-based
Analog Devices.  The exclusion order must be reviewed by President  Barack Obama  and the U.S. Trade Representative to see if there is any
conflict with public policy. The underlying patent case can be
appealed by  Downers Grove , Illinois-based Dover to a court that
specializes in U.S. patent law.  The ADI case is in the Matter of MEMS Devices, 337-700 and
the Knowles case is in the Matter of Silicon Microphone
Packages, 337-695, both U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
