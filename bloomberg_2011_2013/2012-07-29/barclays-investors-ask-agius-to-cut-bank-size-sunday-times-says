Barclays Plc (BARC)  should use the exit of
former Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  as a chance to cut
its investment bank’s size and reduce pay, some of its biggest
investors told the lender in letters, the Sunday Times reported.  Schroders Plc (SDR) , one of Barclays’ institutional investors,
wrote to outgoing Chairman Marcus Agius asking him to seize the
“unique opportunity” to change the bank’s strategy, the Times
said. One of the bank’s 10 biggest investors told Barclays it
should reduce costs by 15 percent, the newspaper said, without
identifying the shareholder.  The investors said Barclays could exit areas such as Asian
and European equities, according to the report. London-based
Barclays spokesman Giles Croot declined to comment when
contacted by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
