Pacific Investment Management Co.
co-founder  Bill Gross  made about $200 million last year and
Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian was paid about $100
million, the  New York  Times reported, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the matter.  El-Erian is the “heir apparent” at Newport Beach,
California based Pimco, Gross told the Times in an interview.
Gross and El-Erian declined to comment on details of their
compensation to the newspaper.  “We all earn too much, but I can sleep because of the
multiples we have provided for our clients over the years,”
Gross told the newspaper during a joint interview with El-
Erian.  Pimco, which manages the world’s biggest mutual fund,
oversees about $1.8 trillion in assets, the newspaper reported.
Pimco is a unit of Munich-based insurer Allianz AG.  Mark Porterfield , a spokesman for Pimco, didn’t immediately
return a request for comment outside normal business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
