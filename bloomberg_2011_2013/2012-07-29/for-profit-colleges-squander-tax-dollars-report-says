For-profit colleges in the U.S.
receive billions in federal dollars yet spend more money on
marketing than on instruction, with many students dropping out
without a degree and in debt, according to a Senate  report .  The schools, which got $32 billion in tuition aid in
2009-2010, aren’t a good investment for taxpayer money,
according to the study released today. The report, from the
 Senate Committee  on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, led
by Iowa Democrat  Tom Harkin , examined 30 education companies
over two years.  More than 9 percent of college students were enrolled in a
for-profit school in 2009, up from 0.2 percent in 1970,
according to Teachers College at  Columbia University  in  New
York . The Obama administration has cracked down on recruitment
and marketing practices at the schools and proposed rules to
limit funding to those whose students don’t earn enough to repay
their debt. More needs to be done, including setting minimum
standards for services such as tutoring and career counseling,
according to the report.  “In the absence of significant reforms,” the report said,
“the sector will continue to turn out hundreds of thousands of
students with debt but no degree, and taxpayers will see little
return on their investment.”  Educational companies have lobbied against new regulations,
which they say will restrict opportunities for working adults
and low-income students.  The  Bloomberg Education Index (USEDU) , made up of 13 publicly
traded companies, declined 53 percent in the year through July
27.  Federal Aid  The $32 billion in federal support received by for-profit
schools in the 2009-2010 academic year accounted for 25 percent
of all Education Department student-aid funds. For-profit
colleges got $7.5 billion in  Pell Grants , which fund
scholarships for low-income students, up from $1.1 billion in
2000-2001, double the rate of growth for all recipients of Pell
funds, the report showed.  For-profit colleges spent $4.1 billion, or 22 percent of
their revenue, on marketing and recruitment, and took an
additional $3.6 billion, or 19 percent, in profit, according to
the study. They spent $3.2 billion, or 18 percent of revenue, on
instruction.  The schools also devote more staff to recruiting new
students than ensuring the success of their existing ones,
according to the study. In 2010, the 30 for-profit schools
employed 32,496 recruiters compared with 3,512 career services
staff and 12,452 support service workers, the report showed.  As a result, 596,556 students who enrolled in the 2008-2009
school year dropped out by mid-2010, the report said. In two-
year associate’s degree programs, 64 percent dropped out.  Default Rate  For-profit college students take on more debt, with 96
percent receiving loans compared with 48 percent at four-year
public universities. They also default at a higher rate than
their counterparts at nonprofit institutions. Almost half of all
federal student loan defaults came from students at for-profit
schools.  The report blames lax enforcement by accrediting agencies
that rely on self-reporting, state education departments that
lack funds to oversee colleges and loopholes in federal
regulations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
