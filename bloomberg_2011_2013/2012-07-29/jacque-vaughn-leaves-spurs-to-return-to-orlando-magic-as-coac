Jacque Vaughn, who played for the
 Orlando Magic  a decade ago, is returning to the National
Basketball Association team as head coach, General Manager Rob Hennigan said.  Vaughn, 37, becomes the Magic’s 10th head coach after
spending the past two seasons as an assistant coach with the  San
Antonio Spurs . He played on the Spurs’ 2006-07 NBA championship
team.  Vaughn replaces Stan Van Gundy, who was fired along with
former General Manager Otis Smith in May after the Magic lost in
the first round of the NBA playoffs.  “We are confident that his diligence, attention to detail
and communication style will help establish the bedrock of our
culture moving forward,” Hennigan said in a statement on the
team’s website. “His commitment and passion to building a
sustainable program will help steer our organization for years
to come.”  During Vaughn’s two seasons on  San Antonio ’s staff, the
Spurs compiled a regular season record of 111-37.  Vaughn was selected by the  Utah Jazz  in the first round of
the 1997 NBA Draft. In a 12-year career he averaged 4.5 points a
game in 776 regular season outings, including stints with the
Spurs and Magic as well as the  Atlanta Hawks  and New Jersey Nets.  Vaughn played 80 games with the Magic during the 2002-03
season, averaging 5.9 points and 1.5 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
