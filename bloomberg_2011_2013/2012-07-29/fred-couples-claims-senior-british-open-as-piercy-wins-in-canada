Fred Couples  birdied the final two
holes to win golf’s Senior  British Open  by two strokes, while
Scott Piercy claimed his second U.S. PGA Tour title by one shot
at the Canadian Open.  Couples, 52, closed with a 3-under-par 67 yesterday at
Turnberry, Scotland, to finish with a four-round total of 9
under 271. Fellow American Gary Hallberg was second.  “For me to win at Turnberry, it honestly doesn’t get any
better,” Couples, who won the 1992  Masters Tournament , said at
a news conference. “It’s one of the harder Open courses and I
played really, really well for four days.”  Piercy followed up his opening-round 8-under-par 62 with a
third straight 67 yesterday at Hamilton Golf & Country Club in
Ontario. He finished 17-under 263 and received $936,000 for his
second PGA title, having also won the 2011 Reno-Tahoe Open.  William McGirt was tied for the lead before making a bogey
at the final hole to finish 16-under par.  Robert Garrigus , the
54-hole leader, missed a 14-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole
that would have forced a playoff.  With yesterday’s win, Piercy earned a spot in the World
Golf Championship’s $8.5 million Bridgestone Invitational in
Akron, Ohio. He said he’ll skip defending his title in Reno as
both events are scheduled from Aug. 2-5.  “Getting into Akron next week is a little change of
plans,” Piercy said. “I was supposed to be in Reno defending.
So I have to apologize to Reno.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
