The primary role of  France ’s Caisse
des Depots et Consignations, a state-run bank, isn’t to save
troubled companies like PSA Peugeot Citroen and Doux SA, new
head  Jean-Pierre Jouyet  told  Journal du Dimanche  in an
interview.  The sovereign wealth Strategic Investment Fund, FSI, will
decide what should be done, the newspaper cited Jouyet as
saying. The CDC has a role to play in industrial recovery,
although it has finite means, he said, according to the
interview.  The limit on the Livret A tax-free state savings accounts
will be “progressively” doubled to raise funds for social
housing, universities and municipalities, Jouyet was quoted as
saying.  The Caisse should play a “major” role in the planned
state investment bank to spur economic growth and help small
companies, and this entity could integrate the FSI, the
newspaper said, citing Jouyet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
