     July 29 (Bloomberg) -- Emirates Telecommunications Corp.,
the state-controlled company known as Etisalat, will “soon”
allow foreigners to own its shares,  Al Khaleej  reported, citing
Group Chief Executive OfficerAhmad Abdulkarim Julfar.  Etisalat is owned 60 percent by state-owned Emirates
Investment Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Abu
Dhabi-based company said on June 7 it’s up to the federal
government to decide on foreign investments after Emarat Alyoum
reported a law that governs Etisalat may be amended to allow
foreign and institutional investors to own the company’s shares.  Etisalat’s  second-quarter profit  rose 17 percent to 1.87
billion dirhams ($508 million), beating analysts’ estimates. The
 shares have increased  1 percent this year compared with a 2.8
percent gain for the benchmark ADX General Index.  Julfar said Etisalat doesn’t plan to make acquisitions
over the next two years, according to Al Khaleej.   To contact the reporter on this story:
