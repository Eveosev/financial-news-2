Chicken will be made available
throughout Iranian provinces at the single rate of 52,000 rials
($4.24) a kilo (2.2 pounds) from today after an announcement by
the Ministry of Industries, Mines and Commerce,  Shargh  newspaper
reported, citing the Tehran province governor, Morteza Tamaddon.  The decision comes after an increase in the price of
chicken, which doubled over the last year and reached 80,000
rials a kilo in recent weeks, because of  Iran â€™s difficulties in
importing chicken feed, officials have said.  U.S. and European Union sanctions against Iran over its
nuclear activities have limited trade and financial interaction
with the Persian Gulf nation and have led to its growing
isolation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
