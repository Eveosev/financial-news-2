Bankrupt Irish businessman  Sean Quinn , once the country’s richest man, said his family lost 3.29
billion euros ($4.1 billion) investing in Anglo Irish Bank Corp.
before it was nationalized three years ago.  “I regret ever hearing the name” of the bank, Quinn said
in an interview aired by  RTE Radio  today.  Quinn said “it’s very likely” he’ll face prison for
contempt of court after his son, Sean Quinn Jr., was jailed on
July 20 for the same offense. Ireland’s  High Court  found both
men and the elder Quinn’s nephew Peter Darragh Quinn in contempt
of court last month for putting assets outside of the reach of
Anglo Irish’s successor, Irish Bank Resolution Corp. “I’ve done
everything in my power to purge my contempt,” he told RTE.  Quinn’s fortune was valued at $6 billion by Forbes in 2008.
He was declared bankrupt in January after a court ruled he owed
IBRC 2.16 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
