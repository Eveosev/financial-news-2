Argentina ’s economic growth will
accelerate in the second half of the year and the government
doesn’t have any plans to take on more debt to cover spending or
bond payments, Tiempo Argentino said, citing an interview with
Economy Minister Hernan Lorenzino.                          South America ’s second-biggest economy is growing less  
quickly than last year, Lorenzino said, according to the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper. The minister added that efforts to reduce
the country’s dependence on the U.S. dollar may be having a
positive impact on the economy, Tiempo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
