South Korean manufacturers’
confidence dropped to the lowest level in more than three years
as  Europe ’s worsening fiscal crisis damped sentiment in a
country where exports make up about half the economy.  An  index  measuring expectations for August was at 70, the
lowest level since May 2009, after dropping from a revised 81 in
July, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in Seoul today. A
measure of expectations at  non-manufacturing companies  also
dropped to 69 from a revised 76.  “The South Korean economy is muddling through uncertainty
caused by the  European debt crisis ,” Oh Suk Tae, an economist
at SC First Bank  Korea  Ltd. in Seoul, said before the release.
“The central bank indicated that it’s ready to act, but the
market is expecting supplementary fiscal support only if the
economy contracts significantly.”  Asia’s fourth-largest economy grew at the slowest pace in
almost three years last quarter, with HSBC Holdings Plc and
Citigroup Inc. saying the Bank of Korea may cut rates again this
year. The BOK lowered its main rate a quarter percentage point
to 3 percent on July 12, and Governor Kim Choong Soo warned last
week the nation may miss a 3 percent growth estimate for 2012.  Consumer confidence  fell to a five-month low in July, the
BOK said on July 25. The business survey, conducted from July 16
to July 23, was based on responses from 1,430 manufacturers and
1,016 non-manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
