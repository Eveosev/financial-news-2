North Korea  said flooding caused by
Typhoon Khanun last week killed 88 people and left 62,900
homeless in the isolated communist nation where drought has
already added to chronic food shortages.  Torrential rains and flooding between July 18 and 24
inundated more than 12,030 houses and destroyed scores of
factory buildings, educational facilities and health-care
establishments, the official Korean Central News Agency reported
yesterday, citing data collected until July 28. More than 91,890
square meters of roads were destroyed and 160 kilometers (99
miles) of embankment washed away, KCNA said.  About 4,800 hectares (11,860 acres) of cropland were washed
away and more than 25,700 hectares submerged, KCNA reported.  As much as 150 millimeters (5.9 inches) of rain is forecast
nationwide for today and tomorrow, falling mainly on the western
coast and the northern province of Jagang on North Korea’s
border with  China , KCNA said in a separate report today.  North Korea’s rainy season began on July 18 as Typhoon
Khanun struck the Korean peninsula, hitting northwestern coastal
areas the hardest. The monsoon season set in after the country’s
worst drought in a century threatened wheat, barley and potato
harvests.  Chronic Food Shortages  About 16 million of North Korea’s 24 million people suffer
from chronic food insecurity, high malnutrition rates and deep-
rooted economic challenges, Jerome Sauvage, United Nations
resident coordinator in the capital of Pyongyang, said in a June
12 statement.  As many as 2 million people starved to death since the
mid-1990s as the communist regime pursued nuclear weapons and
missile development, further isolating itself from the
international community.  North Korea’s new leader Kim Jong Un lost a deal with the
U.S. for 240,000 metric tons of food in exchange for a
moratorium on nuclear and missile tests when his country tested
a long-range rocket on April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
