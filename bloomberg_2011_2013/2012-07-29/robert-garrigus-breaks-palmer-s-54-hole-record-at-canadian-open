Robert Garrigus broke  Arnold Palmer ’s 57-year-old three-round record at the Canadian Open as
he takes a one-stroke lead into today’s final round.  Garrigus shot a 6-under 64 yesterday to finish 54 holes at
16-under 194, breaking the tournament record of 195 set by
Palmer in 1955 at Weston Golf & Country Club in Toronto and
matched by Dean Wilson in 2010 at St. George’s Golf & Country
Club in Toronto.  “Oops. Sorry, Arnie,” Garrigus said when told he had
broken Palmer’s record in golf’s third-oldest championship.  Garrigus, who won his only PGA title in 2010, needed two
putts for par on each of his final six holes yesterday to end at
16-under at Hamilton Golf & Country Club in Ancaster, Ontario.  “It was good to great,” Garrigus said of his putting
during a televised interview. “I made a couple of long ones,
which you need to make. When you make long putts and you’re in
contention, it puts you up there. I didn’t have a three-putt and
didn’t have a bogey.”  William McGirt fired a 66 to end 54 holes at 15-under par
to stand in second place and Scott Piercy is third at 14-under
196.  “My legs are a little bit tired right now, and mentally
I’m a little tired because of being in the mix last week and all
week being right there, here,” said McGirt, who is playing in
his 23rd event this year. “I just have to keep playing my game
and take advantage of the opportunities that I get.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
