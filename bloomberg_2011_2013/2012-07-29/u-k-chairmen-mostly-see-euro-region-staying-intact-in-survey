About two-thirds of chairmen of the
largest U.K. companies expect the euro region to stay intact for
the next year, a survey commissioned by executive search
consultancy Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann showed.  The poll also showed weaker support for the U.K.
government’s economic policies as half of respondents said the
balance between promoting growth and tackling the  budget deficit 
is correct, down from 89 percent in an Ipsos Mori survey in
January 2011.  Twenty-nine percent of respondents in Korn/Ferry Whitehead
Mann’s Boardroom Pulse survey said shareholders should have a
binding vote on executive remuneration. The consultancy last
month polled a third of chairmen of companies in the  FTSE 100
Index (UKX)  of the biggest publicly traded U.K. companies. The survey
gave no margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
