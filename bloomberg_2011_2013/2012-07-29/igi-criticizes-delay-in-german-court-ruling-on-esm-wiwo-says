Estonian Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said it’s “not a good sign” that  Germany ’s constitutional
court is dictating the speed at which European governments can
solve the debt crisis,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing an
interview.  “ Europe  is waiting for a decision,” Ligi was quoted as
saying, referring to a ruling on bids to halt Germany’s
participation in the European Stability Mechanism and the fiscal
treaty. “The government and the parliaments are making fools of
themselves if the Federal Constitutional Court delays the
decision and creates uncertainty about its result.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
