For all the handwringing over the
slowdown in the  U.S. economy , the  bond market  shows there’s less
risk of deflation now than before the  Federal Reserve ’s first
two rounds of large-scale debt purchases.  The expectation that consumer prices will rise, measured by
the  five-year, five-year  forward breakeven rate, means that Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has persuaded traders the U.S. will
avoid the chronic deflation that has slowed  Japan ’s economy
since 1995. It also complicates the central bank’s decision
about starting more quantitative easing to boost an economy that
grew at the slowest pace in a year during the second quarter.
Commodity prices surged during QE1 and QE2 in 2008 and 2010.  “Higher inflation results in a tax on consumers and slows
the economy down,”  Michael Materasso , a senior portfolio
manager and co-chairman of the fixed-income policy committee at
Franklin Templeton Investments, which oversees $320 billion of
bonds, said in a July 24 interview at Bloomberg headquarters in
 New York . “If you end up with a spike in commodity prices, have
you done more harm than good?”  The Fed’s favored bond-market gauge of inflation
expectations ended last week at 2.39 percent, above the 2
percent levels in 2008 and 2010 that led the central bank to
inject $2.3 trillion into the economy by purchasing Treasuries
and mortgage-related bonds, the policy known as quantitative
easing. The  five-year, five-year  measure shows how much traders
anticipate consumer prices will rise during a period of five
years starting in 2017.  ‘Sticking Point’  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw
materials rose as much as 85 percent during the past two
easings, pushing the  consumer price index  to 3.9 percent in
September 2009, higher than its long-term average of 2.5 percent
since 1992.  Measures that track where bond traders see inflation in the
future are key since January when the Fed adopted a 2 percent
target for the personal consumption expenditures index. The
gauge, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8 percent in May from a
year earlier, increasing from as low as 0.9 percent at the end
of 2010. It has averaged 1.9 percent since the 1990s.  While the Fed can ignore its target, traders’ outlook for
consumer prices “could be a sticking point for more QE,”
Chicago-based Bianco Research LLC said in a report to clients on
July 27. “These measures show too much inflation for the time
being.”  Rising Yields  Treasuries fell last week as investors saw less need to
hold the safest assets after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said policy makers would do whatever it takes to
preserve the euro, sending the currency and stocks higher.  Treasury 10-year yields rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 1.55 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The benchmark 1.75 percent note due May 2022 fell
27/32, or $8.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 26/32.  The yield, which reached an all-time low of 1.3790 percent
on July 25, fell four basis points to 1.51 percent as of 12:38
p.m. in New York.  Bonds declined last week even though the Commerce
Department in Washington said on July 27 that gross domestic
product rose at a 1.5 percent annual rate last quarter after a
revised 2 percent gain in the three months ended March 31. The
rate, which was the slowest since the third quarter of 2011,
compared with the 1.4 percent median estimate of 82 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The government will say Aug. 3 the  unemployment rate  held
above 8 percent in July for the 42nd-straight month, the median
estimate of more than 65 economists surveyed by Bloomberg shows.  QE Odds  “You don’t need to pump up inflation, but what you’re
looking at is them wanting to support growth.”  Scott Sherman ,
an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New
York, said in a July 25 telephone interview.  The firm, one of the 21 primary dealers of  government
securities  that trade with the Fed, forecasts a 30 percent
probability of the Fed announcing QE3 at its two-day meeting
ending Aug. 1, with the odds rising to 60 percent at the Sept.
13 gathering if the economy continues to weaken.  Investors have been willing to buy bonds that pay less than
the rate of inflation because of the safety they offer as
Europe’s debt crisis intensifies and the global economy slows.
Spain and Cyprus joined Greece, Portugal and Ireland in seeking
bailouts from the European Union.  Average Yield  The average yield on bonds issued by the Group of Seven
nations dropped to 1.125 percent on July 27 from 3 percent in
2007, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Germany’s
two-year note yield fell below zero for the first time on June
1, while Switzerland’s has been negative since April 24, meaning
investors are paying for the right to lend those nations money.  Central banks are digging deeper into their tool kits in
search of innovative ways to bolster their economies.  The People’s Bank of China joined the ECB on July 5 in
cutting its benchmark rate, while the  Bank of England  raised the
size of its asset purchases. Two weeks earlier, the Fed expanded
a program lengthening the maturity of bonds it holds in a
program traders call Operation Twist.  With U.S. yields at record lows, some investors doubt more
Fed stimulus will work, according to James Sarni, a senior
managing partner at Los Angeles-based Payden & Rygel, which
manages $60 billion.  “Buying more mortgages or buying more Treasuries or
agencies, I just don’t think it’s going to do much good,” Sarni
said in a July 25 telephone interview. “The Fed cannot
unilaterally solve all the world’s problems.”  QE History  The expiration of tax cuts started by President  George W. Bush  and spending reductions to take effect at the start of 2013
would pull $607 billion from the economy, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office . If Congress doesn’t act, those
events would “pose a significant threat to the recovery,”
Bernanke told lawmakers in testimony on June 7.  The Fed’s  QE program  started with a November 2008
commitment to buy $500 billion of mortgage securities and $100
billion of debentures of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac . Policy
makers raised the purchase targets in March 2009 to $1.25
trillion of mortgage bonds, $200 billion of agency debt and
added $300 billion of Treasuries. In November 2010, the Fed
announced it would acquire $600 billion of Treasuries.  ‘Huge Problem’  The programs created about $2.3 trillion dollars, sparking
criticism by Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao , who said in March 2011
that QE2 boosted prices for commodities traded in the U.S.
currency. Representative Stephen Fincher, a Republican from
Tennessee, said this month during Bernanke’s testimony to
Congress that “there is so much money out there” that
“inflation is going to be a huge problem.”  Crude oil reached $114.83 a barrel in May 2011, from $70.76
in August 2010. It was at $90.01 today. Rotterdam-based
Unilever, the world’s second-biggest consumer-goods maker, sees
commodity cost inflation in 2012 to be “slightly higher” than
a mid-single-digit increase, unchanged from its forecast in
April, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Huet said on a July 26
conference call with reporters.  Bernanke has studied policy errors in the Great Depression
and during Japan’s rolling  recessions  of the 1990s. He said in
2000 that the  Bank of Japan  should pursue faster inflation to
curb the risk of deflation, adding earlier this year that the
Fed’s stimulus programs have averted that fate in the U.S.  ‘Very Critical’  “The very critical difference between the Japanese
situation 15 years ago and the U.S. situation today is that
Japan was in deflation,” he said in response to a question at a
press conference after policy makers met April 25, the last time
he addressed the issue. “We are not in deflation, we have an
inflation rate that’s close to our objective.”  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which offer
investors a lower annual rate of interest than Treasuries in
exchange for an increase in the face value of the debt equal to
the rise of the consumer price index, have returned 1.19 percent
this month and 5.42 percent for the year. That compares with
returns of 0.69 percent in June and 2.36 percent in 2012 for
 U.S. debt  that isn’t linked to price measures, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes show.  The five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate, which the
Fed uses to help set policy, has ranged this year from 2.37
percent on March 5 to 2.78 percent on March 19. The 0.39
percentage point drop from its high this year contrasts with the
1.59 percentage point plunge to 2.02 percent between October and
November 2008, and the 0.98 percentage point decline to 2.18
percent between April and August 2010.  A further decline “is probably what the Fed will need to
see before they pull the trigger on further easing,” Robert Robis, head of fixed-income macro strategies in Atlanta at ING
Investment Management, which manages about $160 billion, said in
a July 25 telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
