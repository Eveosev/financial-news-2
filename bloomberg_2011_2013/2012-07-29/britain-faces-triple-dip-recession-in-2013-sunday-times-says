Britain could enter a “triple dip”
recession in 2013 as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis overshadows
a brief recovery spawned by the  Olympic Games , the Sunday Times
reported.  The “unprecedented” event would be triggered in spring
next year by an exit of Greece from the euro region, threatening
Britain’s AAA credit rating, the Times reported, citing
economists including Azad Zangana at Schroders Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
