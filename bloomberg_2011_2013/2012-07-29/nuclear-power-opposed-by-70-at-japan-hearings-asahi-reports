Around 70 percent of participants in
public hearings to gauge opinion on  Japan ’s  energy policy  have
said the nation should end nuclear-power generation by 2030, the
Asahi newspaper reported.  The government held meetings in Hiroshima and Naha
yesterday, the seventh and eight hearings in which members of
the public debate what proportion of the nation’s energy should
be nuclear-generated.  Eleven percent of the 1,253 people to take part in the
meetings so far said atomic power should make up 15 percent of
the nation’s energy mix, with 17 percent of people favoring
20-25 percent, according to the Asahi.  The government will take results of the hearings into
account in finalizing its energy policy. Final hearings will
take place in Fukushima on Aug. 1, and Takamatsu and Fukuoka on
Aug. 4, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
