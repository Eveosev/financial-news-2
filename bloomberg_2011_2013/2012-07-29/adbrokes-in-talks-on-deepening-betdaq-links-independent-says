Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  is in talks on
“deepening” ties with Betdaq, the Ireland-based online sports-
betting exchange owned by businessman Dermot Desmond, the Sunday
Independent  reported , citing an unidentified Ladbrokes
spokesman.  Ladbrokes is improving its technology, which may make
Betdaq “useful” to the company, the newspaper cited the
spokesman as saying. The spokesman declined to comment on
whether Ladbrokes may buy Betdaq, according to the report.  Desmond didn’t respond to a request for comment, the Sunday
Independent said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
