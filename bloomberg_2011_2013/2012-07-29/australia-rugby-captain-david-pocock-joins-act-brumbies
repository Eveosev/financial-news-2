Australia  captain  David Pocock 
agreed to join the ACT Brumbies Super Rugby team on a three-year
contract, ending his seven-year association with the Western
Force.  Openside flanker Pocock, 24, will join the Canberra-based
Brumbies once his commitments with the Wallabies are completed,
the Brumbies said in an e-mailed statement.  Pocock, who’s played 44 Tests for Australia, is leaving a
franchise that finished second-to-last in the Super Rugby
standings this season to join a side that missed out on the six-
team playoffs by one point.  “I see David thriving in this environment,” Brumbies
coach Jake White said in the statement. “He will fit in here
perfectly.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
