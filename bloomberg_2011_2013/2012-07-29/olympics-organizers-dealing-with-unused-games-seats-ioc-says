The International Olympics Committee
said it will act to avoid a repeat of large numbers of allocated
seating at some London Games venues being unused.  The issue which was apparent during events on the opening
day is a “small teething problem,” IOC spokesman  Mark Adams 
told the  BBC  in an interview today.  “We will deal with it, we are dealing with it; we are
getting to grips with this,” Adams said.  U.K. Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said Locog, the
organizing committee, is looking “very urgently” at the use of
empty seating.  “Locog are doing a full investigation into what
happened,” Hunt told the BBC. “I think it was accredited seats
that belonged to sponsors, but if they’re not going to turn up,
we want those tickets to be available for members of the public,
because that creates the best atmosphere.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
