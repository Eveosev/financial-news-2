Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT) 
rallied the most in more than a month on speculation the
government will allow foreign investors to buy shares of the
largest publicly traded company in the  United Arab Emirates .  The shares rose 1.4 percent, the most since June 21, to
9.35 dirhams at the close in Abu Dhabi. Al Khaleej reported
Etisalat will soon allow foreigners to invest in the company,
citing Group Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Abdulkarim Julfar.
The company also known as Etisalat has the heaviest weighting on
Abu Dhabi’s gauge, pushing the  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  up 0.6 percent,
the most since June 21, to 2,485.51. Officials at the company
weren’t immediately able to comment.  Etisalat is owned 60 percent by state-owned Emirates
Investment Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Abu
Dhabi-based company said on June 7 it’s for the federal
government to decide on foreign investments after Emarat Alyoum
reported a law that governs Etisalat may be amended to allow
foreign and institutional investors to hold the shares.  The company’s second-quarter profit rose 17 percent to 1.87
billion dirhams ($508 million), beating analysts’ estimates.
Etisalat comprises 29 percent of  Abu Dhabi ’s index. Six analysts
 recommend investors buy  the shares, while three have a hold
rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
