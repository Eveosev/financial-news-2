Japan ’s stagnating  stock market , its
aging populace and the slowing global recovery are masking
record cash in company accounts and equity valuations that are
close to a 20-year low.  The  1,671 companies  in the  Topix (TPX)  Index, the country’s
broadest measure of equity performance, had 105.2 trillion yen
($1.34 trillion), or 41 percent of their market value, according
to the latest filings compiled by Bloomberg. Almost half have
more cash than debt, a record. At the same time, the index’s 75
percent drop since 1989 pushed prices to 0.86 times  book value ,
4 percent from a two-decade low, data show.  For bulls, the combination makes Japanese shares
irresistible as  earnings  rebound from last year’s earthquake and
chief executive officers spend more on buybacks and dividends
that have doubled since 2006. Bears say the country has been
disappointing investors for the last 20 years and that rising
 cash  shows managers are reluctant to invest as the yen
appreciates and the recovery weakens.  “The price that a Japanese company sells for is
significantly lower than the rest of the world,” said David Herro, the Chicago-based manager of the $8.5 billion Oakmark
International Fund and Morningstar Inc.’s international  fund
manager  of the decade. “What would really ignite the Japanese
stock market is an acceleration of better capital allocation and
a weakening in the yen. I think those are the only two factors
preventing the Japanese from exploding on the upside.”  The Topix declined  1 percent  last week to 726.44, the third
straight loss, as concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened
after Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit rating outlook
for  Germany , the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  Safety Margin  The gauge’s 17 percent drop since March 27 has left it
trading at almost half the valuation of the MSCI World Index
relative to book value, or assets minus liabilities, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The Topix advanced 0.7 percent to
731.74 in  Tokyo  today.  Profits are  forecast  to rise 55 percent this year,
rebounding after last year’s earthquake and nuclear disaster,
and 12 percent in 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Companies from  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  to Kewpie Corp. reported income
this month that beat estimates, driving valuations lower.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Panasonic Corp. are among more than
660 companies reporting results  this week .  Almost half of Topix companies have more cash than debt,
the highest percentage of any developed-country index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the U.S., fewer than 25
percent of  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  companies have leverage
so low, while less than 20 percent of the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  has
that much cash compared with debt, the data show.  Economic Growth  The Topix will rise 24 percent to 900 by the end of 2012,
compared with an estimate of less than 1 percent for the  S&P
500 , according to strategist projections compiled by Bloomberg.
Japan’s economy may grow 2.4 percent this year, more than every
other developed economy, as it rebounds from last year’s natural
disaster, the  International Monetary Fund  forecast this month.  Rising cash and lower valuations have prompted 217
companies in the index to announce they will buy back shares in
2012, after 396  in 2011 , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Dividend yields for companies in the Topix have exceeded
those for the S&P 500 Index since September 2010, Bloomberg data
show. The dividend ratio for Nikkei 225 Stock Average companies
rose to 54 percent in 2011 from 26 percent in 2006, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Giving Back  Topix companies yield  2.6 percent  while those on the U.S.
equity benchmark offer 2.1 percent, the data show. Japan’s 10-
year government bond yields 0.73 percent, compared with the
U.S.’s 1.55 percent. The  Bank of Japan  scrapped this month a 0.1
percent yield floor for government bond purchases, opening the
door to the possibility of negative yields on shorter-dated
securities.  Companies are increasing payouts to lure older investors
who need income greater than that offered by bonds, according to
John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management
Co., which manages $158 billion.  “It’s a gigantic structural shift that is very rarely
noted in the world,” Tokyo-based Vail said in a phone
interview. “It’s a conscious effort by companies to make their
shares more attractive, especially to people who need income as
the population ages. Barring a global disaster, we don’t see
dividends falling in Japan. In fact, we see them increasing.”  When valuations were this low during the financial crisis
of 2008, the Topix rallied 43 percent from March 2009 through
April 2010. The record magnitude-9 earthquake and the ensuing
disaster at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant in March 2011
all but erased those gains.  Bubble Legacy  The Topix is up less than 3 percent since global equity
markets bottomed in March 2009,  compared with  105 percent for
the S&P 500 and 81 percent for the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of developed
markets.  Stocks haven’t recovered since the bursting of the property
market bubble in the early 1990s. More than a decade of
deflation sent the Topix to 726.44 last week from 2,884.80 at
its December 1989 peak. The yen has doubled in value against the
U.S. dollar since then, eroding the competitiveness of exports
and decreasing the value of overseas sales.  Valuations approaching record lows show investors don’t
expect earnings to be sustainable as Europe’s debt crisis
spreads and the Japanese population dwindles. Japan has about
2.4 working-age people for every person over 65 years old now,
compared with 9.1 in 1965, according to  research  presented March
15 by Takehiko Nakao, the vice minister for international
affairs.  Lagging Behind  Government debt will balloon next year to 223 percent of
GDP, up from a projected 214 percent this year, “pushing
Japan’s public finances further into uncharted territory,” the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development said in May. Debt may exceed 1 quadrillion yen,
about $13 trillion, next year, the biggest in the world, the
OECD said.  “The frustrating thing about Japan is the policy
inaction,” said  Sean Darby , chief global equity strategist
Jefferies Group Inc. said in a phone interview. “Judging
economies on relative growth isn’t going to work now for any
fund manager. This is really about who has got loose enough
monetary conditions to deal with a very, very bad deflation
environment. On that score, Japan is lagging behind.”  Rising Cash  Investors should buy assets in U.S. dollars and other
currencies of strong developed nations because Japan may default
within five years, Takeshi Fujimaki, a former adviser to
billionaire investor  George Soros , said in an interview last
month. Should the Japanese government default, the yen may
weaken to 400-500 per dollar, and the yields on benchmark 10-
year bonds could surge above 80 percent, according to Fujimaki,
whose agreement with Soros ended in 2000.  None of that has stopped companies from increasing
earnings. JFE Holdings’s price-to-book ratio declined to 0.4
2013 estimates after the stock  tumbled  24 percent this year.
Japan’s second-largest steelmaker more than doubled first-
quarter  profit  and forecast full-year earnings will beat
estimates.  Seven & I Holdings Co. (3382) , the owner of the 7-Eleven
convenience-store brand, increased  cash  for the past two
quarters to 738.9 billion yen, 35 percent of the company’s
market value, the most among the Topix companies that have
reported earnings for the three months ended June 30. The shares
advanced  16 percent  this year after 2012 earnings expanded 16
percent.  ‘Less Risky’  Kewpie’s cash reached a record 32.2 billion yen in the
three months ending May 31. The  mayonnaise maker  reported
quarterly earnings that exceeded analyst projections on July 2
after raising its first half net income forecast in June. The
stock is up 5.6 percent this year and still trades at its 2013
book value estimate.  “Japanese companies have good balance sheets,” said
 Andrew Smithers , chairman of London-based advisory firm Smithers
& Co. “Japan looks less risky as a market and the buybacks are
a big part of that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
