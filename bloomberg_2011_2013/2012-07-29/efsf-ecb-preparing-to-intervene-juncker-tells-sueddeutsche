Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker, who also heads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said the region’s temporary rescue fund and the
 European Central Bank  are preparing act together to reduce
borrowing costs,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview.  “We act together with the ECB, without touching its
independence,” Juncker was quoted as saying when asked whether
the EFSF was getting ready to purchase sovereign bonds. “If I
say ‘we,’ I mean the euro rescue fund EFSF, that means the 17
euro countries,” he said, adding that “I don’t want to fuel
expectations but I have to say we have reached a decisive
point.”  Juncker added that no decisions have been taken yet on
exactly what action will be taken and it will depend on
developments in the coming days, according to the report. “We
have no time to lose,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
