Jewellery Quarter Bullion Ltd., the
holding company behind online business  BullionByPost , may be
sold after hiring advisory firm Grant Thornton International
Ltd., the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing the founder.  Rob Halliday-Stein, who owns 90 percent of the U.K.â€™s
biggest Internet gold and silver dealer he founded in 2009, told
the newspaper no final decision had been made. A sale would
raise additional funds to hire staff and expand overseas, in
particular to  Spain , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
