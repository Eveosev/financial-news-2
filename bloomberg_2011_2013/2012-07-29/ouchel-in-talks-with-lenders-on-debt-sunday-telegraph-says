Mouchel Group Plc (MCHL)  is in talks with
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and other lenders to reduce its
debt of 180 million pounds ($283 million), the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Mouchel is considering a debt-for-equity swap with the
banks, including  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the
newspaper said. The company hasn’t ruled out a so-called
prepackaged administration process or raising funds from a new
investor in a “highly dilutive” deal, the report said.  Mouchel Chief Executive Officer Grant Rumbles has pledged
to reveal a restructured balance sheet by July 31 and said there
will be limited value for current shareholders, the Sunday
Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
