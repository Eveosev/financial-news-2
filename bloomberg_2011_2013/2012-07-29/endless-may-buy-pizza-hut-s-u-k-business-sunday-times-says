Pizza Hut ’s U.K. business, which is
being sold by Yum! Brands Inc., may be acquired by buyout firm
Endless LLP after other bidders dropped out, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The proposed deal hinges on whether Endless can reach an
agreement with Yum on royalty payments, the newspaper said.
Other bidders were Risk Capital Partners Ltd. and Rutland
Partners LLP, according to the report.  Pizza Hut has 340 restaurants in Britain and employs about
16,000 people, the Times said. Yum took full control of Pizza
Hut in Britain in 2006, when it bought  Whitbread Plc (WTB) ’s 50
percent stake in the business for about 112 million pounds ($176
million), according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
