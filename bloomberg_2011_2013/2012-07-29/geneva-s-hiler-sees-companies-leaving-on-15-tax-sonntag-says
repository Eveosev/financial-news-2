Geneva plans to charge a flat
corporate tax rate of 15 percent, which will probably result in
some companies that were paying less under special agreements
leaving the Swiss canton, Sonntag reported, citing an interview
with David Hiler, Geneva’s finance minister.  The canton will lose about 350 million Swiss francs ($359
million) in revenue and its municipalities will lose about 150
million francs in lower tax from companies that weren’t paying
preferential rates, the newspaper quoted Hiler as saying. Geneva
will ask the federal government to contribute 200 million francs
to compensate, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
