Aviva Plc (AV/)  is preparing to sell its
U.S. life-insurance unit after receiving offers from financial
companies and private-equity buyers, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The division, which Aviva bought in 2006 for 1.8 billion
pounds ($2.8 billion), is now valued at 1 billion pounds, the
newspaper said. Pat Regan, the company’s chief financial
officer, has been spending time in the unit’s headquarters in
Des Moines, Iowa, to prepare for the sale, which  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  may oversee, according to the report.  Aviva spokesman Nigel Prideaux declined to comment when
reached by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
