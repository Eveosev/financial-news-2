Jordyn Wieber of the U.S., the
individual all-round world champion, won’t compete in the
Olympic gymnastics final after her teammates Gabrielle Douglas 
and Alexandra Raisman qualified ahead of her in  London  today.  “It is a bit of a disappointment,” Wieber, 17, said after 
the event at North Greenwich Arena. “It has always been a dream 
of mine to compete in the all-round final of the Olympics. But 
I’m proud of Aly and Gabby and happy that they reached the 
all-round and that I was able to help the team get to the finals.”  Raisman, 18, scored 60.391, ahead of 16-year-old Douglas’s 
60.265 and Wieber’s 60.032, with only two able to advance.  Team USA, which also includes McKayla Maroney, 16, and Kyla
Ross, 15, scored 181.863 in the third qualifying event today. The
U.S. won the gold medal at Atlanta in 1996 with the
“Magnificent Seven” and won silver in Athens and Beijing.  “This is kind of a heartbreak day for some,” Douglas told
reporters. “I’m very happy for Aly, she deserves it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
