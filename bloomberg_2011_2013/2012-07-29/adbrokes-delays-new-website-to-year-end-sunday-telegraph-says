Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  will again postpone
the debut of its new website to the end of the year after poor
customer feedback and technical problems, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Richard Glynn, chief executive officer of the U.K. operator
of about 2,100 betting shops, will tell investors this week the
delays will cut first-half digital profit to about 50 percent of
the 31 million pounds ($49 million) achieved a year earlier, the
newspaper said.  As a result, full-year profit may fall to the lowest since
2004, according to an analyst quoted in the article. Ladbrokes
issued a profit warning for its digital operations on June 28,
sending shares tumbling as much as  14 percent .  To contact the reporter on this story:
