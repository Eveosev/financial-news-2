AEA Technology Group Plc (AAT)  is in talks
on giving control of the company to its employee pension fund to
rid itself of obligations to the plan, which has a 165 million-
pound ($260 million) deficit, the Sunday Times reported.  The environmental consulting firm, which has a market value
of less than 500,000 pounds, is also considering giving a stake
in the company to the government-backed Pension Protection Fund
in return for assuming its liabilities, the U.K. newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
