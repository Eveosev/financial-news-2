Nottinghamshire batsman  James Taylor 
is set to make his Test debut for England against South Africa
as the hosts aim to rally from their innings defeat in the
opening match.  The 22-year-old comes into the 13-man squad for the second
cricket Test at Headingley in Leeds as a replacement for  Ravi Bopara , who is “unavailable for selection for personal
reasons,” the England and Wales Cricket Board said on its
website.  “It is important that this squad regroups and focuses on
preparing for the second Test,” national selector Geoff Miller
said in the statement. “This is a talented squad with plenty of
international experience and they will be determined to
improve.”  England lost the opening match of the three-Test series by
an innings and 12 runs. The second Test starts Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
