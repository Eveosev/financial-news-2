Hedge funds  and other money managers
cut  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  for a fifth consecutive week to
their lowest level in three months, according to data from ICE
Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 161,340 lots in
the week ended Oct. 1, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The reduction of 6,405
contracts, or 3.8 percent, curbs net-longs to their lowest since
July 2.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 318,428, a 4.4
percent reduction from a week earlier that brings their net-short position to its smallest since April 23.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Brent futures slipped 0.6 percent to $107.94 a barrel in
the week to Oct. 1 and traded at $108.36 as of 12 p.m. local
time on the ICE exchange.  Swaps dealers curtailed net-long positions in Brent for a
second week, by 2.8 percent to 172,864, the lowest level since
April 9.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European gasoil fell for a
fourth week, shrinking 3.2 percent to 60,357 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
