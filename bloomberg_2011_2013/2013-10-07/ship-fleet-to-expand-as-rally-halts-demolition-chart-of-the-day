The biggest rally in  iron-ore  freight
costs since 2009 is prompting shipowners to end the industry’s
biggest scrapping program in at least three decades as older
vessels bring in more money.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how rates, in blue, for Capesize
ships hauling 160,000 metric tons of iron ore rose to a 34-month
high of $42,211 a day on Sept. 25. Scrapping levels are in red.
Owners have paid off debt used to buy older vessels, making them
cheaper to run, so they won’t opt for scrapping as long as the
rally allows them to profit from the ships, according to Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo.  Chinese investment in rail, buildings and infrastructure
will rise 20 percent this year, creating demand for another 135
million tons of steel, Shanghai-based Citic Securities Co. says.
That would require 200 million tons of iron ore, used to produce
the alloy, enough to fill 180 Capesizes, according to Fearnley
Consultants A/S, a research company in Oslo.  Capesize fleet capacity is up 75 percent since 2008, says
IHS Maritime, a Coulsdon, England-based maritime researcher.  “Freight rates are expected to return to profitable levels
- even for older tonnage,” said Stavseth, whose recommendations
on shipping company shares returned 26 percent in the past year.
“This will potentially lead to higher net fleet growth.”  World trade in iron ore will grow 6 percent to 1.17 billion
tons this year, with  China  taking two-thirds, according to
 Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the biggest shipbroker. Earnings for Capesize
carriers sailing to China from  Brazil  at a $40,000 daily rate
assuming a voyage time of 45 days will equate to $1.8 million,
spurring owners to keep trading their ships, Stavseth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
