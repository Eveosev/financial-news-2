New Jersey  lawmakers scheduled a
hearing to discuss rejoining a carbon-emissions trading system
that serves nine northeast states.  The State Assembly’s Telecommunication and Utilities
Committee will listen to arguments on Oct. 10 about  Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative Inc.  and its efforts to curb climate
change, according to an e-mailed statement today from Upendra
Chivukula, the Democratic committee chairman.  RGGI operates a carbon-trading system designed to reduce
greenhouse-gas emissions in the northeast. New Jersey was part
of the group that agreed to form the program in 2005. Governor
 Chris Christie  pulled the state out in November 2011. He’s since
vetoed two bills that would have compelled the state to rejoin.  “Retreating from RGGI was a tactical blunder and we
believe it is crucial that New Jersey rejoin,” Chivukula said
in the statement. He said the effort stands a better chance
after  Hurricane Sandy  devastated New Jersey last year,
underscoring the need to address climate change.  Christie, a Republican who faces re-election in November,
has said the group didn’t protect the environment and was an
unnecessary tax on consumers.  RGGI’s current members are the six New England states, New
York, Delaware and Maryland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
