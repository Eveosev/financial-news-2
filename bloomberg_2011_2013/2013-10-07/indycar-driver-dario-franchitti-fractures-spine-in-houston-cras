Dario Franchitti, a four-time IndyCar
Series champion, suffered a spinal fracture when his car went
airborne after a collision and slammed into a metal safety fence
during the final lap of the Houston Grand Prix.  Franchitti was awake and alert after the crash, which also
sent an IndyCar official and two spectators to a local hospital
for evaluation. Franchitti, who won’t need surgery on his back,
also suffered a concussion and a  fractured right ankle , IndyCar
medical director Michael Olinger said.  Franchitti, 40, had surgery on his ankle and was kept
overnight at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston.  A three-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, Franchitti
made contact with Takuma Sato’s car in Turn 5 of the 1.7-mile
temporary track after the Japanese driver slid offline as his
tires lost grip. Franchitti’s car was launched into the air and
broke apart as it crashed into the fence, throwing a wide swath
of debris onto the track and into the stands.  Part of the safety fence was ripped apart and Indycar said
13 people were injured, with 11 treated at the scene.  “On the last lap I caught the marbles and brushed the wall
and lost momentum,” Sato said, referring to the balls of rubber
from tires that collect on the outside of the track. “A couple
cars passed me as I was offline and in Turn 5. I got very loose,
and Dario and I came together.”  Sato and driver E.J. Viso, who was also caught up in the
crash, were evaluated at the scene and released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
