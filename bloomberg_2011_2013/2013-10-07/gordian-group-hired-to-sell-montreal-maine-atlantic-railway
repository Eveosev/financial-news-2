Montreal,  Maine  & Atlantic Railway
Ltd., whose runaway oil train exploded and killed 47 people in
Quebec in July, hired investment bank  Gordian Group LLC  to sell
the carrier, which could occur by the end of the year.  The Canadian monitor and Chapter 11 trustee set Oct. 31 as
the deadline for interest from potential bidders, according to
documents filed today in  bankruptcy court  in Bangor, Maine. A
stalking horse bidder will be selected by Nov. 15 and an auction
will occur on Dec. 13, followed by court approval for the
winning bid three days later, according to the filings.  Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway filed for bankruptcy
protection in August because of potential liability from the
crash,  Canada ’s worst rail disaster since 1910. The Canadian
Transportation Agency suspended the carrier’s operating
certificate after the accident, due to insufficient liability
coverage.  The town of Lac-Megantic is seeking financial aid to
restore the gutted community and a civil complaint alleges a
failure to take steps to prevent a derailment.  The Hermon, Maine-based carrier is still working to create
a formal claims process for the families of the victims and
other claims holders. The carrier will present a formal process
to the court for approval by Nov. 30, according to the filings.  The case is In re Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd.,
13-bk-10670,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Maine (Bangor).  To contact the reporter on this story:
