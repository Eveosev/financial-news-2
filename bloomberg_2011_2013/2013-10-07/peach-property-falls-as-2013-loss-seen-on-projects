Peach Property Group Ltd. (PEAN)  fell the
most in more than two years after the Swiss developer of luxury
homes said it would report a loss this year after unexpected
costs related to construction projects.  The  shares  declined as much as 10 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since September 2011, and were down 9.3 percent
at 9.98 francs at 1:30 p.m. in Zurich, where Peach Property is
based. That gave the company a market value of 48.8 million
francs ($54 million). Almost 37,000 shares traded hands, more
than seven times the average daily volume of the past three
months.  Peach Property will have additional costs of about 15
million euros after the insolvency of its general contractor on
two of its projects in Berlin, according to a statement on Oct.
4 after markets closed. The “vast majority” of these costs
will affect this year’s earnings, which are “expected to be
negative as a result,” it said.  The company expects the projects to generate net returns of
around 55 million francs, compared with a previous forecast of
75 million francs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
