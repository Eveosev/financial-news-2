Cintas Corp. (CTAS)  must defend against a
gender-discrimination suit pressed by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission after the  Supreme Court  turned aside the
uniform-supply company’s appeal.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said the EEOC could move ahead with the suit,
which centers on the company’s hiring practices in Michigan.  The federal agency says that from 1999 to 2002, all but six
of the 268 Michigan sales representatives hired by the
Cincinnati-based company were male.  Cintas argued at the Supreme Court that, before filing
suit, the EEOC should have done more to identify, investigate
and attempt to resolve the claims of the alleged individual
victims.  The case is Cintas v. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, 12-1347.  To contact the reporter on this story:
