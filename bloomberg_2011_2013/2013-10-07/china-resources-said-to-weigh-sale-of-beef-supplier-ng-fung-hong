China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , the
state-backed retail and beer conglomerate, is evaluating options
for its meat distribution unit in  Hong Kong  that could include a
sale, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  China Resources may start a strategic review of the
business as early as this year, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the information is private. The company
took then Hong Kong-listed Ng Fung Hong Ltd. private in 2001 in
a deal that valued it at HK$5.1 billion ($658 million).  Ng Fung Hong, started in 1951 in Hong Kong, handles all
imports of live cattle from the mainland. The Hong Kong
government  said  in May that it was considering requests to open
the import market to competition, citing concerns that
“frequent” price increases by Ng Fung Hong was hurting demand
for fresh beef.  The company raised wholesale beef prices six times last
year, the  South China Morning Post  reported in December.  Ng Fung Hong imported 23,194 head of cattle last year,
according to a January article by the SCMP, which cited figures
disclosed by the company.  Ng Fung Hong ’s gross profit fell 11
percent last year to HK$25 million, on sales of HK$396 million,
the newspaper reported.  Vincent Tse, general manager of  China Resources ’ Strategic
Planning and Investors Relations Department, said he was unaware
of any potential sale of Ng Fung Hong.  When China Resources bought Ng Fung Hong in 2001, the
company also operated businesses including supermarkets and
beverages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
