Brazilian swap rates fell as
economists surveyed by the central bank lowered their 2014
inflation outlook, adding to wagers policy makers will signal
that the pace of increases in borrowing costs will slow.  Swap rates due in January 2017 declined three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 11.25 percent at 11:08 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the lowest level on a closing basis since Sept. 25. The
real appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 2.2110 per dollar.  Economists lowered their forecast for annual inflation at
the end of 2014 to 5.95 percent from 5.97 percent, according to
the median forecast of about 100 analysts in a central bank
survey published today. Inflation was slower than 6 percent in
the year through mid-September for the first time in nine
months, the national statistics agency reported last month.  “I have no reason to question the majority view that they
will raise to 9.75 percent this year and probably not going to
go further than that,”  Siobhan Morden , the head of  Latin
America  fixed income at Jefferies Group LLC, said in a telephone
interview from  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
