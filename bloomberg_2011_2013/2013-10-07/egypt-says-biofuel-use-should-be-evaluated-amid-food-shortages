The use of grain and oilseed crops to
make biofuels should be “looked at in great depth,” as
countries face  food  shortages and high prices,  Egypt ’s minister
for agriculture and land reclamation said.  “The problem of the increase of food prices has been very
difficult in Egypt,” Aymane Farid Abu Hadid said through a
translator during a webcast of a United Nations’ Food &
Agriculture Organization meeting today in  Rome . “We have large
numbers of people suffering from malnutrition, which is why
those foodstuffs should be used for food and not fuel.”  Egypt is historically the world’s largest wheat importer.
The government is providing its poorest consumers with food
ration cards, he said. The country is working to improve storage
and production facilities to reduce the amount of food lost
after harvest, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
