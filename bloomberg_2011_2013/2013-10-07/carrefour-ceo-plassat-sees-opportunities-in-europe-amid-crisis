Carrefour SA (CA)  Chief Executive Officer
Georges Plassat said he still sees “opportunities” in Europe
amid the debt crisis, which he predicts will have an effect on
domestic consumption for as long as five more years.  “In Europe, the average revenue per capita is still the
highest in the world,” Plassat said today in a speech at the
World Retail Congress in Paris. “We will certainly go through
the difficult period we are facing today within the next four-to-five years.”  Carrefour, France’s biggest retailer, is focusing on
Europe,  Latin America  and China after retrenching from markets
where it viewed its prospects as weak, Plassat said. First-half
 profit  rose 4.9 percent as lower prices and refurbished stores
spurred a revival in its domestic market, more than offsetting
soft demand in southern Europe.  There is still room for hypermarkets, Plassat said of
Carrefour’s biggest store format, adding: “I am totally
convinced that clicks and mortar is the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
