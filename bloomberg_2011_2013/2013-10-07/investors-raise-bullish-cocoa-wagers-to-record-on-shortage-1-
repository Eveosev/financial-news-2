Money managers raised bullish bets on
cocoa traded in London to a  record  as global shortages loom for
the 2013-14 season that started this month, according to data
from NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.  Investors were net-long, or betting on higher prices, by
64,759 futures and options in the week ended Oct. 1, the
Commitments of Traders report on the exchange’s website showed
today. That was the largest bullish bet since publishing of
trader holdings began in 2011 and compared with the previous
record of 63,419 contracts in the week ended Sept. 24. The beans
for December delivery fell 0.5 percent in the latest week.  “Although speculators are heavily positioned from the long
side, providing an element of risk for profit-taking, we think
the net length is justified, as it is one of the few markets
that look tight right now across the agri and softs space,”
 Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said
in a report e-mailed today. “We expect sizeable deficits for
both 2013-14 and, tentatively, for 2014-15 too.”  Global cocoa supplies will trail demand by 173,000 metric
tons in the year started Oct. 1, according to Macquarie. A
113,000-ton shortage is estimated for the following season, said
Haque, who correctly forecast a third-quarter price rally. Cocoa
entered a bull market in London last month. Global chocolate
sales will rise 6.2 percent next year to a record $117 billion,
according to Euromonitor International Ltd.  Exchange Inventories  “As we get closer to the Halloween and Christmas peak
demand period, demand for immediate delivery will intensify,”
Haque said in the report. “With cocoa stock levels at Liffe not
exactly brimming, prices will need to stay high to encourage
greater production among the second-tier producing countries, as
well as to ration grindings.”  In robusta coffee, money managers increased their  net-short
position , or bet on falling prices, to 6,690 futures and options
in the week ended Oct. 1, the data showed. That was up from
6,116 contracts a week earlier. The beans used to make instant
coffee slid 3.7 percent in the period.  Investors reduced bets on rising white-sugar prices by 20
percent. They were  net-long  by 8,831 futures and options,
against 11,042 contracts a week earlier, exchange data showed.
The sweetener rose 0.4 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers were net-short by 440
contracts, down from 451 lots a week earlier. The grain advanced
1.2 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
