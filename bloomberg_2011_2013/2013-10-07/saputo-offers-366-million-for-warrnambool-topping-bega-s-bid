Saputo Inc. (SAP) , Canada’s largest dairy
processor, agreed to pay about C$378 million ($366 million) for
Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Factory Co., bettering a rejected
bid by  Bega Cheese Ltd. (BGA)   Saputo offered A$7 cash a share for the maker of Sungold
and Warrnambool cheddar, according to a statement from the
Montreal-based company. The deal, recommended by Warrnambool’s
board, is priced at 8.4 percent more than Warrnambool’s close of
A$6.46 yesterday.  The Canadian company’s bid tops a cash and share offer for
the Warrnambool that operates two dairy processing plants in
southeastern  Australia  by Bega Cheese, its largest shareholder.  Saputo is planning on “increasing existing capacity or
building additional capacity,” as it seeks to tap rising demand
for dairy products in Asia, Warrnambool Chairman Terry Richardson said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
