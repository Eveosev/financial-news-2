American Realty Capital Properties
Inc. (ARCP)  changed the terms of its bid for American Realty Capital
Trust IV, a nonlisted real estate investment trust under the
same management company, to value the company at about $3
billion.  American Realty Capital Properties offered $9 in cash,
0.5190 of its shares and 0.5937 of its perpetual preferred
securities, for each share of the other REIT, the New York-based
companies said in a statement today. The bid is valued at $30.43
a share, based on the Oct. 4 closing price, they said.  On July 2, American Realty Capital Properties said it
agreed to buy American Realty Capital Trust IV for 2.05 of its
shares or $30 in cash for each share in the other REIT. That
deal was worth about $31 per share.  “This amendment was precipitated by recent challenging
conditions in the capital markets that had a material effect on
the economic terms” of the original agreement, the companies
said.  Both REITs are managed by American Realty Capital, a
sponsor of nontraded REITs. The transaction is expected to be
completed in the fourth quarter, the companies said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
