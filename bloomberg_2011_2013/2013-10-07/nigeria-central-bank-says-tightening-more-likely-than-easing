The Central Bank of Nigeria is more
likely to tighten monetary policy than ease it in the months
ahead, Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  “We’re likely to remain where we are but if we’re going to
move at all, we’re more likely to tighten than to ease,” Sanusi
told journalists today in Paris. “I would advise against
precipitate easing only to turn around after a few months and
tighten.”  Sanusi said that inflation is under control and Nigeria’s
currency, the naira, has held up well relative to other emerging
market currencies. The Monetary Policy Committee kept the policy
rate at a record high 12 percent for a 12th consecutive meeting
on Sept. 24.  Inflation eased to 8.2 percent in August from 8.7 percent
in the previous month, staying within the central bank’s target
of less than 10 percent.  The naira has weakened 2.6 percent against the dollar this
year and may come under more pressure as President Goodluck
Jonathan estimates a 12 percent drop in oil and gas revenue in
2014. Sanusi said last month the bank is committed to use its
currency reserves to support the naira. The central bank sells
foreign currency at twice-weekly auctions to keep the naira
within a range of 3 percentage points around 160 a dollar.  “Inflation should be down to under 8 percent by
December,” Sanusi said. “The exchange rate has remained fairly
stable, it’s pushing the band but it’s not lost anything near
what we saw in  India , South Africa or  Ghana , so we’ve done very
well on that score.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
