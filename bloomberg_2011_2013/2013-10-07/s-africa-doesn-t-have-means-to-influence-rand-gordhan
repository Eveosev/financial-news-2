The rand’s 16 percent slide against
the dollar this year is benefiting exporters and South African
authorities don’t have the resources to influence the currency,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  “There are some signs that the more agile exporters are
taking opportunities now that they couldn’t take two years ago
or a year ago,” Gordhan said today in an interview in  London  on
Bloomberg TV’s ‘The Pulse’ show. “We would appreciate less
volatility, particularly for players in the real economy who
require more stability, more certainty.”  The rand slump this year and its implied volatility against
the dollar is the highest of 16 major currencies monitored by
Bloomberg. The rand fell 0.3 percent to 10.0180 per dollar as of
12:17 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Countries that have tried to intervene in foreign exchange
markets to manage their currencies “lost a lot of money,”
Gordhan said. “We do not have those sorts of resources in the
South African case,” he said.  Gross reserves  increased 4.3 percent to $50 billion in
September after the government sold $2 billion of Eurobonds, the
central bank said today. That compares with $376 billion in
 Brazil .  While it’s “regrettable” that strikes in some industries
in recent weeks took longer to be resolved than expected, many
of the settlements are for three years, providing stability,
Gordhan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
