French investigative magistrates have
dropped charges against former President Nicolas Sarkozy over
allegations he took advantage of the mental frailty of heiress
 Liliane Bettencourt  to fund his 2007 electoral campaign,  Agence
France-Presse  reported, citing unnamed people close to the case.  Ten other people, including former Budget Minister  Eric Woerth , will have to stand trial next year, AFP said.  A spokeswoman for Sarkozy didn’t immediately return phone
and e-mail messages. Sarkozy didn’t answer questions from
journalists as he emerged from a lunch at the Paris mosque, AFP
reported.  The magistrates placed Sarkozy under formal investigation
last March 21, even though the Bordeaux prosecutor had
recommended dropping the case against the former president for
lack of evidence. The case had been moved to Bordeaux in a
search of an impartial venue.  Sarkozy has always denied any wrongdoing. He has said he
had visited the 90-year-old daughter of the founder of the
 L’Oreal SA (OR)  cosmetics company, but simply in his role of mayor of
Neuilly, the Paris suburb where Bettencourt has one of her
homes.  The death of her husband Andre Bettencourt in November 2007
set in motion a family dispute over how Liliane, France’s
richest woman according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index,
disposed of her fortune and whether she was mentally fit to make
such decisions.  Sarkozy faces several other cases, including one involving a
French submarine sale to Pakistan and another related alleged
campaign funds from late Libyan dictator  Muammar Qaddafi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
