Former  Duke University  quarterback
Thad Lewis will be promoted from the Buffalo Bills’ practice
squad and start on Oct. 13 against the Cincinnati Bengals, coach
Doug Marrone said today.  A 25-year-old who has played in one National Football
League game, Lewis replaces rookie starter EJ Manuel, who
sprained his right knee in a 37-24 loss to the Cleveland Browns
on Oct. 3. Manuel was replaced in the game by rookie Jeff Tuel,
who completed eight of 20 passes for 80 yards, with an
interception.  Undrafted out of Duke, Lewis started last year’s season
finale for the Browns against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was
22-for-32 for 204 yards, one touchdown and one interception in a
24-10 loss, and was waived in the offseason.  Marrone has said Manuel will miss a few weeks while he
recovers from a sprained lateral collateral ligament in his
right knee.  The Bills (2-3) host the Bengals (3-2).  To contact the reporters on this story:
