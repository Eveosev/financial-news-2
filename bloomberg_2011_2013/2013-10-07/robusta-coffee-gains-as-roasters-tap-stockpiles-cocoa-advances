Robusta coffee rose for a fourth day
in  London , extending the biggest weekly gain in almost 20
months, as roasters tap inventories before the start of the crop
in leading grower Vietnam. Cocoa advanced.  Robusta rallied 6.1 percent last week, the most since the
week ended Feb. 10, 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
Stockpiles with a valid grading certificate in warehouses
monitored by the NYSE Liffe exchange fell 19 percent from two
weeks earlier to 60,380 metric tons as of Sept. 30, bourse data
showed. Prices reached the lowest level since 2010 last month.  “When the price fell in recent months, a number of
suppliers, especially in Vietnam, the main producing country,
opted to hold back some of last season’s crop,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in a
report e-mailed today. “Consequently, processors have had to
turn increasingly to exchange reserves.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in November climbed 0.8 percent
to $1,722 a ton by 10:48 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Arabica
coffee for delivery in December was unchanged at $1.144 a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Harvesting of Vietnam’s 2013-14 crop will start at about
the end of the month, with the first shipment only possible in
mid-November, Nguyen Chi Cuong, chief executive officer at
trading company NC Group Ltd., with offices in  Ho Chi Minh City ,
said by e-mail Oct. 1. Exchange-monitored stocks will reach
52,000 tons by year end, the lowest since May 2000, the average
of 10 trader estimates compiled by Bloomberg in August showed.  Robusta prices are likely to “ease back” before a record
crop in  Vietnam , Kona Haque, a London-based analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd., said in a report e-mailed today. The nation will
gather 29 million bags in the 2013-14 season and the global
market will move into a surplus of 2.4 million bags, compared
with a 900,000-bag shortage in 2012-13, she said.  Cocoa for delivery in December gained 0.5 percent to 1,703
pounds ($2,736) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for the same delivery
month advanced 0.6 percent to $2,627 a ton on ICE.  Refined, or white, sugar for delivery in December added 0.4
percent to $494 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in March
rose 0.3 percent to 18.53 cents a pound in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
