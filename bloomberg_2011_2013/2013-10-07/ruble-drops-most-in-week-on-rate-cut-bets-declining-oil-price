The ruble fell the most in more than
a week against Bank Rossii’s target basket of currencies as oil
plunged and investors bet inflation slowing to a 13-month low
will allow the central bank to cut  interest rates .  Russia’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent against Bank
Rossii’s target basket of dollars and euros to 37.4571 by 12:53
p.m. in Moscow, heading for the steepest one-day decline since
Sept. 26. The yield on ruble-denominated benchmark debt due
February 2027 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 7.64 percent.  Consumer prices  increased 6.1 percent from a year earlier
in September, compared with 6.5 percent in August, the Federal
Statistics Service said on Oct. 4. Russia’s central bank, which
is due to hold a monetary policy meeting on Oct. 14, has kept
the main lending rates unchanged for the past year as inflation
remained above its target range of 5 percent to 6 percent.  The September inflation data make the possibility of a rate
cut “increasingly more possible as we head into year-end,”
Tradition analysts said in an e-mailed note. A deterioration in
the current account surplus means the ruble will probably
underperform in coming sessions, they said.  Russia ’s current-account surplus shrank to $1.1 billion in
the third quarter, compared with $5.83 billion a year ago, Bank
Rossii said Oct. 3. Net capital outflow from Russia was $12.9
billion over the three months through September, compared with
$7 billion in the previous quarter.  Oil Declines  Crude, Russia’s chief export earner, fell 1.2 percent to
$108.14 per barrel in  London , heading for the lowest close in a
week. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 1.2 percent to
$102.59 as output in the  Gulf of Mexico  resumed after a tropical
storm weakened and the U.S. came closer to breaching its debt
ceiling.  The failure of U.S. lawmakers to pass a budget and avert a
government shutdown last week is fueling concern they won’t
agree on raising the $16.7 trillion debt limit. House Speaker
 John Boehner  said on ABC yesterday that he doesn’t intend to let
the government default.  An index of 20 emerging-market currencies compiled by
Bloomberg snapped five days of gains, declining 0.2 percent to
94.3038. The ruble weakened 0.2 percent against the dollar to
32.2545 and dropped 0.5 percent against the euro to 43.8250.  To contact the reporter on this story:
