Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
e-commerce company, will hire 6,000 permanent employees in three
new logistics centers in  Poland  to build capacity for further
expansion in Europe.  The Seattle-based company plans to open two centers near
Wroclaw in southwestern Poland and one facility near the city of
Poznan, 150 miles east of Berlin, Amazon said in a statement
today. The Poznan and one of the Wroclaw centers will open in
August 2014, while the second Wroclaw logistics hub will start
operations in mid-2015. In addition to full-time employees, as
many as 9,000 temporary staff could be employed at peak periods.  Poland’s central location in Europe, proximity to Amazon’s
European clients and access to a skilled workforce were among
the reasons for Amazon’s investment decision, Tim Collins,
director of retailer’s European operations, told reporters at
news conference in Warsaw. Amazon won’t close any of its
existing European logistic infrastructure, he said.  The three sites will be integrated into the network of 25
centers in  Europe  as part of an expansion strategy to serve
customers in every European country, including Russia and
Ukraine, Collins said. He declined to disclose the value of
Amazon’s planned investment, saying only it would be in the
“hundreds of millions of euros.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
