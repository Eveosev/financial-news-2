U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
is scheduled to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on
the federal debt limit on Oct. 10 starting at 8:30 a.m., the
committee said in an e-mail today.  Lew has said Congress needs to increase the $16.7 trillion
debt ceiling or the government runs the risk of defaulting on
its payments. The U.S. will have about $30 billion in cash left
on Oct. 17, according to the Treasury Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
