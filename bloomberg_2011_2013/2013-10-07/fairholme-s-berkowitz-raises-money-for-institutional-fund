     Oct. 7 (Bloomberg) --- Bruce Berkowitz, manager of the $8.3
billion  Fairholme Fund (FAIRX) , is opening a private fund for
institutional investors who agree to tie up their money for at
least one year.  Fairholme Partnership LP has a minimum $5 million
investment and can buy a broad range of securities, Miami-based
Fairholme Capital Management LLC said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. The fund started in January with money from employees
and currently oversees about $140 million. It returned 23
percent through Sept. 30, according to the statement.  Berkowitz, who was named Morningstar Inc.’s domestic stock
manager of the decade in 2010, said in February that he wanted
to move beyond mutual funds and create a less restrictive
vehicle that allowed him to tie up capital for longer periods
and buy as much of a stock as he wanted.  The Fairholme Fund, a mutual fund, gained 29 percent this
year, better than 97 percent of peers. The fund had 44 percent
of its assets in New York-based insurer  American International
Group Inc. (AIG)  as of May 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
