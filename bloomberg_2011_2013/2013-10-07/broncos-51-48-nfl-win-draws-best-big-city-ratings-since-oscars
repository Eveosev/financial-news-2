The Denver Broncos’ 51-48 comeback
victory over the Dallas Cowboys on CBS drew the highest big-city
rating of any National Football League game this season and the
largest since the Oscars.  The Broncos’ win yesterday, in which  Peyton Manning  threw
four touchdowns and Matt Prater kicked a game-winning field goal
with no time remaining, was seen in 18.6 percent of U.S. homes
in the top 56 metered television markets,  CBS Corp. (CBS)  said citing
Nielsen Media Research. Full national ratings from the 115.6
million U.S. TV households are due later.  The overnight rating was the highest for any television
program since February’s Academy Awards, which received a 26.1
rating on ABC, according to the release. The previous highest-rated NFL broadcast of the season was the 18.5 drawn on Sept. 29
by News Corp.’s Fox unit for a trio of games, including the
Broncos hosting the  Philadelphia Eagles , CBS said.  The Broncos and Cowboys each gained more than 500 yards in
their game at Arlington, Texas, including five touchdown passes
from Dallas quarterback  Tony Romo . The Cowboys opened the game
with a 14-0 lead, and led 48-41 with less than three minutes
remaining.  It was the fourth highest-scoring game in NFL history,
according to ESPN.  To contact the reporters on this story:
