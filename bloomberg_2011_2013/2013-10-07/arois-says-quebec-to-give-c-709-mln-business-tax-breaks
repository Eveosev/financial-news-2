Quebec will invest about C$2 billion
($1.94 billion) by 2017 on measures such as tax credits and
power subsidies with a view to bolstering employment in the
province, Premier Pauline Marois said.  Canada’s second most populous province expects the measures
to trigger C$7.6 billion in new investments and create more than
43,000 jobs by 2017, Marois said today at a televised press
conference in  Montreal . Economic output in the province will
increase by C$3 billion annually by 2017, according to Finance
Ministry  estimates .  Among other measures, Marois said Quebec plans to give
C$709 million in tax breaks for companies, and spend C$581
million to promote research and development by 2017. The
province will also subsidize hydroelectric power to lure
investment, and set aside about C$15 million to pay for a
feasibility study on a rail line that would allow for the
transport of iron ore from the Labrador Trough region, she said.  “These are major actions,” Marois told reporters. “There
are measures for the short, the medium and the long term. We
think this will generate billions in investments that will
increase our tax receipts.”  Quebec  had a deficit of C$1.8 billion though the quarter
ended June 30, the provincial Finance Ministry said in a monthly
 report  dated Sept. 27. Budgetary balance for the fiscal year
“will be achieved,” the ministry also said, adding that the
government will present an economic and financial update before
the end of the year.  Quebec’s economy shrank 0.7 percent in the April-June
period, according to Quebec’s statistics agency, compared with
growth of 0.4 percent for the country as a whole, according to
Statistics Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
