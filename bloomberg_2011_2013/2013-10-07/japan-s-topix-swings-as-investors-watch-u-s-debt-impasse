Japanese  shares  fell, with the Topix
index extending its longest losing streak since July 2012, as
the yen climbed amid concern about the standoff over the U.S.
debt limit and government shutdown.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker, slipped 1.5
percent as  Japan ’s currency added to last week’s gains against
the dollar. TV maker Sharp Corp. and utility Tokyo Electric
Power Co. led declines on the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average, falling
8.2 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. SoftBank Corp. gained
2.9 percent after data showed NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan’s largest
mobile phone carrier, lost subscribers last month even after it
started selling Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  The Topix slid 1.4 percent to 1,147.58 at the close in
Tokyo, with all but two of its 33 industry groups retreating.
The measure lost 4.4 percent last week, the most since the
period ended Aug. 9. The Nikkei 225 fell 1.2 percent today to
13,853.32. The yen added 0.4 percent to 97.10 per dollar.  “With so much uncertainty, it’s hard to actively invest in
the stock market,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , the Tokyo-based chief
fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $6 billion. “It’s not like the U.S. is going to default,
so investors will probably continue buying on dips. But things
could be volatile and we may see some big declines on some days,
so the timing of when to buy back shares is difficult.”  The Topix declined seven straight days as a partial U.S.
government shutdown began and concern grew about a possible
default if the debt ceiling isn’t raised on time. The last time
the measure recorded longer stretch of losses was in the nine
trading days through July 18, 2012. The gauge was still up 33
percent this year, making Japanese equities the best performers
among major developed markets.  Debt Ceiling  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sank 0.6
percent. The measure rose 0.7 percent in  New York  on Oct. 4,
trimming its weekly decline to 0.1 percent.  The shuttering of government in the U.S. enters a second
week, with an Oct. 17 deadline for raising the borrowing limit
approaching. House of Representatives Speaker  John Boehner  said
Republican lawmakers won’t increase the ceiling without
packaging it with other measures.  While the  Federal Reserve  releases minutes of last month’s
meeting this week, data from payrolls to retail sales will be
delayed as long as the closure of government continues, making
it more difficult to assess the state of the  U.S. economy  to
decide on when to reduce stimulus.  Risk Aware  Toyota, which counts  North America  as its biggest market
for sales, lost 1.5 percent to 6,090 yen. Sony Corp., Japan’s
biggest television maker, declined 1.8 percent to 1,980 yen.
 Nintendo Co. (7974) , a gaming console maker that gets almost 40 percent
of sales from the Americas, dropped 1.7 percent to 10,800 yen.  “The market consensus is that the U.S. won’t end up
defaulting,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in  Tokyo  at
Resona Bank Ltd. “However, investors are aware of the risks and
will keep refraining from buying.”  Sharp tumbled 8.2 percent to 291 yen. The company may set
the price for as much as 166.4 billion yen ($1.7 billion) in new
shares to be issued to the public as early as today, Sharp said
last month. The shares have lost 20 percent over the past six
days, with  short interest  rising to 41 million shares as of
Sept. 27, the most in four months. Short interest is the total
number of shares investors have sold short and have not bought
back.  Tokyo Electric Power, also known as Tepco, sank 7.6 percent
to 488 yen. The utilities claim that radioactive water leaking
into the sea from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant is
confined to the coast doesn’t make scientific sense, according
to a U.S. researcher who surveyed waters off the site last
month.  GPIF Allocations  Japan’s state-run Government Pension Investment Fund, the
world’s biggest manager of retirement savings, plans to boost
investment in  growth stocks  to increase returns and may
eventually allocate several trillion yen to such equities, the
Nikkei newspaper reported on Oct. 5, without saying where it got
the information.  The 121 trillion yen fund will initially invest several
billion yen in a new domestic index focused on returns on
equity, governance and trading volume, Nikkei said.  Also over the weekend, the Financial Times reported that
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not include labor reforms as part
of his upcoming policies. Abe cited strong opposition within
Japan to liberalization of employment rules, the newspaper
reported, based on an interview.  Yoshinoya, Softbank  Yoshinoya Holdings Co., which operates fast-food chains,
dropped 2.1 percent to 1,097 yen after cutting its forecasts on
higher food and electricity costs.  Among stocks that rose, SoftBank gained 2.9 percent to
7,480 yen, the biggest single support to the  Topix. (TPX)  NTT DoCoMo
said that it lost a net 66,800 users in September, even after
adding iPhones to its lineup in a bid to regain market share
from SoftBank and KDDI Corp. SoftBank added 270,700 and KDDI
232,700 users, according to the carriers.  DoCoMo sank 1.2 percent to 1,542 yen, while KDDI was
unchanged at 5,160 yen.  The Topix may yield 1.92 percent in dividends in the next
12 months, up from 1.7 percent in the past year, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. The measure traded at 1.20 times
book value today, compared with multiples of 2.49 for the S&P
500 and 1.74 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index on Oct. 4. The
Japanese gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at 18.19 today,
compared with its five-year median of 19.34  To contact the reporter on this story:
