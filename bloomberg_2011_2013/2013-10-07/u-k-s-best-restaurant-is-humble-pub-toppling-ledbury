The Hand & Flowers, a provincial pub where the three-course set lunch costs just 19.50 pounds ($31.39), last night toppled the Ledbury as the U.K.’s best restaurant, a title the  London  venue had held for three years.  The Hand & Flowers owner, chef Tom Kerridge, presents the BBC TV series,  “Proper Pub Food.”  His inn in Marlow was the first pub in the world to win two Michelin stars, in 2011. He placed third in the  National Restaurant Awards  last year.  Lunch may include roast tomato soup with green olive tapenade and comte gougere; roast quail with allotment vegetables and smoked beurre blanc; and blackberry fool with garden apple sorbet and fruit tuile. Two courses cost 15 pounds.  The awards are based on the votes of an academy of 150 members, made up of chefs, restaurateurs, food writers, critics and other gastronomes. I am a voter for the event, which is organized by “Restaurant” magazine.  The results were announced at a dinner attended by dozens of chefs at the Old Brewery, in the  City of London . The guest of honor was Joan Roca of El Celler de Can Roca, the Catalan establishment that holds the title of World’s Best Restaurant.  The Top 100, with last year’s ranking in parentheses:  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts and leisure section of  Bloomberg News .
