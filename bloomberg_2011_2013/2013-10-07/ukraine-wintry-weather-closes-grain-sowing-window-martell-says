A snowstorm that hit  Ukraine  and
southern  Russia  over the weekend halted crop planting, adding to
the possibility of a “sharply” reduced winter-grain harvest in
2013-14, Martell Crop Projections said.  “Winter wheat is the main crop in jeopardy, but rapeseed
production would also shrink from exceptionally adverse
weather,” Gail Martell, who heads the Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin-based forecaster, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Temperatures in Ukraine last week were 7 to 9 degrees
Celsius (12.6-16.2 degrees Fahrenheit) below normal and mostly
below freezing, delaying winter-grain development. The harvest
could be reduced by a drop in planting as well as incomplete
sprouting and smaller plants due to the cold, Martell wrote.  Russian producers are facing obstacles getting winter
grains planted after September showers in the Black Earth,
central Volga and Southern districts brought rainfall that was
150 percent to double normal, according to Martell.  “Extremely wet seed beds are detrimental for proper wheat
establishment,” Martell said.  In Siberia, wheat development was behind after spring
planting delays and cool summer growing conditions, and
harvesting of the crop was not yet finished when snow fell last
week, according to the forecaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
