Romania ’s Deputy Prime Minister Liviu Dragnea was charged with abuse of influence during last year’s
referendum for impeaching the president, the country’s anti-corruption prosecutors said.  Dragnea, one of the leaders of Prime Minister Victor Ponta’s ruling party, used his influence as head of Teleorman
county in southern Romania to increase turnout in an attempt to
validate a July 29, 2012 ballot for impeaching President Traian Basescu, the prosecutors said in a statement published on the
National Anti-Corruption Directorate  website today . Dragnea said
the accusations are “absurd and groundless.”  The rivalry between Basescu and Ponta pushed the leu to
record lows and prompted a surge in borrowing costs last year.
Renewed political uncertainty in the run-up to elections next
year may weigh on investor and consumer sentiment, the
 International Monetary Fund  said last week.  “I’m as guilty as mister Dragnea of wanting to rid the
country of Basescu,” Ponta said in a televised speech today,
adding that he won’t oust Dragnea, who also said he wouldn’t
resign.  The leu was little changed at 4.4278 per euro at 3:12 p.m.
in Bucharest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
