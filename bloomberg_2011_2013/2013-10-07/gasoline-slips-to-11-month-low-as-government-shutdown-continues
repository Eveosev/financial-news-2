Gasoline slid to the lowest level in
11 months as the U.S. began a second week of a partial
government shutdown that threatens to weaken the economy and
reduce fuel demand.  Futures fell to the lowest intraday level since Nov. 5. The
closure continued as President  Barack Obama ’s administration
said it won’t negotiate over funding the government and House
Republican leaders demanded concessions, including defunding the
Affordable Care Act. A potential lapse in U.S. borrowing
authority if Congress doesn’t raise the debt ceiling also looms.  “The oil market is concerned about the continued impact of
the shutdown on petroleum product demand,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 3.07 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.5769 a gallon at 10:19 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 14 percent above the
100-day average.  Futures also sank a second straight day as Tropical Storm
Karen appeared to have caused minimal disruption to production
and distribution on the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coasts.  “People felt there was enough product to make it through
the tropical storm and the expectation was for minimal impact,”
Lipow said.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 45 cents to $6.13 a barrel. The fuel
flipped to a 2-cent  discount  to Brent from a 6-cent premium Oct.
4. It’s the first time since December 2011 that Nymex gasoline
was below Brent on ICE Futures  Europe .  Pump Prices  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to $3.346 a
gallon, the lowest level since Jan. 25 and 46 cents below a year
ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery slipped 2.53
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.9737 a gallon on trading volume
that was 8.8 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 53 cents to $22.65 a
barrel while the  premium  over Brent narrowed 8 cents to $16.42 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
