Light Louisiana Sweet crude
strengthened to the highest level in a month after Tropical
Storm Karen shut in more than 2.9 million barrels of  Gulf of
Mexico  crude production over the past four days.  LLS, the benchmark light, sweet oil on the  Gulf Coast ,
gained 90 cents to a premium of $4 a barrel more than West Texas
Intermediate at 3:49 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the highest level since Sept. 4.  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  were among companies
that evacuated workers and shut in oil and natural gas
production from Gulf of Mexico platforms because of Tropical
Storm Karen. About 491,000 barrels were still shut in today even
as companies have started returning workers, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil strengthened by 75 cents to $3.75
a barrel more than WTI. Thunder Horse crude strengthened by 20
cents to a $1.20 premium.  Mars Blend, a medium, sour crude, strengthened by 20 cents
to a discount of $1.65 a barrel. Poseidon crude narrowed its
discount by 40 cents to $2.40. Southern Green Canyon crude
strengthened by 30 cents to a $3.50 discount.  693,345 866,807 855,355 491,162  To contact the reporter on this story:
