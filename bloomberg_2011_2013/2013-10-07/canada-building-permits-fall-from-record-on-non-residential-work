Canadian  building permits  fell in
August from the previous month’s record on a decline in
commercial projects such as retail stores and office buildings.  The value of municipal permits dropped 21.2 percent to
C$6.34 billion ($6.14 billion), following a revised 21.4 percent
jump in July, Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
forecast a 7.4 percent fall according to the median of eight
responses to a Bloomberg survey.  The  Bank of Canada  is counting on a shift in demand to
business investment and exports from debt-fueled  consumer
spending , a process that has taken longer than expected, Senior
Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said in a speech last week. The
central bank has kept its  overnight interest rate  at 1 percent
since September 2010 to encourage borrowing and spending.  “It’s a little bit worrying to see the weakness on the
non-residential side, though it did show a strong gain last
month,” said  Paul Ferley , assistant chief economist at Royal
Bank of Canada in Toronto. “It’s not indicating non-residential
is poised to start leading growth.”  Canada’s dollar declined 0.3 percent to C$1.0322 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:43 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 96.88
U.S. cents.  July Record  Permits for  non-residential construction  fell 37.9 percent
to C$2.43 billion from the July record of C$3.91 billion, with
commercial projects dropping 45.8 percent to C$1.40 billion.  Industrial permits declined 1.2 percent to C$526 million
led by manufacturing plants, following July’s 17.7 percent rise,
the agency said. Institutional permits dropped 36.7 percent to
C$507 million led by Ontario schools and medical buildings.  Residential permits fell 5.4 percent to C$3.91 billion in
August. Single-family housing permits declined 3.0 percent to
C$2.17 billion and for projects such as apartments and
condominiums were down 8.3 percent to C$1.74 billion.  “With this decline, the trend in the value of building
permits has become relatively flat since the beginning of
2013,”  Statistics Canada  said in the report.  Toronto, Canada’s largest city, was the biggest driver of
the August decline with permits falling 35.9 percent to C$1.25
billion on commercial, institutional and multifamily buildings.
 Vancouver  permits rose 13.6 percent to C$583 million on
multifamily housing and commercial buildings, Statistics Canada
said.  The value of permits was 15.2 percent lower in August than
the same month a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
