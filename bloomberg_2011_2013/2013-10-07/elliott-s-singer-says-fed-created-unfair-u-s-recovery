Paul Singer , the billionaire who runs
hedge-fund firm Elliott Management Corp., said the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s economic-stimulus program has created an unfair
recovery.  “The problem with quantitative easing is that it’s a
gimmicky, indirect solution to a problem that has a direct
solution,” Singer said today at the Wall Street Journal’s Heard
on the Street conference in  New York . Other paths to creating
growth through education, tax and wage policies haven’t been
pursued, he said.  “The average investor in stocks and bonds is doing fine
but the average person in America is in fear of his or her job,
or their children’s job and the price of stuff,” Singer said.
“That’s what I mean by an unfair and distorting policy.”  The possibility of the Fed reining back its stimulus is
“off the table,” he said. The central bank’s policy-setting
 Federal Open Market Committee  refrained in September from
reducing the $85 billion pace of its monthly securities buying,
saying it needed to see more evidence of a strong economy before
starting to phase out the purchases.  Singer, 69, started New York-based Elliott in 1977. The
firm has about $21 billion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
