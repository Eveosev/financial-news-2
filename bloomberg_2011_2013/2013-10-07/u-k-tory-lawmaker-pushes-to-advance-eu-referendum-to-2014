A Conservative lawmaker is seeking to
bring forward a referendum on European Union membership to 2014,
in a challenge to U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s authority.  Adam Afriyie told the  BBC  his plan had the support of many
Tory colleagues. Cameron has said that if he’s still prime
minister after the 2015 election, he’ll renegotiate Britain’s
membership of the bloc and hold an in-out referendum by the end
of 2017.  “It’s in Britain’s national interest there’s a referendum
sooner rather than later,” Afriyie said. “Businesses need
certainty.”  His plan is opposed by James Wharton, the Conservative
whose bill to legislate for a referendum Afriyie is trying to
amend. Wharton said that his backbench bill, which isn’t
supported by Liberal Democrat lawmakers in the ruling coalition,
is “very fragile” and could be sabotaged by the amendment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
