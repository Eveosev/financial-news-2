Sharp Corp. (6753) , a supplier of screens to
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) , will raise as much as 137 billion yen ($1.4 billion)
selling stock at a discount as the Japanese company seeks to
rebuild its  balance sheet  after record annual losses.  Shares will be priced at 279 yen apiece, which is 4.1
percent lower than today’s closing price, Osaka-based Sharp said
in a regulatory filing.  Japan ’s largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays will raise as much as 119.1 billion yen from a public
share sale and 17.4 billion yen from selling stock to  Makita
Corp. (6586) ,  Denso Corp. (6902)  and  Lixil Group Corp. (5938) , it said.  Sharp posted  losses  totaling 921 billion yen during the
past two financial years amid intensified competition in LCDs
and flat-panel TVs. The supplier for Apple’s iPhone and iPad is
tapping into the Japanese equities rally after previously
selling minority stakes to Samsung Electronics Co. and  Qualcomm
Inc. (QCOM)   Sharp last month said it would raise as much as 166.4
billion yen from the sale of stock. The company’s shares have
slumped 23 percent since the plan was announced Sept. 18.  The stock  dropped  8.2 percent to close at 291 yen in Tokyo
trading before the announcement. Sharp shares have  fallen  4
percent so far this year, while Japan’s benchmark Topix index
has gained 33 percent.  In August, Sharp reported a  net loss  of 18 billion yen for
the June quarter, narrower than the 138 billion-yen loss a year
earlier. Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold
and administrative expenses, totaled 3 billion yen for the
quarter, compared with a loss of 94 billion yen a year earlier,
the company said. Sales rose 33 percent to 608 billion yen.  The maker of Aquos TVs is forecasting net income of 5
billion yen for the year to March 2014, its first annual profit
in three years, after job cuts. The company sold a stake in its
largest LCD plant to Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou last year
to boost sales through his Foxconn Technology Group, the world’s
biggest contract manufacturer of electronics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
