French power for next month rose to a
record as colder-than-usual temperatures are poised to boost
electricity demand for heating and  Electricite de France SA (EDF) 
delayed the start of two nuclear reactors.  Baseload electricity for November climbed as much as 3.4
percent as the similar Nordic contract gained 2.1 percent to a
record and power in  Germany  advanced to a six-month high,
according to broker and exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.
Weather forecaster Metraweather cut its outlook for  France  next
week by 5.4 degrees Celsius (9.8 degrees Fahrenheit) to 8.9
degrees, according to data using the GFS model compiled by
Bloomberg at 1241pm Paris time.  “From Thursday on, we will see significantly colder
weather, especially in France,” Ricardo Klimaschka, a power
trader at Energieunion GmbH in Schwerin, Germany, said today by
e-mail. “And the market is worried that France can’t bring its
plants back in the market on time.”  Colder weather increases demand for electricity to heat
buildings. France gets about three-quarters of its power from
EDF’s nuclear reactors, a bigger proportion than any other
country, and President  Francois Hollande  has vowed to cut the
share to about half.  Baseload French power for November, for delivery around the
clock, climbed as high as 56.60 euros ($76.78) a megawatt-hour,
a record for the November contract and the highest for next-month delivery since March 28. It was at 56.15 euros at 3:54
p.m. Paris time.  In Germany, power for delivery in November climbed as much
as 4 percent to 44.55 euros a megawatt-hour, the highest price
since April 16. The next-year German contract, a European
benchmark, gained as much as 1.5 percent to 38.60 euros a
megawatt-hour, the biggest increase since Sept. 12.  Central Europe  “Temperatures in most of central  Europe  will cool, up to 2
or 3 degrees below normal for the second half of this week,”
Byron Drew, MetraWeather’s lead forecaster, said today in an e-mailed report. “In Germany, temperatures remain up to 1 or 2
degrees below normal for most of next week.”  Polish power for next year increased 0.2% to 156.30 zloty a
megawatt-hour, the highest level since Sept. 18. Czech power for
November gained as much as 4.1% to 43.50 euros a megawatt-hour,
the highest level since it started trading Sept. 2.  Nordic baseload power for November rose as much as 2.1
percent to 43.50 euros a megawatt-hour, the highest price  since
the contract started trading May 3, according to Nasdaq OMX
Group’s energy exchange data in Oslo.  In  Sweden , the region’s biggest economy, temperatures next
week are forecast to average 7.8 degrees Celsius compared with
an earlier forecast for 10 degrees and a seasonal average of 8.4
degrees, the MetraWeather data show.  Gas Gains  Gas for next month in the Netherlands, mainland Europe’s
biggest market for the fuel, rose 1.1 percent, the biggest jump
in 16 weeks, to 27.27 euros a megawatt-hour before falling to
27.25 euros, broker data show. That increases costs for power
stations burning the fuel.  EDF delayed the start of its 880-megawatt Fessenheim-1
nuclear reactor by 23 days to Oct. 31, according to data on the
website of French grid operator Reseau de Transport
d’Electricite. The company pushed back the start of its 1,330-megawatt Paluel-1 unit by four days to Oct. 13, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
