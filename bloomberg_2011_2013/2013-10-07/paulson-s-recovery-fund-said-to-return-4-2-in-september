Billionaire hedge-fund manager  John Paulson  posted a 4.2 percent gain last month in a fund that
seeks to profit from a U.S. economic recovery, according to a
person with knowledge of the returns.  Paulson’s Recovery Fund has risen 39 percent this year,
said the person, who asked not to be named because the
information is private. The September gain came from investments
in asset-management firms, hotels and insurance companies, the
person said. Paulson’s recovery strategy has about $2.2 billion
in assets.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for New York-based Paulson & Co.
at WalekPeppercomm, declined to comment on the returns, which
were reported earlier today by Reuters.  Paulson, 57 and known for making $15 billion for his
investors in 2007 by betting against subprime mortgages before
the housing collapse, is rebounding from losses tied to gold and
two years of wrong-way calls on the economy. The average hedge
fund returned 0.9 percent last month and 6.5 percent in 2013
through September, based on the Bloomberg Hedge Funds Aggregate
Index.  Paulson’s merger fund, Paulson Partners, climbed 2.9
percent in September, extending its 2013 gain to 14 percent,
said the person. Paulson Partners Enhanced, a version of the
strategy that has borrowed money, rose 2.6 percent in September
and about 25 percent for the year. The merger strategy, the
firm’s biggest, with about $6 billion, benefited from health-care and energy transactions, the person said.  Paulson’s Advantage fund, which seeks to profit from
corporate events such as takeovers and bankruptcies, rose 1.2
percent last month and 12 percent for the year, and the
Advantage Plus fund, which includes leverage, gained 1.3 percent
in September and 16 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
