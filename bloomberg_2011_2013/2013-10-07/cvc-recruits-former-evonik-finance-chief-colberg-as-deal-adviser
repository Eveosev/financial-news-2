CVC Capital Partners Ltd. said it has
appointed Wolfgang Colberg, a former finance chief at German
chemical maker  Evonik Industries AG (EVK) , to advise on strategy and
deals in Germany and Switzerland.  Colberg will support CVC’s offices in Frankfurt and Zurich
in his role of strategic adviser, the buyout firm said in a
release today. CVC owns a 17.9 percent stake in Essen, Germany-based Evonik.  The 53-year-old, with a Ph.D in economic and social
sciences, is the latest chemical-company executive to take up a
role in private equity. In April, Advent International Corp.
hired Gunter von Au, a former CEO of Sued Chemie, after the
catalyst maker was acquired by  Clariant AG (CLN)  for about $2.7
billion.  “After having worked in major corporates for decades, I am
excited to bring my experience to the table on the investors’
side,” Colberg said in the statement.  Other executives hired by CVC as advisers include  Jeffrey
Keefer , who spent 35 years at DuPont Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
