Scania AB (SCVB) , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by Volkswagen AG, fell the most in more than a month
in Stockholm trading after Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
Scania’s earnings may suffer from a strong krona.  The  shares dropped  as much as 2.1 percent to 134.1 kronor,
their steepest decline since Aug. 27. They lost 1.7 percent to
134.6 kronor as of 10:33 a.m. local time, with trading volume at
26 percent of the daily average in the past three months. Scania
was the third-biggest decliner on the Stockholm OMX 30 benchmark
index today.  BofA Merrill Lynch today cut its recommendation on Scania
to neutral from buy after lowering its forecasts for the
company’s earnings before interest and taxes by 15 percent for
this year and by 11 percent for 2014. The bank said profit will
suffer from the Swedish krona’s strength against other
currencies, including  Brazil ’s real. Soedertaelje, Sweden-based
Scania has this year reported rising market share in the South
American country.  “There could be some moderate risk to earnings in the
second half of 2013 due to translation impact from the Brazilian
real,” BofA Merrill Lynch said in the note. It added that there
is “little upside to 2014 forecasts with consensus already
forecasting 18 percent growth” and that there is “potential
for an overhang in EU truck orders in the first half of 2014.”  Of the 26 analysts that cover Scania and share their
recommendations with Bloomberg, 11 advise their clients to  sell
the shares  while eight have hold recommendations and seven
advise clients to buy the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
