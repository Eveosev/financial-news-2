Genting  Hong Kong  Ltd., the largest
shareholder in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., ordered a
1,682-passenger-cabin cruise ship from a German shipbuilder for
707.2 million euros ($960 million) to meet Asian demand.  The new ship is scheduled for delivery from Meyer Werft
GMBH on Oct. 12, 2016, the company said in a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday. Genting said it plans to use the
vessel to serve China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, where it is based.  The vessel will “enable the group to take advantage of
growing demand for cruise business in the Asia Pacific market
and the port infrastructure developments in Hong Kong and Asia
which enable large cruise ships to dock,” Genting said.  Hong Kong this year opened a HK$8.2 billion ($1.1 billion)
cruise terminal on the site of the former Kai Tak airport, as
the city’s government seeks to draw wealthy Chinese travelers
and become Asian’s hub for luxury liners. The facility can
accommodate the world’s largest cruise ships.  Genting Hong Kong owns a 37.7 percent stake in  Norwegian
Cruise Lines (NCLH) , the third-largest U.S. cruise operator, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Genting is controlled by Lim Kok Thay, billionaire chairman of Kuala Lumpur-based  Genting Bhd. (GENT) ,
Southeast Asia’s largest casino operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
