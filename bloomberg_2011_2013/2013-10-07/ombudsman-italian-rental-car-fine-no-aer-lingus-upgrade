Tom Huse  Wilmington, North Carolina Face, meet palm: Why would no one correct this obvious error? To find out, Ombudsman first called a representative of the Italian Tourism Board, whose only advice to Huse was to carry evidence of the mix-up when driving in Italy in the future and to repeatedly call Pisa officials—preferably with help from an Italian speaker—until the mistake was corrected. This was not a satisfactory solution, in Ombudsman's opinion, so we wrote to Hertz. In a welcome gesture, the rental car company paid his ticket and assured Huse that his record would be cleared. Ombudsman applauds Hertz for going above and beyond to remedy this case of mistaken identity. Mishaps like this can be chalked up to plain bad luck, but travelers should be aware of local driving regulations and restrictions. Some cities (such as Singapore, Oslo, London—and Pisa) have congestion zones where vehicles are charged a fee, and rental companies have no obligation to alert customers. Driver beware—after all, it's your rap sheet. Earl Latterman Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Luck of the Irish, eh? Airplane seats are never guaranteed—even if you pay an additional fee. An inconvenient policy, yes, but it makes sense given that when carriers have to change aircraft, the seat configuration often changes, as happened in this case. An airline representative explained that the change of equipment happened on the day of travel, and that the Lattermans could not be seated in an exit row since FAA regulations allow only able-bodied passengers in those seats. Aer Lingus did, however, refund the amount the couple paid for the extra legroom and offered a goodwill credit of $500. Most carriers give free upgrades only to frequent fliers, as thanks for their loyalty. In an ideal world, Aer Lingus would have upgraded the Lattermans in a gesture of kindness, but these days you get what you pay for—sometimes less. More From  Condé Nast Traveler :
