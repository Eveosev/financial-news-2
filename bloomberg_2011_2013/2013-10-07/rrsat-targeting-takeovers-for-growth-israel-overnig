RRSat Global Communications Network
Ltd. (RRST) , the Israeli distributor of live television programming
from Playboy Enterprises Inc. to the  National Football League ,
is seeking to buy companies in the U.S. and  Asia  to boost
growth, Chief Executive Officer Avi Cohen said.  “We are increasing our global footprint with our
acquisitions,” Cohen said in an interview at Bloomberg’s
headquarters in New York yesterday. “We are looking at another
deal in the U.S. as well as one in Asia. In  Russia , we will grow
our business after opening our office there and we will look
into developing a strategy for  Latin America  after 2014.”  RRSat, which acquires content, adds captions, inserts
advertisements, and distributes programs via satellite, cable
and Internet in more than 150 countries, posted the lowest
revenue growth on record in 2012. The Airport City, Israel-based
company made two acquisitions in the past 11 months to enhance
its live entertainment offerings and video on-demand services,
which include distribution rights to the NFL and the  Super Bowl 
outside the U.S., Cohen said.  Shares of RRSat added 0.5 percent to $7.55 yesterday,
extending its advance this year to 13 percent. The Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index of the most-traded Israeli companies in
the U.S. slipped 0.3 percent to 100.55. Alon Blue Square  Israel 
Ltd. rose to a two-month high as  SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) 
plunged 6 percent.  Given Imaging Ltd. (GIVN) , the maker of cameras that
can be swallowed, increased its premium to its Tel Aviv shares
to the highest in a week.  High Definition  RRSat’s revenue increased 0.4 percent last year, the
slowest growth on record, after advancing at an annual average
of 13 percent in the three previous years. Sales growth will
 accelerate  5.4 percent this year to an all-time high of $119.5
million, according to the average estimate of two  analysts 
compiled by Bloomberg.  The global shift from standard definition to high
definition (HD) content is a major “market driver for our
growth,” Cohen said. “The number of HD channels globally will
increase from 3,000 in 2012 to about 16,000 in 2021 and managing
this content is more complex and more costly. Content providers
will continue to outsource the distribution of HD content to
companies like ours.”  RRSat operates in a $9 billion distribution market that
includes telecommunications companies, satellite operators,
broadcasters, and service providers, according to an Oct. 2013
 investor presentation . Service providers make up approximately
30 percent of the distribution market, and RRSat forecasts the
segment will represent a larger portion of the total market as
the shift to HD intensifies.  Elbit Contract  Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT) , the Israeli defense systems developer,
rose 1.3 percent to $53.03 in New York yesterday. The Haifa,
Israel-based company said Oct. 6 that it won a three-year, $33
million contract to supply surveillance equipment to an Asian-Pacific  air force . The Tel Aviv shares added 0.1 percent to
189.90, or $53.41, at 10:02 a.m. local time.  Blue Square, Israel’s second-largest grocery store chain,
jumped 4.3 percent to $3.99, leading gains on the Bloomberg
Israel-US gauge. Trading volume was 2.4 times the daily average
of the  past the three months . The Tel Aviv shares this morning
widened the premium to New York, advancing 0.1 percent to 14.51
shekels, or $4.08.  Given, based in Yokneam, Israel, added 0.9 percent to
$19.32 in  New York . The Tel Aviv stock narrowed their discount
today, gaining 1.2 percent to 68.20 shekels, or $19.19.  SodaStream, the maker of home soda machines, fell to a one-week low of $62.43, the first drop in five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
