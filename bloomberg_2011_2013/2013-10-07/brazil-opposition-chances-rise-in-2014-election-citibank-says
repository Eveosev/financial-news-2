The increasing unity of Brazil’s
opposition increases the likelihood President  Dilma Rousseff 
will have to face a runoff in the October 2014 election,
Citigroup Inc. said.  The failure of former Environment Minister  Marina Silva  and
former Sao Paulo state Governor  Jose Serra  to launch their own
bids has consolidated strength in the two remaining opposition
candidates, Citi Research analysts  Stephen Graham  and Fernando Siqueira wrote in an Oct. 6 note on the company’s website. Silva
joined the opposition PSB Party on Oct. 5.  “The opposition to ’Dilma’ and her PT party is suddenly
stronger,” Citi said in its report. “It sets up chances of
forcing a second round in which PSDB and PSB would join
forces,” Graham and Siqueira wrote.  Rousseff’s lead over her closest rival widened to 22 basis
points in September from 8 points at the height of protests
against bus fares, corruption and poor public services in July,
according to surveys by polling agency Ibope. Still, with the
latest poll giving her support of 38 percent, she remains short
of the 50 percent needed to avoid a second round of voting. None
of the major candidates is “anti-market,” Graham and Siqueira
said.  The swap contract maturing in January 2014 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.432 at 10:44 a.m. The
real gained 0.07 percent to 2.2105 against the  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
