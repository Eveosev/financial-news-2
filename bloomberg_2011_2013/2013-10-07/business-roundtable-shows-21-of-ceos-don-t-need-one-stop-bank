The  Business Roundtable , a group
whose executive committee includes  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  head
 Jamie Dimon , said 21 percent of surveyed chief executive
officers think it’s unimportant to have a “one-stop shop” for
their financial needs.  Fifteen percent said it’s “very important” to have access
to a one-stop company for domestic and international financial
services and 34 percent said it’s important, according to the
 Business Roundtable , which surveyed its 212 CEOs in July and
August and got 148 responses, according to a report released
today from the Washington-based group.  Leaders of the biggest U.S. lenders have said their
customers need large, international banks to finance operations
in the U.S. and overseas. Of the survey’s respondents, 98
percent said their companies rely on “large globally engaged
U.S. banks” for services to help domestic operations, and 89
percent relied on them for foreign dealings.  The Business Roundtable is a group of CEOs whose members
include Bank of America Corp.’s  Brian T. Moynihan , BlackRock
Inc.’s Laurence D. Fink and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Lloyd C. Blankfein, as well as the leaders of Microsoft Corp., Johnson &
Johnson and General Electric Co. The group’s members represent
companies with a combined workforce of 16 million employees and
$7.4 trillion in annual revenue, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
