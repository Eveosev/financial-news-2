The U.S. Supreme Court expressed
interest in  Medtronic Inc. (MDT) ’s appeal in a lawsuit by a man who
was rendered a paraplegic after surgeons implanted a system that
infuses pain medication into the spine.  The justices today asked the Obama administration for
advice on a federal appeals court decision letting the suit go
forward. The suit accuses Medtronic of failing to tell federal
regulators about previous problems with the SynchroMed EL pump
and catheter.  Medtronic argues that patients can’t use state law to sue
device makers for allegedly violating a duty under federal law.
The appeals court rejected that argument, allowing the suit by
Richard Stengel and his wife under  Arizona  state law.  Previous Supreme Court decisions have interpreted the
federal law that governs medical-device approval as limiting the
types of suits patients can press. In a 2008 ruling, the court
said device makers can’t be subjected to additional requirements
under state product-liability law.  That ruling left room for patients to sue under state rules
that are “parallel” to federal requirements. The San
Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the
claims by the Stengels met that test and could go forward.  The case is Medtronic v. Stengel, 12-1351.  To contact the reporter on this story:
