RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest
utility, delayed the start of a hard coal plant in Germany by
three months after chemicals accidentally entered a boiler.  RWE will start selling power from its 764-megawatt Hamm-D
coal plant March 1, 2014, instead of Nov. 30 this year, Lothar Lambertz, a company spokesman, said by phone from Essen today.  “Despite highest precautionary measures and intense
preparation, some chemicals, including hydrochloric acid, got
into the boiler of block D in Hamm,” Lambertz said. “We can’t
say anything on how much this delay is going to cost us.”  RWE is planning two blocks at its site in Hamm. The other
block, unit E, is also scheduled to start producing power in
March 2014, Lambertz said. RWE owns 77 percent of the  Hamm power
plant , according to its  website .  Dortmunder Energie- und Wasserversorgung GmbH, a regional
utility that owns 5.6 percent in the two blocks, expects annual
losses of as much as 16 million euros ($21.7 million) from
granting power deliveries at a fixed price from Hamm-D, Martina
Sprotte, a spokeswoman, said by phone from Dortmund today.  Handelsblatt reported the Hamm-D delay yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
