Clifton Robbins, founder and chief
executive officer of investment firm Blue Harbour Group LP, said
he is waiting for fear of a U.S. default to hurt financial
markets because it will bring an opportunity to buy assets.  “We’re not going to default -- I am waiting for the fear
because I am a buyer,” Robbins said today at the Wall Street
Journal’s Heard on the Street conference in New York. “I’m not
looking forward to that day, and I hope Washington sorts things
out, but it will be a good buying opportunity.”  Robbins, whose Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm oversees
about $1.6 billion, said he is already buying assets and will be
even more aggressive in doing so as the deadline for the U.S. to
raise its debt limit comes closer.  U.S. stocks fell today as lawmakers remained deadlocked
over raising the limit to avoid a default. Barring a
congressional shift, the U.S. will exhaust its borrowing
authority on Oct. 17 and would run out of funds to pay all of
its bills sometime between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31, according to the
Congressional Budget Office.  Bruce Richards, who runs hedge-fund firm Marathon Asset
Management LP, said on the same conference panel that while he
doesn’t expect the U.S. to default on its debt, complacency in
the financial markets may disappear next week.  “When you come closer to Oct. 17, the more risk and
uncertainty and we will move from complacency to fear,” said
Richards, whose firm is based in New York. “We don’t have that
fear right now. Maybe distrust.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
