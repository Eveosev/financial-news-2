U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
is to say that a referendum on the nation’s membership in the
European Union “will happen” as he urges supporters of staying
in the EU to speak up.  The Liberal Democrat leader will signal his willingness to
do another deal with Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
Conservatives who’ve pledged a referendum by 2017, according to
the text of a speech that Clegg is scheduled to give in London
today. He’ll ask business leaders who oppose leaving the EU to
make their position plain.  “The  Conservative party  want one in 2017, regardless of
what’s happening in Europe at that time: it’s a date chosen for
internal party management as much as anything else,” Clegg will
say. “The Liberal Democrats believe it will be far better to
have the referendum when a serious change to  Europe ’s rules,
affecting the U.K., next arises. But we all agree that it will
happen at some point or another.”  Clegg will also propose that in a renegotiated EU bloc,
countries using the single currency shouldn’t be able to outvote
those who don’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
