The U.S.  Supreme Court  turned away a
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  appeal that sought to force arbitration of
California lawsuits over the brakes in Prius cars.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said Toyota couldn’t enforce the arbitration
clauses in its dealers’ purchase agreements with customers.  The consumers say the anti-lock brake system in the model-year 2010 Priuses had a defect that made the cars harder to
stop, particularly on rough surfaces. The consumers, who don’t
allege they were injured, say Toyota failed to resolve the
problem in a 2010 recall. They urged the Supreme Court not to
hear the appeal.  The case is Toyota Motor v. Choi, 12-1230.  To contact the reporter on this story:
