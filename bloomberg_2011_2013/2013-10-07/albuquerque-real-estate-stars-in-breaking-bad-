In addition to turning the concept and execution of a TV drama series on its head, the genre-bending AMC hit “Breaking Bad” also has contributed to the pantheon of TV shows that have turned certain swaths of real estate into co-stars. In the case of “Breaking Bad,” the showplace has been  Albuquerque, NM , where a string of real locations have become tourist attractions and photo opportunities throughout the five seasons of the Emmy Award-winning show. The dusty, rocky, light-infused desert location of this monster series gave it a particular look and feel. In homage to the show’s conclusion, here’s a look at the places where Walter White and his “Yo-Yo” sidekick, Jesse Pinkman, go from artistic meth-makers to drug kingpins in the ABQ. My name is … As Walt begins his transformation from suburban-dwelling teacher to drug lord, the very first words uttered on the show place him squarely at the imagination-deprived dwelling in which he somewhat cowardly had been just getting by: “My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico.” In reality, Walter’s home is at  3828 Piermont Dr NE, Albuquerque, NM 87111 . Either way, by the end of the series, the condition of Walt’s home mirrors his own descent into hell. Gasoline has been soaked into the rugs. The pool is a sordid mess of scum and leaves. And there’s a chain-link fence run around the entire perimeter of the property, since the Drug Enforcement Administration is hunting for Walt. No, Mr. White, you can’t go home again. Yo, like, Jesse Pinkman lived here For a punk druggie, Jesse Pinkman lives in a very nice crib. But very soon into Season 1, we learn the house where Walter and Jesse make quite a mess was left to Jesse by his aunt. Without spoiling any more of the plot, let’s just say that Jesse finds himself out of luck at the nice abode. On the show, the address is shown as 9809 Margo St. But in reality this single-family home on a quarter-acre lot is at  322 16th St SW, Albuquerque, NM 87104.  The  Huning Castle neighborhood,  where homes are listed for sale from $220,000 to just shy of $1 million, is located near the Albuquerque Country Club. Hank and Marie’s house Hank is a federal Drug Enforcement Administration officer. He is married to Marie, who is the sister of Walter’s wife, Skyler. Tracking with us so far? Anyway, Hank and Marie are a big part of the show, and their superior station in life compared to Walt and Skyler’s is demonstrated by their nice stucco home at  4901 Cumbre Del Sur Ct NE, Albuquerque, NM 87111 . Duplex love It’s not easy finding a  rental  when you have no job or documentable source of income, but Jesse manages to finesse an apartment from an intriguing  property manager . Better yet, for Jesse, the attractive property manager lives next door in this stucco duplex, which really does exist at  325 Terrace St SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106 . Peekaboo Jesse earns his reputation as a stone-cold killer after a wild scene that takes place in the  downtown Albuquerque home  at  217 13th St NW, Albuquerque, NM 87102.  But the episode’s real dramatic tension comes from a dirt-smudged and neglected child of meth-heads who startles Jesse. In the middle of the impending violence, Jesse shows his tender side by connecting with the kid — via a game of peekaboo. Related items from  Zillow Blog :
