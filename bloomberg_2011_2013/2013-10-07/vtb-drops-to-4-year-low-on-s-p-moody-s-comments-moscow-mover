VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest
bank, headed for a four-year low as Moody’s Investors Service
and  Standard & Poor’s  said a weakening economy will hurt lending
and erode earnings.  VTB fell 1.1 percent to 4.182 kopeks by 5:30 p.m. in
Moscow, the lowest since September 2009 on a closing basis. The
number of shares trading was equivalent to about 112 percent of
the three-month average.  Russian lenders face a “challenging” environment this
year and in 2014 amid slower economic growth, rising bad debt
and declining profitability, Moody’s said. Banks’ loan portfolio
performance will probably deteriorate in light of the weakening
economy, according to S&P. The  World Bank  last month cut its
forecast for 2013 economic growth to 1.8 percent, the slowest
pace in four years, from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent.  “Investors have a cautious view on the market and they are
avoiding riskier assets like VTB,”  Mark Rubinstein , head of
research at IFC Metropol, said by phone from Moscow.  S&P said in a report today that after a period of
“aggressive” growth it expected declining asset quality to
become the “main threat” to the capital sustainability of
Russia’s largest banks in the next 12-18 months. Moody’s kept
its “negative” outlook for the country’s banking system,
according to an e-mailed note today.  VTB’s  second-quarter profit  rose less than analysts’
estimated to 12.6 billion rubles ($390 million) after the
company than doubled its provision for bad loans to 28.7 billion
rubles, the lender said Sept. 12. The bank kept its full-year
profit forecast of 100 billion rubles.  VTB declined 1.4 percent to $2.598 in  London . OAO Sberbank,
the nation’s biggest lender, lost 0.7 percent to 99.54 rubles in
Moscow, having retreated as much as 1.1 percent earlier.  Sberbank’s nine-month net income rose 6.3 percent to 286.2
billion rubles, the lender said today in a website statement.
VTB and Sberbank account for about 45 percent of Russia’s
banking sector’s assets, according to S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
