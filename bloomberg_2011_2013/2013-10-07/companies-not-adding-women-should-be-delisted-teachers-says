Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan,
 Canada ’s third-largest pension fund, said the country’s publicly
listed companies should have a minimum of three female directors
or face delisting.  “It’s been disappointing that there hasn’t been a lot of
progress made in getting more women on boards of directors for
Canadian public companies,” Wayne Kozun, Ontario Teachers’
senior vice president of public equities, said in a phone
interview today. “We need to put in place some concrete
proposals.”  The Toronto-based fund, which manages C$129.5 billion
($125.6 billion), submitted a  response  to the Ontario Securities
Commission’s open comment period regarding disclosure of women
on boards and in senior management positions at Canadian
companies. The letter was made public on the pension fund’s
website today.  Adding more women to boards would increase diversity of
opinion and shareholder value and wouldn’t be an arbitrary quota
to fill, Kozun said. Boards will make better decisions with
greater gender diversity, he said.  Only 32 of 202 Canadian public companies with market values
of more than C$1 billion, or 16 percent, have at least three
female board members, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The list includes Royal Bank of Canada, which in August
announced Kathleen Taylor as its chairwoman.  “We’ve been one of the institutional investors pushing the
envelope for corporate governance,” Kozun said. Four out of the
nine members on Ontario Teachers’ board are women, including
Chairwoman Eileen Mercier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
