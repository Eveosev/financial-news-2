Julian Robertson, the hedge fund billionaire, told CNBC that he  sold all of his Apple holdings  after discovering that Steve Jobs was a “really awful” person through Walter Isaacson's biography. According to Robertson, this is because mean people can’t build enduringly successful companies. Here are some other business founders whose companies Robertson probably wouldn’t want to own: 1. Henry Clay Frick, United States Steel Corp. Frick was called one of the “ worst American CEOs of all time ” by Portfolio magazine. One reason was that his vigorous response to the  Homestead Strike of 1892  led to the deaths of 16 people. On the other hand, the company he helped found -- U.S. Steel -- remains the country’s largest producer, as well as the namesake of the Pittsburgh Steelers, despite the contraction of the American steel industry over the past 30 years. 2. Henry Ford, Ford Motor Corp. While Ford is admired for paying his workers well and for  building an experimental city in Brazil , he was also  a rabid anti-Semite  who popularized a minor piece of  Russian propaganda  and “inspired” Adolf Hitler. His car company is still thriving, however, and managed to avoid the bailouts endured by General Motors and Chrysler. 3. Ingvar Kamprad, IKEA In his youth, Kamprad was  an active member of Sweden’s fascist movement  and was enthusiastic about recruiting new members. Later in life, the company he controlled took advantage of  forced labor in East German prison camps  as a cost-savings measure. Yet Kamprad is still one of the world's richest men, and his company remains  the world’s biggest home-furnishings retailer . (Fortunately for Robertson, IKEA is privately held, so he could never have been foolishly tempted to buy any shares.) 4. Thomas J. Watson, International Business Machines Corp. According to investigative journalist Edwin Black, Watson may have been directly involved in  IBM’s collaboration with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust . On the other hand, the company is now worth $200 billion. 5. Cecil Rhodes, De Beers  A major advocate of British subjugation of the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa, the founder of the Rhodes scholarship was also the man behind the De Beers diamond mines. Today, De Beers continues to control about  40 percent  of the world’s supply of raw diamonds and now has retail outlets selling jewelry. 6. Republic of Siena, Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena No single individual created this bank, which was established in 1472 by the Italian city-state. However, the founders hoped that it, like the sister institutions that followed it across Europe, would  displace Jewish moneylenders.  Considered the oldest operating bank in the world, Monte Dei Paschi has lately been  embroiled in a scandal  over hiding losses from the financial crisis.  (Matthew C.
