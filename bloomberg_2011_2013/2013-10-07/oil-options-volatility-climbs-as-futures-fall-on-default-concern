Crude oil options volatility climbed
as West Texas Intermediate futures dropped on concern the U.S.
debt-limit debt lock would move the nation closer to default.  Implied volatility for at-the-money November options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value,
rose to 20.24 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  from
19.14 percent yesterday.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 61
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most active
options were November $98 puts with 4,061 lots exchanging hands
as they rose 4 cents to 21 cents a barrel. November $99 puts
were the second-most traded, with 2,708 lots. They increased 5
cents to 30 cents a barrel.  Volatility for puts protecting against a 10 percent drop in
November-delivery futures surged to 29.16 percent from 25.76
percent Oct. 4.  WTI for November delivery slipped 81 cents to settle at
$103.03 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices fell 0.8 percent after
House Speaker  John Boehner  said the country could end up in
default if President  Barack Obama  doesnâ€™t negotiate over the
Affordable Care Act, which Republicans want weakened or delayed.  In the previous session, calls accounted for 58 percent of
the 70,244 contracts traded.  December $115 calls were the most-active traded options on
Oct. 4. They rose 2 cents to 19 cents a barrel on volume of
3,226 contracts. Decembers $110 calls added 8 cents to 65 cents
a barrel on 2,976 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
41,056 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 40,662 lots
and December $100 calls with 31,863.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
