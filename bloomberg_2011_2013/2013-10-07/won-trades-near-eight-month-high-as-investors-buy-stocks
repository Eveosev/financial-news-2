South  Korea ’s won traded 0.1 percent
off an eight-month high after overseas investors pumped more
money into domestic stocks.  Government bonds  fell.  Global funds have  bought  more South Korean shares than they
have sold every day since Aug. 22, according to stock exchange
data. Any gains in the currency may be limited on speculation
that the authorities may intervene to slow the pace to help the
nation’s exporters, according to Jeon Seung Ji, a strategist at
Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul.  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,070.43 per dollar as of 9:49
a.m. in Seoul, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,069.68 on Oct. 4, the highest since Jan
25. The currency has rallied 6.7 percent since the end of June,
the best performance among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies,
eroding the value of the nation’s exports that account for
around half of gross domestic product.  “There are some intervention fears with the won flirting
with the 1,070 level of late,” said Jeon. “Still, the won may
come under rising appreciation pressure given hefty foreign
buying of local stocks.”  South Korea  is closely monitoring the market, Finance
Minister Hyun Oh Seok told reporters on Sept. 27. The  Bank of
Korea  is likely to manage the pace of won appreciation, Credit
Suisse Group AG wrote in a Sept. 25 report.  The won’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, slid
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.07 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent sovereign notes due June 2018
added one basis point to 3.06 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
