U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened for
a second day after Tropical Storm Karen passed the region with
limited impact on refinery operations.  Conventional, 85-octane blendstock, or CBOB, dropped 0.25
cent to 14.5 cents below below futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 3:33 p.m. RBOB slid 1 cent to a discount
of 14.75 cents.  Karen, downgraded to a depression as it headed for  Florida 
on Oct. 6, prompted a reduction in rates at Motiva Enterprises
LLC’s  Norco, Louisiana, refinery , last week as the storm slowed
oil shipments.  Chevron Corp.’s (CVX)  Pascagoula,  Mississippi , refinery returned
to normal operations, while Phillips 66’s  Alliance plant  and
Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Chalmette refinery, both in Louisiana, were
unaffected by the storm.  “That was the most action we had in the refining system
all year,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions LLC in Houston. “It was a non-event but there was
still plenty of hype.”  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , gained $1.38 to $7.85 a
barrel. The same spread based on  Light Louisiana Sweet oil , the
Gulf Coast benchmark, rose 48 cents to $3.85 a barrel, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast dropped 0.15 cent
to 5.15 cents a gallon below Nymex futures. The same fuel gained
0.02 cent to a premium of 0.85 cent in  New York  Harbor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
