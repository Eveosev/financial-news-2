NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s largest
mobile phone carrier, lost the most subscribers on record even
after adding  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones to its lineup as it attempts to
regain market share from  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  and  KDDI Corp. (9433)   DoCoMo lost 66,800 net users in September, the company said
in an e-mail today. SoftBank added 270,700 and KDDI 232,700
users, according to the carriers. DoCoMo’s share of mobile users
slumped to 46 percent in September, compared with 52 percent in
2008, as first SoftBank Corp. and then KDDI Corp. won Japanese
consumers with Apple handsets.  Apple introduced two new smartphones last month, including
a cheaper version in bright colors and an updated high-end
device DoCoMo began selling on Sept. 20. The carrier had
resisted the iPhone to focus on handsets from Sony Corp. and
Samsung Electronics Co. and protect its online store, called
dmarket, from competition with Apple’s iTunes.  “DoCoMo must offer more incentives for existing users to
remain with the carrier,” said Eiji Mori, an analyst at BCN
Inc. in  Tokyo .  DoCoMo attributed the subscriber loss to customers who
delayed purchases until after Apple’s new mobiles went on sale
Sept. 20 and insufficient stock of those handsets, said Atsuko
Suzuki, a company spokeswoman. Rival carriers’ marketing
strategies also hurt sales, she said.  DoCoMo had a total of 61.8 million subscribers last month,
followed by KDDI with 39 million and SoftBank with 34 million.  Market Share  DoCoMo, which has gained 24 percent this year, fell 1.2
percent to 1,542 yen at the close in Tokyo. SoftBank, which has
more than doubled, added 2.9 percent and KDDI, which has gained
69 percent in the same period, was unchanged at 5,160 yen.  SoftBank accounted for 39.5 percent of Japanese sales of
Apple’s two new models, while DoCoMo took a 31.9 percent market
share and KDDI controlled 28.6 percent, according to estimates
from BCN, which compiles data from appliance and electronics
chain stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
