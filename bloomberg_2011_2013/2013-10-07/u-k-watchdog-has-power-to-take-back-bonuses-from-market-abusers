The U.K.’s banking watchdog said it
has the authority to claw back bonuses from insider traders and
market manipulators without needing beefed-up enforcement
powers.  The Prudential Regulation Authority’s “powers are
sufficient” to recover “vested remuneration in the cases of
individuals who have been the subject of successful enforcement
action,” the  Bank of England  said in  response  to a June report
from the Parliamentary Committee on Banking Standards.  Bonus clawbacks are part of a program of sweeping change
proposed by the cross-party panel of lawmakers set up by the
U.K. government last year to reform the industry in the wake of
the Libor manipulation scandal. The committee also said that
parts of bonuses should be deferred for as long as 10 years and
that “reckless” management of lenders should be made a crime.  “We welcome the report and, with few exceptions, intend to
take forward its recommendations,” the Bank of England said in
a statement on its website.  The  Financial Conduct Authority , which polices financial
markets from its headquarters in  London , also responded to the
committee’s report today saying it agreed with the “wider
recommendations on remuneration,” according to a statement
published on its  website .  The PRA, which took over from the Financial Services
Authority in April as the country’s top banking supervisor, will
work with the FCA to “review the extent to which there is scope
to extend bondholder influence” over banks’ disclosure of their
own safety, the BOE said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
