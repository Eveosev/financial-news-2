JGWPT Holdings Inc., the firm that
offers cash for settlements under the J.G. Wentworth brand,
filed to raise $200 million in an initial public offering.  The figure is a placeholder amount used to calculate fees,
and may change, according to a regulatory filing today. Barclays
Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG are leading the sale, and JGWPT
plans to apply to list Class A shares on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol JGW, the filing shows.  JGWPT  is owned by private-equity firm JLL Partners Inc.
Wentworth converts regular streams of income, such as legal
settlements or annuities, into lump-sum payments. JGWPT buys
rights to future payments from individuals, then packages them
as securities and sells them to investors.  The Radnor, Pennsylvania-based firm, known for  television
ads  that declare “It’s my money and I need it now,” had
weighed a possible sale last year, people with knowledge of the
matter said then. The firm abandoned that process after bids
failed to meet expectations, deciding instead to explore an IPO
or a dividend recapitalization, people familiar with the matter
said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
