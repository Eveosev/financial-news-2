Petroceltic International Plc (PCI) , the
Irish oil and gas company, gained the most in more than a month
after selling part of its stake in an Algerian oil license.  The  shares  advanced as much as 3.1 percent, the most on an
intraday basis since Aug. 28, and traded 2.4 percent higher at
147.50 pence as of 12:37 p.m. in  London . The company was down 17
percent in the year through Friday, compared with an 11 percent
gain on the 616-member FTSE All-Share Index.  Sonatrach, the Algerian state-owned oil company, plans to
buy Petroceltic’s 18 percent stake in the Isarene Production
Sharing Contract, which is tied to the Ain Tsila oil field, the
Dublin-based explorer said in a statement. Petroceltic will
receive $20 million on completion of the deal, a $140 million
“development carry” and two further payments of $10 million
once the venture meets certain milestones.  Petroceltic will hold 38 percent of the license if the deal
is completed while Sonatrach will own 43 percent, according to
the statement.  Enel SpA (ENEL) , the Italian energy firm, will hold the
remaining 18 percent.  “The decision by Sonatrach to exercise its pre-emptive
right is a clear indication of the current value and long term
upside potential of the Isarene asset,” Petroceltic Chief
Executive Officer Brian O’Cathain said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
