The  Oakland Raiders  released third-string quarterback Matt Flynn, the latest downward step for a
player who was setting passing records for his team less than
two years ago  The 28-year-old Flynn was sacked seven times, fumbled twice
and threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown
against the  Washington Redskins  on Sept. 29, his lone start of
the season. He was demoted after the game to third string behind
starter Terrelle Pryor, who missed the game with a concussion,
and undrafted rookie Matt McGloin.  Team spokesman Will Kiss said in an e-mail that Flynn had
been cut. Flynn was due to make $6.5 million this year,
according to ESPN. The team will work out free-agent
quarterbacks Pat White and  David Carr  tomorrow, the network
said.  Flynn played for the Green Bay Packers as a backup to  Aaron Rodgers  from 2008 to 2011. After he threw for 480 yards and six
touchdowns in the Packersâ€™ 2011 season finale, both franchise
records, he signed with the Seattle Seahawks on a three-year,
$19.5 million contract. Seahawks rookie Russell Wilson won the
starting job in preseason and Flynn was traded to Oakland in
April.  In six NFL seasons, Flynn has completed 62.3 percent of his
passes for 1,329 yards and 10 touchdowns, with six
interceptions. He has never started more than one game in a
season.  To contact the reporters on this story:
