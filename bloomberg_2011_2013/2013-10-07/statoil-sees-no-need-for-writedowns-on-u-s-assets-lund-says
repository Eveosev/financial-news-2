Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest energy
producer, sees no need to write down the value of its portfolio
of oil and gas assets in the U.S., Chief Executive Officer  Helge Lund  said in an interview today in Houston.  “The assets that we have there are performing well,
according to plan,” Lund said. “We do regular reviews of the
assets in our portfolio everywhere in the world when we do
quarterly reporting. So far there has been no need for
writedowns.”  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are among European
producers that have been forced to reduce the estimated value of
U.S. shale formations since last year.  Stavanger-based Statoil set a goal in 2011 to reach oil and
natural gas output of 2.5 million barrels a day by 2020,
production that would require an investment of $21 billion a
year through 2017, said Lund.  “Our portfolio can deliver that,” he said. “We need to
evaluate, as we move forward, is that the best plan? We do not
live on volumes and neither do the investors, so we will make
sure that we do the right thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
