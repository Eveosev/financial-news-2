The U.S.  Supreme Court  turned away an
appeal by Robert Coplan, a former Ernst & Young LLP executive
convicted of selling illegal tax shelters that cost the federal
government as much as $2 billion.  The justices today left intact Coplan’s seven-count
conviction and three-year prison sentence. His appeal, which
challenged one of the seven counts, sought to narrow the scope
of the federal law that criminalizes conspiracies to defraud the
U.S. government.  Coplan, a tax lawyer, is one of four Ernst & Young
executives convicted in 2010 for developing and marketing tax
shelters sold from 1999 to 2001. Two of the men, Richard Shapiro
and Martin Nissenbaum, have since won reversals.  Prosecutors said Coplan also took steps to conceal the
shelters from the  Internal Revenue Service , lied to the IRS in
audits and encouraged clients to do likewise.  In his appeal, Coplan pointed to a 2010 Supreme Court
decision that limited the reach of a separate federal fraud law
in the case of former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer
 Jeffrey Skilling .  A federal appeals court upheld Coplan’s conviction last
year, along with that of Brian Vaughn, a former Ernst & Young
accountant.  The case is Coplan v.  United States , 12-1299.  To contact the reporter on this story:
