Rubber recovered from an almost two-month low on bets that demand from  China , the world’s largest
user, may increase as buyers return from a week-long holiday.  The contract for March delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange advanced as much as 1.3 percent to 257.5 yen a kilogram
($2,652 a metric ton) and traded at 255.4 yen at 11:06 a.m.
local time. The price touched 253.8 on Oct. 4, the lowest intra-day level since Aug. 8. Futures slid 5.9 percent last week, the
worst for a most-active contract since the five days through May
24.  The Shanghai Futures Exchange will reopen tomorrow after
National Day holidays. Rubber inventories in Qingdao, China’s
main hub for the commodity, fell to 283,100 tons as of Sept. 16
from a record 371,000 tons on April 26, according to the Qingdao
International Rubber Exchange. China may step up buying to
replenish stockpiles, said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  “Expectations for a pick-up in Chinese demand provide
support to futures,” Saito said today by phone.  Gains were limited as the Japanese currency strengthened
against the dollar, weakening the appeal of yen-denominated
contracts, as U.S. lawmakers continue to scrap over raising the
debt limit amid a government shutdown. U.S. House of
Representatives Speaker  John Boehner  said lawmakers won’t raise
the debt ceiling without packaging it with other provisions.  Thai rubber  free-on-board fell for an eighth day on Oct. 4,
losing 0.3 percent to 78 baht ($2.49) a kilogram, according to
the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
