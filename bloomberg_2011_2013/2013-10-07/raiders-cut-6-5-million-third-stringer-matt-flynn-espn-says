The Oakland Raiders released Matt Flynn, the National Football League team’s $6.5 million third-string quarterback, ESPN reported today, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the move.  The 28-year-old Flynn was sacked seven times, fumbled twice
and threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown
against the Washington Redskins on Sept. 29, his lone start of
the season. He was demoted after the game to third string behind
starter Terrelle Pryor, who missed the game with a concussion,
and undrafted rookie Matt McGloin.  The team will work out free-agent quarterbacks Pat White
and David Carr tomorrow, according to ESPN.  Raiders spokesman Will Kiss didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment on the report.  Flynn played for the Green Bay Packers as a backup to Aaron Rodgers from 2008 to 2011. After he threw for 480 yards and six
touchdowns in the Packers’ 2011 season finale, both franchise
records, he signed with the Seattle Seahawks on a three-year,
$19.5 million contract. Seahawks rookie Russell Wilson won the
starting job in preseason and Flynn was traded to Oakland in
April.  In six NFL seasons, Flynn has completed 62.3 percent of his
passes for 1,329 yards and 10 touchdowns, with six
interceptions. He has never started more than one game in a
season.  To contact the reporters on this story:
