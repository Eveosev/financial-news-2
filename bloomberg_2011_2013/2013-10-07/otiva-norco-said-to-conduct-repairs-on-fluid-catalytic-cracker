Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Norco,
Louisiana,  refinery  is conducting planned repairs on a fluid
catalytic cracker, a person familiar with operations said.  The unit was shut in the third week of September for
approximately 50 days of scheduled maintenance, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public.  A community notice on Sept. 19 from St. Charles Parish,
where the refinery is located, said that Motiva would begin
planned maintenance on several units the week of Sept. 28.  The 250,000-barrel-a-day Norco refinery is about 13 miles
(21 kilometers) west of New Orleans.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell
Oil, a unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   Destin Singleton, a spokeswoman for Shell in Houston, did
not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
