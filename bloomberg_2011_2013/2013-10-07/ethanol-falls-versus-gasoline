Ethanol fell against gasoline on
speculation the corn harvest that’s under way will help
companies boost production of the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 1.85 cents to
93.91 cents a gallon. Corn is the primary ingredient used to
make ethanol and 12 percent of the  crop was harvested  as of
Sept. 27, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. More
recent data isn’t available as a result of the partial
government  shutdown .  “We are starting to see the harvest,” said Julie Ward, an
assistant vice president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker
in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “It certainly bodes well for good ethanol
numbers.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery was unchanged at
$1.687 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
dropped 23 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 1.85 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.6261 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol  production  has averaged 836,000 barrels a day this
year through Sept. 27, down 4.1 percent from the same period a
year earlier, data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration show.  Stockpiles in the week ended Sept. 27 were at 15.5 million
barrels, 19 percent a year ago, according to the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Drought Damage  Last year’s drought damaged corn yields and forced ethanol
companies to temper operations. Farmers responded by planting
record acres of the grain.  Corn for December delivery added 6 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $4.4925 a bushel in  Chicago . The December crush spread, a
measure of profit for turning corn into ethanol, was minus 2
cents, down from break-even on Oct. 4.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  held at $2.20 a
gallon; in Chicago prices declined 1.5 cents to $2.035; in the
U.S. Gulf the additive lost 0.5 cent to $2.12; and on the West
Coast the biofuel gained 2.5 cents to $2.05 a gallon, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  New York Harbor’s premium to Chicago expanded 1.5 cents to
16.5 cents, while the West Coast’s discount to the Gulf narrowed
3 cents to 7 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
