Perhaps one of the greatest signs that the  real estate market is experiencing a strong recovery ? Not one but four listings have entered the market with price tags higher than $100 million — one nearing the $150 million mark. From a massive Connecticut estate to a prime spread in The Hamptons, here are the 10 priciest homes currently on the market in the United States. $140 million Undisclosed address, Greenwich, CT When Copper Beech Farm  first hit the market earlier this year  at $190 million, it was far and away the most expensive listing, ever. Even with a recent price cut of $50 million, the estate is still the priciest home available in the U.S. The 50-acre estate holds a 13,519-square-foot home with 12 bedrooms and 9 baths on 4,000 feet of coveted waterfront facing Long Island Sound. The home was built by the Lauder Greenway family (George Lauder was a partner in Carnegie Steel). It was sold 31 years ago to its current owner, John Rudey, who leads several timber companies. $125 million 795 Fifth Avenue PHE–PHW, New York, NY While Connecticut holds the most expensive home for sale, New York has the greatest number of pricey homes, including this penthouse, which occupies the entire 41st, 42nd and 43rd floors of the Pierre Hotel to create a 16-bedroom residence. Whoever buys this home won't need to scrape together a down payment: The entire amount will be due in full, as the  Pierre Hotel reportedly doesn't accept financing . $115 million Undisclosed address, New York, NY When this condo was constructed, architect Charles Gwathmey wanted it to be "the most sophisticated, stunning and elegant apartment in New York City." Whether he succeeded or not will be up to the future buyer, but the duplex is sleek and modern with 4 bedrooms and 5.5 baths in 9,000 square feet of living space. $115 million Beverly House, Los Angeles, CA Pick your price point for this listing: Drop $115 million to buy the home outright, or  pony up $600,000 each month to rent the place . Located in the heart of Beverly Hills, the Beverly House sits on 3.7 acres just a few blocks from Sunset Boulevard and like many high-end homes in L.A. has hosted a number of famous owners and guests. William Randolph Hearst spent the final years of his life here, and "The Godfather" was partially filmed on the premises, as was "The Bodyguard," starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner. Reportedly, even John and Jackie Kennedy spent their honeymoon at the residence. $100 million Owlwood, Los Angeles, CA A lot of current information about this residence is on lockdown, with photos and the price hidden behind a password wall on  The Agency 's site. Owlwood, like the Beverly House, has a rich history of celebrity owners and residents, beginning with 20th Century Fox co-founder Joe Schenck, (reportedly Marilyn Monroe stayed in the guesthouse during her rumored affair with Schenck), as well as Tony Curtis and Sonny and Cher. The home today is one of the largest properties available in L.A., containing three parcels, including the lot that once held Jayne Mansfield's Pink Palace and another lot  previously owned by Esther Williams that still holds the swimming pool and pool house . $95 million 781 5th Ave FL 18, New York, NY Back to Manhattan for the next priciest listing. This 15-room residence is located in the pre-war Sherry-Netherland building. The Sherry-Netherland began as a boutique hotel and was converted to luxury condos in the 1950s, although a few limited hotel suites are available starting  as much as $1,200 a night.  The full-floor offering, with Central Park views and hotel amenities, is part of the reason for the sky-high apartment price. $90 million Carolwood Estate, Los Angeles Like Owlwood, Carolwood is located in Holmby Hills on coveted North Carolwood Drive. The property once held Walt Disney's home, but when the Walt Disney Foundation sold the home after Walt and Lily Disney passed away, it was determined that the house was a tear-down, due to asbestos concerns. The new owner began constructing a brand-new, custom-designed home that was finished in 2001. It measures 35,000 square feet and has 8 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms. The house sits on 4 acres and includes a wealth of features, including a full wine cellar, pool and pool house, tennis court, putting green, custom movie room, 3 bars, library, gym and 2 safe rooms. $85 million 635 W 42nd St FL 45, New York, NY When the Atelier building first opened in 2007, rumors swirled that  Lindsay Lohan was offered an apartment there for free as a part of a grand marketing scheme.  It may have worked: The building has quite a number of celeb tenants, including actor Brendan Fraser, "Entourage" star Dania Ramirez and comedian Dane Cook. While the building's $85 million full-floor penthouse was never home to a star, it does include 10,000 square feet of space.  Curbed NY , however, noted at one point, a buyer could purchase the 40 remaining apartment units, and the full amount still wouldn't add up to the cost of the single $85 million unit. $75 million Undisclosed address, New York, NY Like many of the other expensive apartments on the list, this Manhattan apartment features views of Central Park. Designed by Tony Ingrao, the penthouse occupies an entire floor of the renovated Time Warner Center. At $75 million, the price tag means that the future buyer would be paying more than $9,000 per square foot for the high-end, 8,300-square-foot pad. $75 million Undisclosed address, East Hampton, NY  Homes in The Hamptons have long been on the pricey side, so it's no surprise that one in East Hampton made the most expensive list. Situated on East Hampton's "most prestigious private lane" bordering the pond and ocean, the 5.4-acre lot has a 7,500-square-foot main house, barn, 3-bedroom guesthouse and heated pool.
