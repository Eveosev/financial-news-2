VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-largest
bank, will rebound from a four-year low after the stock price
fell below the lender’s book value, Chief Executive Officer
Andrey Kostin said.  Global depositary receipts of VTB dropped to the lowest
price since 2009 in London yesterday after Moody’s Investors
Service said that profitability of Russian lenders will decline
this year and in 2014 amid slower economic growth and rising bad
debt, while  Standard & Poor’s  said the loan portfolios of banks
will probably deteriorate. The price-to-book ratio of VTB’s
stock in Moscow is at 0.63, less than half the  average  1.44 for
financial stocks in the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  “The current price is irrational,” Kostin said in an
interview yesterday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum in Bali. “Certainly VTB can’t cost
less than book value. At some point this will improve. That’s
why I’m not too worried.”  VTB dropped 0.6 percent to $2.62 yesterday in London, while
futures on the lender due to expire in December rose 0.1 percent
in U.S. hours. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. was little changed.  OAO
Mechel (MTL)  rallied, while  Yandex NV (YNDX)  slumped. RTS stock index futures
fell 0.1 percent to 144,120 in U.S. hours.  A “pessimistic” view of the banking sector and a “not
very positive view of Russia, given slowing economic growth,”
are fueling the stock’s decline, Kostin said.  Problem Loans  Banks will face “challenging” conditions through 2014,
with problem loans set to surpass 10 percent of total lending in
the next 12 to 18 months, from about eight percent at the end of
2012, Moody’s analysts Eugene Tarzimanov and Yaroslav Sovgyra
said in an e-mailed report yesterday. Lending growth will slow
to as little as 10 percent this year and next, from 20 percent
in 2012, with the corporate market “particularly sluggish,”
they wrote.  “Retail lending was considered to be the engine for
growth, the source of relief for banks,” Andrey Klapko, an
analyst at OAO Gazprombank in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.
“The macroeconomic situation isn’t supporting this.”  Russia is struggling with the slowest economic growth since
a 2009 recession. The  World Bank  reduced its forecast for
expansion in 2013 to 1.8 percent last month from 2.3 percent
previously. Net capital  outflow  reached an estimated $12.9
billion in the third quarter, compared with $7.9 billion in the
same period a year earlier, according to the central bank.  VTB, Sberbank  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  cut VTB to a neutral rating last month
and lowered its earnings estimates. While  second-quarter profit 
missed analysts’ projections, VTB maintained its full-year
forecast of 100 billion rubles ($3.1 billion). OAO Sberbank’s
“robust fundamentals” make Russia’s largest lender JPMorgan’s
favorite stock within the nation’s financial shares.  “Sberbank is on track for full-year 2013 guidance, whereas
VTB surely cannot make its management guidance for 2013,”
Julian Rimmer, a trader with CF Global Trading UK Ltd. in
 London , said by e-mail yesterday.  VTB extended this year’s plunge in London to 24 percent.
That compares with a 1 percent gain for Sberbank in 2013.  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge rose less than 0.1 percent to
99.66. The Micex Index erased losses to advance 0.4 percent in
Moscow, the highest since Sept. 26. The  Market Vectors Russia
ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that holds Russian
shares, fell 0.6 percent to $28.70 yesterday. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the index futures, rose
0.3 percent to 25.90 in U.S. hours.  American depositary receipts of Mechel, the nation’s
biggest producer of coal for steelmakers, rallied 2.5 percent to
$3.23. The shares traded at a 1.5 percent premium to the Moscow-listed stock.  Yandex, Russia’s largest search engine, retreated 2.4
percent to $37.44 in the biggest decline since Sept. 20.  United Co. Rusal (486) , a Moscow-based aluminum producer, added
0.4 percent to HK$2.40 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:35 a.m.
local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell less than 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
