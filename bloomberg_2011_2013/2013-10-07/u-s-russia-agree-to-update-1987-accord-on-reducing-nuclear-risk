The U.S. and Russia agreed to update
a 1987 accord aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear war to
reflect changing technologies.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  and Russian Foreign
Minister  Sergei Lavrov  signed the agreement on the sidelines of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia.
Today’s agreement adapts the original accord to today’s reality,
Lavrov said at a press conference with Kerry.  The original agreement, which was signed with the Soviet
Union, led to the creation of Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in
Washington and Moscow to provide time-sensitive communications
required by arms control treaties and security agreements, the
U.S. State Department said in a statement.  “With over 26 years’ experience, the Centers continue to
support a robust array of conventional and strategic arms
control treaties and agreements and confidence-building
measures,” the State Department said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
