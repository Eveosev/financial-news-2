The resignation of two junior
ministers from  David Cameron ’s government signaled the start of
a reorganization of jobs aimed at giving his  Conservative Party 
a new look in the runup to the 2015 general election.  Chloe Smith, a Cabinet Office minister, and John Randall,
who as deputy chief whip had been responsible for discipline
among Tory lawmakers, both said in letters to the premier they
want to step down when Cameron announces promotions and
demotions in his team. Those changes may come as soon as today.  In his keynote speech to the Conservatives’ annual
conference on Oct. 2, the prime minister praised a series of
senior ministers by name, including Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne , Home Secretary Theresa May, Education Secretary
Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith,
suggesting that the restructuring will be confined to the lower
ranks of the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
