Vale SA, the world’s largest  iron-ore 
producer, said supply of the steelmaking raw material is
expected to grow faster than demand, reducing support for future
increases in price.  Iron-ore producers may have between 5 percent and 6 percent
more capacity than demand by as early as 2018 as China steel
consumption slows and companies boost output, Vale’s head of
Ferrous & Strategy Jose Carlos Martins told reporters in Sao
Paulo yesterday. While iron-ore prices are expected to remain
above $100 a metric ton, the extra supply will make prices less
volatile and unlikely to repeat spikes seen previously, he said.  “We will probably start to have some surplus capacity
around 2015,” Martins said at the World Steel Association’s
annual congress. “Peak prices are unlikely to happen again.”  Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro , is spending almost $20
billion in its Serra Sul mine and logistics venture in Carajas,
the world’s largest iron-ore complex, which is the industry’s
most expensive project. The investment, scheduled to start
operating in late 2016, will add 90 million metric tons of
nominal capacity, or almost a third of Vale’s 2013 expected
production.  A 5 percent excess capacity can still be considered a
“tight” market for iron-ore, Martins said, adding that global
capacity may reach about 1.6 billion tons by 2020 with
consumption at 1.5 billion tons.  “Any problem you may have at a port or a mine, like
weather events, you enter in a situation of lack of supply.”  China’s Growth  Vale expects to boost its production capacity by 50 percent
to 450 million metric tons by 2018 once the Serra Sul project,
also known as S11D, reaches full output, Martins said during a
presentation at the event. The company will spend $34 billion on
its approved iron-ore mining and logistics projects in the
period, he said.  Vale  fell  1.6 percent to 31.39 reais in  Sao Paulo 
yesterday. It’s dropped 23 percent this year, compared with a 14
percent decline for the Brazilian benchmark Ibovespa  index .  Iron ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin  has fallen  9.3 percent to $131.40 a ton this
year and is trading 32 percent below its February 2011 record of
$191.90, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  Steel consumption growth in China, the world’s largest
producer and biggest buyer of iron ore, is likely to moderate in
coming years, Martins said.  “This year they are growing more than expected and we are
expecting a more moderated growth next year,” he said. “Nobody
can grow at the pace that  China  has been growing in the last 10,
15 years. At some point you will have a slow down. But there
won’t be a reduction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
