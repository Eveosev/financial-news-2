The cost of hauling crude on the
largest tankers is poised to rise to a four-year high as the
biggest demolition program in a decade trims a glut of capacity.
Rates still won’t be high enough for owners to break even.  Shipping companies will demolish 23 very large crude
carriers in 2013 and scrapping will stay at about that level for
the next three years, according to E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.,
a brokerage in London. Daily rates will average $22,000 in 2014,
the mean of 10 analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg News 
shows. While that’s almost three times more than current
earnings, it’s still below the $25,000 that  Frontline Ltd. (FRO) ,
which operates 31 of the vessels, says it needs to cover costs.  Rates plunged as much as 97 percent from their December
2007 peak of $229,484 a day as the surge spurred the most orders
for new ships since the 1970s, just before the global recession
began. That generated the biggest capacity surplus since the
mid-1980s and drove  Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. (OSGIQ)  and General
Maritime Corp. to seek  bankruptcy protection . Freight swaps
traded by brokers show rates won’t exceed Frontline’s break-even
cost of $25,000 before at least 2015.  “Rates are rising from a devastatingly low level this year
and scrapping is helping to reduce the fleet,” said Nicolai Hansteen, chief economist at Pareto Shipping, an Oslo-based
research company. “But we’re at the very start of this and
there’s still not enough scrapping going on.”  Crude Cargoes  Daily earnings for the vessels, which haul 2 million
barrels of crude, averaged $7,296 since the start of 2013,
according to London-based Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker.
That’s the lowest level in Clarkson data that begin in 1997.  The analysts in the Bloomberg survey are more bullish than
the swaps market, which is anticipating $12,565 for 2014 and
$16,492 for the following year, according to Marex Spectron
Group data. The contracts, known as forward freight agreements,
relate to the industry’s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route.  Shares of Frontline, led by billionaire  John Fredriksen ,
slumped 19 percent to 15 kroner in Oslo this year. They will
drop another 40 percent to 9.02 kroner in 12 months, according
to the average of 16 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
While Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  in  Tokyo 
are the biggest owners, VLCCs represent no more than 7 percent
of either Japanese company’s fleet, Clarkson data show.  The VLCC market has 50 to 75 too many ships, equal to as
much as 13 percent of the fleet, and owners need to scrap more,
Jens Martin Jensen, chief executive officer of Frontline’s
management unit, said in a conference call with analysts in
August. There are 588 VLCCs in service.  ‘Remove Tonnage’  “It is on the ships’ supply side there is an imbalance,”
Singapore-based Jensen wrote in an e-mail Oct. 2. “The only way
to clear that is to remove tonnage -- scrapping is the way
forward.”  The capacity glut is being compounded by contracting U.S.
and European oil imports and the slowest expansion in Chinese
purchases since at least 2005. The three account for about 52
percent of demand for seaborne crude, according to Clarkson.  U.S. imports, representing about 14 percent of oil carried
at sea, averaged 25 percent less this year than the peak in
2005, Energy Department data show. The nation’s crude  output  is
at the highest level since 1992 because of increased extraction
of reserves found in shale-rock formations.  Two Decades  China ’s imports this year are 3 percent higher than in
2012, poised for the smallest increase in at least eight years,
customs data show. The nation’s economy will expand 7.4 percent
in 2014, the weakest growth in two decades, according to the
average of 57 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The 28-nation European Union, representing 24 percent of
demand, will import 2 percent less oil this year, the equivalent
of about 18 fewer supertanker cargoes, Clarkson data show.  Owners reacted to the slump in rates by cutting speeds when
tankers sail without cargoes to about 10 knots, from as fast as
13 knots three years ago, according to Dag Kilen, an analyst at
Fearnley Consultants A/S in Oslo. Higher rates may spur ships to
speed up again, worsening the oversupply of vessels that
Fearnley says is the biggest since 1985.  Capacity gluts extend across most of the shipping industry
because owners ordered too many vessels before the global
recession. The ClarkSea  Index (BDIY) , measuring earnings for ships
across the merchant fleet, averaged $9,332 a day this year, on
course for the lowest annual level since at least 1990.  Refined Products  That contrasts with tankers hauling refined oil products,
which analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News last month said would
be profitable again next year for the first time since 2008.
Rising rates are being underpinned by the biggest expansion in
Middle East crude refining on record.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of the cost of hauling
everything from coal to grains, tripled to 2,115 this year,
according to the  Baltic Exchange , a London-based publisher of
prices on more than 50 maritime routes. Rates for iron ore-carrying Capesize ships jumped almost eightfold as China bought
record amounts of the steelmaking commodity.  Frontline’s net loss will narrow to $92.9 million in 2014
from $178 million this year, according to the average of 22
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Hamilton, Bermuda-based
company last reported a quarterly profit for the first three
months of 2012 and will only do so again in the initial quarter
of 2015, the analysts’ predictions show.  The surge in scrapping is boosting business for yards in
 India , the biggest destination for tanker demolitions. The
nation handled 1.81 million gross tons in 2011, compared with
 Pakistan ’s 1.49 million tons, United Nations data show.  Existing Capacity  The number of new VLCCs on  order  as a proportion of the
fleet dropped to the lowest level since at least 2005, according
to data from IHS Maritime, a research company in Coulsdon,
 England . Vessels scheduled to be built are equal to 6.4 percent
of existing capacity, from as much as 46 percent five years ago,
its data show.  “The supply and demand balance will start to correct,”
said Nikhil Jain, a New Delhi-based analyst at Drewry Shipping
Consultants Ltd., a shipping-research company. “But there’s
scope for a lot more demolition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
