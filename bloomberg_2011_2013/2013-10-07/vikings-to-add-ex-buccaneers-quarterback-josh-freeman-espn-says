The  Minnesota  Vikings will sign
former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman to a one-year, $3 million contract,  ESPN said,  citing unidentified people
familiar with the situation.  The Buccaneers released Freeman, 25, on Oct. 3 after the
former first-round draft pick lost his starting job to rookie
Mike Glennon. Freeman had completed an NFL-low 45.7 percent of
his passes during the team’s 0-3 start.  The Vikings (1-3), who were off during Week 5, have
Christian Ponder, Matt Cassel and McLeod Bethel-Thompson at
quarterback. While Ponder has been the Vikings’ starter, he was
replaced by Cassel while recovering from a fractured rib in Week
4 and Minnesota snapped a three-game losing streak.  Tampa Bay  still has to pay the remaining $5.9 million
Freeman had left on the contract he signed after being the third
quarterback taken in the 2009 draft.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
