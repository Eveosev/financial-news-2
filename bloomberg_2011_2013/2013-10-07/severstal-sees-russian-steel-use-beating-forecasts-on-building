Russian steel demand may exceed the
World Steel Association’s forecasts this year and the next as
the country steps up house building and car manufacturing,  OAO
Severstal (SVST)  Chief Executive Officer  Alexey Mordashov  said.  Demand may exceeded the WSA’s growth estimates of 3.8
percent for this year and 4.6 percent for 2014, the billionaire,
who controls Russia’s second-largest producer of the alloy, said
in an interview.  “We have growth and demand, which may be even higher,”
Mordashov said today in  Sao Paulo , on the sidelines of the
industry group’s annual conference.  Construction will account for about 60 percent of Russian
steel use this year after demand reached a record in July,
according to Morgan Stanley estimates. About 70.1 million square
meters (755 million square feet) of newly built housing will be
registered for use this year in Russia, the most since at least
the year 2000, according to estimates from the country’s economy
ministry.  Cherepovets, Russia-based Severstal is selling its stake in
a Brazilian iron-ore project little more than two years after
acquiring it as it focuses on improving quality and cutting
costs at existing operations, Mordashov said. The company isn’t
seeking to sell more assets or boost capacity, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
