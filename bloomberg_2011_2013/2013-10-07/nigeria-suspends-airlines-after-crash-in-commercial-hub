Nigeria stopped flights by two
airlines, including Associated Airlines, whose Embraer 120
aircraft crashed on takeoff from the Lagos airport four days
ago, killing 14 people, the Aviation Ministry said.  Associated Airlines was suspended along with Dana Airlines
Ltd., another local carrier, which “has been having issues over
the past months,” Joe Obi, a spokesman for the Aviation
Ministry, said by phone today from Abuja, the capital. “The
suspension is to make room for maintenance and operational
checks.”  A twin-propeller Embraer 120 plane, carrying thirteen
passengers and seven crew, crashed shortly after takeoff from
Lagos on Oct. 3. The passengers included family members taking
the body of Olusegun Agagu, a former aviation minister, to his
funeral.  The incident follows Nigeria’s deadliest crash in almost 40
years in June last year, when a Dana Airlines plane carrying 146
passengers and seven crew members plunged into the Agege suburb
of Lagos, killing everyone on board and about 10 people on the
ground.  Lagos-based Dana Airlines resumed flights in January after
the crash last year.  Dana will “continue to cooperate with the aviation
authorities and abide by all local and international safety
regulations,” Tony Usidamen, a spokesman for the company, said
today in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
