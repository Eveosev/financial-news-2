Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, the
co-controller of the world’s largest sugar-cane processor, rose
to a four-month high on speculation that rising gasoline prices
will push drivers to switch to ethanol.  Cosan  gained  2.1 percent to 44.25 reais at 12:40 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, poised for the highest closing price since June 13.
It was the fourth-biggest gain on the 73-member benchmark
Ibovespa equity gauge, which  fell  0.4 percent.  With international oil prices up 15 percent from a year
earlier, investors are betting  Brazil ’s government will lift
gasoline prices by the end of this year to reduce the cost of
its subsidy, according to Luis Gustavo Pereira, an analyst at
the brokerage firm Futura Corretora. Brazil’s so-called flex-fuel cars can run on either a mix of ethanol and gasoline or
pure ethanol, allowing drivers to choose the cheapest
alternative.  “Every time such rumors circulate in the market we see
Cosan’s shares benefiting,” Pereira said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo.  Brazil needs to “look at” the gap between domestic and
international fuel prices, Energy Minister Edison Lobao told
reporters in Rio de Janeiro on Aug. 28.  State-controlled oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3)  has
already raised fuel prices twice this year. The 7 percent
weakening of the Brazilian real in 2013 is intensifying losses
from fuel imports sold at a discount to distributors as part of
a policy to keep inflation in check.  To contact the reporter on this story:
