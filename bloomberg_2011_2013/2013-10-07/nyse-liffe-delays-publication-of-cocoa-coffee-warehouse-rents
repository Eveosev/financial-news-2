NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of
NYSE Euronext, will delay the publication of warehouse rents and
movement out fees for cocoa and robusta coffee as it seeks
“further information” on the proposed charges.  The bourse was set to publish last month maximum rent and
loading out charges for the period from January to June, it said
on an  info-flash  published on its website and dated Oct. 4. NYSE
Liffe has received proposed charges from warehouses that store
robusta coffee and cocoa that can be delivered into its futures
contract and “is seeking to understand better a limited number
of those submissions,” it said.  “The exchange will publish the rates for the new charge
period at the earliest opportunity once it has had the
opportunity to review the additional information provided to it
by the relevant nominated warehouse keepers,” NYSE Liffe said.  The exchange will extend rules implemented to accelerate
warehouse deliveries of robusta coffee to its cocoa contract
starting in December, it said last month. Warehouses storing as
much as 30,000 metric tons of cocoa will have to deliver at
least 250 tons per working day. Those holding more will have to
deliver 500 tons a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
