U.S. financial conditions held at
about the highest levels since before the worst financial crisis
since the Great Depression as debt investors brushed off House
Speaker  John Boehner ’s warning that America is on a “path” to
defaulting on its debts.  While the  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  fell
0.08 to 1.2, that’s above the average of 1.11 this year and
compares with the high in 2007 of 1.266. The gauge measures
stress in the markets by combining everything from money-market
rates to yields on government and corporate bonds to volatility
in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, the
index fell as low as negative 1.631.  Pacific Investment Management Co. Co-Chief Investment
Officer  Bill Gross  and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, who oversee $5.76 trillion,
dismiss the possibility of a default. Boehner said that may
happen if President  Barack Obama  doesn’t negotiate over the
budget. The government stopped providing nonessential services
last week after lawmakers couldn’t agree on a spending package.  “Despite the rhetoric, handwringing, name calling and
finger pointing, the market believes a deal will ultimately be
struck,” said  Adrian Miller , director of fixed-income
strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York. “The markets are
on edge, are defensive and increasingly concerned, but there is
still hope that we will avoid a default.”  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Congress needs to
increase the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit by Oct. 17 or the
nation risks defaulting on its payments.  Investors should buy three-, four- and five-year Treasuries
and inflation-protected securities, Gross said on Bloomberg
Television on Oct. 1. The government shutdown will end “very
rapidly,” BlackRock’s Fink said Oct. 3 at an event hosted by
the UCLA Anderson School of Management in  Beverly Hills ,
 California .  Treasuries  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  U.S. Treasury  note fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.63 percent at 5
p.m.in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
yield is down from the high this year of 3 percent on Sept. 6
and compares with the average of 3.53 percent over the past
decade.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, fell 0.14 basis point to 12.86 basis points.
The gauge typically narrows when investors favor assets such as
corporate bonds and widens when they seek the perceived safety
of  government securities . The measure has dropped from this
year’s high of 19.55 in June on a closing basis.  Credit  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk fell. The Markit CDX
North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps
benchmark that investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, climbed three basis points to a
mid-price of 82.8 basis points, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The index, which typically climbs as investor
confidence in credit deteriorates and falls as it improves, has
ranged over the past three months from as high as 86.5 on July 5
to as low as 69.76 on Sept. 18.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, fell 0.2 percent to 1,008.13, the
sixth decline in seven days. The index is has traded in a range
of 1,008.4 and 1,054.48 the past three months. The greenback
lost 0.8 percent to 96.71 yen, after touching 96.67, its weakest
level since Aug. 12. The Japanese currency added 0.6 percent to
131.32 per euro.  Stocks  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  fell 0.9 percent to 1,676.12 in
New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 136.34
points, or 0.9 percent, to 14,936.24.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, rose 16 percent to
19.41, below its closing high for the year of 20.49 in June and
above the low of 11.3 in March. Volatility in Treasuries as
measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index fell to
80.29, compared with the average this year is 72.24.  Currency swings as measured by the JPMorgan Global
Volatility Index fell to as low as 8.76 on Oct. 4, the least
since May 9. It was 8.79 today, versus a 2013 average of 9.38.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
fell 81 cents to $103.03 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices climbed last week for the first time in four
weeks as the storm Karen forced production shutdown.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1 percent to
$1,323.23 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Prices dropped 2.1
percent last week amid speculation that the Federal shutdown
that has furloughed 800,000 workers would be short-lived.  Copper futures for delivery in December slid 0.1 percent to
$3.2965 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
