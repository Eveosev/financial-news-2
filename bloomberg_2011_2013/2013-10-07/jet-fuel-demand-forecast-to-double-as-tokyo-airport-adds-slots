Jet fuel demand is forecast to double
at  Tokyo ’s Haneda airport as the Japanese government adds 40
slots for international flights, according to a survey of four
local refining officials.  Sales of bonded jet fuel, or tax-exempted aviation
petroleum sold only for overseas flights, may increase by as
much as 600,000 kiloliters at Haneda to 1.2 million kiloliters,
said the officials from local oil refiners and fuel suppliers
who asked not to be identified, citing company policy.  The increase in jet fuel sales may buffer falling demand
for most oil products in  Japan . The country’s total fuel
consumption will fall an average of 1.8 percent annually through
March 2018, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said in
a report in June.  “Amid slowing domestic oil demand, it is very gratifying
for Japan’s oil industry to see increasing Haneda slots boosting
jet fuel demand,” Satoru Yamamura, the Tokyo-based
international sales manager at  TonenGeneral Sekiyu (5012)  K.K., said in
an e-mail. “I hope the 2020  Olympic Games  will add more jet
fuel demand.”  Tokyo will host Japan’s fourth Olympics in 2020. That
follows the Tokyo summer games in 1964 and the  winter games  in
Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.  The government plans further additions before the 2020
event, Transport Minister Akihiro Ohta told reporters on Sept.
10, according to a transcript posted on the minstry’s website.  First-month swaps for jet fuel in  Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest
oil-trading center, fell 60 cents to $121.70 a barrel on Oct. 4,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. The fuel’s swaps
dropped 6.9 percent between Aug. 29 and Sept. 24 to $120.20 a
barrel.  Second Largest  TonenGeneral, Japan’s second-biggest refiner by capacity,
operates the 335,000 barrel-a-day Kawasaki plant across the
river from Haneda airport, Tokyo’s largest.  Japanese refiners sold 7.4 million kiloliters of bonded jet
fuel to airlines such as  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  and  ANA Holdings
Inc. (9202)  in the fiscal year ended March 2013, according to data
compiled by the Petroleum Association of Japan. A gain of
600,000 kiloliters accounts for 8.1 percent of total sales.  Japan’s transport ministry distributed 31 slots on Oct. 2
for daytime outbound routes starting at the end of March at
Haneda airport, just outside Tokyo’s main business district. The
allocation includes 16 slots for the two local carriers, and the
ministry is continuing negotiations with the U.S. and other
countries on how to divide the remaining nine.  The expansion is a part of Japan’s plan to boost landing
and takeoff slots at Haneda and Narita, 70 kilometers (40 miles)
east of Tokyo, to 750,000 annually by the year ending in March
2015 from the current 680,000, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
