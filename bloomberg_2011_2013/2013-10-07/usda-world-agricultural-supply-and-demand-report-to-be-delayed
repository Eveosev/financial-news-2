The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is
postponing its World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates
report, which is relied upon by traders for its detailed
information on commodity supply trends, because of the
government shutdown, the agency said.  The monthly report on world supply and demand for major
crops including corn, wheat and U.S. livestock won’t be issued
as scheduled date Oct. 11, agency spokeswoman Courtney Rowe said
in an e-mail. “USDA will not issue a WASDE report this week due
to the lapse in federal funding,” she said.  The partial federal shutdown, which began Oct. 1, has
delayed or cancelled government reports ranging from hog-price
data to last week’s scheduled unemployment release. World
Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates data is among the most-watched by commodity markets because of its breadth and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
