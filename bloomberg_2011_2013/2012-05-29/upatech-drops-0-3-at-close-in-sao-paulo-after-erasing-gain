Lupatech SA (LUPA3) , a Brazilian provider of
oil equipment and services, fell 0.3 percent to 3.84 reais at
the close in Sao Paulo, after erasing an earlier gain of as much
as 4.9 percent.  The company said in a regulatory filing that Duratex, a
maker of wood panels and bathroom fixtures, agreed to buy
Lupatechâ€™s unit that produces bronze valves for 45 million reais
($23 million) in cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
