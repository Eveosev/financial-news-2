Spain ’s government bonds declined
after a spokesman for the economy ministry said the nation’s
preferred option for raising funds to recapitalize Bankia group
is via debt markets.  The yield on  five-year securities  climbed eight basis
points to 5.82 percent at 11:04 a.m. London time. The 10-year
rate climbed three basis points to 6.51 percent.  The price of Spanish bond  futures  for September, which
began trading today, fell to 95 from as high as 95.59 earlier
today.  Spain considers that using treasury bonds instead of cash
to recapitalize Bankia is now a “marginal” option, the spokesman
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
