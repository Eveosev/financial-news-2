Defending champion  Rafael Nadal 
started his campaign for a men’s record seventh French Open
title with a straight-sets win against Simone Bolelli.   The second-ranked Nadal of Spain defeated the 11th-ranked
Italian 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 on the main Court Philippe Chatrier at
Roland Garros. The left-hander is now 46-1 on the Parisian clay
courts. His only loss dates back to 2009, when he was beaten in
the fourth round by Sweden’s  Robin Soderling . Nadal shares his
haul of six Roland Garros titles with another Swede, Bjorn Borg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
