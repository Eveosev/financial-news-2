A crackdown by Chinese Customs and
rising premiums for Thai sugar have reduced sugar smuggling into
 China , Deng Yi, secretary-general of the Yunnan Sugar
Association, said in an interview from Guangzhou.  Smuggling may have reached 500,000 metric tons in the first
quarter, the most in 17 years, the Guangxi Sugar Association
said in April. Contraband might drop by two thirds in the second
quarter, Deng said today. Guangxi and Yunnan are the biggest
producing provinces.  Domestic sugar gained 0.8 percent this year, reaching the
highest since October last month, as a government stockpiling
program mopped up supplies, while prices in  New York  tumbled 16
percent on rising output from Brazil and  India . China may import
2.2 million tons in 2011-2012, the most since 1994-1995,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “China’s sugar market is expected to stabilize with the
reduced smuggling and the coming peak consumption season in the
summer,” Deng said.  The price gap between Thai sugar and local Chinese sugar
has narrowed to below $300-$400 a ton from more than $500 a ton
a month ago, according to Deng. “Such a price gap is not
sufficient enough to encourage smugglers.”  The country has imported a total of 810,000 tons of sugar
in the first four months, up 242 percent from a year ago, the
 customs data  showed.  Refined sugar futures traded in Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange gained 0.4 percent to trade at 6,004  yuan  ($946) a ton
at 2:24 p.m. local time.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
