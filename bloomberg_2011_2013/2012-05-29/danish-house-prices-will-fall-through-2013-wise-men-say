Danish  house prices  will extend
declines through 2013 and weigh on economic growth, the
government-sponsored Economic Council said.  House prices will fall 4.9 percent this year and 1.2
percent next year, before recovering 1.7 percent in 2014, the
council, known as the “Wise Men,” said in its periodic review
of the Danish economy. Private consumption growth will slow to
1.3 percent next year from 2.3 percent in 2012, it said.  Denmark is struggling with a burst real estate bubble that
has spilled over into the banking industry and helped tip the
economy into a  recession  in the third quarter. Five banks
collapsed last year, prompting lenders to rein in credit and
spurring the government to pass new measures to support
businesses and farms.  “House prices continue to be slightly over the long-term
equilibrium level,” the council, which advises the Danish
government, said in its report. “Inflation will also erode real
house prices significantly.”  The council said gross domestic product will expand 1.3
percent this year as the government implements measures to spur
the economy. Growth will slow to 1.2 percent in 2013, it
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
