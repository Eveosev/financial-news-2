French President  Francois Hollande 
has the support of 61 percent of voters after two weeks in
office, according to a poll by the  BVA institute  for L’Express
magazine published today.  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault had the backing of 65
percent, BVA said in an e-mailed statement. Hollande, who took
power on May 16, was elected president on May 6 with 50.6
percent of the vote.  Fifty-five percent of respondents said they want the
president’s Socialist Party to win the June 10 and 17 elections
to the lower chamber of parliament.  Paris-based pollster BVA interviewed 1,304 respondents of
age 18 or over on May 23 and 24. It didn’t publish margins of
error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
