Terex Corp. (TEX) , which bought  Demag
Cranes AG (D9C)  in August, rose the most in six months after BMO
Capital Markets said equipment rental companies will buy more
aerial work platforms to replace aging fleets.  Terex climbed 11 percent to $18.80 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain since Nov. 30. Customers of Westport,
Connecticut-based Terex will buy more of the company’s cranes
and aerial work platforms, Charles D. Brady, an analyst at BMO,
wrote in a note published today. The  platforms  are used to lift
workers.  “This segment could outperform expectations over the next
12 to 18 months should non-residential construction spending
come back sooner or be stronger than expected,” Brady said.  Terex completed its purchase of Demag, a Dusseldorf,
Germany-based builder of cranes and harbor equipment, for about
963 million euros ($1.2 billion), on Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
