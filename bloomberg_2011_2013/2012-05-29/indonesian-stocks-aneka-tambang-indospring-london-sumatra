Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  rose 0.38 points, or less than
0.1 percent, to 3,919.07. The gauge has declined 6.3 percent in
May, heading for the first monthly drop since November.  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI)  , Indonesia’s biggest listed
plantation company by market value, gained 2 percent to 20,000
rupiah, the highest close since May 14.  Crude palm-oil imports by  India , the largest buyer, are
poised to increase after the nation raises the tax on refined
cooking oils, according to Adani Wilmar Ltd. Refined palm-oil
and soybean oil will become more expensive once the government
links the import tax to market prices, said  Atul Chaturvedi ,
chief executive officer of India’s second-biggest importer.  PT Aneka Tambang (ANTM)  , Indonesia’s second-largest
nickel producer, dropped 2.9 percent to 1,330 rupiah, the lowest
close since April 28, 2009. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. reduced its
share-price estimate on the stock to 1,460 rupiah from 1,710
rupiah. The government’s plan to impose a mineral ore export tax
will “negatively impact” Aneka, Peter P. Sutedja, a Jakarta-
based analyst at CIMB, said in a report today.  PT Indospring (INDS)  , an auto parts manufacturer, jumped
8.9 percent to 5,500 rupiah, the highest close since May 4.
Shareholders approved a bonus of two shares for every five held
by investors and a cash dividend of 160 rupiah a share, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
