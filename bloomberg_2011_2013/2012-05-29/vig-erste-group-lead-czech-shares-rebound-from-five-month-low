Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)  and  Erste
Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led a rebound for the Czech stock index from its
lowest in five months as optimism  China  will boost economic
growth drove investors to riskier assets.  VIG jumped 3.1 percent to 745 koruna and Erste climbed 1.4
percent to 373 koruna by 9:47 a.m. in Prague. The  PX (PX)  gauge, in
which the two Austrian companies have a combined 32 percent
weighting, rose 0.8 percent to 872.2, snapping a 1.5 percent
drop in the previous two sessions to the lowest since Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
