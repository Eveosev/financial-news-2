Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  plan to sell about $864.9 million of bonds
tied to commercial mortgages as  Wall Street  contends with wider
relative yields that can curb profits on new deals.  The transaction is backed by 61 loans on 80 properties
across the U.S., according to a person familiar with the
offering, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t
public. Retail buildings account for more than 57 percent of the
pool, the person said.  Lenders hold commercial mortgages for several months before
selling them as securities, which means swings in values as they
accumulate debt can reduce profit margins and thwart efforts to
boost sales. The extra yield investors demand to own top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries climbed 15
basis points to 201 basis points this month as the  European debt
crisis  rattled markets, according to a Barclays Plc index.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies
Group Inc. sold top-ranked debt that matures in 9.19 years to
yield 140 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate on May
18, the widest spread of 2012. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Banks have arranged about $10 billion in CMBS offerings
this year, compared with $28 billion in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance is down from a record $232
billion in 2007.  Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from Wells Fargo’s $25
billion to Credit Suisse Group AG’s projection of as much as $45
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
