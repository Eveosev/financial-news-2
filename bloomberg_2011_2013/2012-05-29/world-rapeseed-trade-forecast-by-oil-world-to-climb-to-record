World rapeseed and canola trade is
forecast to climb 16 percent to a record on increased imports by
 China  and the European Union, Oil World said.  Imports and exports will climb to 12.4 million metric tons
in the year through June from about 10.7 million tons in
2010-11, the Hamburg-based researcher oilseed researcher said
today in an e-mailed report.  Canada is the world’s biggest shipper of canola, a variety
of rapeseed, and the country’s exports of the oilseed are
forecast to jump to 8.6 million tons from 7.1 million tons after
production increased, according to Oil World.  “Canadian canola stocks will probably be depleted to a
multi-year low,” Oil World wrote. “Some demand rationing will
be inevitable in May to July 2012, the last quarter of the
Canadian canola crop year.”  China’s purchases of rapeseed and canola are forecast to
double to 2.23 million tons from 1.1 million tons, the report
shows. EU imports are forecast to climb to 3.18 million tons
from 2.7 million tons.  World rapeseed and canola production is forecast to slip to
59.4 million tons in 2011-12 from 60.7 million tons a year
earlier, with output dropping in the EU, India and China and
rising in  Canada , Australia and  Russia , according to Oil World.  To contact the reporter on this story:
