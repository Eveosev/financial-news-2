The opening of eight new border gates
between Mongolia and  China  yesterday will “significantly
increase” coal export capacity between the two nations, miner
 SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ)  said in a statement today.  Coal was previously transported out of Mongolia through a
single gate, which would allow empty trucks into Mongolia in the
mornings, and loaded trucks into China in the afternoons, the
company said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing.  Alexander Molyneux, SouthGobi’s president and chief
executive officer, said the new gates at the Shivee Khuren-Ceke
border crossing eliminate a bottleneck, reducing costs for
transport companies by allowing more-efficient use of trucks.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
