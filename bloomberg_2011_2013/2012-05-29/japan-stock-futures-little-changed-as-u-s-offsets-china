Japanese  stocks  fell, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average snapping a four-day rally, after Spain’s
credit rating was downgraded as the nation struggles to rescue
its banks, and on reports China has no plans to introduce large-
scale stimulus to bolster its slowing economy.  Nintendo Co., a maker of gaming consoles that gets a third
of its revenue from  Europe , sank 2.4 percent.  Fanuc (6954)  Corp., a
producer of automation controls for Chinese factories, lost 1.2
percent.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  soared 27 percent as short-
selling in its shares was restricted after a 25 percent slump
over the past two days.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to 8,633.19 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, headed for a monthly drop of 7.7 percent. Volume
on the gauge was almost 5 percent below the 30-day average. The
broader  Topix (TPX)  index lost 0.5 percent to 723.62, with about nine
shares dropping for every seven that gained.  “The European crisis is spreading out to  Spain  from
Greece,” said Kenji Shiomura, a manager at Daiwa Securities
Group Inc., Japan’s second-biggest brokerage. “Shares are
extremely undervalued, but even so, investors are reluctant to
buy, especially in sectors that depend on Europe.”  The  value  of stocks listed on the Topix has fallen to 0.85
times book value, compared with 2.10 times for the  S&P 500  and
1.34 times for the Stoxx 600. A number below one means companies
can be bought for less than value of their assets.  The Topix has plunged 17 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed, and on renewed
concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The political gridlock in
 Greece  after an inconclusive election this month reignited
concern the nation will renege on austerity pledges required for
240 billion euros ($299 billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Spain Downgraded  Shares fell after Spain’s credit grade was trimmed to B
from Bb- by Egan-Jones Ratings Co. The 17-nation currency fell
to a two-year low against the dollar on investor concern about
Spain’s ability to recapitalize banks, boosting speculation the
monetary union’s debt crisis is worsening. The euro weakened to
as low as 98.94 yen today in Tokyo, compared with 99.72 yen at
the close of trading yesterday.  Nintendo slid 2.4 percent to 9,010 yen.  Ricoh Co. (7752) , an
office-equipment and camera maker that obtains more than 20
percent of its revenue in Europe, sank 3.6 percent to 595 yen.  Stocks also fell on a report  China  has no plans to
introduce stimulus measures on the scale deployed during the
global financial crisis to counter the economic  slowdown ,
according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  “The Chinese government’s intention is very clear: It will
not roll out another massive stimulus plan to seek high economic
growth,” Xinhua said yesterday in a Chinese-language article on
economic policy, without attributing the source. “The current
efforts for stabilizing growth will not repeat the old way of
three years ago.”  China-Linked Shares  Fanuc slipped 1.2 percent to 13,710 yen. Murata
Manufacturing Co., an electronic-parts maker that depends on
China and Taiwan for about half of its sales, retreated 1.8
percent to 4,160 yen.  “The report completely threw a wet blanket over
expectations China may introduce measures to stimulate the
economy,” said Daiwa Securities’ Shiomura.  Among companies that fell, Aozora Bank Ltd., the Japanese
lender controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, declined
the most in the Nikkei 225, falling 7.1 percent to 171 yen. The
Nikkei newspaper reported the bank withdrew plans to announce a
public-fund repayment proposal next month after failing to reach
agreement with investors and the government.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  fell 0.5 percent today. The gauge
advanced 1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday after home values in
20 U.S. cities fell 2.6 percent in the 12 months ended March,
the smallest decrease since December 2010, while the Conference
Board’s gauge of  consumer confidence  unexpectedly dropped.  Renesas  Renesas Electronics, the world’s biggest maker of
microcontrollers for cars, surged 27 percent to 260 yen. Japan
Securities Finance Co., Japan’s biggest provider of loans for
 margin trading , restricted short-selling of the stock from today.
The shares rebounded after its two-day drop of 25 percent on the
company’s plans to raise 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion).  -- With assistance from Adam Haigh in Sydney. Editor: Jim Powell  To contact the reporter on this story:
