Taiwan’s 10-year government bond
yields rose to a three-week high on concern an increase in
electricity prices next month will stoke inflation. The local
dollar closed little changed.  The island’s sole electricity retailer, Taiwan Power Co.,
will raise prices to help recover losses from costlier fuel
prices. Inflation reached 1.44 percent in April, compared with
1.21 percent in March, official data show. The statistics bureau
forecast last week that consumer prices will rise 1.84 percent
this year, versus 1.42 percent in 2011 and 0.97 percent in 2010.  “There is a bit of pressure on inflation this year, which
should be short term in nature,” said George Pu, a bond trader
at Sinopac Securities Corp. in Taipei. Declines in bond prices
may be limited because of buying support from banks and
insurers, he said.  The yield on the 1.25 percent note due March 2022 climbed
1.5 basis points to 1.25 percent as of 4 p.m. in Taipei,
according to Gretai Securities, the highest level since May 4.
The notes may fetch 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent between now and
year-end, Pu said.  Taiwanese  government bonds  have returned 0.97 percent this
year, the third-worst performance among 10 Asian markets tracked
in a HSBC Holdings Plc index. The securities rose 0.29 percent
this month.  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$29.645 against
its U.S. counterpart, maintaining its depreciation this month at
1.4 percent, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders use to
price options, dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 5.59 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.51 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
