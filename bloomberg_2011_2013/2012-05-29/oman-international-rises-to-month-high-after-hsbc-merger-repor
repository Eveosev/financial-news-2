(Corrects date of board meeting in third paragraph.)  Oman International Bank SAOG (OIBB)  climbed
to the highest in a month after Al Watan newspaper said the
bank’s merger with  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s operations in the Persian
Gulf country is on schedule.  The shares gained 1.7 percent to 0.238 rial, the highest
level since April 30, at 12:47 p.m. in Muscat. The benchmark
 MSM30 Index (MSM30)  advanced 0.9 percent.  The Muscat-based bank will elect a new board of directors
May 31, the newspaper said, without saying how it obtained the

the merger after a lawsuit, Times of Oman reported last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
