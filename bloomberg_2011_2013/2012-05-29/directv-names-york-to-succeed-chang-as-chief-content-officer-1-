DirecTV (DTV) , the largest satellite pay-
television service, named Dan York chief content officer, to
succeed Derek Chang, who is leaving at the end of the year.  York, former president of content and advertising sales for
 AT&T Inc. (T) , will join DirecTV in early July, the El Segundo,
California-based company said today in a statement.  Chang, 44, whose plans weren’t provided, has run DirecTV’s
content group since March 2007. He led the company’s
introduction of three-dimensional channels in 2010 and pushed
for premium on-demand rights to films shortly after their
theatrical runs ended, in some cases angering cinema operators.  DirecTV was unchanged at $46.40 at the close in  New York .
The stock has gained 8.5 percent this year. Dallas-based AT&T
added 0.7 percent to $33.94 and is up 12 percent in 2012.  York developed the content strategy and offering for AT&T
U-verse video platform and oversaw the company’s content
operation on all platforms to more than 100 million customers.
In six years, he helped build U-verse from zero to about $8
billion in annualized revenue, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
