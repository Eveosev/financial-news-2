Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said he sometimes wishes that the country’s soccer league would
be banned for two to three years because of repeated cases of
corruption and match fixing.  Monti said today at a press conference in Rome that
suspending soccer was not the position of his government and
that he was “deeply saddened” by the latest case alleging
match fixing by top players and coaches.  Prosecutors yesterday ordered the arrest of 19 people in a
probe of match fixing. Monti said that allegations show that all
corruption in  Italy  isn’t confined to politics as many Italians
seem to believe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
