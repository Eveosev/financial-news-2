Banco Popular  Espanol SA, a Spanish
lender under pressure to comply with a government order to
recognize real estate losses, is in talks to sell majority
stakes in its internet bank and bank-cards businesses.  No agreement has been reached on any sale, the Madrid-based
bank said today in a filing to regulators. Expansion newspaper
today reported that Popular could earn 2 billion euros ($2.5
billion) of gains from the sale of the internet bank.  Popular said on May 14 that the impact of the latest real
estate clean-up ordered by the government would cost it 1.7
billion euros in additional provisions. The bank said that
potential transactions announced today would help it generate
“reasonable results” over the next two years and that it plans
further steps to raise funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
