The U.K.’s National Union of Rail,
Maritime and Transport reached agreement with  London Underground 
on a dispute over the  Olympic Games .  The agreement includes as much as 850 pounds per day in
extra pay for workers “in recognition of the massive additional
pressures” during the Olympics, the union said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Transport for London welcomed the union’s acceptance of its
proposals, it said in a separate e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
