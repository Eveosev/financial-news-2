The European Commission will call on
Belgium to allow its pension age to rise in line with  life
expectancy  and to boost competition on its energy market as part
of a set of measures to improve competitiveness,  De Tijd 
reported, citing a draft report.  The recommendations, to be published tomorrow by the
commission, also include that the country should shift its tax
burden from employment to environment and energy, and prevent
wages from significantly exceeding those in neighbouring
countries, the newspaper said.  Belgium will also be told to honor its commitment to get
its  budget deficit  below 3 percent of economic output in 2012,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
