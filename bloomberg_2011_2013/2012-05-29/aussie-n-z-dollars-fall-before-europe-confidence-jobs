The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars remained higher after gaining yesterday as Asian stocks
rose, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie and kiwi climbed versus most of their
major counterparts as commodities advanced and futures signaled
U.S. equities are poised to strengthen. Both South Pacific
nations’ currencies headed for monthly declines against the U.S.
dollar before reports this week that may show euro area  consumer
confidence  remained weak and the jobless rate rose across the 17
nation bloc, boosting speculation the Europe’s fiscal turmoil is
hurting growth.  “Stock markets have now started to stabilize,” said
 Joseph Capurso , a strategist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia . “That’s helped the Aussie and kiwi to form a bottom
and tick up a little bit.”  Australia ’s dollar added 0.2 percent to 98.74 U.S. cents as
of 4:32 p.m. in Sydney after rising 1 percent yesterday, its
biggest one-day gain since April 12. The Aussie climbed 0.3
percent to 78.50 yen. New Zealand’s currency was up 0.1 percent
at 76.27 cents after advancing 1.1 percent yesterday. It gained
0.1 percent to 60.64 yen.  Australia’s bonds rallied, pushing  10-year yields  down four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.14 percent. New
Zealand’s  two-year swap rate , a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, climbed two basis points to 2.5 percent.  Stocks, Commodities Gain  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares rose 1.2 percent
after earlier falling as much as 0.6 percent. Standard & Poor’s
500 Index futures climbed 0.9 percent.  Oil gained for a third day, advancing 0.7 percent. Copper
prices added 0.4 percent.  In Australia, a private report by the Housing Industry
Association showed sales of  newly built homes  rose 6.9 percent
last month to 5,816, the biggest increase in more than two
years. That compares with a 9.4 percent drop to a record low in
March, according to the data.  The kiwi has dropped 6.8 percent versus the dollar since
April 30, the worst performance among 16 major counterparts of
the  U.S. dollar , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Aussie has fallen 5.3 percent.  An index of  consumer confidence  in the euro area was at
minus 19.3 in May, from minus 19.9 in April, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the final reading is released
tomorrow. The  jobless rate  probably climbed to 11 percent in
April, the highest in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to
1990, economists forecast in a separate survey before the June 1
report.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold  Spain ’s 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German notes soared to 5.12
percentage points yesterday, the most since 1995, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Under Stress  “The uncertainty in  Europe  and the unknown of how
governments are going to fund the recapitalization of banks are
impacting the Aussie,” said Greg Gibbs, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney. “It’s
pretty clear that several periphery countries are under a lot of
stress already.”  Standard Chartered Plc lowered its forecasts for the
Australian currency and sees it at 96 cents in the three months
ending June 30 from an earlier prediction of $1.03. The Aussie
dollar will be at 99 U.S. cents by year-end, down from a
previous estimate of $1.10, it said in a note yesterday. The
bank also reduced its estimate for the kiwi and sees it at 75
cents in the fourth quarter, compared with an earlier projection
of 88 cents.  Australia’s dollar has declined 1.8 percent this year, the
second-worst performance among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
Its New Zealand counterpart dropped 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
