Kuwait formed a ministerial committee
to handle an international court ruling that ordered the Gulf
state to pay $2.16 billion in damages to  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) ,
according to a Cabinet statement.  The committee, headed by the finance minister, will also
seek to “minimize losses and damages” as a result of the
ruling, according to the statement, released after the Council
of Ministers’ weekly meeting yesterday.  The award by the London-based International Court of
Arbitration doesn’t include costs or interest and is final and
binding, Midland, Michigan-based Dow said on May 24.  Kuwait’s Petrochemical Industries Co., under pressure from
lawmakers, canceled a contract to form a 50-50 venture with
Dow’s plastics unit in December 2008. The failure of the so-
called K-Dow venture deprived Dow of a $9 billion payment during
the global financial crisis, almost derailed its 2009 purchase
of Rohm & Haas Co. and forced the company’s first dividend cut.  Kuwait’s government, which has held a series of high-level
meetings since the ruling was announced, also formed a separate
panel to probe all procedures followed in the deal and those
leading to its cancelation, according to the statement.
