(Corrects date of board meeting in second paragraph.)  Oman International Bank SAOG (OIBB) ’s merger
with  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s operations in the Arab country is
proceeding on schedule, Al Watan reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The Muscat-based bank will elect a new board of directors
May 31, the newspaper said. Oman’s Ministry of Commerce and
Industry had halted the merger after a lawsuit, Times of Oman
reported last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
