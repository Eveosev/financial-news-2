Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP) ,  Kenya ’s
only publicly traded retailer, gained the most in almost three
months after a three-day fall.  The stock jumped 7.7 percent to 16.7 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the capital, the biggest increase since March 8. The
stock had dropped 20 percent in the previous three sessions.  “We have been seeing quite a bit of aggressive selling
during the three days and today there was some foreign buying,
that combined with local investors who think the stock has
bottomed out,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
