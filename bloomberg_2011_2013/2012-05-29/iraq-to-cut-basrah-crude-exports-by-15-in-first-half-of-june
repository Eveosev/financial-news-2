Iraq  will reduce its daily exports of
Basrah Light crude from the  Persian Gulf  by 15 percent in the
first half of June compared with shipments in the previous two
weeks, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The  nation  will ship 19 cargoes from the Basrah Oil
Terminal, seven less than in the second half of May, according
to the plan. Exports will total 32.1 million barrels, or 2.14
million barrels a day, compared with 2.53 million a day two
weeks earlier.  The June program comprises 14 consignments of 2 million
barrels each, two 1 million-barrel lots, and two 600,000-barrel
and one 900,000-barrel.  Iraq started operating a second offshore mooring facility
for crude exports from the Gulf on April 20. The new single-
point unit with the capacity to handle 900,000 barrels a day is
the second of four planned.  A third mooring facility will be ready “within a few
months” and would be used if exports increase, Dhia Jaafar,
director general of Southern Oil Co., said on April 20. Deputy
Prime Minister for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said in
December that a fourth unit will be in place in 2013.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
