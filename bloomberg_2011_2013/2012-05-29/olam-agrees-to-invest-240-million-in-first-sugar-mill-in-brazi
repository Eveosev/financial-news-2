Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , one of the
world’s top three suppliers of rice, cocoa, and coffee, agreed
to invest $240 million in its first sugar mill in Brazil by
buying Usina Açucareira Passos S.A.  The Singapore-based company will pay 255 million reais
($128.6 million) for the acquisition and will invest $111.5
million over the next five years to expand capacity and boost
output, Olam said in a statement today. The investment will be
funded internally and with borrowings, it said.  Olam, partly owned by Singapore’s state-backed Temasek
Holdings Pte., is buying assets and developing new projects to
help boost annual profit after tax to $1 billion by 2016, Chief
Executive Officer Sunny Verghese said March 7 in  Kuala Lumpur .
The company this year also bought a biscuit and candy maker in
Nigeria and agreed to invest as much as $800 million with a
partner in a new dairy venture in  Russia .  “Brazil is the largest and one of the most cost
competitive producers of sugar in the world, and is integral to
executing our sugar strategy,” Devashish Chaubey, Olam’s
president for sugar, said in the statement.  The mill’s capacity will expand to 3 million metric tons
annually from 1.75 million tons, it said. The sugar mill is
located in the state of  Minas Gerais , the second largest
sugarcane growing area in Brazil, it said.  Olam closed 1.8 percent higher at S$1.695 in Singapore,
before the announcement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
