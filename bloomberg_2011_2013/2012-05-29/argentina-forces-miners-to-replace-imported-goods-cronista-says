Argentina  ordered mining companies to
use local transport companies for exports and replace imported
goods with locally-made products, newspaper El Cronista
reported, citing government resolutions.  The measures aim to limit the purchase of dollars used to
pay for imported goods and services, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said. The government may extend this resolution to
other industries, according to the newspaper.  About 70 percent of the industryâ€™s supplies are bought
abroad, the paper said. The government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner estimates that replacing imported goods
will help boost the  trade balance  by $1.5 billion, Cronista
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
