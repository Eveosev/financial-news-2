China ’s government will spend as much
as 2 billion  yuan  ($315 million) a year to develop alternative-
energy vehicles to reduce fuel consumption, the  finance ministry 
said today.  The government will also promote using buses with hybrid
engines in major cities, Vice Finance Minister Zhang Shaochun
said in a  statement  on the ministry’s website. Agencies and
companies that provide public services, such car-rental firms,
will be encouraged to use alternative energy vehicles in 25
trial cities, Zhang said.  A projected tripling in  vehicle  population by 2020 will
increase the country’s demand for fossil fuel and add to its air
pollution. China buys more than half of its crude oil needs from
overseas and is the world’s second-largest importer of oil after
the U.S.  Air quality  in all of the 32 Chinese cities that track
pollution falls short of World Health Organization guidelines,
with Beijing among the world’s most polluted cities.  The finance ministry urged cities to exempt alternative-
energy vehicles from restrictions on the issue of license plates
and limiting the use of cars on certain days. Municipal
authorities should also introduce preferential policies for
parking, electricity rates and highway tolls, while speeding up
construction of charging stations, according to the statement.  Automakers including  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and
BYD Co. have announced plans to introduce hybrids or electric
vehicles in China.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
