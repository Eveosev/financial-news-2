Deutsche Wohnen (DWNI)  AG, the residential-
property investor that’s buying 23,500 German apartments from
 Barclays Plc (BARC) , plans to sell almost a fifth of the homes to focus
on cities including Berlin and Frankfurt.  Deutsche Wohnen will divest 4,339 properties in Bremen,
Luebeck and other medium-sized cities, Chief Executive Officer
Michael Zahn said on a call with analysts and reporters today.
The company agreed to purchase Baubecon Group, Barclays’ German
housing unit, two days ago in a transaction valued at about 1.25
billion euros ($1.6 billion) including debt.  Baubecon is a legacy of the buyout boom in German
multifamily housing before the credit crisis that started in
2008. Barclays took over the company when borrowers  Prelios SpA (PRS) 
and Deutsche Bank AG’s RREEF Real Estate refused to provide the
company with more money. Prelios and RREEF bought Baubecon for
1.67 billion euros in a 2007 deal financed by a 1.3 billion-euro
loan from Barclays.  Deutsche Wohnen will increase its portfolio to 73,260 homes
as a result of the transaction, the Frankfurt-based company said
in a May 27 statement. The additional properties will generate
95 million euros of gross rental income a year, Zahn said. That
will allow Deutsche Wohnen to raise its annual funds from
operations, a measure of a company’s ability to generate cash,
by about 10 million euros, he said.  Boost to Profit  “We’ve built the foundation to significantly boost our
earnings in the next two to three years,” the CEO said.  Deutsche Wohnen climbed 45 cents, or 4 percent, to 11.85
euros at the 5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt . The shares have risen
about 13 percent in the past 12 months, while the German DAX
Mid-Cap Index on which the stock trades has dropped almost 3
percent. Barclays was unchanged at 181 pence in  London .  Baubecon’s homes have an average vacancy rate of 3.3
percent. During the first quarter, Deutsche Wohnen’s properties
had an average rate of 2.3 percent, according to the company’s
latest results.  The acquisition may be completed as early as July 31, Zahn
said. The transaction will be financed with a loan of as much as
750 million euros from unidentified German banks and 180 million
euros in cash raised in a capital increase in November.  Deutsche Wohnen may sell additional shares to pay off a
bridging loan from Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG that was
also used to finance the deal, Zahn said.  Deutsche Wohnen is in talks to buy three smaller groups of
apartments, he said, without naming the sellers. The company’s
goal is to own about 75,000 properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
