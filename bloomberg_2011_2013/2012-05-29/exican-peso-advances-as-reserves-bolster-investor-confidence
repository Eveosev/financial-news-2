Mexico ’s peso rose for a second day
as the central bank said international reserves increased for
the first time in four weeks, boosting confidence in policy
makers’ ability to support the currency as needed.  “In case of an event with foreign markets, the central
bank has the ability to intervene” Mario Copca, a currency
strategist at Metanalisis SA, said by phone from Mexico City.
“We keep having good results.”  The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 13.8832 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City. It has gained 0.4 percent in 2012 after
touching 14.0775 on May 23, the weakest level on an intraday
basis since Nov. 28.  International holdings advanced by $496 million to $154.3
billion last week after falling for the prior three weeks, the
central bank reported.  It sold dollars on May 23 for the first time since 2009 to
prop up the peso after it plunged to a six-month low. The
central bank sold $258 million under a program that it has had
in place since November in which policy makers offer $400
million daily at an  exchange rate  at least 2 percent weaker than
the previous day’s official fix level to reduce volatility.  Concern  Greece  may abandon the euro has helped spur a 6.4
percent drop in the peso this month. Greece’s New Democracy
party, which supports an austerity plan negotiated with
international lenders, placed first in polls published May 26 as
campaigning continued for next month’s election.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.19 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased
0.48 centavo to 133.20 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
