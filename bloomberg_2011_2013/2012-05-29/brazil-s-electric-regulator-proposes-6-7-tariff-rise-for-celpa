The Brazilian electric energy
regulatory agency, known as Aneel, proposed a 6.7 percent higher
tariff for  Centrais Eletricas do Para SA , said Aneel’s general
director Nelson Hubner.  The proposal will have a public evaluation to determine the
final figure, to be effective Aug. 7, Hubner told reporters in
Brasilia today.  The company from the Brazilian northern state of Para has
filed for bankruptcy and presented a recovery plan May 4. In the
document, Celpa said to expect Aneel to grant a 10.33 percent
tariff increase as one of the premises for the company to be
able to pay their debt holders.  Celpa’s bankruptcy has led its parent  Rede Energia SA (REDE4)  to
seek to renegotiate dollar-bond terms after the securities
plunged and  Fitch Ratings  cut the company’s credit rating to one
level above default. Fitch trimmed Rede Energia’s grade two
levels to C from CCC on March 9, saying Celpa’s bankruptcy will
likely prevent the parent from accessing the credit needed to
roll over short-term debt.  About 66 percent of Celpa is owned by Rede Energia, while
state-run  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , known as
Eletrobras, holds about 35 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
