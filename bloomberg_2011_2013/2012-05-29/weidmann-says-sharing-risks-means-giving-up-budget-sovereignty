Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said if euro-area governments want to share risks, they will
need to give up some sovereignty over budgets.  “We have to take a fundamental decision: where do we want
to go with the currency union?” Weidmann said today after a
meeting with officials from  Germany ’s Ver.di trade union,
according to an e-mailed statement from the union. “At the
moment there is a trend toward a collectivization of the risks,
but no corresponding willingness to give up national budgetary
sovereignty.”  Weidmann, who sits on the European Central Bank’s Governing
Council, said the ECB’s monetary policy is currently aimed at
preventing an escalation of the  European debt crisis , according
to Ver.di. Weidmann also said experience suggests better
regulation of financial markets is needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
