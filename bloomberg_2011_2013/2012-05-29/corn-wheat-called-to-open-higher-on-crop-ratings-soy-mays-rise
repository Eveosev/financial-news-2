What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the CBOT after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
reported a drop in crop conditions after the close of pit
trading in Chicago, Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global
Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana , said by
telephone. The USDA said 72 percent of the crop was rated good
or excellent as of yesterday, down from 77 percent a week
earlier.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after the USDA report showed declining conditions
of winter varieties in the southern Great Plains, Zuzolo said.
The department said 54 percent of the crop received the top two
ratings, down from 58 percent a week earlier.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher in
 Chicago  as equities gain, improving the demand outlook for raw
materials, Zuzolo said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.3 cent to 0.5 cent higher, and soybean-meal futures may open
$3 to $4 higher per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
