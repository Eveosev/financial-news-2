Iran ’s Foreign Ministry said life
sentences issued by a court in Kuwait for Iranian nationals
accused of spying are “baseless” and unacceptable.  “Baseless claims, which are surprising, have been made
again,” ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  said today in the
Iranian capital, Tehran, according to the state-run  Mehr  news
agency. “Such verdicts are in no way acceptable.”  Two Iranian men were sentenced yesterday to life in jail by
an appeals court in Kuwait on charges of spying for the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Kuwait hasn’t given the Iranian consulate access to the
accused, said Mehmanparast, who did not identify them. The
Iranian official said he hoped Kuwaiti officials will reconsider
the verdict and release the men.  To contact the reporter on this story:
