Boston Hannah International LLC, a
publishing company, filed for bankruptcy court liquidation.  The company listed assets of less than $50,000 against debt
of more than $500,000 in a Chapter 7 petition filed in  U.S.

interests of the company, its creditors, members, and other
parties in interest,” according to a court filing.  Chapter 7 proceedings let companies liquidate their assets
while being protected from creditors. The bankruptcy petition
was filed by Jason C. Powell, a partner at Ferry, Joseph and

bk-11645, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
