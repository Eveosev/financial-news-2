New Zealand ’s central bank will keep
the official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent until early
2014 because of falling exports and increasing global risks, the
New Zealand Institute of Economic Research said.  The  Reserve Bank  may cut interest rates if the European
debt crisis worsens,  Shamubeel Eaqub , principal economist at the
Wellington-based organization, said in a report today. In March,
he forecast a rate rise in mid-2013.  New Zealand’s economy will grow 1.5 percent this year and
2.5 percent in 2013 as reconstruction of earthquake-damaged
Christchurch and the surrounding province of Canterbury
accelerates, NZIER predicted. Traders are pricing in a 45
percent chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the central bank’s
next review on June 14, according to  interest-rate swaps  data
compiled by Bloomberg late yesterday.  “There is little economic growth and the outlook is
challenging,” Eaqub said. “Low interest rates are not
encouraging new borrowing and investing.”  Consumers are paying down debt rather than spending because
job and wage growth are subdued, Eaqub said. The deleveraging
trend may continued for another three years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
