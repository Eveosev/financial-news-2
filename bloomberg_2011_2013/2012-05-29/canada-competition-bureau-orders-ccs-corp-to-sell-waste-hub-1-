Canadian Competition Commissioner
 Melanie Aitken  won an order today forcing CCS Corp. to sell a
hazardous-waste landfill site, which she said marks the first
such challenge since 2005 and sets a precedent for future
disputes.  The ruling today by the country’s competition tribunal
requires the company to sell the Babkirk site, an asset acquired
when it bought Complete Environmental Inc. The purchase would
have reduced competition in northeast British Columbia,
according to a statement from the commissioner’s office.  “We would far prefer to resolve matters consensually,”
Aitken said in a telephone interview from Toronto. “If we have
to protect competition we won’t hesitate to take something to
court.”  CCS Corp. in March was  renamed  along with other business
units as Tervita Corp. The closely held company is based in
Calgary.  “While we are disappointed in the decision reached by the
tribunal, it is a lengthy decision involving a consideration of
several novel legal issues,” company representative Mandy
Dinning wrote in an e-mail. “We will take the time to review it
thoroughly with a view toward determining whether the pursuit of
a successful appeal would be available to us.”  Aitken declined to comment on her review of the takeover
bid for TMX Group Inc. by Canadian banks and pension funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
