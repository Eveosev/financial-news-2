Sierra Leone ’s National Commission
for Privatisation signed a three-year  management contract  with
Management and Development International Co. of Beirut to run
the state-owned telecommunications company, Sierratel.  “Sierratel still remains 100 percent government-owned,”
Madonna Thompson, head of the commission’s utilities section,
said in an interview in Freetown, the capital, today. “All the
structures still remain, it’s just that the day-to-day
operations to turn around the business will be done by a
management contractor.”  The talks over the contract lasted for nine months,
Thompson said. Sierratel has monopoly over landlines in the West
African nation and also provides mobile-phone and internet
services.    To contact the reporter on this story:
