Gold is seen declining for the first
time in three days in London on speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis
will drive investors to the dollar, curbing demand for the metal
as an alternative asset.  The dollar traded near a 22-month high versus the euro
today as concern Europe’s turmoil is hurting economic growth
boosted demand for the greenback. Gold imports by  India  may fall
as much as 51 percent this month as a weaker rupee and higher
duties increase prices, the Bombay Bullion Association said.  “Whether it’s  Greece  leaving the euro or Spain being next
in line for a bailout, investors are focusing on the crisis in
Europe at the moment and picking the dollar as their haven of
choice,” said Sun Yonggang, an analyst at Everbright Futures
Co., a unit of  China ’s largest state-owned investment group.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,577.25 an ounce by 9:14 a.m. in London. Prices are 5.3
percent lower in May for a fourth monthly decline, the longest
losing run since 1999. August-delivery futures were 0.5 percent
higher at $1,578.30 on the Comex in  New York . U.S. markets were
closed yesterday for Memorial Day.  Gold is up 0.9 percent this year after 11 consecutive
annual increases. Bullion purchases by India may be about 50
metric tons to 60 tons this month, down from 102 tons a year
earlier,  Prithviraj Kothari , president of the Bombay Bullion
Association, said today in a phone interview.  Consumer confidence  in the euro area was at minus 19.3 in
May, compared with minus 19.9 in April, according to a Bloomberg
News survey before the final reading is released tomorrow.  The  unemployment rate  climbed to 11 percent in April, the
highest in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1990,
according to a separate survey of economists before the June 1
report.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.4 percent to $28.5175
an ounce. Palladium was little changed at $605.88 an ounce.
Platinum was little changed at $1,439.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
