(Corrects second paragraph to show floor and electronic
trading schedule.)  Palladium futures for September
delivery rose $19.45, or 3.3 percent, to $611.30 an ounce at
10:45 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. A close at that
price would mark the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since Feb. 21  Yesterday, Nymex floor trading was closed for a public
holiday, while electronic trading was open, and no settlement
price was issued. Palladium for immediate delivery in over-the-
counter trading climbed 2.6 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
