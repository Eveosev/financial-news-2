Rafako SA (RFK) , the power engineering unit
of Poland’s third-largest builder  PBG SA (PBG) , headed for the lowest
in more than a week after saying Alstom Power Systems GmbH filed
a suit against it in a German court.  The shares lost 0.4 percent to 7.8 zloty, the lowest on a
closing basis since May 18, as of 9:12 a.m. in Warsaw trading.  The unit of France’s  Alstom SA (ALO)  seeks 28.7 million euros
($36 million) from its subcontractor for damages related to work
on a German power plant, Rafako said in a regulatory statement
yesterday. The Polish company said the lawsuit is groundless and
should be rejected in full.  To contact the reporter on this story:
