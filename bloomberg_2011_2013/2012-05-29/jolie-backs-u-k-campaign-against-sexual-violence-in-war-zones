Actress  Angelina Jolie  will give her
support to a British campaign against sexual violence in war
zones, the Foreign Office said.  A U.K. team able to be deployed to conflict areas to gather
information for legal cases will be created under the
initiative. Jolie, a special envoy to the United Nations High
Commissioner on Refugees, will attend the launch at the Foreign
Office in  London , which will also show “In the Land of Blood
and Honey,” her directorial debut set during the 1990s Bosnian
war.  “It is in the context of war and conflict that that sexual
violence is found to the most appalling degree and on a scale
most of us cannot imagine,” Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
will say, according to remarks released by his office.  As many as 50,000 women were raped in Bosnia between 1992
and 1995 and as many as 250,000 during the genocide in Rwanda,
Hague will say.  To contact the reporter on this story:
