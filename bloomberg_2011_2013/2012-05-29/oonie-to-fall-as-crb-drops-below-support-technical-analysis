Investors should bet the Canadian
dollar will slide to its weakest level since October as
commodities drop below 3 1/2 year support levels, according to
Bank of America Corp.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index (CRY)  of raw materials
fell below 295 on May 8, a 42-month trend line, and reached
280.34 today, the lowest level since September 2010. It may
decline to 265 and 257, according to  MacNeil Curry , head of
foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical strategy at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch in New York.  Raw materials account for
half of Canada’s export revenue.  Curry’s firm entered a Canadian-dollar bet at C$1.0053 per
 U.S. dollar  on May 15, with a target of it weakening to
C$1.0528, he wrote to clients today. It last closed weaker than
that on Oct. 3. The firm will exit the trade if the Canadian
currency gains to 99.50 cents.  Brent crude oil has decreased below $109.45 per barrel, its
3 1/2 year support, opening up a possible decline to $98.27,
Curry wrote. Copper touched $7,647 per metric ton in  London ,
about $140 above its equivalent support level at $7,505. Support
is an area on a chart where buy orders may be clustered.  “The CRB Index having broken its 3.5 year trend line
support, crude having broken it as well and copper on the verge,
we should see a weaker  Canada  dollar,” Curry said in an
interview.  The Canadian currency traded at C$1.0249 at 1:59 p.m. in
Toronto, down 0.1 percent, after strengthening earlier as much
as 0.3 percent.  Net Longs Decline  Futures traders  had 38,555 more contracts betting on a rise
in the Canadian dollar against the greenback than a decline --
so-called net longs -- in the week ended May 22, according to
the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. That was down from
70,223 on May 4, an almost 14-month high. The average net-long
position for the  currency pair  in the past year has been 7,043
contracts.  “Guys are clearly long Canadian dollars and are
underwater,” Curry said. “All the longs were put on when we
were trading between C$1.0053 and 97 cents in the four months
between February and May, so it’s pretty decent factor that
could move price action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
