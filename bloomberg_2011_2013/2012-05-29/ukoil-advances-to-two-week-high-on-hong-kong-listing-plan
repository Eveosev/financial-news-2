OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-biggest
oil producer, rose the most in three months on plans to list
more than $1 billion of its existing shares in Hong Kong within
a year.  Lukoil climbed 3.6 percent to 1,728.6 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest gain since Feb. 24. American depositary
receipts of Lukoil shares climbed the most in three month,
gaining 5.1 percent to $53.80. One ADR represents one ordinary
share.  “Placement on the Asian stock exchanges could help Lukoil
realize its expansion plans in the area, in particular in
China,” Daria Kozlova, an analyst at Rye, Man and Gor
Securities, said in an e-mailed note.  Vagit Alekperov, the billionaire CEO of the Moscow-based
oil producer, is seeking to quadruple Lukoil’s market value in
the next decade as the company invests $125 billion to expand
exploration and production worldwide. The company has previously
said it may borrow in  yuan  and look to Asia for growth.  Lukoil may hire China International Capital Corp. and
Renaissance Capital for the listing, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer  Leonid Fedun  told reporters in Hong Kong after a
presentation to investors today. The oil producer may later gain
access to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange (510230) , subject to permission
from the Chinese government, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
