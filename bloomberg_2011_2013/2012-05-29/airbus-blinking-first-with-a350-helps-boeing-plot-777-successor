Airbus (EAD)  SAS is losing the staring
contest with  Boeing Co. (BA)   The European planemaker may have to rework its A350-1000
wide-body jet as cancellations mount and airlines criticize the
design of Airbus’s alternative to Boeing’s 777. That gives
Boeing some breathing room before it commits to a successor to
the world’s top-selling twin-aisle airliner.  The pending decisions on the 777 and the A350-1000 show the
risks in an industry whose products cost billions of dollars to
develop and typically stay in production for decades. While
Airbus and Boeing share a duopoly for single-aisle jets, the
U.S. company holds the advantage in wide-body planes, which
offer higher margins because they cost three times as much.  “Airplane development is one of the best real-life case
studies in game theory,” said Carter Copeland, a  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
analyst in New York. “These are big bets with long-life
paybacks. Decisions about components, technology, production
systems, all have an important bearing on the long-term profit
profile of these programs.”  The A350-1000 was initially scheduled for delivery in 2015,
before Airbus announced a delay in late 2011, saying it needed
another 18 months to boost the performance of the largest member
of the A350 line. Qatar Airways and Emirates, the biggest A350
buyers, have said they still aren’t content with the design,
adding pressure on Airbus as Boeing plots what comes after its
777-300ER.  Second-Mover Benefit  Boeing said it stands to benefit from Airbus moving first,
because the rival product would help the Chicago-based company
hone its response. The next plane probably will come at the turn
of the decade and have a new engine, said  Randy Tinseth ,
Boeing’s vice president for marketing.  “We’re in no rush to address that market,” Tinseth told
journalists in Paris yesterday. “It’s better to have everything
lined up for what we can do and when we can do it, understand
what the competition will do and then move forward.”  Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders hands off the
A350-1000 challenge tomorrow to Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier, who becomes CEO as Enders ascends to lead parent
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. The transition will
occur at EADS’s annual general meeting in Amsterdam.  The twin-engine 777 entered service in 1995, and has since
been upgraded with the 777-300ER variant. That plane lists for
$298.3 million and has a maximum range of 7,930 nautical miles
(14,685 kilometers).  Buying at Discount  No A350s are flying yet. The first version, the mid-sized
A350-900, is undergoing final assembly, with entry into service
scheduled for the first half of 2014. The A350-1000 lists for
$320.6 million. Airlines typically buy at a discount.  Airbus’s only wide-body model below the A380 jumbo is the
twin-engine A330, which entered service in the mid 1990s. The
jet has gained sales in recent years as an alternative to
Boeing’s delayed 787 Dreamliner. The four-engine A340 variant
was a commercial flop because it burned too much fuel, and
Airbus ended the program last year after losing out to the 777.  The two planemakers have found themselves in a who-blinks-
first standoff before. In December 2010, Airbus said it would
offer new engines on its A320 single-aisle jet, jumping ahead as
Boeing deliberated between engine upgrades on the 737 or an all-
new narrow-body model.  Leapfrogging Boeing  Record orders for the A320neo variant forced Boeing to
agree seven months later to outfit the 737 with new engines -- a
pledge taken in such haste that the U.S. company’s board had yet
to sign off on the plane that has since been dubbed 737 MAX.  The A320 was pivotal to the success of Toulouse, France-
based Airbus in leapfrogging Boeing in 2003 for the top spot in
global commercial sales, a position it has defended since. The
wide-body market has been tougher to crack, leaving Airbus with
an open flank in an area where Boeing earns its highest margins.  In the last five years, Boeing’s commercial airplane
business has earned a profit margin of 6.5 percent on average,
compared with 1.9 percent for Airbus, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Boeing’s superior margins rest partly with its
success in wide-bodies, which comprise half of all commercial
plane sales in dollars.  “There’s a significant difference in pricing and
profitability between wide-bodies and narrow-bodies,” said
 Richard Aboulafia , vice president of Fairfax, Virginia-based
forecaster Teal Group. “The difference between Boeing and
Airbus in commercial margins reflects that.”  No New Orders  Airbus suffered a setback in April on the A350-1000 when
Etihad canceled seven jets, after already paring its order book
in December. That left the Abu Dhabi state-owned airline with 12
A350s, less than half the number it originally agreed to take.  While Boeing celebrated the delivery of the 1,000th 777 in
March, the A350-1000 has only 62 orders, compared with 368 for
the smaller A350-900. The bigger plane hasn’t won a new order
since 2008 and has only four customers. Airbus Sales Chief  John Leahy  said May 25 that there’s a dearth of orders because he has
no delivery slots within a reasonable time frame.  “Our biggest constraint right now is production slots,”
Leahy said when asked about the A350-1000’s lack of sales.  The A350 is Airbus’s first major program since the A380
double-decker entered service in 2007. Airbus is building the
A350 from composite materials that are lighter and promise
greater  fuel efficiency , though they are less tried than
aluminum and require more complex design and assembly.  ‘Not Satisfied’  Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker, who has an order for 80
A350s, including 20 of the largest variant, has publicly blasted
Airbus for falling short with the design of the A350, demanding
the company fulfill its contractual obligation.  “The aircraft is on the drawing board, we are not
satisfied,”  Al Baker  said in a March interview. “They will
need major improvement in range, performance, and fuel burn.”  Boeing is racing to keep up with 777 demand. The planemaker
won 202 orders for the jet in 2011, more than any previous year,
and is increasing production to 8.3 a month starting in 2013’s
first quarter, from seven now.  The popularity of the 777 and Airbus’s struggles on the
A350-1000 give Boeing flexibility to choose the best time when
to upgrade the plane, Commercial Airplanes CEO  Jim Albaugh  told
analysts at a May 15 meeting.  Albaugh said Boeing’s expectation is that the new 777 would
have a wing made of composite materials along with new engines.
Albaugh has said he expects Boeing to have a plan for a 777
upgrade to take the company’s board by year’s end.  Emirates President  Tim Clark , whose airline is the biggest
operator of 777s, said in an interview last month that he was
eager to have a successor by 2019 and may order more than 100
over time. He also has said Airbus’s design changes and
subsequent delays on the A350-1000 were unnecessary.  Boeing has a leg up on the design of the new 777 because of
lessons learned from the design, production and customer
feedback on the Dreamliner, which has composite-material wings
and fuselage, said  Howard Rubel , an analyst with Jeffries & Co.
in  New York .  “The more time they give thought to how to come up with
some incremental and possibly break-through solutions, the
better the 777X will be,” Rubel said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
