Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
down the most in three weeks, on speculation  Europe ’s fiscal
crisis may ease after polls showed Greek voters supported
politicians in favor of the nation’s bailout.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 dropped four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.30 percent at 11:58 a.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. It was the biggest
decrease on a closing basis since May 3. The price rose 0.27
centimo to 116.65 centimos per sol.  “Markets are more hopeful because of  Greece ,” said Dirk Willer, head of Latin America local markets strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in  New York . “The market isn’t expecting Greece
to be out of the euro before year-end.”  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.6960 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Greece’s New Democracy party, which supports international
bailout agreements, placed first in all six opinion polls
published on May 26 as campaigning continued for the general
election June 17.  Peru’s central bank sold dollars on May 25 for the first
time in seven months, dipping into a record $58 billion of
international reserves as foreign investors sold local currency
on concern the euro zone’s debt crisis is getting worse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
