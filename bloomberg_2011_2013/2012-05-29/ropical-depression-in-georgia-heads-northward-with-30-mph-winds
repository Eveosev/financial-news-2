Tropical Depression Beryl, which
caused rain and power outages after making landfall in North
Florida over the U.S. Memorial Day weekend, is moving slowly
northward from Valdosta,  Georgia , with 30 miles per hour (48
kilometers per hour) winds, the National Hurricane Center said.
The system is expected to move back out over Atlantic waters
later Wednesday and possibly re-form as a tropical storm, the
Miami-based center said today in a 5 a.m. EDT advisory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
