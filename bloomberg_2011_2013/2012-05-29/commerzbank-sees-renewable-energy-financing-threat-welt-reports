Jan-Philipp Gillmann, the  Commerzbank
AG (CBK)  manager in charge of renewable energy financing, said higher
interest rates may threaten projects in Germany and endanger the
countryâ€™s plan to exit nuclear power. He spoke in an interview
with Die Welt.  If feed-in-tariffs remain flat or fall, the yield on
investments in sector projects may reach a level that render
investments unattractive, he is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
