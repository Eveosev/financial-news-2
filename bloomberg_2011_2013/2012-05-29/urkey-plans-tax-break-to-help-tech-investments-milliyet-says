Turkey  is working on a law that would
provide angel investors with tax breaks to help spur Internet
and technology-related projects, Milliyet  reported .  The measure, being debated in the Ankara parliamentâ€™s
budget committee, would absolve early investors from taxes for
five years, Science, Industry and Technology Minister Nihat Ergun told the Istanbul-based newspaper. Investors must own less
than half of the company to qualify for tax breaks, Ergun said,
