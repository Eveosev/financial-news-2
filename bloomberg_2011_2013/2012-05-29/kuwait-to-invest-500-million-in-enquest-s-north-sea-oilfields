Kuwait will invest $500 million in
 EnQuest Plc (ENQ) ’s Alma and Galia oilfields in the U.K.  North Sea  in
exchange for a 35 percent stake in the prospects.  As part of the deal Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration
Co., or Kufpec, will contribute as much as $182 million to past
and future costs, EnQuest said in a statement in  London  today.
EnQuest said the total cost of developing Alma and Galia will be
$1 billion.  “This enhances the economics for us,” EnQuest Chief
Executive Officer Amjad Bseisu said in a telephone interview.
“While selling the stake will reduce our production targets
somewhat, we’re hoping that the additional capital can be used
for other development opportunities or to acquire more producing
assets.”  The deal is the second this month for EnQuest after
increasing interests in the Kildrummy and Cairngorm discoveries
as the company tries to bolster output.  Danny Alexander , a U.K.
government minister, said today’s deal showed that the North Sea
is still attracting investment after the government introduced a
surprise tax increase on crude oil profits in 2011.  In March, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne
guaranteed tax relief for dismantling platforms and promised to
increase tax allowances on marginal fields.  “This is good news for northeast Scotland and the whole of
the U.K.,” Chief Secretary to the Treasury Alexander said.
“The government will continue working with the industry in the
North Sea to get the most of what is a huge national asset.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
