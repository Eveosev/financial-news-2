Liberbank, Ibercaja Banco and Banco
Cajatres said their boards will meet today to decide on a three-
way merger of the former savings banks as the restructuring of
 Spain ’s financial system gathers pace.  The lenders announced the board meetings in separate
filings to Spain’s market regulator today.  The country’s central bank has shepherded lenders into
mergers to help them pool costs as they weather the impact of
real estate slump that is causing loan  defaults  to rise and
credit to shrink. The three banks have combined assets of almost
120 billion euros ($150 billion), according to data published by
Spain’s savings bank association.  Liberbank is the product of a merger of three savings banks
in Spain’s Asturias, Extremadura and Cantabria regions while
Cajatres was formed from combining Caja Inmaculada, Caja Circulo
de Burgos and Caja Badajoz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
