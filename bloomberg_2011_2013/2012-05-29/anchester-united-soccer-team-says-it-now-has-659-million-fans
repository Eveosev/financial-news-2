Manchester United , the record 19-time
English soccer champion, said it now has 659 million fans.  The figures are based on a study carried out on the club's
behalf by Kantar Media. Some 54,000 people were interviewed in
39 countries.  “What this shows is our followers have doubled in five
years,” United’s commercial director Richard Arnold told
reporters in London today. “It’s important to the club, not
only for commercial partnerships. It gives us a road map to
understand exactly what’s going on.”  The team, managed by  Alex Ferguson , finished trophy-less
this year after being eliminated in the group stage of the
Champions League and losing its Premier League crown on the last
day of the season to local rival  Manchester City .  To contact the reporter on this story:
