A juror was dismissed from the
perjury case of former  New York  Yankees pitcher  Roger Clemens 
because of a death in the family, leaving the trial with just
one alternate as it begins a seventh week.  U.S. District Judge  Reggie Walton  in Washington today
excused the juror after noting on May 25 that the woman’s mother
died. Two jurors, a man and a woman, were dismissed earlier in
the trial for sleeping during the proceedings.  “She has to make all the arrangements,” Walton said.
“She’s just unavailable. I have to excuse her. There’s nothing
I can do.”  Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young Award winner, is charged
with one count of obstructing a congressional investigation,
three counts of making false statements and two counts of
perjury stemming from his testimony to a House panel
investigating the use of performance-enhancing drugs including
steroids and human growth hormone.  The ballplayer faces as long as 21 months in prison if
convicted. He denies having used the drugs. The government is
trying to prove he used them and lied about it to Congress.  The case is U.S. v. Clemens, 1:10-cr-00223, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
