Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s trade union in St.
Petersburg,  Russia , will open wage talks with management on May
31 and would consider a strike if no agreement is made, said
union Chairman Evgeny Pavlovsky.  The union wants an inflation adjustment of 6.1 percent on
workers’ salaries and an additional flat increase of 25 percent.
The union wants the average monthly salary for an assembly-line
worker to rise to 41,000 rubles ($1,273) from 31,500, Pavlovsky
said.  Russia’s economy expanded 4.6 percent in the first four
months of this year, while the inflation rate stood at 3.6
percent in April. The company has received the union proposals
and will address them in talks, scheduled to be held through
June 13, Nissan spokeswoman Tatiana Natarova said by phone.  The  St. Petersburg  factory produces X-Trail and Murano and
Teana models for the Russian market. The union was founded at
the beginning of 2010, and now 52 members of the plant’s 2,000
workforce, Pavlovsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
