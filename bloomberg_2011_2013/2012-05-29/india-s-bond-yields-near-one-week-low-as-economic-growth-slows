India ’s benchmark bonds were little
changed, with yields near a one-week low, on speculation slowing
economic growth will prompt the central bank to cut  reserve
requirements  for lenders.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has reduced the amount of funds
banks must set aside as  reserves  by 125 basis points to 4.75
percent in 2012. Asia’s third-largest  economy  probably expanded
6.7 percent in the fiscal year that ended March, compared with
8.4 percent in the previous 12 months, according to the median
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey before a May 31
report. Brent crude oil has dropped 15 percent to $106.97 a
barrel since March.  “The outlook for bonds is positive as the economy is
slowing,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Falling oil prices are also
a good development.”  The yield on the government’s 8.79 percent bonds due
November 2021 was 8.52 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.95 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  India’s central bank next meets to set monetary policy on
June 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
