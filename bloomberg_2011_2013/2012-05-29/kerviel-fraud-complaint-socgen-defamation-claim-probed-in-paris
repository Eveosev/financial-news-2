(Corrects first paragraph to say Kerviel isn’t in jail.)  Paris prosecutors are investigating
 Jerome Kerviel ’s fraud complaint against former employer  Societe
Generale SA (GLE)  as well as the bank’s defamation allegations against
the former trader.  The prosecutor opened a preliminary inquiry into Kerviel’s
complaint that Societe Generale hid a tax credit on the bank’s
4.9 billion-euro ($6.1 billion) trading loss from the court that
convicted Kerviel in 2010, Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a
spokeswoman for the prosecutor, said by phone.  Separately, the prosecutor on May 23 started another
preliminary inquiry into Societe Generale’s defamation
complaint against Kerviel, Thibault-Lecuivre said, without
elaborating.  Kerviel is appealing the court’s decision ordering him to
repay the trading loss and sending him to jail for three years.
The sentence is suspended pending appeal. The Paris appeals
court trial is scheduled to begin June 4.  Kerviel’s lawyer, David Koubbi, declined to comment when
reached by phone.  Societe Generale ’s spokeswoman Nathalie
Boschat, based in Paris, declined to comment. French daily
newspaper Le Monde reported the preliminary investigations
earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
