KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s second-
largest mobile phone operator, sold 443 billion won ($376
million) of bonds backed by phone bills this month as smartphone
demand bolsters sales.  The sale follows the carrier’s first-ever offering of
asset-backed securities, or ABS, worth 510 billion won in April,
Chi Seung Hoon, a director for financing at KT, said in a phone
interview on May 25. The Seongnam, South Korea-based company may
sell more of the notes this year, he said.  The carrier joins South Korea’s two other mobile-phone
carriers in selling ABS to capitalize on an increasing number of
smartphone subscribers who pay the operators for their devices
in monthly installments. SK Telecom Co. and  LG Uplus Corp. (032640)  along
with KT sold a combined 4.8 trillion won of ABS this year, a
fourfold jump from the same period a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  KT had 8.54 million smartphone subscribers as of the end of
the first quarter, compared with 3.84 million a year ago,
according to the company. The influx raised its operating costs
14 percent in the period.  The company sold $350 million of U.S. dollar-denominated
debt in January. It has no plan to sell more global bonds this
year, Chi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
