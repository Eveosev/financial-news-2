Thailand ’s baht dropped toward its
weakest level in four months and government bonds fell as
concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen damped demand for
emerging-market assets.  Global funds sold $525 million more Thai equities than they
bought in May, exchange data show, contributing to the baht’s
2.9 percent slump during the period. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia
Dollar Index traded near this year’s low after the extra yield
investors seek to hold Spain’s 10-year bonds over German notes
soared to the highest level since 1995.  “With growing concern about Europe’s situation, we are
seeing risk-off sentiment again, and investors don’t want to put
money into emerging markets,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher
at the Japan Center for  Economic Research  in Tokyo. “Fund
outflows are weighing on the baht.”  The baht retreated 0.2 percent to 31.67 per dollar as of
3:22 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 31.84 yesterday, the weakest level since
Jan. 17. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52
percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.62
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
