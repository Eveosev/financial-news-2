The alleged victims in former Penn
State coach Jerry Sandusky’s sexual abuse case sought a court
order to shield their identities during his trial, scheduled to
start on June 5.  Lawyers for victims, identified in a grand jury report as
victims 3, 4, 5 and 7, asked state court Judge John M. Cleland
to prevent disclosure of their names in open court and to allow
them to use a pseudonym, according to court papers filed today
in Bellefonte,  Pennsylvania .  “There exists no compelling reason which justifies the
disclosure of Victim #4’s identity which would trump the
compelling need for privacy,” Benjamin Andreozzi, an attorney
for the alleged victim, said in a court filing.  Sandusky, 68, is charged with more than 50 counts tied to
the alleged abuse of boys he met through a charity he founded
for needy children. The case led to the firings of Penn State
President  Graham Spanier  and head football coach  Joe Paterno ,
who died in January. Two other school officials were charged
with perjury in the case.  This month, Sandusky revived a request to have the charges
against him dismissed, citing a lack of specificity and
sufficient evidence. Prosecutors haven’t identified two of the
alleged victims in the case, according to a filing by Sandusky’s
attorney, Joseph Amendola.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Sandusky,
CP-14-2422-2011, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County,
Pennsylvania (Bellefonte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
