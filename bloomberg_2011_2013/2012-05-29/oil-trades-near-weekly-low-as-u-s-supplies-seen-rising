Oil fell for a second day, heading
for the biggest monthly drop in more than three years, before a
report that may show stockpiles climbed to the highest level
since 1990 in the U.S., the world’s biggest crude user.  Futures slid as much as 1 percent. U.S. inventories rose
800,000 barrels to 383.3 million last week, according to the
median estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
before the Energy Department report tomorrow. Prices dropped
yesterday after  Spain ’s credit rating was cut and BNP Paribas SA
reduced its 2012 forecast for West Texas Intermediate oil.  “Demand out of the U.S. and the  euro zone  has been very
soft,”  David Lennox , an analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney, said
in a telephone interview. “For the foreseeable future, barring
any supply-side shocks, oil will stay around $90 a barrel. If
there’s going to be any movement, it’s not likely to be up.”  Crude for July delivery decreased as much as 91 cents to
$89.85 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange and was at $89.98 at 5:17 p.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday slid 10 cents to $90.76, the lowest close
since May 24. Prices are down 14.2 percent this month, the
biggest drop since December 2008.  Brent oil for July settlement fell 77 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $105.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to
West Texas Intermediate was at $15.93, from $15.92 yesterday.  Fuel Supplies  Oil in New York has long-term technical support at $89.83 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the weekly
chart, that’s the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop
to $32.40 in December 2008 from an intraday record high of
$147.27 in July that year. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably fell 250,000 barrels last
week, according to the Bloomberg survey before tomorrow’s Energy
Department report. Distillate supplies, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, will likely remain unchanged at 119.5
million barrels, the survey shows.  The  American Petroleum Institute  will release separate
inventory data today. The API collects stockpile information on
a voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals
and pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed
with the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  U.S.  gasoline  at the pump fell below year-earlier levels
for the sixth straight week, the Energy Department said in a
weekly retail report yesterday. The national average price for
regular gasoline dropped 4.5 cents to $3.669 a gallon from a
week earlier, it said.  Oil Forecast  BNP Paribas cut its 2012 price forecast for New York crude
by $7 to $100 a barrel, and its estimates for Brent by $4 to
$115 a barrel, as Europe’s debt crisis worsened, according to an
e-mailed report. Prices will still advance in the third quarter
because of sanctions against  Iran  and shrinking spare production
capacity in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
the bank said.  Oil fell yesterday as the euro slid toward an almost two-
year low after Egan-Jones Rating Co. cited a deteriorating
economic outlook in Spain for its decision to lower the nation’s
sovereign credit rating to B from BB-. A weaker European
currency increases the cost of crude priced in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
