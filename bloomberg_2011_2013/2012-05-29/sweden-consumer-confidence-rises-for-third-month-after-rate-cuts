Swedish  consumer confidence  improved
for a third month in May after the central bank cut  interest
rates  twice since December to avoid a recession in the largest
Nordic economy.  The  consumer confidence  index rose to 5.9 from 4.7 in
April, the Stockholm-based National  Institute of Economic
Research  said today. Economists predicted a reading of 2.5,
according to the median of 14 forecasts in a Bloomberg  survey . A
 manufacturing confidence  index rose to zero from minus 1.  Sweden’s $500 billion  economy  will probably accelerate amid
rising confidence, the country’s central bank Governor Stefan Ingves said in the minutes of the bank’s latest rate meeting
last month. The Riksbank kept its  benchmark interest rate  at 1.5
percent on signs a pickup in economic growth and predicted no
more cuts in the next year after two reductions since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
