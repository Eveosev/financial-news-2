Crude-oil options volatility was
little-changed as the underlying futures declined after Egan-
Jones Ratings Co. downgraded  Spain ’s credit rating.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.52 percent at 5:05 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 26.53 percent May 25. Floor
trading was closed yesterday for the U.S. Memorial Day holiday.  Crude oil for July delivery slipped 10 cents to settle at
$90.76 a barrel on the Nymex, below $91 for the fourth straight
session. Prices are down 17 percent since their year-to-date
high settlement of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  Futures fell as Spain’s rating was cut to B from Bb-. A
debate in that country about how to fund a recapitalization of
the Bankia group is spurring speculation that the debt crisis
that is battering  Greece  is spreading. Earlier, oil touched a
one-week high as U.S. equities advanced.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $80 puts, which fell 6 cents to 13 cents a barrel at
5:09 p.m. with 3,261 lots trading. July $82 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,687 lots changing hands as
they fell 7 cents to 23 cents.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 56 percent of the 100,448 trades
in the previous session. December $80 puts were the most
actively traded, with 4,301 lots changing hands. They fell 4
cents to $3.31 a barrel. The next-most active options, July $95
calls, rose 2 cents to 76 cents on volume of 3,687.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,295
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 35,944 lots and
December $70 puts with 35,459.  To contact the reporter on this story:
