Lawmakers from Just  Russia  party have
introduced a bill in parliament for an alternative law
regulating protests developed by former Russian Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin’s Civic Initiative Committee, Interfax reported.  Pro-government lawmakers gave preliminary approval to an
increase in the maximum fine for protesters who violate the law
to 500,000 rubles ($16,100) from 2,000 rubles. The opposition
condemned the initiative as an attempt to stifle the
constitutional right to free expression. Just Russia is hoping
the proposed law will become an alternative to the United
Russia’s plan, Interfax said, citing Ilya Ponomarev, a lawmaker
with the party.  Police beat demonstrators in Moscow with batons and
arrested hundreds of them on May 6 and in the following days
during a series of unauthorized gatherings. Activists who
clashed with police before President  Vladimir Putin ’s May 7
inauguration are protesting non-stop in Moscow, using the  Occupy
Wall Street  movement’s tactics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
