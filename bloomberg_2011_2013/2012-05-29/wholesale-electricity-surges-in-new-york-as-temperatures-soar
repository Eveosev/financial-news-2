Wholesale electricity jumped in  New
York  as hot, humid weather from Massachusetts to  North Carolina 
prompted homes and businesses to crank up air conditioners.  Spot power  in  New York City  rose to an average of $339.82 a
megawatt-hour from 7 a.m. through 3 p.m. after soaring as high
as $1,647.56 at 10:55 a.m., according to the New York
Independent System Operator Inc., which manages the state grid.
Electricity traded yesterday for delivery for those peak-demand
hours today was priced at an average of $57.34.  The high in New York today was 88 degrees Fahrenheit (32
Celsius), 13 above normal, while Baltimore reached 96, according
to the  National Weather Service . Humidity in New York may rise
as high as 93 percent later today, said AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “Today’s demand is expected to be up with the heat and
humidity, but power supplies are more than adequate to meet that
demand,” Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison
Inc. in New York, said in an e-mail. A cold front forecast to
move in later today and tomorrow will “bring temperatures back
to normal by the end of the week,” he said.  Most power for a given day is purchased the previous day in
what is known as the day-ahead market. Spot prices can jump when
demand exceeds the amount secured in trading a day earlier.  New York Grid  Hourly prices across the New York state grid rose above
$100 a megawatt-hour after 7 a.m. with the start of the work
day.  Electricity use  on the grid was 27,685 megawatts as of 4:54
p.m., 8.3 percent above yesterday’s  forecast  for that time.  “Temperatures are climbing to highs not experienced since
last August,”  David Flanagan , a spokesman for the New York grid
operator, said in an e-mail. Demand response programs were
activated to encourage large consumers to reduce consumption
during peak hours, he said.  The New York ISO issued a thunderstorm alert to market
participants just before 3 p.m., resulting in transmission
bottlenecks and bolstering prices, said Brendyn Brooks-Stocking,
a Boston-based Northeast power analyst with Genscape Inc., a
real-time data power provider.  Today’s spot-market price gains won’t affect bills for Con
Ed customers immediately because rates are set by contract,
according to Clendenin. The utility has more than 3 million
customers in New York City and Westchester County.  New England Prices  Spot power across  New England  rose to $429 a megawatt-hour
at 3 p.m. after averaging $77.79 for the hour ended 2 p.m.,
based on gains in  Connecticut  and Western  Massachusetts .  The high in Worcester, Massachusetts, may be 79 degrees, 9
above normal. Western Massachusetts power averaged $290.14
megawatt-hour from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., or six times more than the
day-ahead prices for that time, according to data from ISO New
England Inc.  Demand  on the mid-Atlantic grid operated by PJM
Interconnection LLC, which spans 13 states from New Jersey to
North Carolina and as far west as  Illinois , was 131,099 as of
4:30 p.m., 6.6 percent more than the day-ahead forecast.  Prices have traded from lows that were mostly in the $20s
and $30s per megawatt-hour to more than $600 in some of the more
densely populated areas where transmission bottlenecks aren’t
unusual, according to PJM data.  Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) ’s territory in  New Jersey 
averaged $275 a megawatt-hour from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., after
rising to a high today of $451.75. Spot power at the Dominion
Resources Inc. zone in Virginia and North Carolina jumped to
$601.07 at 4:35 p.m. after averaging $213.38 from 1 p.m. to 4
p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
