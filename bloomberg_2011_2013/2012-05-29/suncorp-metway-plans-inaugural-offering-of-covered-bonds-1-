Suncorp-Metway Ltd. (SUN) , Australia’s
sixth-largest mortgage lender, is planning to sell notes due in
four years to five years in its debut offering of covered bonds.  The lender will start marketing the Australian dollar-
denominated securities soon, depending on market conditions,
according to an e-mailed statement today from  RBC Capital
Markets , which is helping to arrange the sale. Barclays Plc,
Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG are also managing the offering,
according to the statement.  Suncorp-Metway may price the securities to yield about 140
basis points more than swap rates, two people with direct
knowledge of the matter said today, asking not to be identified
because the details are private.  It would be the first covered bond sale by an Australian
lender outside the nation’s four biggest, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd. and Westpac
Banking Corp. in the first quarter issued the equivalent of $25
billion of covered bonds, which are mortgage-backed notes that
stay on the seller’s balance sheet. The Australian government
passed laws in October allowing the nation’s banks to issue of
the securities.  Fitch Ratings  expects to rate Suncorp-Metway’s notes AAA,
according to an e-mailed statement on May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
