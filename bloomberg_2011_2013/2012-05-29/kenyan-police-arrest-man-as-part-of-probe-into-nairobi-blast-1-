Kenyan police arrested a man in
connection with an explosion at a shopping center in Nairobi
that injured 33 people, spokesman  Eric Kiraithe  said.  “One person was arrested a few meters from the scene and
he is under interrogation this morning,” Kiraithe said by phone
from the city today. “Members of the public saw him running
from the scene and he could have been either looting, doing some
kind of other criminal activity or in shock.”  The blast yesterday at the one-story shopping complex in
the capital’s city center may have been caused by a home-made
bomb, according to initial investigations by police. Prime
Minister  Raila Odinga  vowed to pursue any “terrorists”
targeting the East African nation.  The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militia has threatened to
carry out attacks in  Kenya  after the country deployed its army
in neighboring southern Somalia in mid-October to fight the
group. Al-Shabaab has waged a campaign since 2007 to oust
Somalia’s United Nations-backed transitional government.  The incursion into Somalia was followed by a string of bomb
attacks in Nairobi which have killed at least eight people, and
others in the port city of Mombasa and towns near Kenya’s
northeastern border with Somalia.  Officials from the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  are
assisting Kenyan police in the criminal probe, John Haynes, a
spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, said by phone today.  Kenya’s shilling fell 0.6 percent to 85.95 per dollar at
4:23 p.m. in Nairobi, heading for a four-month low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
