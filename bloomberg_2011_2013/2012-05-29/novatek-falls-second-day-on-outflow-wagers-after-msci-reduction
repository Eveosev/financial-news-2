OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest
natural gas producer, fell for a second day on bets investors
tracking  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s Russia 10/40 Index will sell the stock
after the company’s weighting in the gauge was cut.  The shares retreated 1.1 percent to 298.15 rubles by the
close in Moscow, the most since May 23. The benchmark Micex
Index rose 2.8 percent to 1,327.08.  “The immediate cause is the anticipation of about $600
million of outflows that will be generated by the halving of its
weighting in MSCI Russia,” Julian Rimmer, a trader at CF Global
Trading UK Ltd. in  London , said by e-mail.  Novatek’s weighting dropped to 4.5 percent from more than 9
percent, Troika Dialog said yesterday, citing MSCI data. The
amended index weight comes into effect May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
