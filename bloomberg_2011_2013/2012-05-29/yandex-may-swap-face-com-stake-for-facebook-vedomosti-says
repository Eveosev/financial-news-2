Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russiaâ€™s most-used search
engine, may swap its 18.4 percent stake in the Face.com Internet
service for a stake in  Facebook Inc. (FB) ,  Vedomosti  reported today,
citing unidentified people familiar with the talks.  Alternatively, Yandex may just sell the stake for cash,
the newspaper said.  Face.com develops face-recognition technology that allows 
users to search for photographs on the Internet.   To contact the reporter on this story:
