A John Constable painting owned by
the widow of the Dutch-born industrialist and Old Master
collector Baron Hans Thyssen-Bornemisza may sell for as much as
25 million pounds ($39.2 million) at an auction.  Constable’s 1824 landscape “The Lock,” showing a figure
struggling to open a canal gate, was one of six large-scale
canvases of the River Stour that the artist exhibited to acclaim
at the London  Royal Academy  between 1819 and 1825.  The work was bought by Baron Thyssen at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in 1990
for 10.8 million pounds, then a record for any British painting
sold at auction. It is being re-offered by Christie’s
International in its July 3 sale of Old Master pictures with a
low estimate of 20 million pounds, the London-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Baron Thyssen was the heir to a fortune built from his
Austro-Hungarian family’s business interests that included
steel, armaments and naval construction. Carmen Cervera, a
former Miss Spain, became his fifth wife in 1985.  The Baron’s collection of more than 1,600 Old Master and
modern paintings is housed in a museum in  Madrid  that first
opened to the public in 1992. He died in  Spain  in April 2002 at
the age of 81. “The Lock” has been entered for sale from the
private collection of Baroness Thyssen, Christie’s said.  The auction record for “The Lock” was set at a time when
paintings by revered 19th-century British artists such as
Constable and J.M.W. Turner were more popular with international
collectors.  The price remains the highest paid for a Constable work at
auction. In 1990, no work by  Mark Rothko  or  Andy Warhol  had sold
for more than $5 million at a public sale. Since then, changing
tastes among the world’s wealthiest art buyers have pushed the
records for Rothko and Warhol to $86.9 million and $71.7 million
respectively.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
