Libya ’s parliamentary elections may
be delayed for a “few days” beyond their scheduled June 19
deadline, said Tahir Graf, one of the country’s 13 election
commissioners.  The elections, billed as the first free national elections
in at least four decades, will see a national parliament elected
with the task of appointing a commission to draft Libya’s
constitution.  While the National Transitional Council, Libya’s interim
rulers, had said the elections must be held by June 19, the
“date can slip by a few days,” Graf said in an interview in
Tripoli. He said some potential candidates were appealing
against their disqualification while others needed more time to
campaign.  Of the 200 seats in the assembly, 120 have been set aside
for individual candidates while the rest are earmarked for party
lists. Roughly half of the seats set aside for parties are
supposed to be occupied by women.  Graf said that 2.75 million of the 3.5 million eligible
voters have registered to cast their ballot. About 45 percent of
registered voters were women.  To contact the reporter on this story:
