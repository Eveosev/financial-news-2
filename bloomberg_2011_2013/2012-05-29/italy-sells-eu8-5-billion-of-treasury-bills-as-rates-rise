Italy  sold 8.5 billion euros ($10.7
billion) of Treasury bills, meeting its target as rates rose
from the previous auction amid concern that  Greece  may leave the
euro region.  The Rome-based Treasury sold the 183-day bills at 2.104
percent, up from 1.772 percent at the last sale of similar-
maturity debt on April 26. Investors bid for 1.61 times the
amount offered, down from 1.71 times last month.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond was 5.704 percent at
11:08 a.m. in Rome, pushing the difference with German bunds to
434 basis points. A bigger test for the Italian treasury comes
tomorrow when Italy sell as much as 6.25 billion euros of
longer-maturity debt.  Europe ’s debt crisis intensified this month after Greek
elections pushed a political party opposed to the nation’s
international bailout into second place, raising the specter of
Greece leaving the 17-nation euro region. Greece will hold a
second round of elections on June 17.  While European leaders at a summit last week remained
divided on how to stop contagion from the debt crisis,  Spain  is
also adding to concerns. The country, which nationalized its
third-largest lender this month, is trying to shore up its
banking system and its cash-strapped regions even as its own 10-
year bond yields approach the 7 percent level that prompted
Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
