The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell 1.5 basis points to 315 at
8 a.m. in London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions
of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 10 basis
points to 690.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was down two at 167.75 basis points.
The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25
banks and insurers declined four basis points to 290 and the
subordinated gauge was 5.5 lower at 484.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
