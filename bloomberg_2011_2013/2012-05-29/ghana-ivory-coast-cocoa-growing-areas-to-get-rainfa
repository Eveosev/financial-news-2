Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , the worldâ€™s
largest cocoa producers, will get rains over the next seven
days, potentially helping pod development, according to the U.S.
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  Most areas in the top growers will get at least 40
millimeters to 50 millimeters (1.6 to 2 inches) of rain through
June 5, data on the NOAA website show. Large parts of Ivory
Coast and the coastal areas of Ghana will get as much as 75
millimeters, according to the data. Rainfall may reach 100
millimeters in some areas.  Ghana and Ivory Coast accounted for 69 percent of total
global cocoa production last season, according to the London-
based  International Cocoa Organization . The smaller of two
annual harvests in Ivory Coast, known as the mid-crop, has
started, the ICCO said.  Rainfall may help pod-development for this season and the
next after dry weather delayed the start of the mid-crop
harvesting, which usually begins in April, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. Cocoa gained 0.3 percent to 1,481 pounds
($2,325) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
