A program to distribute  Research in
Motion Ltd. ’s BlackBerrys and other mobile devices to U.K.
police to boost efficiency produced costs more than 100 times
the savings it achieved, a panel of lawmakers said.  The U.K. government gave police forces 71 million pounds
($111 million) between 2008 and 2010 to buy more than 41,000
devices to let officers spend more time on the beat and cut down
paperwork, the  House of Commons Public Accounts Committee  said
in a report published in London today. The move, intended to
produce 125 million pounds worth of savings, has so far
“managed a woeful 600,000 pounds,” the lawmakers said.  “Although some forces have used the devices to improve
efficiency, most have not,”  Margaret Hodge , the opposition
Labour Party lawmaker who heads the panel, said in an e-mailed
statement. “And although most forces reported that the devices
allowed officers to spend more time out of the station, some
said that using the devices actually led officers to spend more
time in the station.”  The committee said reductions in funding for policing as
part of government efforts to narrow the  budget deficit 
meant the use of technology to make savings is essential. About
1.5 billion pounds -- 10 percent of all the money spent on
policing -- goes each year on  information technology , according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
