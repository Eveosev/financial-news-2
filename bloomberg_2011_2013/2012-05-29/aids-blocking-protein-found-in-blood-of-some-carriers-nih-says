A protein that suppresses the AIDS
virus has been identified in the blood of some infected people,
opening a new door for developing drugs and vaccines against the
disease.  The protein, called CXCL4, prevents HIV from attaching to
or entering healthy human cells, the U.S. National Institutes of
Health said in an e-mailed statement today. It was identified by
scientists led by Paolo Lusso at the National Institute of
Allergy and  Infectious Diseases .  To contact the reporter on this story:
