Facebook Inc. (FB)   shares  fell to a new
low, extending losses from the worst-performing large initial
public offering during the past decade to more than 24 percent.  The stock fell 9.6 percent to $28.84 in New York, below the
prior low of $30.94 on May 22. Facebook debuted on May 18 after
underwriters sold shares at $38. Facebook  options  trading began
today, with volume for puts exceeding calls by 1.2-to-1, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. More than 200,000 puts giving the
right to sell traded.  About $25 billion in market value has been erased from
Facebook as bearish sentiment built in stock and options markets
after the social networking site went public while U.S. equities
headed for the biggest monthly decline since September. The
company, its underwriters and  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  were sued
last week by investors who say they lost money in the IPO. June
$30 puts were the  most-active  contracts, with volume at 23,723.
They were followed by June $34 calls and June $32 calls.  “People are disillusioned,”  Matt McCormick , who helps
oversee $6.2 billion at Bahl & Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, said
in a telephone interview. He doesn’t own shares of Facebook. “A
lot of investors believed the hype,” he said. “In this type of
volatile market environment, people are not going to take
chances.”  Facebook shares climbed as high as $45 on May 18, when the
shares ended the day with a price-earnings ratio of 83.1, making
the  Menlo Park , California-based company more expensive than 99
percent of Standard & Poor’s 500 Index stocks.  MF Global  The IPO, which set a record for technology companies by
raising more than $16 billion, produced the worst five-day
return among the 10 largest U.S. deals of the past decade. The
13 percent loss through May 24 exceeded the 10 percent drop by
MF Global Holdings Inc. in its first five sessions.  The stock plunge has also pushed the purchase price for
photo-sharing site Instagram Inc. below the $1 billion that
Facebook offered last month. Facebook is paying $300 million in
cash plus about 23 million shares of common stock to acquire
Instagram. The deal is now valued at about $963 million.  Facebook and Morgan Stanley, its lead underwriter, faced
criticism for boosting the number of shares sold in the IPO by
25 percent to 421.2 million in the days before the deal. They
also increased the asking price to $34 to $38 from $28 to $35.  The first day of trading was disrupted by the “poor
design” of Nasdaq OMX’s software for IPO auctions,  Robert Greifeld , the chief executive officer of the exchange operator,
said on May 20. The malfunction also prevented Nasdaq OMX from
sending messages to brokerages confirming that clients’ orders
went through.  “Investors are incorporating the risks embedded in the
stock,”  Brian Wieser , a senior analyst at New York-based
Pivotal Research Group LLC, said in a telephone interview today.
He has a sell rating on the stock and a $30 share-price
estimate. “A lot of people are trying to trade the stock on the
basis of those expectations. Options will be a very robust
marketplace with respect to Facebook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
