OAO Bashneft, the regional oil
producer controlled by Russian billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK Sistema, fell the most in a week after posting
first-quarter revenue that missed analyst estimates.  Bashneft declined 0.9 percent to 1,610.10 rubles by the
close in Moscow, the biggest one-day drop since May 23. The
Micex Index rose 2.8 percent to 1,327.08 rubles.  Sales in the first quarter  rose  13 percent to $3.92 billion
from a year earlier, according to an e-mailed company statement.
Nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected an average
revenue of $4.27 billion.  “The revenue came below expectations,” Slava Bunkov, an
analyst at Aton LLC in Moscow, said by phone. “Bashneft focused
its sales on the domestic market and lost because the  oil prices 
were lower than if they had focused on their exports.”  International  sales  made up 57 percent of Bashneft’s
revenues in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
First-quarter oil production climbed 4 percent to 3.84 million
tons.  Net income beat estimates, rising 20 percent to $444
million from a year earlier, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
