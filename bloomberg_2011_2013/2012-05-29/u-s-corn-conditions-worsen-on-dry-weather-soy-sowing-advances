The condition of the U.S. corn crop
deteriorated last week after warm, dry weather increased stress
on plants in parts of the Midwest and South. Spring-wheat
ratings rose, and soybean planting moved closer to completion.  About 72 percent of the corn crop was in good or excellent
 condition  as of May 27, down from 77 percent a week earlier,
while up from 63 percent from a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . An estimated
92 percent of the seeds  emerged  from the ground, up from 76
percent a week earlier and the average in the previous five
years of 69 percent.  “Everyone is worried about the hot, dry weather pattern in
May continuing into June,” Emerson Nafziger, an agronomist at
the  University of Illinois  in Urbana, said in a telephone
interview. “I doubt we have compromised our yield potential at
this time with timely rain next month.”  The report was issued after the close of trading on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. Corn futures for July delivery fell 2.8
percent to settle at $5.625 a bushel. The most-active contract
has fallen 11 percent this month on speculation that farmers
will harvest a record crop this year.  Production will jump 20 percent to 14.79 billion bushels as
farmers plant the most acres since 1937 and yields expand to a
record 166 bushels per acre, the USDA said on May 10.  Based on today’s report, yields may average 165.1 bushels
this year, down from 169 bushels a week earlier, according to
 David Salmon , the owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton,
 Missouri .  Soybeans, Wheat  About 89 percent of the  soybean  crop was planted, compared
with 76 percent a week earlier and the five-year average of 61
percent, the USDA said. Plant  emergence  rose to 61 percent from
35 percent a week earlier and 22 percent a year earlier.  The spring-wheat  crop  rated good or excellent as of May 27
rose to 79 percent from 74 percent a week earlier.  The winter-wheat crop was  rated  54 percent good or
excellent as of May 27, compared with 58 percent a week earlier
after dry, hot weather stunted plant growth from  Texas  to  Ohio ,
the USDA said. A year earlier, 33 percent got the top ranking.  An estimated 57 percent of the  cotton  crop was in good or
excellent condition, the government said in its first assessment
of this year’s crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
