China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, said it will see a
larger revenue contribution from its third-generation network
than from 2G subscribers for the first time this year.  Sales from users of the company’s 2G network may post a
small drop this year from the 70.6 billion  yuan  ($11 billion)
recorded last year as more subscribers shift to the high-speed
3G service, President Lu Yimin told reporters at a briefing in
Hong Kong today after the company’s annual shareholders meeting.
The 3G unit contributed 32 percent of mobile revenue last year,
with the rest coming from 2G users, the company said in March.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chang Xiaobing has
lured users to Unicom’s third-generation wireless network with
smartphones from domestic suppliers including  ZTE Corp. (000063)  priced
at less than 1,000 yuan ($158). The low-cost handsets helped
Unicom’s subscriber base expand 20 percent from a year earlier
in each of the first four months of 2012, even after the
Beijing-based company lost the advantage of being the nation’s
only carrier to offer  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone with a service plan.  “We are not as focused on the number of new users, we want
to make sure we are adding good quality customers,” Lu said.  Unicom’s 3G business will be profitable this year, Chang
said at today’s briefing, reiterating an outlook given in March.
He didn’t provide details.  Unicom’s 3G subscribers totaled 51.8 million at the end of
April, trailing  China Mobile Ltd. (941) ’s 61.9 million, according to
data the companies released this month. Unicom’s total mobile
customer base of 212.8 million was less than half the 672.5
million at China Mobile.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
