Empresas Copec SA (COPEC) , Chile’s largest
wood pulp exporter, said prices of the material began to recover
in the first quarter due to increased demand from  Asia .  Hardwood pulp prices gained 9 percent in the first three
months of this year in Asia, Copec said today in a statement
accompanying first-quarter earnings. Hardwood pulp rose 12
percent in Europe and 8 percent in the U.S., the company said.
Softwood pulp rose by a smaller margin, it said.  Copec’s forestry unit is spending $2 billion to expand in
southern Chile, Brazil and Uruguay as it bets global demand for
paper and wooden boards will rise. The company, based in
Santiago, partnered Brazil’s  Klabin SA (KLBN4)  to buy timberland worth
$473.5 million in southern  Brazil  last year and is building a
plant in Uruguay with Finland’s Stora Enso Oyj.  Copec’s first-quarter profit fell 48 percent to $154
million from $295 million a year ago, according to data on the
Chilean securities regulator’s website. Net income slid as
revenue from the company’s fish, forestry and fuel distribution
units declined compared with the same quarter last year. Timber
prices to Asia fell in the first quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
