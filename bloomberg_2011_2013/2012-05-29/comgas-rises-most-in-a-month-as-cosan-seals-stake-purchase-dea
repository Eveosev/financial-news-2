Cia. de Gas  de Sao Paulo, a Brazilian
natural gas distributor, rose after  Cosan SA Industria e
Comercio  finalized its bid for  BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s 60.1 percent stake
in the company.  Shares of Comgas, as the distributor is known, gained 1.1
percent to 38 reais at the close in Sao Paulo. Cosan fell 0.6
percent to 29.43 reais. The benchmark Bovespa index dropped 1
percent.  Cosan, a renewable energy and infrastructure company, is
paying 3.4 billion reais ($1.7 billion) for the stake in the
company, according to a regulatory filing. The deal was
announced earlier this month.  “Because Cosan doesn’t have experience in this business,
the acquisition should not change Comgas’s strategies or
operations,” Rodrigo Fernandes, an analyst at Fator Corretora,
said by phone from Sao Paulo. “For Cosan, it is a good deal
even though this business is different from its others because
Comgas is a company that acts in a regulated market, has good
cash generation and pays good dividends.”  Comgas fell 6.9 percent this year through yesterday, while
Cosan gained 9.7 percent. The Bovespa slid 2.7 percent in that
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
