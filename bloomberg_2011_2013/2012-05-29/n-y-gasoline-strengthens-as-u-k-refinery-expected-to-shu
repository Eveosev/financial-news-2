New York  gasoline strengthened on
speculation that Petroplus Holdings AG will shut its 175,000-
barrel-a-day Coryton refinery in the U.K., reducing production
capacity in the Atlantic Basin.  Crude supplies will run out at the plant in the week of
June 4, Steven Pearson, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
Petroplus Holdings AG’s U.K. administrator, said yesterday.
Europe exported 533,000 barrels a day of gasoline to the U.S.
East Coast in the week ended May 18, according to the Energy
Department.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in New York Harbor narrowed 1.75 cents to a discount of 7.5
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 3:18 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery gained 3.11 cents to $2.8315 a gallon.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline at the hub
held at 1.5 cents a gallon. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel gained 0.75
cent to a premium of 6.88 cents versus Nymex heating oil
futures.  Petroplus, once  Europe ’s biggest independent refiner, filed
for insolvency earlier this year.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  in Europe increased for a third day
to $11.70 a barrel, data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. showed.
