Gasoline rose on the possibility that
Petroplus Holdings AG will shut its 175,000-barrel-a-day Coryton
oil refinery in the U.K., reducing European exports to the U.S.  Futures gained after Steven Pearson, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Petroplus’s U.K. administrator, said
by phone today from the site in southeast  England  that crude
supply at the plant will run out sometime next week. Coryton
would be the sixth European refinery to stop production since
the start of 2011.  “You’re seeing the effect of the Coryton refinery shutting
down,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston. “That would require the U.K. to import additional
supplies of gasoline and there would be less for exporting.”  Gasoline for June delivery increased 3.37 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.9266 a gallon at 9:28 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the third consecutive increase. The price
has dropped 8.4 percent in May.  U.S. gasoline imports fell 15 percent to an average 575,000
barrels a day in the week ended May 18, according to Energy
Department data.  Coryton was one of five refineries in  Europe  operated by
Petroplus until the Swiss refiner filed for insolvency in
January. Its plants in  Germany ,  France , Belgium and Switzerland
were halted and two have subsequently been sold.  June-delivery heating oil rose 1.49 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $2.8437 a gallon. Prices have fallen 11 percent in May.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,  fell  0.5
cent to $3.636 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest level since Feb. 22. Gasoline is down 7.6 percent since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
