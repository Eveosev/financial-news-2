Romgaz SA, Romania’s state-owned
natural gas producer, said its net income rose last year to
about 1 billion lei ($280 million) on higher sales,  Ziarul
Financiar  reported, citing a company statement.  Romgaz’s total sales increased to 4.05 billion lei from a
year earlier and the company plans to distribute most of last
year’s profit to its shareholders, which include the Romanian
Economy Ministry and  Fondul Proprietatea SA (FP) , the Bucharest-based
newspaper said.  Romania’s government plans to sell a 15 percent stake in
Romgaz this year on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The company
supplies about half the gas produced in the country, while the
other half comes from  OMV Petrom SA. (SNP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
