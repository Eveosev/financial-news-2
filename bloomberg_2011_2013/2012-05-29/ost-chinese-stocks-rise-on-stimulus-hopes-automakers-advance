China’s stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to a two-week high, on speculation the
government will take more steps to halt slowing economic growth.  Great Wall Motor Co. (601633)  advanced 6.4 percent as it was named
among auto companies by BNP Paribas SA that may benefit from
government subsidies.  Hisense Electric Co. (600060)  climbed to a one-
month high after the Ministry of Finance said the nation will
subsidize the use of energy-saving products.  China  Vanke Co.,
the country’s largest publicly traded developer, rose 1.1
percent as China International Capital Corp. said the central
bank may cut lending rates as early as next month.  “There are expectations China will introduce more stimulus
to boost the economy,” said Mao Sheng, an analyst for Huaxi
Securities Co. in Chengdu. “There’s optimism the economy will
recover in the second half.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1.2 percent to 2,389.64
at the close, its highest since May 11. Thirty-day  volatility  in
the gauge was at 15.12 today, the highest in more than a week.
The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 1.4 percent to 2,650.85.  Today’s gain trimmed the Shanghai Composite’s loss this
month to 0.3 percent. The index has climbed 8.6 percent this
year on optimism the government will ease monetary policies and
accelerate approvals of infrastructure projects to spur growth.  The Chinese government’s stimulus in response to the
nation’s economic slowdown will probably range from 1 trillion
yuan ($157.6 billion) to 2 trillion yuan, half the size of
2008’s package, Credit Suisse Group AG said yesterday. China has
no intention to introduce a large-scale stimulus like it did
during the global financial crisis in response to this year’s
slowdown, the official Xinhua News Agency said today.  Auto Subsidies  Great Wall Motor, China’s biggest pickup truck maker,
advanced 6.3 percent to 17.37  yuan  after BNP named it as among
possible beneficiaries from Chinese auto subsidies.  SAIC Motor Corp., the nation’s largest automaker, gained
0.7 percent to 15.65 yuan.  Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. (000625) , the
Chinese partner of Ford Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp., climbed
1.9 percent to 5.48 yuan.  China’s cabinet agreed to revive financial incentives for
consumers to trade in their passenger cars to help increase
demand in the world’s biggest vehicle market, a government
official said yesterday. The State Council approved a cash-for-
clunkers plan last week and relevant ministries are working on
details, said the official, who asked not to be identified
because the matter hasn’t been made public.  Hisense, China’s biggest manufacturer of flat-panel
televisions, surged 5.9 percent to 18.88 yuan, its highest close
since April 20.  Qingdao Haier Co. (600690) , the nation’s largest
refrigerator maker, climbed 2.6 percent to 12.19 yuan. Hefei
Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co., a manufacturer of washing
machines, gained 2 percent to 9.24 yuan.  Boosting Consumption  The promotion of energy efficient flat-panel televisions
and energy-saving air conditioning is projected to stimulate
consumption of more than 135 billion yuan, the Ministry of
Finance said in a statement yesterday.  Stocks in the Shanghai Composite are valued at 10.3 times
estimated earnings, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on
Jan. 6, according to  weekly data  compiled by Bloomberg. About
9.5 billion shares changed hands in the measure yesterday, 20
percent higher than the daily average this year. The MSCI BRIC
Index, which tracks stocks in  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and China,
is valued at 8.2 times estimated profit.  Vanke added 1.1 percent to 9.27 yuan on optimism lower
lending rates will boost property demand. China Merchants
Property Development Co., the third-biggest developer by market
value, advanced 1.8 percent to 25.44 yuan.  Hangzhou Binjiang
Real Estate Group Co. (002244)  gained 3.5 percent to 9.76 yuan.  European Concern  The People’s Bank of China may reduce the lending rate as
soon as June, Xu Xiaoqing, Liu Mingxi and Chen Jianheng,
analysts at CICC, wrote in a report yesterday. A deposit rate
cut may follow in the second half of the year on easing
inflation, it said.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.3 percent today as
expectations about China’s stimulus plans tempered concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen. In Europe, at least 25 percent
of leveraged buyout companies with debt due by the end of 2015
may default as the economy worsens, Moody’s Investors Service
said.  Spain  is trying to shore up its banks and help cash-
strapped regions while its own borrowing costs compared with
Germany’s are the highest since the creation of the euro. As
Spain’s narrowing market access depends on domestic lenders
financed by the  European Central Bank , the government is
considering using public-debt securities rather than cash to
fund a 19 billion-euro ($24 billion) bailout of BFA-Bankia.  Dalian Port (PDA) Co. (601880)  dropped 1.8 percent to 3.25 yuan and
 Rizhao Port Co. (600017)  lost 1.3 percent to 3.15 yuan amid speculation
trade flows to Europe may slow. The region is China’s biggest
export market, accounting for about 18 percent of the nation’s
overseas shipments, according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
