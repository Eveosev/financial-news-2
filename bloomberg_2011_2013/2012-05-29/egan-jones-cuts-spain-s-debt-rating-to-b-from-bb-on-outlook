Spain ’s sovereign credit rating was
cut by Egan-Jones Ratings Co. to B from BB- on the country’s
deteriorating economic outlook.  The nation’s 9.6 percent budget deficit, 24 percent jobless
rate and bank losses of as much as 260 billion euros ($324
billion) weigh on the economy, the ratings company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “Spain will inevitably be faced with payments to support a
portion of its banking sector and for its weaker provinces,”
the Haverford, Pennsylvania-based company said. “Assets of
Spain’s largest two banks exceed its GDP. We are slipping our
rating to ‘B’; watch for more requests for support from the
banks and money creation.”  Spain is trying to bolster its banks and help cash-strapped
regions at a time of surging borrowing costs. The yield
difference between Spanish and German 10-year bonds increased
yesterday to the highest since the creation of the euro. As
Spain’s market access narrows, it depends increasingly on
domestic lenders, which in turn are getting cash from the
 European Central Bank , to buy its debt.  Foreign investors cut their holdings of Spanish debt to 37
percent of the total in circulation in April from 50 percent at
the end of last year. Domestic lenders, bolstered by emergency
funding from the ECB, have picked up the slack, increasing their
share to 29 percent from 17 percent over the same period. At a
 bond auction  on May 17, foreigners took 20 percent to 30 percent
of the issue, a government official, who declined to be named,
told reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
