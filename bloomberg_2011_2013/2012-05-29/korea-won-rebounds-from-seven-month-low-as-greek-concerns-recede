South Korea ’s won rebounded from a
seven-month low as concern eased that Greece will exit the euro.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  Greek opinion polls showed stronger backing for parties
that support the European Union’s bailout agreement. Greece’s
New Democracy placed first in all six opinion polls published on
May 26 as campaigning continued for the general election on June
17. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose to a two-week high as overseas
investors  bought  more of the nation’s stocks than they sold
today for the first time this month. South Korean financial
markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  The won strengthened 0.9 percent from May 25 to 1,174.82
per dollar at today’s close in Seoul, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency fell 1.1 percent last week and
touched 1,185.53 on May 25, the weakest level since Oct. 6.  “Concerns surrounding  Greece  eased with opinion poll
results released, and South Korean exporters were selling the
dollar to convert income as the end of the month nears,” said
Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based currency trader at Hana Bank.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slid ten basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 11.48 percent.  South Korean manufacturers’ confidence for June fell to 86
from a nine-month high of 90 in May, the  Bank of Korea  said in a
statement today.  Franklin Templeton Investments, the biggest overseas owner
of South Korean bonds, remains “positive” on the country,
betting the manufacturing industry will hold up as the currency
weakens, Kim Dong Il, chief investment officer for fixed income
at its  Seoul  unit, said in an interview on May 24.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 was steady at 3.36 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. Three-year debt futures dropped 0.03 to 104.52 and the
one-year interest-rate swap rose two basis points to 3.37
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
