China  is expected to become the
world’s largest retail e-commerce market in 2013, Xinhua News
Agency reported today, citing a forecast by a Ministry of
Commerce official.  Chinese online shoppers spent 782.6 billion ($123 billion)
 yuan  online last year, a gain of almost 54 percent from a year
earlier, Xinhua said, quoting figures from Li Jinqi, director of
the ministry’s information technology department.  There were 194 million online shoppers recorded in China at
the end of last year, and the country’s total “e-business”

trillion yuan, according to Xinhua.  To contact the reporter on this story:
