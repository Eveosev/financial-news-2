Canadian natural gas fell on
forecasts that the northern U.S. will have cooler-than-normal
weather, cutting air-conditioner use in the biggest consuming
region for the nation’s gas exports.  June gas in  Alberta  slid 6.6 percent. Cooling demand in the
U.S. Midwest will trail normal by 28 percent through June 5,
according to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives. Chicago
may have a high May 31 of 61 degrees Fahrenheit (16 Celsius), 14
lower than normal, AccuWeather Inc. said.  “The forecasts have shifted to cooler,” said  Martin King ,
an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp., in Calgary. “There’s
a sense of caution now about coal-to-gas switching and how that
might have been jeopardized by the recent price runs.”  Alberta gas for June delivery dropped 13.75 cents to
C$1.945 a gigajoule ($1.81 per million British thermal units) as
of 2:50 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian internet market.
Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system. NGX gas
has declined 32 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange declined 14.2 cents, or 5.4 percent, to settle at
$2.485 per million Btu. The June contract, which expired at the
close of trading today, fell 13.9 cents to $2.429.  Pipeline Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.5 billion cubic
feet, 303 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.09 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.03 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1.11 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.51 billion cubic feet today, or 58 percent
of its capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.73
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
