Polyplex Corp Ltd. (PPC) , an Indian
manufacturer of polyester film, will build a $150 million
plastics plant in Turkey and plans another investment of $500
million within five to eight years to produce resin raw
material.  The factory to make polyethylene terephthalate, used to
make bottles, will have a capacity of 600,000 metric tons a year
and export about $1 billion a year, Kapil Gupta, senior vice
president for the company said at a news conference in Istanbul
today.  “Our PET resin production plant will start operations
within two to three years,” Gupta said. The raw material for
the resin will be purchased from local suppliers such as  Petkim
Petrokimya Holding AS (PETKM) , he said.  Polyplex will start the construction of the plant in the
Corlu tax-free zone, to the west of Istanbul, in the second half
of this year, the company and  Turkey ’s  Investment Support &
Promotion Agency  said in a press release given out at the news
conference.  Polyplex is considering a joint venture with a Turkish or
international partner for the additional investment at the site,
Gupta said.  “We are focusing first on PET resin investment and then
will consider a resin raw material plant in 5 to 8 years with a
partner,” he said.  Ilker Ayci, head of the investment agency, said Polyplex
investment will help Turkey increase its foreign direct
investment this year from 2011’s $16 billion.  “We may even break the 2007 record of $22 billion this
year or next,” Ayci said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
