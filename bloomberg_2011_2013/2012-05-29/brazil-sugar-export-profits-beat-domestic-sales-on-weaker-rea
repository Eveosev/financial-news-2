Sugar exports from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, remained more profitable than domestic
sales after the country’s currency weakened, according to
researcher Cepea.  Exports were 2.3 percent more profitable than sales in the
local market last week, Heloisa Lee Burnquist, an analyst at the
University of Sao Paulo group, said in a report yesterday.
Brazil’s real on May 23 touched 2.1062 to the dollar, the
weakest level since May 2009. The currency is down 6 percent
this year.  “The international market is still more advantageous
compared to the domestic because of the sharp dollar valuation
against real,” Burnquist said. Declines by the real increase
the value of exporters’ foreign sales on conversion to the
Brazilian currency.  A weaker real has compensated for lower sugar prices on the
international market this month, according to the report. Raw
sugar for July delivery was down 6.3 percent in May at 19.78
cents a pound by 5:13 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Domestic sugar sales last week were 24 percent more
profitable than selling anhydrous ethanol, the kind blended into
gasoline, and 42 percent more advantageous than hydrous ethanol,
the type used in so-called flex-fuel cars, according to Cepea.  Both the sweetener and the biofuel are made from sugar cane
in Brazil. About 46 percent of the country’s cars were so-called
flex-fuel vehicles able to burn either gasoline or ethanol as of
last year, Sucden Geneva SA analyst Claudiu Covrig said by e-
mail on May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
