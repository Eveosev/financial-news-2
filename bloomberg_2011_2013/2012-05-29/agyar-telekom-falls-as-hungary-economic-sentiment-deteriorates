Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , fell the first time in three days
as  Hungary ’s economic sentiment index slid the most since 2008.  The shares fell 1.2 percent to 431 forint by 1:13 p.m. in
Budapest. The sentiment index dropped to minus 24.9 from minus
19.3 in April as business and consumer moods turned “deeply
pessimistic,” the GKI research institute in Budapest said today
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
