The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 2:09 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  rose 1.3 percent to 14,629.61, while the
 Colcap Index (COLCAP)  increased 0.8 percent to 1,714.71.  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  , the country’s biggest
cement maker, fell 0.7 percent to 11,520 pesos. Colombia’s
gray-cement production retreated 0.1 percent in April from a
year ago, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday by the
national statistics agency.  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB)  , a Colombian lender, slumped 3.8
percent to 500 pesos on takeover delay concern. “Investors are
seeing that the sale could take more time than they expected and
may be losing interest in speculating,” said Felipe Toro, an
analyst at Interbolsa SA. Helm Corp., the holding company that
controls Bogota-based Helm Bank, said April 17 that it would
open an information center for companies looking to acquire a
stake in the lender.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , which operates
Colombia’s largest oil field, gained 1.5 percent to 49,220
pesos. It rallied after agreeing to purchase 85.7 million units
of  CGX Energy Inc. (OYL)  to increase its stake in the oil explorer in
Guyana to 35 percent. “This is a good deal for Rubiales,” said
 Rupert Stebbings , Colombia managing director at Celfin Capital,
in an e-mail. “It is a solid portfolio move and another
investment outside of their Colombian base with money they have
at their disposal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
