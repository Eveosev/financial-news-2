Slovenia’s main political parties
agreed that referendum results should only be recognized if more
than 35 percent of voters turned out, Finance  reported , citing
Prime Minister  Janez Jansa .  Previously no turnout figure was set. Slovenian voters last
year rejected pension changes in a referendum that marked the
start of an increase in benchmark bond yields and credit rating
cuts.  Police trade unions are demanding a people’s vote on
austerity measures passed by lawmakers that aim to cut public
spending by about 800 million euros ($1 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
