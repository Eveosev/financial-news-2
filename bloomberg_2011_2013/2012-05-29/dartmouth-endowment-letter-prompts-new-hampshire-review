The  New Hampshire attorney general’s 
office said it’s reviewing an anonymous letter claiming that
wealthy alumni of  Dartmouth College  have mismanaged its $3.4
billion endowment.  The letter, dated Feb. 4, says it’s from a group of former
and current faculty and school employees who call themselves
“Friends of Eleazar Wheelock,” the founder of the Hanover, New
Hampshire-based school, according to a  copy  posted on
Dartblog.com on May 21.  New Hampshire  officials “are in the process of looking
into this and requesting Dartmouth’s response to the
allegations,” Anthony Blenkinsop, a senior assistant attorney
general, said in an interview yesterday. He declined to comment
further on the letter.  The letter is “riddled with inaccuracies and untruths,”
including allegations that the  school  can’t pay interest on its
debt, that it invests money for faculty savings and research
grants in  hedge funds , and that more than 50 percent of its
endowment is invested with trustees, investment committee
members or their friends, Justin Anderson, a Dartmouth
spokesman, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  ‘Explicitly Legal’  “The letter implies that there is something that’s
fundamentally improper with colleges like Dartmouth investing
with companies or funds that are managed by an alumnus or a
trustee and that is just categorically false,” Anderson said.
“These investments that are mentioned in the letter are
explicitly legal and entirely proper and Dartmouth meets or
exceeds all provisions under the law governing such
transactions.”  Dartmouth’s endowment was the worst performer in the  Ivy
League  last year. The university said Sept. 28 that investments
rose 18 percent for the year ended June 30, boosted by stocks
and  venture capital  and gains across asset classes.  Investment returns helped increase the endowment to $3.41
billion, after more than $40 million in new gifts and transfers,
partly offset by distributions, Dartmouth said.  The letter accuses a “cabal of external, wealthy alumni”
of a “quiet takeover” of the college by borrowing heavily in
the tax-exempt marketplace and enriching themselves by taking
“gargantuan fund management fees” through investments that
they manage and own, abusing the school’s nonprofit status.  Interest Rate Swaps  The letter says the college engaged Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in six interest rate swaps over seven years whose
value has dropped to more than $200 million from $550 million --
losses the writers say aren’t included in the school’s financial
statements.  The letter also says that more than 50 percent of the
endowment is invested with trustees, investment committee
members or their friends, and that the college didn’t report
investments in six hedge funds, as much as 40 percent of which
was lost.  The letter calls on Governor  John Lynch  and the attorney
general’s office to start a probe and ask the trustees in
question to resign “because of their mismanagement and
conflicts of interests and that Dartmouth divest itself of its
investments in trustee-managed funds.”  Fitch has a AAA credit rating on the school’s long-term
debt and noted that the school’s “strong balance sheet
liquidity, healthy fundraising ability and diverse revenues,”
Anderson said in a statement. Moody’s and  Standard & Poor’s  have
rated the college’s debt one level below their highest
investment grade rating, he said.  ‘Performance History’  The school’s investment office selects managers for
investments based on their “strategy, expertise and performance
history,” as well as the endowment’s specific asset allocation
needs, Anderson said.  “The successful performance of these investments over many
years has been key to providing the necessary financial support
to advance Dartmouth’s vital academic mission,” Anderson said.
“Had we chosen to exclude these funds as an option for our
investment staff simply because of a connection to an alumnus or
trustee, our endowment returns would have been lower.”  The initial investments with firms related to college
trustees occurred before those people became trustees, and New
Hampshire law imposes special requirements to make sure such
transactions are conducted on an “arms-length basis” and are
in the best interests of the organization, Anderson said.  The school imposes procedures that exceed the requirements
of New Hampshire law when it comes to investments with firms
managed by trustees or members of the school’s Investment
Committee who aren’t trustees, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
