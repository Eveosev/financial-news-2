While Treasury 10-year note yields
approach record lows, they’re cheap compared with AAA debt of
other nations, helping trigger record demand at U.S. bond
auctions even in a fourth year of $1 trillion budget deficits.  Yields on the benchmark security are  23 basis points  higher
than the average for comparable debt of nations from Germany to
 Australia , above the average of 12 basis points in the past
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The gap between U.S.
notes and  German bunds  widened to 37 basis points. As recently
as November, bunds yielded 34 basis points more than Treasuries.  “Looking at the spectrum of opportunities in safe-haven
assets, yields in 10-year Treasuries don’t really look that
bad,” Gregory Whiteley, who manages investments in government
debt at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, which has $35
billion in assets, said in a May 25 telephone interview.  Even after boosting the amount of marketable debt
outstanding to more than $10 trillion from $4.34 trillion in
mid-2007, the Treasury Department is attracting record demand at
auctions. The cost to President  Barack Obama ’s administration of
financing a fourth straight deficit has never been lower. The
extra yield investors receive for holding Treasuries is an added
benefit for investors seeking a haven from Europe’s sovereign
debt turmoil.  “There is no floor” for Treasury yields, Whitely said.
“We could go to 1.50 (percent) this summer and Europe will be
the driving force behind it.”  Bund Yields  While 10-year yields rose 1.5 basis points last week, or
0.015 percentage point, to 1.74 percent, they are down from this
year’s high of 2.40 percent on March 20. The 1.75 percent note
due May 2022 declined 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to
100 3/32 in the five days ended May 25, based on Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The yield fell three basis points to 1.71 percent
at 1:16 p.m. in  New York .  Yields on similar-maturity German  bunds  fell six basis
points to 1.37 percent last week, while  U.K. gilts  dropped seven
basis points to 1.75 percent.  Treasury yields dropped 85 basis points since  Standard &
Poor’s  stripped the U.S. of its AAA rating in August 2011 for
failing to reduce the deficit amid political wrangling. Rates
touched 1.69 percent on May 17, the lowest this year and
approaching the record 1.67 percent set on Sept. 23.  Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings kept their top
grades on the U.S., albeit with “negative” outlooks.  Record Bids  Investors have bid $3.19 for each dollar of the $903
billion of notes and bonds sold by the U.S. this year, above the
record $3.04 in all of 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Top-rated assets are in short supply worldwide. The U.S.,
 Germany , Switzerland, Sweden and the U.K. are the only Group-
of-10 nations with credit-default swaps trading at less than 100
basis points, the cheapest to insure against default, down from
eight a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s AAA Rated Global Fixed
Income Index contained 3,597 securities with the highest ratings
as of April 30, down from a high of 5,331 in December 2007 and
the fewest since November 2005. AAA debt assets have returned
about 2.18 percent, including reinvested interest, according to
the index. Ten-year Treasuries have gained 2.53 percent.  Next Steps  Rising demand for  U.S. debt  has narrowed the gap with some
European issuers. Finland’s 10-year yield is 8 basis points less
than Treasuries, compared with an average premium of about 32
basis points in the last 12 months. Those in the Netherlands are
7 basis points higher compared with an average 31 more during
the period.  European Union leaders tied their next steps on the
financial crisis to the outcome of a contested election in
Greece that may determine whether the 17-nation euro currency
splinters. EU officials closed their summit meeting May 24 by
asking Greek voters on June 17 to elect a pro-austerity
government that will make the budget cuts needed to keep the
country in the euro.  The currency dropped to the weakest level against the
dollar since July 2010, and has fallen more than 5 percent this
month. It slid to $1.2496 on May 25 after closing April 2 at
$1.3321. The euro weakened to $1.2461 today in New York, the
least since July 2010.  Diversification  “You’ve seen a developing trend toward weakness in the
euro-dollar  exchange rate , and that partly reflects investors
who had taken safe haven in the European core actually moving
some of that into the U.S. as a means of diversification,”  Carl Lantz , head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Credit
Suisse Group AG, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with
the  Federal Reserve , said in a May 21 telephone interview.  Higher-rated European sovereign debt, particularly Germany,
has remained in demand from Asian reserve managers and sovereign
wealth funds, which has been a bulwark holding down yields,
according to  Stuart Thomson , a bond  fund manager  at Ignis Asset
Management in Glasgow, Scotland.  “The outlook for the dollar is greater than the outlook
for the euro at the moment,” Thomson, whose firm oversees $121
billion, said in a May 24 telephone interview. “Investors will
find that attractive from a 12-month view. In time the reserve
managers will follow that.”  Higher U.S. yields in part reflect an outlook for faster
growth than in  Europe . America’s gross domestic product will
expand 2.3 percent this year, according to the median forecast
of 74 economists, while Europe’s economic output shrinks 0.35
percent, the median estimate of 32 economists in separate
Bloomberg surveys show.  Fed Minutes  Treasury yields were 38 basis points higher than the
average of top-quality sovereign debt on April 3, after minutes
from the Fed’s March 13 meeting signaled the central bank was
unlikely to initiate an additional round of monetary stimulus.  Since then, the odds of Fed policy makers announcing
additional easing at their June 20 meeting have risen to about
50-50, Morgan Stanley economists, led by  Vincent Reinhart  wrote
in a May 18 note to clients.  “To buy Treasuries you have to buy U.S. dollars,”  Jack McIntyre , a fund manager who oversees $28.5 billion in debt at
Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia, said in
a May 25 telephone interview.  “The dollar’s proven itself to be the flight-to-quality
beneficiary in this environment” rather than the yen or the
franc, which have been sold by the  Bank of Japan (8301)  and the  Swiss
National Bank  to prevent their gains from undermining their
economies, he said.  Tax Cuts  U.S. government debt may also benefit from a slowdown
caused by the expiration of George W. Bush-era tax cuts at the
end of the year, while bunds may be hurt by “the contingent
liability aspect” of expectations that Germany will have to
provide funding for additional rescues in Europe, McIntyre said.  The Treasury sold $35 billion of two-year notes May 23 at a
yield of 0.30 percent with a 0.25 percent coupon, garnering
$3.95 in bids for every dollar of debt sold, the second-highest
demand since 1992 when the government began collecting the data.  Even with the demand, the U.S. couldn’t match Germany,
which sold 4.56 billion euros ($5.72 billion) of two-year notes
the same day at a 0.07 percent yield, an all-time low, according
to the Bundesbank.  Japan  sold 2.495 trillion yen ($31.4 billion)
of two-year notes on April 26 to yield 0.11 percent.  Super Low  “We have bunds joining Japan in that super low-yielding
group,” Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist in  Newark ,  New
Jersey , for Prudential Financial Inc.’s fixed income division,
which oversees $335 billion in bonds, said in a May 23 telephone
interview. “Investors look and see Treasuries and have to bring
them along as a result of this move.”  The flight to quality is divided, with European investors
buying bunds and everyone else favoring Treasuries, said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in Memphis,
Tennessee, in a May 23 telephone interview.  “The question isn’t ‘I’m necessarily afraid of a bad
outcome in Europe,’” Vogel said. “It’s ‘I don’t know how it
gets better and so I need to reduce my exposure to Europe until
I can make a sensible choice.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
