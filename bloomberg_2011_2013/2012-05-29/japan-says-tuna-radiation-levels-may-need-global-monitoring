Japan  said there may be a need for
global monitoring of radiation levels in tuna after a report
showed fish with elevated levels of cesium from last yearâ€™s
Fukushima nuclear disaster near the California coast.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura spoke to
reporters today in Tokyo.  Bluefin tuna contaminated from the March 2011 meltdown at
the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant migrated 6,000 miles
to  North America , the Associated Press reported, citing a study
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  To contact the reporter on this story:
