Paul Cosgrove, the former head of
worldwide sales at  IMI Plc (IMI) ’s California unit Control Components
Inc., pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.  Cosgrove, 65, pleaded guilty today in federal court in
Santa Ana, California, to paying a bribe to a Chinese government
official, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement. He
faces as long as 15 months in prison at his sentencing,
according to the statement.  Cosgrove is the fourth former Control Components executive
to plead guilty out of six charged in 2009 for bribing officials
at state-owned companies in  China , Malaysia and the  United Arab
Emirates  to win contracts for Rancho Santa Margarita,
California-based Control Components.  The company, a maker of control valves used in nuclear, oil
and gas power plants, paid an $18.2 million fine in 2009 as part
of a plea agreement. Control Components and IMI, based in
Birmingham, England, cooperated with the investigation, the
company said at the time.  Thomas Bienert Jr., Cosgrove’s lawyer, didn’t immediately
return a call to his office for comment on the plea.  The case is U.S. v. Carson, 09-00077, U.S District Court,
Southern District of California (Santa Ana.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
