Japanese  stocks  rose, sending the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to a four-day advance, as  China 
introduced measures to stimulate consumer demand and on
speculation that shares were oversold.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that gets 14
percent of sales from China, rose 3.2 percent. Nippon Yusen K.K.,
Japan’s largest shipping line by sales, jumped 4.4 percent after
its equity rating was raised to “outperform” by Credit Suisse
Group AG.  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  climbed 3.9 percent after the
electronics maker said it’s considering restructuring, including
cutting jobs.  “China’s stimulus steps are moving closer to market
expectations,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Shares that
were oversold are now being bought as China’s economic measures
are coming into view.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 percent to 8,657.08 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, with volume about the same as the 30-day average.
The broader Topix Index added 0.8 percent to 727.03, reversing
losses of as much as 0.8 percent.  Stocks linked to China gained after the cabinet agreed to
revive financial incentives for consumers to trade in used
passenger cars for cash to raise demand in the world’s biggest
vehicle market, a government official said. China’s finance
ministry said separately it will allocate as much as 2 billion
 yuan  ($317 million) every year to support purchases of energy-
efficient cars.  Komatsu gained 3.2 percent to 1,952 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a
producer of robotics for Chinese factories, climbed 1.8 percent
to 13,880 yen.  Shipping lines gained the  most  among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after Credit Suisse boosted the sector rating to
“overweight” from “market weight,” saying it was “time to
sow seeds” for investment returns in a year. The investment
bank also raised ratings on the nation’s three biggest companies
in the sector to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Nippon Yusen K.K.  jumped 4.4 percent to 212 yen. Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines Ltd. climbed 4.8 percent to 282 yen. Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd. soared 5.8 percent to 147 yen.  Panasonic climbed 3.9 percent to 536 yen. The biggest
employer among companies on the Tokyo bourse may cut jobs after
streamlining operations at production units, spokesman Yuko
Hosaka said today. Panasonic’s headquarters staff of about 7,000
will be cut by 3,000 to 4,000 through attrition and transfers to
subsidiaries, according to a Nikkei newspaper report.  The 25-day Toraku index, which compares advancing and
declining shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section,
fell to 62.67 yesterday, the lowest since November 2009. A
reading below 70 suggests stocks are close to bottoming.  ‘Shares Undervalued’  The value of stocks listed on the Topix has fallen to 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.1 times for the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.3 times for the Stoxx 600, according to
Bloomberg data. A number below one means companies can be bought
for less than value of their assets.  “Shares are undervalued,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co., a unit of
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. “They are at a level that
indicates they’re oversold in the short term, which will support
investors’ sentiment.”  The Topix has plunged 17 percent from this year’s high
on March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed, and on renewed
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis. The political gridlock in
Greece after an inconclusive election this month reignited
concern the nation will renege on austerity pledges required
for 240 billion euros ($300 billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Stocks fell earlier in the day as Spain tries to shore up
its banks and help cash-strapped regions while borrowing costs
surge. As the nation’s narrowing market access depends on
domestic lenders backed by the  European Central Bank , Spanish
Prime Minister Rajoy is considering using public-debt securities
rather than cash to fund the 19 billion-euro ($24 billion)
bailout of BFA-Bankia.  ‘Spain’s Band-Aid’  “Spain’s public injections into banks are only putting a
band-aid on the crisis,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in
Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about $75 billion.
“It’s preventing the problem from getting worse faster, but it
can’t stop the situation from gradually deteriorating.”  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (4902) , a photo film maker that
counts Europe as its biggest market, slid 0.3 percent to 582 yen,
paring earlier losses of as much as 2.6 percent.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) ,
an electronics maker that gets almost 20 percent of its sales in
Europe, added 0.3 percent to 6,590 yen, reversing the drop of up
to 1.8 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.9 percent
today. The gauge slid 0.2 percent in  New York  on May 25, paring
its first weekly rally since April. Financial markets in the U.S.
were closed yesterday for the Memorial Day holiday.  -- With assistance from Satoshi Kawano in Tokyo and Adam Haigh
