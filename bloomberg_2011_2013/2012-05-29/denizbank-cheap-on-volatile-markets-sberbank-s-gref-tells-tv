OAO Sberbank is taking advantage of
the ‘low’ valuation caused by market turbulence in its bid for
 Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s Turkish unit  Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , Herman Gref, chairman of
 Russia ’s biggest lender, told Russia Today.  Bank shares are inexpensive and had it not been for market
turbulence, Dexia would have never sold the bank or would have
offered it “for much more,” Gref said in an interview,
according to an e-mailed statement from the channel.  The Moscow-based lender began talks to buy Denizbank in
Istanbul from Dexia, the Franco-Belgian lender said on May 24.
Sberbank may agree to pay as much as 1.5 times Denizbank’s book
value, said one person close to the deal. The stock currently
trades at 2.01 times book value, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
