Germany ’s Free Voters will
participate in the national parliamentary election next year to
protest the euro policies of the country’s leading political
parties, party leader Hubert Aiwanger told  Handelsblatt .  The Free Voters, which took more than 10 percent in the
southern state of Bavaria in 2008 and oppose the euro bailout
fund and the fiscal treaty, will vote June 16 to contest the
2013 election, Aiwanger told Handelsblatt.  The party is supported by former Federation of German
Industries President Hans-Olaf Henkel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
