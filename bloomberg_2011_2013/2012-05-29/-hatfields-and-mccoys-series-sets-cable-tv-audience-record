“Hatfields & McCoys,” History
channel’s miniseries about the famous family feud, drew a record
cable audience to its premiere and encore showings last night.  The program attracted more than 13.9 million viewers to
become the most-watched non-sports telecast on an ad-supported
cable network, History channel owner A&E Television Networks
said today in a statement. More than 17 million people watched
the debut and encore showing, A&E said.  Cable channels are beginning to draw audiences that rival
broadcast television’s prime-time shows. “Hatfields & McCoys”
stars Kevin Costner, Bill Paxton and Tom Berenger in a re-
telling of the legendary family feud that spanned decades and
nearly sparked a war between Kentucky and West Virginia,
according to the statement. The miniseries continues tonight and
tomorrow, A&E said.  A&E Television Networks is owned by  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , Hearst
Corp. and  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal . On March 26, NBC
Universal exercised an option to sell a “substantial” portion
of its stake in the company, according to regulatory filings.  In addition to A&E and History, the company owns Lifetime,
Military History and Crime & Investigation Network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
