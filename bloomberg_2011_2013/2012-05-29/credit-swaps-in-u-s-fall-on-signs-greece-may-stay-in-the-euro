An index of corporate credit risk
declined as concern lessened that  Greece  would leave the euro
even as a gauge of U.S. consumer confidence slipped to a four-
month low.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, dropped 0.8 basis point to a mid-price of
116.8 basis points at 3:57 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The index last closed lower at 114.7
basis points on May 14. Contracts linked to  Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN) 
declined by the most in more than two years.  The gauge declined after polls showed voters in Greece may
support politicians backing the nation’s bailout, diminishing
the chance that the country will leave the single currency. The
Conference Board’s index of U.S.  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly fell to 64.9 this month from a revised 68.7 in
April.  “There’s a positive tone in the credit markets with the
possibility that Greece may stay in the euro,” Mark Pibl, head
of credit strategy at broker-dealer Cortview Capital Securities
LLC, said in a telephone interview.  The median forecast of 70 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for a confidence reading of 69.6. Estimates ranged
from 62 to 74.1. The measure averaged 53.7 during the 18-month
recession that ended in June 2009.  Eastman CDS  The cost to protect against losses on the debt of Eastman
decreased as the biggest U.S. producer of chemicals from coal is
issuing more than $2 billion of bonds.  Credit Swaps on the Kingsport, Tennessee-based company fell
8.2 basis points to a mid-price of 106.7 at 3:54 p.m., Bloomberg
data show. That’s the biggest decline since May 11, 2010 when it
dropped 12.3 basis points.  The swaps gauge typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
