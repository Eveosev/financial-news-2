The head of the Turkish parliament’s
human rights committee said abortions are human rights abuses
and should be banned, Milliyet  reported .  The call by Ayhan Sefer Ustun follows Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s comment last week comparing abortion to murder.  Levent Gok, a lawmaker from the main opposition  Republican
People’s Party , criticized Ustun and Erdogan for creating an
issue out of abortion to obscure other discussions such as the
human rights committee’s review of a December airstrike that
killed 34 civilians wrongly identified as terrorists, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
