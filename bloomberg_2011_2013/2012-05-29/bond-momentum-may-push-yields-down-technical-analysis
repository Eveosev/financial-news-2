Price momentum indicates Treasury 30-
year  bonds , which have produced almost double the returns of the
broader Treasury market this year, are poised to rally,
according to CRT Capital Group LLC, citing  technical analysis .  Weekly Stochastics, used to predict a security’s movement
based on how close its price is to its highest or lowest levels,
are signaling the 30-year bond rally has further to run, even as
the securities have reached “equilibrium,” said David Ader,
head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT in  Stamford ,
Connecticut  The 30-year yield failed to breach its yearly closing low
of 2.78 percent after  approaching  that level during the past six
sessions. A breach of 2.78 percent would signal further rallying
to as low as 2.72 percent, Ader said.  “Domestic data has shifted and, of greater importance,
 Europe  is and remains an uncertain mess,” Ader said in a
telephone interview. “A break of 2.78 percent will signal
movement away from the equilibrium in the market, and short-term
bullish momentum. And in this environment, you take your few
basis points and you say ‘thank you.’”  The 30-year yield was little changed at 2.84 percent in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 2.3 percent this year,
outperforming the 1.2 percent gain in the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
