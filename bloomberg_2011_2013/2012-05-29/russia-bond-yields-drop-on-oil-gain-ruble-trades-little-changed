The ruble fell for a fifth day
against the dollar as Urals crude,  Russia ’s main export, traded
at its lowest price this year.  The ruble dropped 0.2 percent to 32.17 per dollar by the
close in Moscow, its weakest level since Dec. 29. The Russian
currency lost 0.2 percent to 40.35 per euro and 35.851 against
the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Urals sank 1.1 percent to $104.21 per barrel. Oil and
natural gas accounted for about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue last year, according to government estimates.  “For the ruble to depreciate further it might require a
further softening in global risk appetite, a decline in  oil
prices  in particular,” Vladimir Kolychev, chief economist at
OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , the Moscow based unit of  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , said
by e-mail.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The central bank started
intervening to support its currency after it weakened beyond
35.65 against the basket on May 25, Kolychev said.  Bank Rossii is selling as much as $150 million a day in
foreign currencies to support the ruble, Kolychev said. The
interventions will increase to as much as $250 million a day if
the ruble weakens beyond 36.5 against the basket, he said.  Investors increased bets on the Russian currency weakening,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.697 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 31.872 per
dollar yesterday. The ruble may fall as much as 1 percent to
32.5 per dollar this week, Mikhail Palei, a London-based
currency trader at VTB Capital, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
