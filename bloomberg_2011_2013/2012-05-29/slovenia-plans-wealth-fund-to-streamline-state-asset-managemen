Slovenia plans to create a sovereign-
wealth fund by merging agencies that are managing state assets
to boost revenue from their investments.  “The aim is to streamline the management of state assets
and make them more efficient,” Finance Minister Janez Sustersic
told reporters in Ljubljana today. “We will later decide which
are just portfolio investments, which are strategic and we want
to keep and which companies will be sold.”  The fund will report to the lawmakers while profits will be
used to finance pensions and the budget, Sustersic said. The
plan is to merge five different agencies with total assets
estimated at more than 10 billion euros ($12.54 billion),
Finance newspaper reported yesterday.  Slovenia, the first post-communist nation to adopt the euro
in 2007, wants to earn more from state-owned companies as it
seeks to reduce budget spending and enact the so-called fiscal
compact inspired by  Germany .  Slovenia’s export-driven economy is in its second recession
in three years and is forecast to shrink 2 percent this year,
according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
