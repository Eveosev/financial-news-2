The Foschini Group Ltd. (TFG) , a South
African clothing retailer, plans to increase stores in the rest
of  Africa  by 45 percent over the next two years as it adds 39
outlets in the region.  Foschini will enter Nigeria and Mozambique in addition to
expanding in its existing markets, the Cape Town-based company
said in a statement today. Foschini operates 87 stores outside
of South Africa, with 58 in Namibia, 11 in Botswana, 12 in
Zambia, four in Swaziland and two in Lesotho.  With 1,857 stores as of March 31, Foschini is following
other South African retailers such as  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  and
 Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  in expanding across the continent to tap
rising consumer spending.  Foschini plans to offer credit purchases in the African
countries outside of  South Africa  in which it operates, Chief
Financial Officer Ronnie Stein said in a telephone interview
from Cape Town today. Outside of South Africa, the company only
offers credit sales in Namibia and Botswana.  Net income in the year ended March 31 climbed 22 percent
from a year earlier to 1.58 billion rand ($192 million). Diluted
earnings per share excluding one-time items rose 24 percent to
7.66 rand, beating the 7.59-rand median estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Foschini’s shares advanced 0.5 percent to 118.10 rand at
the close of trading in Johannesburg, bringing the gain this
year to 12 percent.  Bad debt as a percentage of the debtors’ book rose to 9.4
percent, from 9.2 percent in the previous year. It won’t rise to
more than 10 percent in the new financial year, Stein predicted.  To contact the reporters on this story:
