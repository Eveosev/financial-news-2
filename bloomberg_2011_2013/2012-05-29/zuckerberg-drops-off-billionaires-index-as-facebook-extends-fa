Mark Zuckerberg ,  Facebook (FB)  Inc.’s co-
founder and chief executive officer, is no longer one of the
world’s 40 richest people.  The 28-year-old’s fortune fell to $14.7 billion yesterday
from $16.2 billion on May 25, as shares of the world’s largest
social-networking company dropped 9.6 percent. They slipped
another 2.3 percent today to $28.19. That extended the stock’s
losses to 26 percent from the worst-performing large initial
public offering in the past decade and cut Zuckerberg’s net
worth to $14.4 billion.  “It seems to be a clear reflection that there was just too
much stock issued, that the valuation was aggressive and that a
lot of people who lined up to buy it really had no intention of
holding it,”  Jack Ablin , chief investment officer of BMO Harris
Private Bank in Chicago, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. The bank oversees about $60 billion of assets.  Facebook shares closed at $38.23 on May 18, the first day
they began trading, giving Zuckerberg a net worth of $19.4
billion. The  Menlo Park , California-based company ended the day
with a price-earnings ratio of 83.1, making it more expensive
than 99 percent of  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  stocks. The
company went public as the equity index was heading for its
biggest monthly decline since September.  Facebook options trading began yesterday, with volume for
puts exceeding calls by 1.2 to 1, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. More than 200,000 puts were traded yesterday, giving the
holder the right to sell the shares at a specified price. June
$30 calls were the most active contracts today, with volume at
22,896. They were followed by June $28 puts and June $29 puts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
