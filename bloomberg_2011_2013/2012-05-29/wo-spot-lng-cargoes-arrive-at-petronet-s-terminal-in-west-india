Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) , India’s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas, received two spot shipments
of the fuel from Africa this week, vessel-tracking data show.  The company, which operates an LNG terminal at Dahej on
India’s west coast, received about 60,000 metric tons of the
fuel from Egypt today, according to vessel fixtures listed in
EXIM India, a shipping newsletter. The LNG Pioneer was last
tracked near Dahej after leaving Egypt earlier this month,
vessel-transmissions captured by  IHS Inc. (IHS)  on Bloomberg show.  Petronet’s terminal also received about 62,000 tons of LNG
from Nigeria this week, according to EXIM. The Methane Rita
Andrea was last tracked off India’s west coast after leaving
Bonny in  Nigeria  in early May, the IHS data show.  LNG is created by cooling gas to about minus 260 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 162 degrees Celsius), shrinking it to about a
600th of the original volume, according to the U.S. Department
of Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
