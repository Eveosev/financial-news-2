Germany ’s 10-year bond yield was two
basis points from a record low as concern the European debt
crisis is worsening underpinned demand for the region’s safest
securities.  Ten-year bunds erased an earlier decline after reports from
three German states showed inflation eased in May. Bunds were
also boosted by speculation Spanish banks will need a bailout
and as  Greece  prepared to hold new elections next month after an
earlier poll resulted in a stalemate. Spanish and Italian bonds
rose, with the spread between  Spain ’s 10-year securities and
similar-maturity bunds shrinking from a euro era record.  “Ongoing nervousness ahead of the Greek elections and
mounting jitters about the health of the Spanish banking sector
mean new lows in 10-year bund yields cannot be ruled out,” said
 Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital
Markets Ltd., a broker for banks.  The German 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.37
percent at 10:13 a.m. London time, after falling to a record
1.351 percent on May 24. The 1.75 percent bond due in July 2022
traded at 103.575.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year bond  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 6.46 percent. The extra yield
investors demand to hold the securities instead of their German
counterparts narrowed by two basis points to 509 basis points
after widening to 514 basis points, the most since the euro’s
introduction in 1999.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield declined three basis points to
5.71 percent.  The inflation rate declined to 2 percent from 2.1 percent
in Brandenburg, to 1.9 percent from 2 percent in Saxony and to
1.5 percent from 1.7 percent in North Rhine-Westphalia. In
Hesse, it stayed at 1.9 percent.  German debt has returned 2.2 percent this month, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities dropped 3.6
percent, the indexes show.  -- Editors: Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporters on this story:
