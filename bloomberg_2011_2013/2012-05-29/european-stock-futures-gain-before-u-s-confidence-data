basis.  Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in May to
the lowest level in four months as Americans grew more
pessimistic about the labor market. The Conference Board’s

prior month. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a reading of 69.6.  China has no intention of starting a large-scale economic
stimulus program like it did during the global financial crisis,
the official Xinhua News Agency said today.  China Stimulus  “The Chinese government’s intention is very clear: it will
not roll out another massive stimulus plan to seek high economic
growth,” Xinhua said in the seventh paragraph of a Chinese-
language article on economic policy. “The current efforts for
stabilizing growth will not repeat the old way of three years
ago.”  CGGVeritas added 5.7 percent to 19.65 euros as UBS upgraded

snacks such as Cornish pasties subject to value-added tax.  Spanish lender Bankia sank 16 percent to 1.14 euros after
dropping 13 percent yesterday. Spain’s  IBEX 35 (IBEX)  slid 2.3 percent
