American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a U.S.
maker of wind-turbine components, said  China ’s highest court
agreed to hear an intellectual-property suit against Sinovel
Wind Group Co.  The case is seeking $200,000 in damages and is the smallest
of four suits AMSC is pursuing in China against its former
largest customer, the Devens, Massachusetts-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  AMSC is seeking a total of more than $1.2 billion in
damages from China’s biggest turbine maker for allegedly
violating sales contracts and stealing its technology. Sinovel
stopped accepting contracted shipments in March 2011. A former
AMSC employee in Austria pleaded guilty in September to charges
including economic espionage for passing software to Sinovel.  A provincial court dismissed the $200,000 case in February
and AMSC filed its appeal with China’s Supreme People’s Court in
April. The copyright infringement suit also names Dalian Guotong
Electric Co. as a defendant.  AMSC said in the statement that there is a “significant
amount of evidence that its copyrighted software is being
infringed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
