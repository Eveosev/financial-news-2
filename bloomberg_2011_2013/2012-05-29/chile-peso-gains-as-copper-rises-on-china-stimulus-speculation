Chile’s peso gained as copper, the
country’s principal export, rose past $3.50 a pound for the
first time in a week on speculation China will take steps to
boost economic growth.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 511.55 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:54 a.m. in Santiago, from 512.54 yesterday.  China is the biggest buyer of Chile’s copper, which makes
up more than half the Andean country’s exports. Chinese Premier
 Wen Jiabao  last week called for a greater focus on growth in the
world’s second-largest economy, spurring speculation the nation
would step up measures to boost expansion. Stocks rose in  Asia ,
the U.S. and Europe.  “Copper is up, U.S. stocks are up and the euro is up,”
said Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa
SA in Santiago. “With the world as it is today, paying 512
pesos for a dollar is expensive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
