Sales at  AB Apranga (APG1L) , the biggest
clothing retailer in the Baltic states, grew at least 28 percent
in May from the same period last year, said Chief Executive
Officer Rimantas Perveneckas.  Demand is driven by recovering  consumer spending  in the
region and by “ideal weather conditions” for the clothing
market this year, Perveneckas said in a meeting with investors
in Vilnius today. The company also plans to revise its 2012
revenue forecast in the third quarter after sales grew more than
estimated in the first quarter this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
