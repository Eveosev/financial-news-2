French Foreign Minister Laurent
Fabius said nations opposed to Syrian President Bachar el-Assad
aren’t planning any military ground operations in the Middle
Eastern country,  Le Monde  reported, citing an interview.  “No state is currently ready to plan a ground operation,”
Fabius said, according to the newspaper. “The risk of it
spilling over elsewhere in the region, particularly in the
Lebanon, is frightening.”  Fabius described Assad as a “murderer” and said  France  is
in favor of an investigation by the  International Criminal Court 
after the massacre of more than 100 people in the Syrian town of
Houla last week.  Fabius also said France wants to maintain pressure on  Iran 
to deter it from obtaining nuclear weapons. He said France was
not planning military action against Iran, according to Le
Monde.  To contact the reporters on this story:
