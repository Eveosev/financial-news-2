The Tate has received a gift of works
that will enhance the museum’s collection of 20th-century
British art, director Nicholas Serota said today.  The donation by philanthropists Mercedes and Ian Stoutzker
includes paintings by  Lucian Freud  and  David Hockney . The Tate
didn’t place a value on the works, which Serota said will go on
show in London at Tate Britain later this year.  “Gifts and bequests from major collectors are the
foundation of the national collection,” Serota said in an e-
mailed release. “The Stoutzkers have added exemplary individual
paintings by two generations of British artists and have greatly
enriched the national collection of art after 1960.”  Stoutzker, 83, worked for Samuel Montagu from 1952-56 and A
Keyser & Co. in 1956-75, before becoming chairman of London
Interstate Bank, and Dawnay Day International to 2000,  according
to Debrett’s . Tate holds the national collection of British art
from 1500 to the present day and international modern and
contemporary art.  (Richard Vines writes for Muse, the arts and leisure
