Kenya ’s shilling retreated to a four-
month low on increased demand for dollars from importers to
settle month-end obligations.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.6 percent to 85.95 per dollar, the weakest intraday price
since Jan. 25, by 4:11 p.m. in the capital Nairobi, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Kenyan shilling weakness is due to end-month importer
demand, falling government bond yields and a global rush to
safety into dollar is expected to continue mounting pressure on
the local currency,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said in a
note to clients.  Kenya’s three-month and six-month yields fell for the 19th
straight week at an auction last week, after the government
halved its borrowing target. 182-day bills borrowing costs slid
to 10.915 percent from 20.914 percent realized on Jan 23, while
yields on 91-day treasury bills declined to 9.865 percent from
20.799 percent tagged on similar-maturity debt sold on Jan 12  Kenya has lowered its local borrowing target to 62.1
billion shillings ($723 million) from 119.5 billion shillings
for the fiscal year ending June 30, replacing shilling-
denominated financing with a $600 million syndicated loan
arranged by Citigroup Inc.,  South Africa ’s Standard Bank Group
Ltd. and London-based Standard Chartered Plc.  The central bank accepted today 8 billion shillings of bids
of 9.225 billion shillings for seven-day  repurchase agreements 
on offer at 17.952 percent, after offering 8 billion shillings,
an official who declined to be identified in line with policy,
said in a phone interview. The bank accepted 1.5 billion
shillings of late six-day repurchase agreement at 16.952
percent, the official said.  Ugandan shilling appreciated 0.4 percent to 2,470.62 per
dollar while Tanzania’s shilling remained unchanged at 1,590 to
the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
