Free-agent pitcher Roy Oswalt signed
with the  Texas Rangers , who are trying to reach their third
straight World Series, the Dallas Morning News reported.  Oswalt, 34, who had two stints on the disabled list last
season while with the Philadelphia Phillies because of lower
back inflammation, is likely to make a few minor-league starts
before joining the Rangers, the  newspaper said , citing an
individual familiar with the process.  An e-mail seeking comment from John Blake, a spokesman for
the team, wasn’t immediately returned.  Oswalt, a right-hander, pitched 10 seasons with the Houston
Astros before joining the Phillies at the 2010 trade deadline.
The three-time All-Star has a 159-93 career record with a 3.21
earned run average, 1,759 strikeouts and 500 walks.  An opening in the Rangers rotation arose when right-hander
Neftali Feliz was placed on the disabled list on May 19 with a
sprained ligament in his right elbow.  Texas has never won Major League Baseball’s championship.
The Rangers fell in seven games to the  St. Louis Cardinals  in
last season’s World Series after losing to the  San Francisco
Giants  the year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
