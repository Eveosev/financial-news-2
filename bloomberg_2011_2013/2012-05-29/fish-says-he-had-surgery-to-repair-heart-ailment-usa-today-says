Mardy Fish  had surgery to repair a
heart ailment that has kept him out of action since April,  USA
Today  reported, citing the top-ranked U.S. men’s tennis player.  Fish, ranked No. 10 on the ATP World Tour, said he had the
procedure, called cardiac catheter ablation, on May 23 to
correct misfiring electrical pulses in his heart.  The 30-year-old Fish started to feel symptoms in February,
waking up in the middle of the night with extreme palpitations
that doctors explained were a form of arrhythmia, USA Today
said. After one episode, he said he thought he was going to die.  “During days, I’m totally fine,” the newspaper cited Fish
as saying. “I can track it and work out fine. But every time I
would go to bed my mind would start racing. Is this going to
happen tonight? Is this going to be another night like that? It
was super hard to go to sleep.”  Fish, who pulled out of the French Open currently taking
place in Paris, can begin light training this week and wants to
be back in time for Wimbledon in late June, USA Today added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
