The Slovak government’s planned
measures to improve public finances “should be sufficient” to
reduce the euro member’s  budget deficit  below the European
Union’s limit, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The scope for further broad spending cuts is limited after
the  budget  shortfall narrowed to 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product last year from 8 percent in 2010, Daria Zakharova, the
head of the fund’s mission in Slovakia, told reporters today.
The measures proposed by the government, which mainly seek to
boost  tax revenue , are “broadly appropriate,” she said.  The second-poorest euro region member must boost revenue
and cut spending by about 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to
trim the budget deficit to meet the limit of 3 percent of GDP by
next year at a time when the economy is hurt by the region’s
debt crisis. The government wants to increase corporate and
personal income taxes as well as introduce special levies for
selected industries to collect more revenue.  The Washington-based lender forecast the Slovak economy to
grow 2.6 percent this year, one of the fastest in the EU, and
3.5 percent in 2013. The potential spillover of the euro
region’s debt crisis is the main risk to the outlook, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
