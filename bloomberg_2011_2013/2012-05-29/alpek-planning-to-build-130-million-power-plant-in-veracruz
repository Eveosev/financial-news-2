Alpek SAB (ALPEKA) , Mexico’s largest
petrochemical company, plans to build a $130 million power plant
in the state of Veracruz.  The plant, in the city of Cosoleacaque, will have capacity
of more than 85 megawatts, Enrique Flores, a spokesman for
Alpek’s majority owner,  Alfa SAB (ALFAA) , said today. It will generate
steam and electricity for an Alpek factory that makes
polyethylene terephthalate, known as PET and used in fibers and
containers, and for another making purified terephthalic acid,
known as PTA and used in plastic bottles.  “Any additional electricity that goes beyond the needs of
those plants will be sold to other Alfa companies in other parts
of Mexico,” Flores said in a telephone interview from Alfa’s
headquarters in San Pedro Garza Garcia,  Mexico .  Alpek awarded the contract to build the plant to a group
led by Bilbao, Spain-based Sener’s Mexican unit, Sener said in a
 statement  today. The plant is expected to be finished in
February 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
