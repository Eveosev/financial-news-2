Mario Mesquita,  Brevan Howard  Asset
Management LLP’s chief strategist for Latin America, left the
hedge fund, said a person with knowledge of his departure who
asked to remain anonymous because the matter is private.  Mesquita, a former Brazilian central bank director, ran
Brevan Howard’s office in  Sao Paulo . The firm, which oversees
$36 billion globally, hired Jose Oswaldo Monforte from Banco BTG
Pactual SA this month to be an emerging-markets trader.  Mesquita declined to comment, as did Monforte and a London-
based spokesman for Brevan Howard.  To contact the reporters on this story:
