The percentage of U.S. taxpayers
reporting adjusted gross income exceeding $200,000 who paid no
U.S. income taxes increased in 2009 to 0.53 percent from 0.51
percent, meaning that one in 189 high earners avoided taxation,
an Internal Revenue Service study found.  The filers reported tax-exempt interest along with
deductible charitable contributions, medical expenses and other
items to legally reduce their taxable income. They avoid the
alternative minimum tax, which was created in 1969 in response
to a report that 155 people earned $200,000 and paid nothing in
taxes.  “High-income returns are more often nontaxable as a result
of a combination of reasons, none of which, by itself, would
result in nontaxability,” the IRS wrote in a  report released 
May 25.  The annual report comes amid a debate over the fairness of
the U.S. tax code and particularly how it applies to those at
the top of the income scale. President  Barack Obama  has proposed
the so-called Buffett rule, which would impose a 30 percent
minimum tax on high earners; a congressional proposal
implementing the rule set the threshold for the 30 percent tax
at $2 million.  Low Rates  The number of high-income households paying no taxes is an
indicator of the low rates paid by many high earners, said Matt
Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and
 Economic Policy , a Washington research group that supports a
more progressive tax system.  “When high-income people find ways to avoid paying any
income tax at all, they’re frequently doing so through tax
breaks that some members of Congress and President Obama have
sensibly sought to reform,” he said.  Including the Buffett rule and other proposals, Obama has
supported limits on deductions and the  tax exemption  for
municipal bond interest that would make it tougher for high
earners to avoid all taxes.  The IRS uses two definitions of income and two of taxation
in its calculations, resulting in four ways of measuring the
percentage of Americans with high incomes and no taxes. In 2009,
the percentage of nontaxable returns rose in three of the four
measures and hit a record high, stretching back to 1977.  In 2009, 10,080 households reported adjusted gross income
of at least $200,000 annually, or 0.26 percent of high earners,
who paid no income taxes in the U.S. or to other countries.
Under U.S. tax law, citizens owe U.S. taxes for income they earn
around the world and receive tax credits for payments to other
governments.  Income Taxes  Using an expanded concept of income that includes some
nontaxable items and looking only at U.S. income taxes, there
were 35,061 households, or 0.88 percent, that paid nothing.  Overall, about half of U.S. tax filers pay no income taxes,
and they are concentrated among lower and middle-income
households. For them, tax breaks such as the  child tax credit 
and the earned income tax credit combine with the standard
deduction and personal exemptions to eliminate tax liability.  The number and percentage of U.S. households with income
exceeding $200,000 declined from 2008 to 2009. In 2009, 3.9
million households, or 2.8 percent of the population, had
adjusted gross income at that level. That was down from 4.4
million and 3.1 percent in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
