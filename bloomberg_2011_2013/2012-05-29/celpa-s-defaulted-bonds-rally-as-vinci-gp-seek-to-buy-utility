Defaulted bonds issued by  Centrais
Eletricas do Para SA (CELP3) , known as Celpa, gained as Brazilian
private-equity funds Vinci Partners Investimentos Ltda. and GP
Investments Ltd. seek to purchase the bankrupt utility.  The securities climbed 4 cents to 35 cents on the dollar as
of 11:43 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The private-equity funds plan to merge Belem-based Celpa
with Cia. Energetica do Maranhao, a Brazilian utility that’s
controlled by Vinci Partners, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the discussions are private. Officials at
Vinci Partners, GP Investments, Celpa and Cemar declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
