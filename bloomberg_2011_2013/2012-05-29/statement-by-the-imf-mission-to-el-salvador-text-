Following is the text of the mission
statement from the International Monetary Fund visit to  El Salvador :  A mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led by Mario Garza
visited San Salvador during May 21-25 to review recent developments and
the economic outlook.
At the conclusion of the visit, Mr. Garza issued the following statement
in San Salvador:
“The IMF team had productive meetings with President Mauricio Funes and
his economic team. The authorities reiterated the government’s commitment
to prudent policies that will place the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a
downward path and protect social spending. They noted the importance of
further strengthening El Salvador’s fiscal position through expenditure
restraint and higher fiscal revenues and expressed their interest in
maintaining a financial arrangement with the IMF until 2014.
As part of the agreed working agenda, IMF staff will maintain a close
dialogue with the authorities to assist them in achieving their fiscal
consolidation objectives.”  SOURCE:  International Monetary Fund
