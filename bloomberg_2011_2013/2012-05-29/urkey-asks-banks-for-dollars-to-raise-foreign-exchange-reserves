Turkey â€™s central bank is seeking to
increase its foreign currency reserves by as much as $2.1
billion by asking banks to deposit more of their lira reserve
requirements in foreign exchange.  The central bank in Ankara raised the portion of required
reserves banks can keep in foreign currency to as much as 45
percent of total reserves from 40 percent, it said in statement
on its website today.  The measure, to be implemented on June 22, would also
release as much as 2.8 billion liras of liquidity into the
market, the central bank said.  Central bank governor Erdem Basci is seeking to bolster his
defenses against further sales of lira by increasing his
reserves from $80 billion on May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
