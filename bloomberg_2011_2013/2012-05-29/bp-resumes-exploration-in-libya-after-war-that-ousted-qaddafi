BP Plc (BP/) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil
company, said it will begin exploring in Libya again after the
civil war last year that ousted  Muammar Qaddafi  from power.  BP has lifted the declaration of force majeure, a legal
clause that allows companies to miss deliveries because of
circumstances beyond their control, it said in a statement
today. The state-run Libyan National Oil Corp. also said today
that BP will resume operations after suspending them in February
last year.  BP signed a contract in 2007 committing it to drill five
offshore and 12 onshore wells in the North African country.
After collecting seismic data, the civil war prevented BP from
starting drilling.  “The lifting of force majeure is a significant milestone
in BP’s plans to return to the exploration of onshore and
offshore blocks,” Mike Daly, head of exploration at BP, said in
a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
