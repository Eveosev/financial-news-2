U.K. populations of farmland and
wintering water birds have deteriorated since 2000, according to
a biodiversity  report  released by the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.  Six of 35 biodiversity measures in the report showed
deterioration in the past 12 years, including the prevalence of
marine and terrestrial invasive species and richness of plant
species in woodland, grassland and boundary habitats, London-
based  Defra  said today on its website. Seventeen measures showed
improvement, 10 showed little or no change and two had
insufficient data for assessment, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
