(Corrects location of Arusha in second paragraph.)  Increased revenue from commodities
will help reduce Tanzania’s reliance on foreign aid, central
bank Governor Benno Ndulu said.  “Earnings are generated in shillings and we have to
service debt in foreign currency,” Ndulu told a meeting of the
 African Development Bank  in Arusha, in the north of the country,
today. “We hope that the natural resources boom will lead to a
reduction of official development assistance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
