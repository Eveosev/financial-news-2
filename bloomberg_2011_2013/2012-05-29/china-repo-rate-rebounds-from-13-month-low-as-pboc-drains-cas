China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose, extending a rebound from a 13-month low, as the central
bank drained funds from the financial system following a
relaxation of lenders’ reserve requirements.  The People’s Bank of China sold 50 billion  yuan  ($7.9
billion) of 28-day  repurchase agreements  at 2.8 percent today,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. The monetary authority  withdrew  78 billion yuan using
open-market operations last week and 64 billion yuan in the five
days ended May 18, when the cut in reserve ratios took effect,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, climbed nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.58 percent in  Shanghai , according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. The rate reached 2 percent on May 24, the lowest level
since April 2011.  “The repo rate was too low and a small rebound is expected
unless we see another round of reserve-requirement easing,”
said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in
 Hong Kong . “We see a range of 2.5 percent to 3.25 percent for
the seven-day repo.”  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the
seven-day repurchase rate, increased one basis point to 2.60
percent in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deposit Auction  The central bank sold 60 billion yuan of nine-month
treasury deposits to commercial banks today on behalf of the
Ministry of Finance at 4.22 percent, according to a trader
required to bid at the sales. That compares with a 5.9 percent
yield at the last sale of similar-maturity deposits in June 2011
and is lower than the People’s Bank of China’s six-month deposit
rate of 6.1 percent.  “The yield is very low,” Chong said. “The deposit
auction is a reflection of how much banks need money. It’s no
big surprise here as there is ample liquidity in the system post
the recent reserve-requirement cut.”  The yield on 3.51 percent government bonds due February
2022 rose three basis points to 3.38 percent today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
