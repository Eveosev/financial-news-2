The finance committee of  Venezuela ’s
National Assembly approved an extra 5.9 billion bolivars ($1.4
billion) in spending this year, in part to fund an increase in
the minimum wage five months before the presidential election.  The additional expenditure will cover 30 percent of the
increase in the minimum wage, decreed by President  Hugo Chavez ,
for 3.8 million people, 3 million of them pensioners. Some of
the funds will also finance a mausoleum in Caracas to honor
South American liberator  Simon Bolivar .  “The bulk of the impact is on the old folks who are
pensioners,” Elias Matta, an opposition lawmaker who voted for
the spending, told reporters after today’s committee meeting.
“That’s where Chavez has a solid vote.”  Chavez, who has undergone three operations for cancer in
the past eight months, is seeking a third six-year term in
October’s election. Public spending climbed 17 percent to 81.19
billion bolivars ($18.9 billion) in real terms in the first
quarter from a year earlier as the government prepared for the
vote, according to calculations by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.  The extra spending approved today will also cover
allowances to poor mothers, athlete development and computers
for school children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
