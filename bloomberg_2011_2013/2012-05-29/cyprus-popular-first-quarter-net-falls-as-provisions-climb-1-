Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl (CPB) , the island’s
second-biggest bank, posted a 23 percent decline in first-
quarter net income after provisions for bad loans climbed and
 Greece ’s debt crisis worsened.  Profit fell to 54.8 million euros ($69 million) from 71
million euros in the same period a year earlier, the Nicosia-
based bank said in an e-mailed statement today. The decline was
limited by an 84.7 million-euro tax gain, the company added.  Provisions for bad loans jumped more than 51 percent to 119
million euros as the economies of Cyprus and Greece, its two
main markets, deteriorated. In Greece, the proportion of the
bank’s non-performing loans climbed to 22.8 percent, up 330
basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011, the lender said.  Net interest income, the difference between what a bank
earns from lending and what it pays on deposits, fell 2.3
percent as funding costs rose and competition for deposits
forced it to offer customers higher  interest rates .  Cyprus Popular said its core Tier capital 1 ratio, a
measure of financial strength, will reach 9.2 percent once it
completes a capital raising plan to comply with rules set by the
European Banking Authority. The bank is preparing a 1.8 billion-
euro rights offering, fully underwritten by the Cypriot
government, as well as a voluntary exchange of 1.2 billion euros
of debt capital securities to bolster capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
