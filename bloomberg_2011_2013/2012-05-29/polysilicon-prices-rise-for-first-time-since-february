The price of polysilicon, the raw
material used to make most solar panels, rose 1.3 percent last
week, the first increase since February, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance.  The material’s  average spot price  was $23.20 a kilogram
compared with $22.90 a week earlier, a survey by the London-
based research group showed today. Polysilicon tumbled 62
percent in the past year on oversupply issues and is down from a
February 2008 peak of $475.  The shares of polysilicon companies rose.  MEMC Electronic
Materials Inc. (WFR) , the second-largest U.S. producer, climbed 6.3
percent to $1.69 at 11:16 a.m. in New York.  China ’s  GCL-Poly
Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  gained 5.8 percent and  Norway ’s Renewable
Energy Corp. ASA increased 3.6 percent.  Polysilicon probably won’t hold onto the gain, Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  San
Francisco , said today in an interview.  “I don’t see any reason for prices to trend upward,”
Hosseini said. “Until companies start going bankrupt and
capacity coming off line, we’re not going to see a healthy solar
industry.”  The modest gain doesn’t “alter the fundamental dynamics of
excess capacity coming in,” said Hari Chandra Polavarapu, an
analyst at Auriga USA LLC in  New York . “People have to get used
to the reality of polysilicon oscillating between $20 and $25 a
kilogram.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
