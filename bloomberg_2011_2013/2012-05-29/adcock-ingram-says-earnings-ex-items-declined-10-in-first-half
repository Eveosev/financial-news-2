Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. (AIP) ,  South
Africa ’s largest supplier of hospital and critical care
products, slumped the most on record after first-half profit
slid, missing analysts’ expectations.  Adcock’s shares declined 7.9 percent, the biggest drop
since the company’s 2008 listing, to close at 58.20 rand, the
lowest since March 23.  Net income for the six months through March dropped to
335.3 million rand ($40.3 million), from 353.4 million rand a
year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Diluted earnings per share excluding one-time items
declined 10 percent to 198.4 cents, missing the 266.5-cent
average  estimate  of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The earnings were weaker than estimates and pricing
remains tough,”  Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at Afrifocus Securities
in Johannesburg, said by phone today.  Price reductions averaged 2 percent for the half-year, the
company said in the statement. The gross margin narrowed to 46.7
percent from 49.2 percent and may only increase about 1 percent
in the second half because of price deflation, Chief Executive
Officer Jonathan Louw said in a telephone interview from
Johannesburg today.  Costs related to upgrades pushed  capital spending  to 274
million rand, from 217 million rand a year earlier. That’s
expected to climb to 406 million rand in fiscal 2012, before
declining to 158.5 million rand next year, Louw said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
