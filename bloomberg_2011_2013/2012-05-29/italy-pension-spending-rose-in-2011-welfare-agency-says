Pension spending in  Italy ,  Europe ’s
fourth-biggest economy, rose in 2011, welfare agency  INPS  said.  The agency’s spending on pensions increased to 181.6
billion euros ($228.2 billion) from 177.4 billion euros in 2010,
INPS said in its annual report released in Rome today. Prime
Minister Mario Monti’s government approved last year an overhaul
of the pension system as part of a 20 billion-euro austerity
package to fight the sovereign debt crisis and put Italy’s debt
on a downward trajectory.  Besides raising the pension age and penalizing early
retirement, the reform based the system on contributions rather
than salary level and ended inflation indexation for larger
pensions. The overhaul means that younger workers will collect
smaller pensions than their parents.  Pension spending last year amounted to 11.5 percent of
 gross domestic product , little changed from 2010, INPS said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
