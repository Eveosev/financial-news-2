The euro fell to the lowest level in
almost two years against the dollar as Spain struggled to rescue
its troubled banks, adding to signs the  European debt crisis  is
spreading to the region’s larger economies.  The 17-nation currency slid for a seventh day versus the
yen, the longest losing streak in four months, after Italy sold
less than its maximum target at a debt auction. The yen and
dollar strengthened as investors sought safer assets after a
European report showed economic confidence dropped more than
economists estimated in May. Asian currencies weakened, pushing
the Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index to the lowest level
since September 2010.  “The market has lost confidence in the euro,” said Carl Forcheski, a director on the corporate currency sales desk at
Societe Generale SA in New York. “We’re a little oversold but
certainly the path is very clear to possibly testing $1.20 or
the $1.1877 low of 2010. People are battening down the hatches
and continue to trade very defensively.”  The euro declined 1.1 percent to $1.2367 at 5 p.m.  New York 
time. The single currency fell 1.6 percent to 97.79 yen. It
dropped to 97.76 yen, the lowest level since Jan. 18. The yen
gained 0.5 percent to 79.08 per dollar after touching 78.87, the
strongest since Feb. 17.  The shared currency fell to $1.2362, its weakest since July
2010. It reached $1.1877 in June that year, which was the lowest
level in four years, after escalating concern about  Greece  led
to the bloc’s first bailout. Since its inception in 1999, the
euro has traded as low as 82.30 U.S. cents, in 2000, and as high
as $1.6038 in July 2008.  ‘Downward Spiral’  The euro has depreciated 6.6 percent against the dollar
this month, the most since September, and slid 7.4 percent
versus the yen.  The yield on  German two-year  government notes fell to zero
for the first time before trading at 0.010 percent. The average
since the euro’s inception is 2.79 percent.  “The euro could go lower, maybe it can go down towards
$1.20,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at
Rabobank International in  London . “The question is, will the
downside risks turn into a downward spiral?”  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield rose as high as 6.70 percent,
approaching the 7 percent level that led to bailouts in Greece,
Ireland and  Portugal , after central bank Governor Miguel Angel
Fernandez Ordonez resigned a month early amid criticism over the
nationalization of Bankia group.  European Commission  The European Commission called for direct euro-bloc aid for
troubled banks and touted a Europe-wide deposit-guarantee system
and common bond issuance as antidotes to the debt crisis now
threatening to overwhelm Spain.  The commission, the European Union’s central regulator,
sided with Spain in proposing that the euro’s permanent bailout
fund inject cash to banks instead of channeling the money via
national governments. It also offered Spain extra time to
squeeze the  budget deficit .  “The focus was on Greece and the way the electorate
sentiment was going,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior
currency strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in New York.
“That’s now completely been pushed to the sidelines by concerns
about Spain.  Europe ’s just so broad and lacking in policy
coordination, that’s the problem.”  Greece’s New Democracy party, which supported the
international bailout and austerity measures, and the anti-
bailout Syriza party are tied for first place in the country’s
June 17 vote, according to an opinion poll by Pulse,
Naftemporiki newspaper reported.  The euro has declined 2.1 percent this year against nine
developed-market counterparts tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The dollar climbed 3.1 percent, the best
performer, while the yen was little changed.  Italian Borrowing  The yen surged at least 0.5 percent against all 16 of its
major peers tracked by Bloomberg after Italian borrowing costs
climbed and European confidence plummeted, boosting investor
demand for the safest assets.  Italy  sold 5.73 billion euros of bonds as yields rose from
the previous sale in April. The Treasury auctioned 10-year debt
at a rate of 6.03 percent, the highest since Jan. 30. Investors
bid for 1.4 times the amount offered, down from 1.48 last month.
Italy also sold five-year notes to yield 5.66 percent, compared
with 4.86 percent last month.  An index of executive and consumer  sentiment  among the euro
member nations fell to 90.6 from a revised 92.9 in April, the
European Commission said today. That’s the lowest since October
2009 and below the 91.9 forecast by economists, according to the
median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Technical Analysis  The euro faces resistance levels at $1.2305 and $1.2150,
according to Niall O’Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in New York. If it breaks below $1.20, he said, it
could depreciate further.  “There are going to be some psychological levels around
$1.20,” O’Connor said. “If we break it, this will be a new leg
down. Intraday breaks should be enough given price action these
past couple of days.”  The euro would stabilize if it rallied above $1.2510 to
$1.2515, where it traded yesterday, O’Connor said. It would
retrace higher if it appreciated above $1.2625.  The euro will strengthen to 104 yen by year-end, according
to the average forecast in a Bloomberg survey of financial
companies with the most recent projections given the heaviest
weightings.  ‘Fragile’ Sentiment  The Asia Dollar Index has lost 2.6 percent this month, the
biggest loss since September, as exchange data showed global
funds pulled $7.7 billion from South Korean, Taiwanese and
Indonesian stocks. The gauge dropped to as low as 113.80, the
weakest since Sept. 24, 2010.  “Sentiment toward emerging-market assets remains fragile
on concern over the Spanish banking sector,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong .
“We expect a risk-off environment, with currencies on the
defensive and lower rates.”  The Australian dollar fell for a second day, dropping 1.5
percent to 97.04 U.S. cents, after a government report showed
retail sales unexpectedly slid in April for the first time in 10
months.  Sales declined 0.2 percent from March, when they rose a
revised 1.1 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney.
The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 0.2 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
