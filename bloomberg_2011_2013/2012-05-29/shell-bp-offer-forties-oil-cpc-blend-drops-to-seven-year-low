Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc
failed to sell  North Sea  Forties crude even after lowering their
offers by 5 cents from yesterday. Trafigura Beheer BV didn’t
find buyers for CPC Blend at the lowest differential for more
than seven years.  Iraq  will reduce its daily exports of Basrah Light crude
from the  Persian Gulf  by 15 percent in the first half of June
compared with shipments in the previous two weeks, a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Shell didn’t manage to sell a Forties cargo for shipment on
June 10 to June 12 at parity to Dated Brent, while BP was unable
to sell the blend for June 13 to June 15 at 10 cents a barrel
more than the benchmark, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.  Trafigura failed to sell the grade for June 15 to June 17
at 26 cents more than Dated Brent, 6 cents above its offer
yesterday, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea crude trading typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before
the session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 10 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 31
cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Brent for July settlement traded at $107.23 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $107.46 yesterday. The August contract was at
$106.81, a discount of 42 cents to July.  A third Forties lot for loading  next month was delayed by
five days, according to three people with knowledge of the
shipping schedule.  The consignment number F0604 will be shipped on June 10 to
June 12, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential. It was originally planned for
June 6 to June 8 and was advanced by one day two weeks ago.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals for
delivery on June 8 to June 12 to Augusta,  Italy , at $1.15 a
barrel less than Dated Brent, 5 cents lower than its offer
yesterday, the survey showed.  Gunvor Group didn’t manage to buy the blend for June 16 to
June 20 delivery to Rotterdam at $2.25 a barrel less than Dated
Brent, according to the survey.  Urals was at $2.35 a barrel less than Dated Brent, up 5
cents from yesterday, the Bloomberg data showed.  Trafigura failed to sell 85,000 tons of CPC blend for
loading on June 11-15 at $2.50 less than Dated Brent, compared
with a discount of $2.30 yesterday, according to the survey.  The differential of CPC Blend to Dated Brent crude dropped
to a discount of $2.35 to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
yesterday, the lowest since April 6, 2005, according to data
from Platts.  “It is very much in line with what’s happening to naphtha-
rich, gasoline-rich crudes in the Mediterranean,” Ehsan Ul-Haq,
a senior market analyst with KBC Energy Economics in Walton-on-
Thames,  England , said by phone today. “In Europe, naphtha
cracks are the lowest since November while in  Asia , naphtha
cracks are the lowest in one and a half years,” he said,
referring to the spread between naphtha and crude.  Iraq will ship 19 cargoes from the Basrah Oil Terminal,
seven less than in the second half of May, according to the
plan. Exports will total 32.1 million barrels, or 2.14 million
barrels a day, compared with 2.53 million two weeks earlier.  The June program comprises 14 consignments of 2 million
barrels each, two 1 million-barrel lots, and two 600,000-barrel
and one 900,000-barrel.  OAO Transneft said it probably won’t fill the capacity
available for crude shipments from the nation’s  Baltic Sea  ports
next month.  Transneft will give  oil companies  until June 15 to request
additional loadings from three available slots at the port of
Ust-Luga and seven positions at Primorsk, Igor Dyomin, a
spokesman, said today by telephone. Some of the slots will be
filled, he said.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe crude was at a premium of $1.79
a barrel to Dated Brent, down from yesterday’s $1.82, Bloomberg
data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
