Everything Everywhere, the U.K.
venture of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , will
cross-sell products from both its Orange and T-Mobile brands in
stores.  “We’re going to be announcing plans to sell T-Mobile
products in Orange stores and Orange fixed-broadband at T-
Mobile,” Chief Executive Officer Olaf Swantee said in an
interview in London today. The company is not going to offer all
products in all stores, “but it will be big parts of the
portfolio,” he said.  Everything Everywhere, formed in a 2009 merger of  France
Telecom ’s Orange unit and Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile division,
last year said it will keep both brands to target different
types of consumers. The London-based company became the largest
mobile-phone operator in the U.K. after its merger, overtaking
Telefonica SA’s O2 unit.  “With 34 percent market share, you have to have a
segmented marketing strategy,” Swantee said today. “It doesn’t
necessarily mean you have to be multibrand.”  The company will invest 50 million pounds ($78 million) in
stores and training to implement the changes, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
