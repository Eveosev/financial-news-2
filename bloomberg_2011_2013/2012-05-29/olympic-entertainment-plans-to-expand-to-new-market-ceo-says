Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) , the
only publicly traded casino operator in eastern  Europe , plans to
expand to a new market as soon as this year, said Chief
Executive Officer Madis Jaager.  “We’re hoping to see our flag in a new country this
year,” Jaager said in a meeting with investors in Vilnius
today. The company currently operates in Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Belarus.  First-quarter profit of 5.1 million euros ($6.39 million)
was “a very good result,” Jaager said, adding that he doesn’t
“see any crisis yet because people now have more confidence in
spending.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
