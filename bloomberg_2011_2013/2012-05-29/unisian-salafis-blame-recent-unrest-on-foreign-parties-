A Tunisian Salafi party blamed what
it said were “foreign parties” for recent violence that has
stirred new unrest in the North African nation.  Hundreds of Salafis, who adhere to an ultraconservative
interpretation of Islam, last week forcibly shut bars and liquor
shops in two western regions in the country. The incidents were
condemned by Tunisia’s Islamist-led government, and stoked
worries that they could threaten the country’s long-standing
secularist background and undercut the vital  tourism industry  as
Tunisia struggles to revive its economy.  While condemning the violence, Ridha Belhaj, the spokesman
of the Salafist Ettahrir Party, told reporters that “some
foreign parties are trying to infiltrate” the Salafi groups to
“create a situation that serves their agenda.” He didn’t
elaborate or say whom he blamed for the incidents.  Islamist Prime Minister Hamadi Jbeli has said his
government won’t close bars and wine shops.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jihen Laghmari in Tunisia
