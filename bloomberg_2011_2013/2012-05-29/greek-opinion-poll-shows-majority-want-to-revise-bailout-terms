Most Greeks want to see terms for an
international financial rescue revised, according to an opinion
poll conducted weeks before a second general election on June
17.  Nearly eight in 10, or 77 percent, of the 1,600 Greeks
surveyed by GPO for Athens-based Mega TV, said the terms of the
bailout should be revised. The poll results were broadcast on
Mega TV. Most Greeks, or 81 percent, said they wanted to remain
in the single currency, the poll showed.  More than half, or 52.4 percent, said they should stay in
the euro if they were forced to accept the current austerity
measures accompanying the bailout while 44.5 percent said they
shouldnâ€™t. The poll showed Greeks divided on whether they would
leave the euro area, with 48 percent saying there was a low
possibility compared with 45 percent saying the possibility was
high.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
