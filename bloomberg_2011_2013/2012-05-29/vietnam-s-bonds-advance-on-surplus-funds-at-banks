Vietnam ’s bonds gained, driving down
yields by the most in more than two weeks, on speculation banks
have surplus cash to invest in debt. The dong was stable.  Vietnam’s money supply has risen 4.5 percent this year,
according to a government statement distributed at a briefing in
Hanoi on May 27. Bank lending fell in the first five months,
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said on a radio broadcast
yesterday, without giving a figure.  “Banks have a lot of abundant cash but they can’t lend out
to companies for fear of high credit risks,” said Nguyen Tuan Phong, the Hanoi-based fixed-income manager at Bao Viet Fund
Management Co., a unit of Vietnam’s biggest insurer. “So they
use the funds to buy  government bonds .”  Yields on five-year notes declined nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 9.58 percent, the biggest drop since
May 10, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  dropped five basis
points to 1.56 percent, the lowest level since June 2009 when
Bloomberg started compiling the data.  The dong traded at 20,870 per dollar as of 2:28 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,862 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the  reference rate 
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
