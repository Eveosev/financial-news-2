Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the Japanese TV
maker that eliminated 36,000 jobs last fiscal year, rose in
Tokyo trading after the company said it’s considering
restructuring operations and cutting jobs.  The stock  gained  as much as 3.3 percent to 533 yen and
traded at 526 yen as of 10:06 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
while  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.5
percent.  Panasonic, the biggest employer among companies on the
Tokyo bourse, may cut jobs at its headquarters after
streamlining operations at production units, Yuko Hosaka, a
Tokyo-based spokeswoman, said today. The Osaka-based company
said last year it was closing down display plants and trimming
the number of workers at its unprofitable semiconductor unit.  The stock sank to its lowest level in 34 years on May 11,
when the company  forecast  a profit that missed analyst
estimates. Net income will probably total 50 billion yen ($629
million) in the year started April 1, from a record loss of 772
billion yen in the previous year, the company said that day.  The projection missed the 106 billion yen average of 18
 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  In February, the maker of Viera TVs and Lumix cameras
joined rival Sony Corp. in nominating a younger  leader  amid
worsening earnings as the electronics makers struggle to turn
around TV operations and cope with the stronger yen.  Panasonic is promoting Kazuhiro Tsuga, its 55-year-old
chief of audiovisual products, to replace President Fumio Ohtsubo, 66, as the company tries to speed up reforms. The
change is set to take place after getting shareholder approval
at the June 27 general meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
