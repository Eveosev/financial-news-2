The Scissor Sisters are back. They
are pouring themselves into Lycra costumes, jiving like there’s
no tomorrow and disco has never been away.  At a time when 1970s dance has been in the headlines, with
the deaths of Donna Summer and Robin Gibb, the Scissor Sisters
are pointing the way for Rihanna, Lady Gaga, maybe even Madonna.  “Magic Hour” is actually 44 minutes and isn’t all pure
magic. It peaks early with “Only the Horses,” a relentlessly
boppy single. It’s co-produced by Calvin Harris, a man known for
his ludicrous claim to have invented disco.  The  New York  band can make a genuine case for reinventing
disco for 2012 with the bubbly opener “Baby Come Home” with
drums like popping champagne corks.  Still, the incessant beat gets irritating. So does the
upbeat philosophy that having a good time and dancing every
night until dawn will cure all ills. Rating: ***.  Neil Young ’s “Americana” also has a misleading title. The
guitar thrashes could just as much be called “Canadiana” and
conclude with Young’s ramshackle version of the U.K. national
anthem “God Save the Queen,” just in time for Elizabeth II’s
diamond jubilee.  Along the way, Young attacks folk classics such as “Gallows
Pole,” “Clementine” and “This Land Is Your Land.” It’s often as
bad as it sounds. Just now and again it’s full of joy in Young’s
first collaboration with Crazy Horse since “Greendale” in 2003.  Fans will lap it up. Rating: **.  Rock   stars  of a certain age often take on the great
American songbook like Young is doing. Here comes Willie Nelson,
79.  “Heroes,” Nelson’s first release under a new Sony Music
contract, is nicely understated with country classics such as
“My Window Faces the South” and “My Home in San Antone”
alongside a cover of Coldplay’s “The Scientist.” Rating: ***.  Welsh singer  Tom Jones  tries a similar trick with “Spirit
in the Room.”  You have to laugh at his take on  Leonard Cohen ’s “Tower of
Song.” Originally sung in on off-key slur, the line “I was born
with the gift of a golden voice” goes somewhere else here. Jones
really has an amazing pop baritone, and he knows it.  His last, “Praise & Blame,” was good. Sir Tom’s latest is a
notch better. Rating: ***½.  Regina Spektor’s “What We Saw From the Cheap Seats” is her
best yet. The 32-year-old U.S. singer-songwriter’s music isn’t
the easiest of listens, with quirky vocals, abrupt changes of
direction and lyrics so unhinged they make Tori Amos look
positively normal.  For all that, Spektor is taking risks and improves on
“Begin to Hope” from 2006. A song such as “Firewood” is
astonishing. Rating: ****.  Information:  http://www.scissorsisters.com ,

in the U.S. on June 5, as is Neil Young on Warner.  Single download fees vary across services. The albums are
priced from about $12 in the U.S. and 9 pounds in the U.K.
