Chinese solar panel shipments to
 North America  may be cut by 75 percent this year because of an
anti-dumping ruling by the U.S. Commerce Department, according
to  IHS Inc. (IHS)   The cut in Chinese supplies may reduce North America’s
total panel imports by 45 percent, driving up prices for the
modules, El Segundo, California-based IHS said in an e-mailed
 statement . The consulting company had estimated Chinese
manufacturers would account for 2 gigawatts of imports, a figure
it says may now drop by as much as 1.5 gigawatts.  “The Commerce Department action will have a major impact
on the North American solar market, constraining supplies and
driving up prices for modules and systems,” Mike Sheppard, a
photovoltaics analyst with IHS, said in the statement. “The
penalties are likely to add as much as 12 percent to the cost of
solar modules, lowering the average return on investment for
solar systems in the region by as much as 2.5 percent.”  Chinese solar companies criticized the Commerce
Department’s May 17 preliminary finding that they improperly
benefit from government subsidies and sell solar cells below
cost. The department is scheduled to make its final
determination on the solar tariffs in early October.  The U.S. unit of  SolarWorld AG (SWV) , which brought the
complaint, said it was responding to thousands of job losses due
to Chinese trade practices. At least four U.S. solar
manufacturers filed for bankruptcy in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
