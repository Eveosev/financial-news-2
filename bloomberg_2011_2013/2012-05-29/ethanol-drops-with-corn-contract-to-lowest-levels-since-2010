Ethanol futures dropped along with
corn to the lowest levels since 2010 amid high stockpiles of the
biofuel.  Prices fell for the fourth time in six days as corn, the
main feedstock used to make the fuel additive in the U.S.,
reached the lowest level since December 2010 in intraday
trading. Crude oil fell 10 cents to $90.76.  “It’s mainly the corn market as to why ethanol’s down,”
said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
in  Chicago . “Corn definitely has a bigger impact than the
basically unchanged crude oil market.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 4.2 cents, or 2
percent, to $2.042 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest settlement since Oct. 7, 2010.  Ethanol  supply  surged to 21.4 million barrels for the week
ending May 18, the steepest gain since Jan. 27, according to the
Energy Department.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 16 cents, or 2.8
percent, to close at $5.625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. It was the lowest settlement for a most-active corn
contract since January 2011.  Corn is used to make ethanol, with one bushel distilling
into at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  held at $2.10 a
gallon and in Chicago the additive decreased 3 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.04, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 3.5 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $2.10 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel decreased 5
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.275.  To contact the reporter on this story:
