Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko plans to discuss expanding Belarusian Potash Co., the
trading arm of  Russia ’s OAO Uralkali, with  Vladimir Putin  when
his Russian counterpart visits this week.  Lukashenko is looking at “intensifying our joint work on
selling potash fertilizers, as well as potentially expanding
this company and assigning it more functions for selling
nitrogen, phosphoric fertilizers, involving volumes from Russian
companies,” he said in an e-mailed statement today after
meeting with Belarusian Potash Director-General Valery Ivanov.  Belarusian Potash is a joint venture between Uralkali, the
world’s largest producer of the crop nutrient by output, and the
Belarusian state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
