Chevron Corp. (CVX)  crews stopped the
discharge of steam and oil droplets from a well at the Cymric
field in California yesterday.  The leak was stopped about 2:30 p.m. local time and the
well is being plugged with cement, Russell Johnson, a spokesman,
said in an e-mail from Houston. Cleanup will begin after a site
inspection.  The well began spewing a mixture of steam and oil at about
10:30 a.m. May 27. No one was injured in the incident and  San
Ramon , California-based Chevron hasn’t said how much oil was
spilled.  The Cymric field, in California’s San Joaquin Valley,
produces mostly heavy crude, which is forced out of the ground
using steam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
