Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS) , a maker of signal
processing chips, climbed to an 11-year high on speculation it
will win more orders from its largest customer,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   Cirrus  rose  $1.94, or 7.1 percent, to $29.39 at 4 p.m. in
New York, the highest since Jan. 24, 2001. The stock has surged
85 percent this year.  The shares gained on optimism Apple will proceed with a
rumored television project and that Cirrus, which supplies chips
for iPads, iPhones and iMacs, will get more orders, said Tore Svanberg, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in San Francisco.  “It’s pure speculation,” said Svanberg, who recommends
buying Cirrus stock. “They are basically trading in line with
whatever Apple is doing.”  Apple will provide Austin, Texas-based Cirrus with about 80
percent of its revenue in the second half of the year, he
estimates. Apple currently accounts for about 53 percent of
Cirrus sales, according to Bloomberg’s  supply chain  analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
