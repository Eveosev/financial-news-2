CLS Bank International , which settles
about $4.5 trillion in foreign-exchange transactions daily,
received a letter from U.S. regulators including it among
entities proposed for designation as systemically important,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The London-based bank, which settles transactions in 17
currencies, joins clearinghouses owned by  CME Group Inc. (CME) ;
Intercontinental Exchange Inc.; OCC, formerly the Options
Clearing Corp.; and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. in
receiving the designation from the Financial Stability Oversight
Council. CLS’s inclusion was confirmed by the person, who
requested anonymity because the decisions haven’t been publicly
disclosed.  Being labeled systemically important moves the so-called
financial market utilities closer to heightened supervision
under the Dodd-Frank Act. The designations are subject to appeal
and may be completed “as early as this summer,” said Anthony Coley, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesman.  The Clearing House Payments Co. LLC, which operates a
cross-border and domestic wire-transfer system, also received a
letter of designation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
