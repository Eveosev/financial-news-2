European banksâ€™ reluctance to lend to
each other held near a three-week low, according to a money-
market indicator.  Prices in the forward market for the three-month euro
interbank offered rate relative to overnight indexed swaps,
known as the  FRA/OIS spread , was 32 basis points at 8:23 a.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure was
31 yesterday, the lowest since May 7.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held at
the lowest levels in more than two weeks. The three-month cross-
currency  basis swap  was little changed at 45 basis points below
Euribor, the cheapest since May 11.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 63 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Euribor/OIS spread was little changed at 39 basis
points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 742 billion euros ($932
billion) from 760 billion euros on May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
