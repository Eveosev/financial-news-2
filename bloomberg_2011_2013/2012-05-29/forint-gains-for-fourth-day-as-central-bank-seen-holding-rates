The forint gained the most in a month
and Hungarian bonds weakened as the country’s central bank held
the European Union’s highest benchmark rate unchanged following
a delay in obtaining International Monetary Fund aid.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.9 percent to 296.6 per
euro by 4:57 p.m. in Budapest, the biggest advance on a closing
basis since April 25. The yield on the government’s benchmark
three-year bonds rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 8.345 percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank left the two-week deposit rate at 7
percent for a fifth month today, meeting the projection of all
23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Hungary has failed to
start talks on IMF aid for six months because of a dispute on
legislation affecting the central bank’s independence.  It’s “difficult to see rate moves in the near term until
we get real progress on the IMF front,” Timothy Ash, a London-
based strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote by
e-mail after the rate decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
