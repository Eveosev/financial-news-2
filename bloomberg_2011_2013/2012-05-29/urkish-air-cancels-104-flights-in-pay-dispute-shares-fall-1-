Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the carrier
known as  Turkish Airlines , canceled 104 flights today due to
industrial action, Transport Minister Binali Yildirim said. The
shares declined.  Hackers also attacked Turkish Airlinesâ€™ website though
there was no damage to infrastructure, Yildirim told reporters
in Ankara. The website was down as of 11:51 a.m. in Istanbul.  Workers at Turkish Airlines are on a go-slow today due to a
proposal in parliament to ban strikes in civil aviation, labor
union Hava-Is said on its website. Talks on pay for 2011 and
2012 with the company are continuing and a decision about wider
industrial action is being considered, it said.  Turkish Airlines fell as much as 0.8 percent to 2.54 liras
on the  Istanbul Stock Exchange . It was unchanged at 11:51 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
