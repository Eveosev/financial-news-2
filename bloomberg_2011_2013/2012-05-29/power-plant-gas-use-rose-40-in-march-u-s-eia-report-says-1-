U.S.  power plants  increased natural
gas use by 40 percent in March from a year earlier as low prices
prompted a switch from coal, the Energy Department said today.
Coal’s share fell by 20 percent.  Gas used in electricity generation rose to 703.5 billion
cubic feet in March from 503.9 billion a year earlier, the
department’s Energy Information Administration said today in its
 Electric Power Monthly . The increase represents 6.4 billion
cubic feet a day of additional gas demand during the month,
versus an average daily gain of 5.8 billion in February and 3.6
billion in January.  The shift from coal to natural gas among electric
generators was most notable in the Southeast, Central and mid-
Atlantic states.  “This trend is likely to persist in the short term as low
natural  gas prices  make natural gas-fired generation more
economical,” the department  said .  Coal use fell to 57.6 million tons from 72.3 million in
March 2011. Supplies “as measured by days of burn were above 80
days for the third straight month in March as declining coal
consumption drove coal stockpile increases,” the department
said.  Companies choose which power plants to run primarily based
on their operating costs, with fuel accounting for the lion’s
share, according to the department.  Power Generation Drops  U.S. power generation declined by 2.9 percent in March to
309.7 million megawatt-hours from a year earlier, department
data show. Gas-fired plants accounted for 30 percent of the
electricity produced during the month, up from 21 percent in
March 2011, while coal’s share declined to 34 percent from 42
percent.  The average price for natural gas at the  Henry Hub  in
 Louisiana , the delivery point for New York futures, dropped for
the eighth straight month, the department said.  Gas  at the
benchmark hub averaged $2.22 per million British thermal units
in March compared with $2.85 per million Btu for Central
Appalachian coal, according to department data.  Natural gas futures declined 49 cents, or 19 percent, in
March to $2.126 per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Gas today fell 13.9 cents, or 5.4 percent, to settle
at $2.429. Next-month futures, which are down 19 percent this
year, slid to a 10-year intraday low of $1.902 on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
