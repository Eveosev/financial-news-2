The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from default increased in the Asia-Pacific
region outside  Japan , according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 2.5 basis points
to 196 basis points as of 10:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The benchmark has traded this month
between 154.5 and a five-and-a-half month high of 201 basis
points on May 18, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside of Japan advanced 2 basis points to 196.5 as
of 8:23 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The index is poised to rise 31.6 basis points from
April 30, according to CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index decreased 2 basis points to
186 basis points as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The gauge reached 217.3 on May 18, the highest
since Oct. 5, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
