OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, lost a lawsuit against a retail customer in connection
with foreign-currency calculation methods used for the repayment
of a Swiss-franc mortgage, news website  azenpenzem.hu  said,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The lender initiated the lawsuit after a financial
arbitration board operating under the auspices of the financial
market  regulator  ruled that OTP should pay back about 600,000
forint ($2,521) in foreign-exchange differences, the news
website said, citing Istvan Binder, a spokesman for the market
watchdog.  The court’s ruling, which upheld the arbitration board’s
verdict, is binding, the portal said, adding that four similar
cases are currently under way.  To contact the reporter on this story:
