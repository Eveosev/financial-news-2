Japan ’s auction of 0.1 percent two-
year notes drew the strongest demand since June 2005 even after
technical difficulties delayed the sale by 2 1/2 hours.  The Ministry of Finance’s 2.5 trillion yen ($31 billion)
sale drew bids worth 9.79 times the amount of debt on offer.
 Bank of Japan (8301)  staff members involved in the process had entered
incorrect bid ceilings for some dealers, causing system errors,
the central bank told reporters. This was the first problem at
an auction since December 2008, the bank said.  It was the first sale of 2-year notes since the Bank of
Japan on April 27 added 10 trillion yen to its planned purchases
of government debt and extended the maximum maturity of notes
bought to three years, from two years.  “The two-year auction results were unmistakably solid,”
said Jun Kawakami, a market economist at Mizuho Securities Co.,
one of the 25 primary dealers obliged to bid at government
offerings. “Market participants are very confident in the
demand-supply situation in shorter-term securities, so the
delays due to technical difficulties didn’t have any impact.”  Two-year yields have been unchanged at 0.095 percent since
May 16, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. Ten-year rates dropped 2 1/2
basis points to 0.85 percent from yesterday, while 20-year
yields declined three basis points to 1.65 percent.  The new notes will be issued on June 15. The securities had
a lowest accepted price of 100, higher than the median estimate
of 99.995 in a Bloomberg News survey of 14 traders.  “For those who expect additional monetary easing, a 0.1
percent note is still a buy,” said Tomohisa Fujiki, an
interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas Securities Japan Ltd. in
 Tokyo .  To contact the reporters on this story:
