State-run Rosneftegaz, where former
first deputy prime minister Igor Sechin was named as chairman
this month, may get control over Federal Grid Co. and  OAO MRSK
Holding (MRSK) ,  Kommersant  reported, citing people familiar with the
situation.  The state proposed the same directors to the boards of
Federal Grid,  Russia ’s monopoly for high-voltage power
transmission lines and MRSK Holding, Russia’s largest
electricity distribution company, newspaper said.  Following this both companies may merge with a newly
created unit in which Rosneftegaz will have 75 percent,
