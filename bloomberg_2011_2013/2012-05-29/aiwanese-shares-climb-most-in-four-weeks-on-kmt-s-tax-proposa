Taiwan’s  stocks  rose, poised for the
biggest advance in four weeks, after the ruling party proposed a
taxation system that seeks to ease the burden on individual
investors of a tax on trading gains.  The  Taiex (TWSE)  gained 2.3 percent to 7,299.89 as of 11:16 a.m.
in Taipei, headed for the largest jump since May 2, after the
official Central News Agency reported the Kuomintang party is
drafting a dual stock taxation system. Individual investors can
choose to declare their  capital gains  through stock trading as a
personal income tax, or substitute the capital-gains tax with a
stock transaction tax to be adjusted according to stock market
performance, the agency reported.  “Investors are obviously much happier with this proposal
compared with the previous capital-gains tax plan,” Robyn Hsu,
a  fund manager  at Capital Investment Trust, who helps to oversee
about $6.7 billion, said by telephone in Taipei.  Under a plan that was approved by Cabinet on April 26,
individuals who earn more than NT$4 million ($135,000) annually
from trading will incur a tax of 15 percent to 20 percent. That
proposal was itself a less rigorous plan after an earlier
version helped drag the Taiex down as much as 12 percent since
March 28, when a government panel held its first discussion on a
capital-gains tax.  The Taiex’s advance was the biggest among Asian benchmark
indexes today.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , the stock
with the biggest representation on the gauge, increased 1.1
percent, while  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , the second-
largest stock, climbed 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
