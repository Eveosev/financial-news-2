Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ,  Europe ’s largest
mail carrier, said the German government has demanded repayment
of 298 million euros ($374 million) in subsidies that the
European Commission said breached antitrust legislation.  The German postal operator filed an appeal against the
January ruling with the  European Court  of Justice, the Bonn-
based company said in an e-mailed statement. “The ruling is
incomprehensible and has no basis in fact,” it said.  The commission had estimated the repayment at 500 million
euros to 1 billion euros after an investigation into payments
from the German government to cover pension costs at Deutsche
Post that may have hampered rivals who paid 10 percent to 15
percent more in contributions.  The company “has effectively borne significantly lower
social contributions than its private competitors for services
which were open to competition,” such as parcel delivery and
retail banking, the regulator said in January.  The EU probe broadened the scope of an investigation that
started in 2007 into “all public measures, such as transfers of
public money and tariff income” granted to Deutsche Post and
predecessor Postdienst since 1989. The prior probe was prompted
by complaints from Atlanta-based  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the
world’s largest package-delivery company.  Deutsche Post will record the payment only on its balance
sheet this year as it expects the ruling to be voided, the
company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
