Tropical Depression Beryl will
probably pick up speed overnight as it moves across southern
Georgia and be back in the Atlantic by midday tomorrow, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at about 4:40 p.m.
local time.  The rain-laden system, with maximum sustained winds of 30
miles (48 kilometers) an hour, may regain tropical storm status
as it hugs the coast of  South Carolina  and North Carolina on its
way to the ocean, the center said. Beryl was 40 miles north of
Waycross, Georgia, and moving northeast at 5 mph.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
