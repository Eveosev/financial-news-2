President  Barack Obama  said there is
“no doubt” the government needs new revenue from closing tax
“loopholes” and limiting deductions, along with enacting
spending cuts.  There’s “no reason why we can’t have really strong growth
in 2013,” the president said in an interview with CBS
television today before the network’s Super Bowl broadcast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
