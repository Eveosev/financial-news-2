Defending champion the Czech Republic
and the U.S. won in the opening round of tennis’s Davis Cup,
while 2012 runner-up Spain was ousted by Canada.  Tomas Berdych beat Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6
(7-5) in Geneva to give the Czechs an unassailable 3-1 lead over
Switzerland in the best-of five contest. The U.S. beat Brazil
3-2 as  Sam Querrey  came back from a set down to beat Thiago Alves 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) in Jacksonville.  Canada advanced past the opening round for the first time
with a 3-2 win over Spain, which was without its top four
singles players --  David Ferrer ,  Rafael Nadal ,  Nicolas Almagro 
and  Fernando Verdasco . Milos Raonic won his second singles match
of the weekend, beating Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in
Vancouver as Canada advanced to a home quarterfinal against
Italy on April 5-7.  Italy was a 3-2 victor over Croatia, while Kazakhstan beat
Austria 3-1 in first-round matchups at the top team event in
men’s tennis.  Serbia, France and Argentina yesterday secured quarterfinal
spots by taking unassailable leads against Belgium, Israel and
Germany, respectively.  The  Czech Republic  yesterday snapped a 1-1 tie in its match
against Switzerland as Berdych and Lukas Rosol beat Wawrinka and
Marco Chiudinelli 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 24-22 in seven hours
and two minutes. The fifth set took over 3 1/2 hours in the
longest match in the competition’s history.  After Berdych’s win over Wawrinka today sent the Czechs
through, Switzerland won the last singles match to make the
final score 3-2.  Decisive Match  Querrey’s decisive victory for the U.S., a record 32-time
Davis Cup winner, came after  John Isner  had lost to Brazil’s
Thomaz Bellucci to tie the contest at two matches apiece.  The Americans will next face Serbia in the final eight.  Canada’s Raonic, ranked 15th in the ATP rankings, followed
up his four-set win over Spain’s Albert Ramos by dropping nine
games against No. 82 Garcia-Lopez, who Spanish captain Alex Corretja selected to replace Marcel Granollers an hour before
the match.  Fabio Fognini won Italy’s decisive match 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4
against Ivan Dodig in Turin today after Croatia’s  Marin Cilic 
had beaten Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-3, 7-5.  Kazakhstan guaranteed victory over Austria in Astana,
taking a 3-1 lead when Andrey Golubev beat Jurgen Melzer 4-6,
6-3, 6-4, 6-2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
