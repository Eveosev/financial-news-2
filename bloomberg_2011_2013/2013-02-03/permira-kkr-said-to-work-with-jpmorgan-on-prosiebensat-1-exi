Permira Advisers LLP and  KKR & Co. (KKR) 
are working with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  on options for their
controlling stake in  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) , including a sale,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The buyout firms, which own 53 percent of the German
broadcaster, may exit this year by selling their stake to
another company or on the market, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the discussions are private.
ProSiebenSat.1 fell 3.3 percent today in Frankfurt, valuing the
holding that may be sold at 2.9 billion euros ($3.9 billion).  “We could see a fall in the share price when the
controlling stakes are sold on the market and there aren’t
enough buyers,” said Stefan Wimmer, an analyst at Bankhaus
Metzler in Frankfurt, who recommends buying ProSiebenSat.1
shares. “A strategic shareholder who keeps the asset for a
longer while would be good news to investors.”  Potential bidders may include  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , Comcast
Corp. and  News Corp. (NWSA) , Financial Times reported. ProSiebenSat.1,
based in Unterfoehring near Munich, is trying to offset
shrinking advertising revenue by pushing digital and on-demand
offerings.  Chief Executive Officer Thomas Ebeling on Jan. 30 sold
300,000 shares for about 7.5 million euros, the company said
today. The preferred stock dropped from the highest level in
5 1/2 years, declining 85.5 cents to close at 25 euros in
Frankfurt trading today.  RTL Sale  Julian Geist, a spokesman for ProSiebenSat.1, and a
representative for New York-based KKR declined to comment. A
Permira official in Germany couldn’t be reached for comment.  The buyout firms invested in ProSiebenSat.1 in 2006,
agreeing to purchase a 50.5 percent stake for 3.1 billion euros
from U.S. billionaire Haim Saban’s German Media Partners LP.  Now ProSiebenSat.1 and rivals such as Bertelsmann SE’s RTL
Group SA are facing a declining TV-advertising market that’s
prompting them to seek new avenues of growth. Bertelsmann said
last week it plans to sell a 2 billion euro-stake in RTL as it
looks for takeover targets to accelerate growth.  In December, ProSiebenSat.1 agreed to sell its SBS Nordic
unit, which included TV networks in Norway, Sweden,  Denmark  and
 Finland , for $1.7 billion. On announcing the deal, the company
said that at the next annual general meeting investors would
vote on converting preferred shares into exchange-listed common
stock, which would facilitate an exit for KKR and Permira.  Preferred Stock  KKR and Permira own 18 percent of the preferred shares,
which don’t carry  voting rights , and 88 percent of the voting
common stock, giving them a 53 percent stake in the company,
according to ProSiebenSat.1’s  website . Dutch publisher  Telegraaf
Media Groep NV (TMG)  owns the remaining 12 percent of preferred
shares.  Private-equity firms pool money from investors with a
mandate to buy companies, overhaul and then sell them, and
return the funds with a profit. The firms typically use debt to
finance the deals and amplify returns.  Permira, started in 1985, advises funds with committed
capital totaling about $26 billion. Since 1997, more than 30
percent of investments have been in technology, media and
telecommunications companies. The London-based buyout firm in
October agreed to buy Ancestry.com Inc. in a transaction valued
at about $1.6 billion, gaining the world’s largest family-
history website.  KKR was started by  Henry Kravis , Jerome Kohlberg and  George
Roberts  in 1976. The company had $66.3 billion in assets under
management as of Sept. 30, according to its website.  Axel Springer  AG, Europe’s biggest newspaper publisher,
might face antitrust issues if it decided to invest in
ProSiebenSat.1. Before KKR and Permira acquired their stake,
Axel Springer’s 2005 takeover bid for ProSiebenSat.1 was
rejected by German media regulators.  To contact the reporters on this story:
