Forecasts of snow and rain across
China threaten to disrupt the travel plans of millions of
Chinese heading home for the Lunar New Year holidays that start
Feb. 9, the  national weather agency  warned today.  Snow is expected in northeastern provinces this week with
snow and sleet in western Xinjiang and parts of central China,
the agency said in an e-mailed report. The nation’s rail network
was due to carry 5.86 million holiday travelers today, the
Railways Ministry said on its  website .  Rain and snow will have an adverse impact on the peak
period, the China Meteorological Administration said, warning of
slippery conditions for road travel. The 2012 Lunar New Year
period generated more than 3 billion passenger trips by Chinese,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported last year.  Five road accidents killed a total of 58 people in the past
two days, including two involving overloaded vehicles that
veered off the roads, Xinhua reported. Twelve people died when a
coach designed for 19 passengers and carrying 34 overturned and
crashed in Guizhou province yesterday, Xinhua said.  Eighty-six flights were canceled and 162 delayed at the
 Beijing Capital International Airport  as of 1:50 p.m. today,
with snow continuing into the evening expected to further affect
operations, according to the airport’s website.  Authorities canceled or planned alternative routes for 13
coach lines today, mainly those leaving Beijing via mountain
roads, Xinhua said in a separate report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
