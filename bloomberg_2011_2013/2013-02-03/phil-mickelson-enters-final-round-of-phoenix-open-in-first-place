Phil Mickelson fired a 7-under 64 to
match the tournament record of 24-under 189 for the lowest 56-
hole score at the Phoenix Open.  Mickelson, who missed setting a U.S. PGA Tour record for
three rounds of play by one stroke, tied the tournament mark set
by Mark Calcavecchia in 2001. He holds a six-stroke lead over
Brandt Snedeker at TPC Scottsdale in Scottsdale, Arizona.  “I know how good Snedeker is and how hot he can get with a
putter,” Mickelson told reporters yesterday. “He can make
birdie from just about anywhere. He’s going to make a run
tomorrow. I, hopefully, will be able to keep pace.”  Mickelson has been in the lead since he finished the first
round. If he wins today, it will be his fourth wire-to-wire
victory and first since the 2006 BellSouth Classic.  “To me, the wire-to-wire isn’t that important except for
now I’m three rounds and the fourth one is kind of the more
important one,” Mickelson said.  Snedeker had a 65 yesterday to finish the first three
rounds at 18-under.  “Phil is playing pretty unbelievable,” Snedeker said. “I
will have to go at some pins and make some putts early and be
more aggressive than I probably normally would be.”  Padraig Harrington and Ryan Moore were tied for third at 16
under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
