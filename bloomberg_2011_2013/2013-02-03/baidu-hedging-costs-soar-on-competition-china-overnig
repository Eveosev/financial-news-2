Options traders are paying the most
in two years to protect against swings in  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  relative to
rival  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  on concern rising costs and competition will
erode profit for the owner of  China ’s biggest search engine.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
one-month contracts closest to Baidu’s American depositary
receipts was 5 points higher than that for Beijing-based Sohu
Jan. 29, the widest gap since January 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Both companies report fourth-quarter earnings
today, and Baidu posted the smallest jump since the end of
December last week. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of
Chinese U.S.-listed shares rallied 1.4 percent.  While Sohu, which derives most of its income from online
games, is expected to post 46 percent profit growth this year,
Baidu’s net income will rise 24 percent, about half the pace of
2012, according to average analyst estimates for both stocks.
 Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) , a Beijing-based software developer
that started a search engine in August, may siphon advertising
from Baidu, hurting profitability as they spend more money
luring mobile-phone Internet users, according to 86Research Ltd.  “Negative sentiment toward Baidu mainly comes from the
competition with Qihoo,” Ming Zhao, founder of 86Research Ltd.,
the Beijing-based equity research firm, said in a phone
interview Feb. 1. “Higher costs to offer search on mobile
devices will hurt its profit margin.”  Search Traffic  Implied volatility for one-month options closest to Baidu’s
ADRs has risen 18 percent from a Jan. 18 low to 45 Jan. 31,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. During that time, implied 
volatility for Sohu advanced 7.7 percent to 42.  Baidu’s ADRs rose 0.3 percent to $108.61 Feb. 1, extending
their weekly advance to 0.6 percent. The Bloomberg China-US
gauge rose to 101 last week, led by  Huaneng Power International
Inc. (600011)  and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co.  Beijing-based Baidu forecast Oct. 29 that fourth-quarter sales 
will be between 6.16 billion  yuan  ($987 million) to 6.35 billion 
yuan, short of the 6.41 billion-yuan average of 13 analysts’ 
estimates compiled by Bloomberg at the time. The ADRs have lost 
4.6 percent since the guidance was issued.  Qihoo has picked up about 10 percent of China’s Internet 
search traffic, according to Internet consulting group iResearch,
surpassing Sohu’s Sougou search engine. Qihoo, which also owns
China’s most-used web browser, is teaming up with Google Inc. in
online advertising, which may add $140 million in revenue this
year, according to a Dec. 31 note from Wedge Partners Corp.  ‘Downside Risks’  ADRs of Beijing-based Qihoo slid 4.7 percent last week to
$30.50 after surging 89 percent in 2012.  Sohu, which also operates web search and video sites,
slipped 0.1 percent last week to $49.22, for a 4 percent
increase this year. The Beijing-based company may report today
that net income declined 21 percent from a year earlier to $21.2
million, according to the average of seven analysts' estimates.  Huaneng Power, the largest electricity producer in China,
soared 9 percent last week to $40.65, the steepest
weekly gain since June 2012. The Beijing-based company said its
2012 net income will have risen more than 340 percent, according 
to a preliminary earnings statement issued to the Shanghai Stock
Exchange Jan. 30.  Yingli Green , the world’s biggest silicon-based panel maker 
by capacity, climbed 5.9 percent last week to $3.05, extending its
gain this year to 30 percent.  The Baoding, China-based company will see gross margin rise
to as much as 20 percent this year should module prices rebound 
and production costs drop, Chief Financial Officer Bryan Li said in
an interview Jan. 29.  Indexes Climb  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., advanced 0.8 percent to
$41.82, for a weekly gain of 1.8 percent. The  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  rallied 1 percent to a five-year high of 1,513.17 on
Feb. 1 as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 14,000
after data showed the U.S. added jobs in January and
manufacturing expanded.  The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a
basket of companies that gained U.S. listings after buying firms
that already trade, jumped 2 percent last week to 80.12, rising
the most in three weeks.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  climbed 0.7 percent
to 12,215.03 on Feb. 1, ending the week up 1.8 percent. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares surged 1.4
percent to 2,419.02, gaining 5.6 percent in the week for the
steepest rally since October 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
