Scotland’s Stephen Gallacher scored a
final-round 71, 1-under par, to win golf’s Omega Dubai Desert
Classic by three shots.  Gallacher, who had an eagle two on the par-four 16th hole,
finished on 22-under par, ahead of South Africa’s Richard Sterne
in second. Felipe Aguilar of Chile and Denmark’s Thorbjorn
Olesen were joint third on 17-under.  It was Gallacher’s second European Tour victory, the first
coming in the 2004 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. He picked
up a prize of about 310,000 euros ($424,000) today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
