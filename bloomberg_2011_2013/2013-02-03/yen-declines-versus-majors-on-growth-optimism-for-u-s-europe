The yen rose against the euro and the
majority of its major peers as technical indicators signaled the
pace of recent weakening has been too quick.  Japan’s currency halted losses against the dollar after
completing on Feb. 1 a record 12 straight weeks of declines,
triggered by speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will boost monetary
stimulus. The euro traded 0.6 percent from a 14-month high
versus the greenback before a report predicted to show  investor
confidence  improved in the region.  Australia ’s dollar rose
before the nation’s central bank meets on policy tomorrow.  The yen “can’t keep weakening at the same speed, so it’s
natural to see a correction,” said  Daisaku Ueno , a senior
foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The yen weakness story
remains on expectations that the BOJ will keep its accommodative
stance for a long time.”  The yen rose 0.3 percent to 126.29 per euro as of 7:17 a.m.
in  London  from last week, when it fell as low as 126.97, the
least since April 2010. It gained 0.1 percent to 92.69 per
dollar, after touching 92.97 on Feb. 1, the weakest since May
2010. The euro fetched $1.3628 from $1.3640 and last week
reached $1.3711, the strongest level since Nov. 14, 2011.  The yen’s 12 weeks of declines against the dollar marked
the longest losing streak in data compiled by Bloomberg going
back to 1971.  The Japanese currency’s 14-day relative strength index
against the euro was at 22 on Feb. 1, below the 30 level that
some traders see as a signal an asset has fallen too far, too
fast and may be due to reverse course. Against the U.S.
currency, it was 24.  Yen Performance  The yen tumbled 16 percent over the past three months, the
biggest decline among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 5.1
percent, and the dollar lost 1.7 percent during the same period.  Japan ’s currency slid as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
administration pressed the central bank to ease monetary policy
further to beat deflation. Finance Minister Taro Aso said
yesterday the government is imitating his Depression-era
predecessor, Korekiyo Takahashi, who told the BOJ to underwrite
government debt to fund deficit spending.  Gains in the yen were limited before reports predicted to
show U.S. factory orders increased and European investor
confidence improved, damping demand for the refuge assets.  U.S. Data  U.S. factory orders rose in December by the most in three
months, economists said before a Commerce Department report
today. Bookings rose 2.3 percent after being little changed in
November, the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey showed.
That would follow data from last week showing payrolls expanded
by 157,000 in January following a revised 196,000 advance in the
prior month and a revised 247,000 surge in November.  An index measuring sentiment in the euro-area economy
advanced to minus 1.7 from minus 7 in January, the Limburg,
Germany-based Sentix institute is forecast to say according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. That
would be the highest level since July 2011.  “Excessive pessimism about the European economy has eased
while expectations for a U.S. recovery have increased,” said
Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst at IG Markets Securities Ltd. in
Tokyo. The yen may decline toward 95 per dollar, he said.  Australia’s dollar rallied against most of its peers before
a meeting tomorrow by the nation’s central bank, which is
forecast to keep borrowing costs unchanged.  Australia Inflation  TD Securities Inc. and the Melbourne Institute said today
consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in January from a year earlier.
The  Reserve Bank  of Australia targets inflation in a range of 2
percent to 3 percent on average.  “Stronger economic growth and leaving rates on hold would
be positive for the Aussie,” said Hans Kunnen, chief economist
at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “The Reserve Bank will
continue to wait and see the impact of earlier cuts. There just
doesn’t seem to be the same level of anxiety there was last
year.”  The Aussie added 0.2 percent to $1.0426. It touched 96.79
yen, the highest since August 2008, before trading at 96.60
little changed from last week’s close.  To contact the reporters on this story:
