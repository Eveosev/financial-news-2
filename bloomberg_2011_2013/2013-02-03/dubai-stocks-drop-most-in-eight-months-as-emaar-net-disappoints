Dubai’s benchmark stock index
retreated the most in almost 11 months after  Emaar Properties
PJSC (EMAAR) ’s quarterly profit missed estimates.  Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest tower, slumped 3.7
percent.  Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM) , the only publicly traded
Gulf Cooperation Council stock market, tumbled the most since
May. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  retreated 2.1 percent, the biggest
decrease since March 7, to 1,848.28 at the close in the emirate.
Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  fell 0.3 percent.  Dubai’s stocks surged 16 percent in January, the fourth-
biggest gain among 93 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as
investors bet Emaar’s profit would improve amid a real estate
recovery in the city. Quarterly net income at the company with
the  heaviest weighting  on Dubai’s index dropped to 512 million
dirhams ($139 million), missing the 538 million-dirham  average
estimate  of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “Recent gains were pricing in stellar fourth-quarter
numbers and the reality was somewhat different so some profit-
taking is evident,” according to  Julian Bruce , Dubai-based head
of institutional trading at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE. “Looking
ahead, volumes are lighter amid this weakness, so I see this
more of a much-needed consolidation rather than any sort of
turnaround in recent positive sentiment.”  Expansion  Emaar shares fell to 4.69 dirhams today in the biggest drop
since June 3. The stock surged 46 percent last year amid a
revival in real estate, retail and tourism, which helped Dubai’s
economy expand 4.1 percent in the first half of 2012, putting
the emirate on track to reach a 5 percent growth forecast,
government data show. That would be the fastest pace of
expansion since 2007.  Dubai’s 14-day  relative strength index  dropped to 71 from
86. A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that a
security or index is poised to decline. Dubai’s measure, the
best performer in the six-nation GCC in 2012, trades at an
estimated 2013  price-to-earnings ratio  of 10.5 times, versus 11
times for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   About 275  million shares  traded in the city today, compared
with last month’s daily average of 363 million shares. Dubai
Financial Market, which relies in part on trading volumes for
revenue, slumped 3.9 percent, the most since May 16, to 1.23
dirhams.  Elsewhere in the GCC, the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the
biggest companies in the Gulf and Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  dropped 0.3
percent. Kuwait’s  gauge  increased 0.5 percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM) 
and  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  were little changed, while
Bahrain’s  measure  gained 0.1 percent.  Egypt Gains  Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose 1.6 percent following a drop of
1.5 percent last week when clashes between demonstrators and
police left more than 50 people dead. One person was killed as
protesters and police clashed Feb. 1, according to the Health
Ministry. That prompted the biggest government opposition bloc,
the National Salvation Front, to call on supporters to hold more
rallies and assert that it won’t join a national dialogue to end
the political crisis.  “The market is growing accustomed to the violence and the
fact that the death toll wasn’t high is enough as a positive
signal for some investors,” said Hassan Kenawi, equities trader
at Cairo-based HC Brokerage. “We expect more volatility ahead,
though, as pressure builds in the coming weeks to change the
government.”  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  gained 1.5 percent, the most in a
month, at the close in  Tel Aviv . The yield on the government’s
benchmark 4.25 percent bonds maturing March 2023 was unchanged
at 4.09 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
