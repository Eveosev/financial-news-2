Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  dropped the
most in eight months after the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper reported a 28 percent decline in fourth-quarter
profit as expenses increased.  The shares retreated 3.7 percent, the biggest decrease
since June 3, to 4.69 dirhams at the close in Dubai on more than
two times the three-month daily average trading volume. Emaar,
which makes up more than 20 percent of the benchmark  DFM General
Index (DFMGI) , led declines on the gauge, which fell 2.1 percent.  Quarterly net income dropped to 512 million dirhams ($139
million), missing the 538 million-dirham average estimate of
five analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 20 percent
to 2.68 billion dirhams, while cost of sales jumped to 1.5
billion dirhams from 970 million dirhams, the company said.  The share price decline “is mostly driven by retail
investors after the fourth-quarter numbers,” said Tariq Qaqish,
deputy head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal Capital
PSC. “But Emaar is looking more and more promising and
investors should be looking at future projects and future
earnings.”  Emaar shares rallied 30 percent last month as the developer
started a new luxury hotel project in central Dubai, set to
comprise 280 apartments. It sold all units made available at a
first offering, the company said Jan. 27. Emaar’s 2013 profit
may rise 9 percent, according to the average estimate of 11
analysts on Bloomberg.  The share’s  14-day relative strength index  fell to 71 today
from 86. A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that a
security is poised to drop. Twelve analysts recommend investors
buy Emaar shares, while three say hold, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg.   To contact the reporter on this story:
