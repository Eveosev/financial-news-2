Nigeria upset tournament favorite
Ivory Coast 2-1 and Burkina Faso beat Togo 1-0 after extra time
to advance to the  Africa  Cup of Nations soccer semifinals.  Sunday Mba got Nigeria’s winning goal yesterday with a
deflected shot in Rustenburg, South Africa, after Ivory Coast
midfielder Cheick Tiote had made it 1-1 following Emmanuel
Emenike’s opener three minutes before halftime.  Jonathan Pitroipa headed in the only goal after 105 minutes
in Nelspruit to lift Burkina Faso past Togo and into a semifinal
against  Ghana  in two days. Nigeria will play Mali the same day
for a place in the Feb. 10 final in Johannesburg.  Burkina Faso,  ranked 92nd  in the world by soccer’s
governing body FIFA, only once previously reached the final four
of Africa’s continental championship when it hosted the
tournament in 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
