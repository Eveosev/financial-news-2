Australia ’s bonds fell, sending
benchmark 10-year yields to a nine-month high, and the local
dollar was supported amid speculation the central bank will hold
 interest rates  unchanged tomorrow.  The so-called Aussie dollar gained against most of its
major peers before data forecast to show the nation’s trade
deficit narrowed.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose
to the strongest since September 2011 versus the greenback as a
rally in global stocks boosted demand for higher-yielding
assets. The currency gained to a level unseen since July 2010
against its Australian counterpart.  “Stronger economic growth and leaving rates on hold would
be positive for the Aussie,” said Hans Kunnen, chief economist
at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “The  Reserve Bank  will
continue to wait and see the impact of earlier cuts. There just
doesn’t seem to be the same level of anxiety there was last
year.”  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year bonds rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.59 percent at 4:41 p.m.
in Sydney from Feb. 1. It earlier reached 3.61 percent, the
highest level since May 2.  The Aussie advanced 0.3 percent $1.0435. It touched 96.79
yen, the highest since August 2008, before trading at 96.70, up
0.1 percent from last week’s close. The currency dropped to
NZ$1.2269, the lowest since July 2010, before trading at
NZ$1.2328.  The kiwi added 0.2 percent to 84.64 U.S. cents, after
earlier touching 84.93, the highest since September 2011. It
reached 78.81 yen, the strongest since August 2008, before
trading at 78.43 from 78.38 at the end of last week.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares gained 0.9 percent,
after the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  climbed 0.8 percent on Feb. 1.  Trade Balance  Imports probably  outpaced  exports by A$800 million ($834.7
million) in December, compared with a A$2.64 billion shortfall
in November, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The Bureau of Statistics is due to
release the data tomorrow.  TD Securities Inc. and the Melbourne Institute said today
consumer prices in Australia rose 2.5 percent in January from a
year earlier. The  Reserve Bank of Australia  targets inflation in
a range of 2 percent to 3 percent on average.  “The RBA is in comfortable position to discuss the outlook
and the risks at the board meeting tomorrow, without reducing
the cash rate further, for now,”  Annette Beacher , head of Asia-
Pacific research for TD Securities in  Singapore , said in a
statement today.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 17 percent chance the RBA will lower its benchmark rate by
a quarter percentage point to 2.75 percent at its meeting
tomorrow.  Rate Forecasts  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. last week
dropped their forecasts for a rate cut at the first meeting of
the year after a 76 percent rebound in the price of  iron ore ,
the nation’s biggest export. The RBA lowered the benchmark rate
by 1.75 percentage points since Nov. 1, 2011, as it seeks to
spur industries that will help offset a peak in resources
investment.  Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are among 24 of 28 economists in
a Bloomberg  survey  forecasting the RBA will hold rates unchanged
tomorrow, with the remaining four expecting a quarter percentage
point cut.  The Aussie and kiwi were also supported by data over the
weekend showing that  China ’s services industries grew at the
fastest pace since August.  The  non-manufacturing   Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to
56.2 in January from 56.1 in December, the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
& Purchasing said in a statement yesterday. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  China is Australia’s largest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export destination.  Building Data  Gains in the Aussie dollar were limited after building
approvals unexpectedly declined. The  number of permits  granted
to build or renovate houses and apartments in Australia fell 4.4
percent from November, when they rose a revised 3.4 percent, the
Bureau of Statistics said today. The median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey was a 1 percent rise.  Futures traders decreased their bets that the Australian
dollar will gain against the U.S. currency. The difference in
the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other large speculators
on an advance in the Australian dollar compared with those on a
drop -- so-called  net longs  -- was 85,296 on Jan. 29, compared
with net longs of 97,011 a week earlier, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
