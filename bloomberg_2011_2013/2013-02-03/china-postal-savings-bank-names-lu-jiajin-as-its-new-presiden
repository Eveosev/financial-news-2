Postal Savings Bank of China  named Lu
Jiajin as its new president, eight months after saying his
predecessor was being investigated by authorities.  The bank’s previous president, Tao Liming, was formally
arrested in December, Caixin Media magazine New Century reported

officials after coming under “suspicion of personal economic
problems,” Beijing-based Postal Savings Bank said in a June
statement, without elaborating.  Li Guohua was named board chairman, the bank said in the
same Feb. 1  statement  that announced Lu’s appointment.  The bank had 39,000 outlets across  China  at the end of
October, with 4.5 trillion yuan ($722 billion) in local and
foreign-currency deposits, according to its  website . Its total
assets were 4.7 trillion  yuan .  Lu, 44, was previously a vice president at the bank,
according to his biography on the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
