Iran ’s parliament dismissed Abdolreza
Sheikholeslami, President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s labor minister,
for making “unlawful” appointments, local media reported.  The dismissal came after an impeachment motion that passed
in a 192-56 vote today with 24 abstentions, the state-run Mehr
news agency said. Sheikholeslami “can no longer continue his
activities in the Labor Ministry,” the state-run  Fars  news
agency said.  Ahmadinejad testified in the failed defense of the
minister, the official  Islamic Republic News agency  reported.
Lawmakers first spoke against Sheikholeslami, who was then given
an opportunity to defend himself, IRNA said.  Lawmakers seeking to impeach Sheikholeslami said the main
reason behind their move is the minister’s failure to remove
former prosecutor-general Saeed Mortazavi from his post as the
head of the country’s Social Security Organization, Tehran Times
said on Jan. 24. The impeachment motion had been signed by 18
people, according to IRNA today.  A group of Iranian parliamentarians sought to impeach
Sheikholeslami in April after he appointed Mortazavi to the
post, the state-run Fars news agency reported at the time. The
ex-prosecutor-general was suspended in 2010 after accusations
that he was linked to the deaths of prisoners, local media said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
