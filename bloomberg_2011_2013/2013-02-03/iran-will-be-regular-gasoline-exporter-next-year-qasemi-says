Iran  plans to become a regular
gasoline exporting nation within months, despite sanctions
against the country, Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi said.  “The progress made in the oil industry has allowed us to
leave behind the road of sanctions,” Qasemi was quoted as
saying during the inauguration ceremony last week of a new
gasoline-producing unit at the Abadan refinery, the oil
ministry’s news website,  Shana , said yesterday.  “With the coming on stream of this unit, Iran no longer
needs to import gasoline and will be among the exporters of
gasoline,” by the next Iranian year starting on March 21 or the
following Iranian year at the latest, Qasemi said.  Iran boosted the refinery’s fuel output capacity by 2
million liters a day to 6 million liters, state television said
on Jan. 31.  Iran, one of the main producers of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, formerly relied on imported
gasoline to meet as much as 40 percent of its needs as it lacked
sufficient refining capacity. The U.S. tightened its sanctions
against Iran, over the country’s nuclear program, in 2010 to
target foreign suppliers of gasoline.  Iran has exported Iranian-made gasoline in recent months to
the U.A.E, Afghanistan, Iraq and  Armenia , the state-run Mehr
news agency reported in June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
