BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ’s head of debt capital
markets for the Middle East and North Africa has left, according
to a bank spokeswoman.  Simon Putt left in December and has yet to be replaced,
although the lender continues to have a team to handle debt
capital markets, Lubna Forzley, communications head for the
Middle East and Africa at BNP Paribas, said today by e-mail from
Bahrain, where the bank’s regional office is based. Putt,
reached by telephone in Dubai, confirmed his departure.  Christophe Mariot, BNP Paribas’ head of structured finance
for the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, is becoming chief
executive officer of BNP Paribas Investment Co. in Saudi Arabia,

finance advisory business in his new role, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
