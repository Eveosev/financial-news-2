Italy upset title favorite France 23-
18 today in the first round of matches in European rugby’s Six
Nations championship.  Italy, which finished fifth in the championship last year,
trailed 15-13 in  Rome  at halftime.  Luciano Orquera kicked 10 points for Italy, which got tries
through captain Sergio Parisse and Martin Castrogiovanni. Kris
Burton’s late drop goal put the seal on the victory.  Louis Picamoles and Benjamin Fall were France’s try-
scorers, with Frederic Michalak kicking eight points.  Yesterday defending champion  Wales , which won all its Six
Nations games last season, lost 30-22 at home to Ireland.
England beat Scotland 38-18.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
