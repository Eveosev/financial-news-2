Evangelos Venizelos , leader of
 Greece ’s socialist Pasok party, was admitted to hospital today
in the country’s second-largest city of Thessaloniki for a
scheduled health check,  Pasok  said.  Following Venizelos’s admission, it was declared necessary
for him to remain hospitalized for one day for a complete
gastrointestinal and cardiovascular examination, according to an
e-mailed statement from Athens-based Pasok.  Pasok is one of three parties that supports Greece’s
coalition government led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.
Venizelos underwent surgery in Nov. 2011 after being admitted to
hospital with stomach pains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
