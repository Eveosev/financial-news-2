Blackstone Group LP (BX)  said a private-
equity fund it manages gained a controlling stake in two
Maldives-based seaplane operators that provide service to resort
islands from Hulhule Airport Island in  Maldives .  Terms weren’t disclosed. The owners of the companies will
still retain a stake in the business and serve as directors on
the board, the financial-management firm said in a statement.  Maldivian Air Taxi , founded in 1992, is the biggest
seaplane operator in the world, Blackstone said.  Trans Maldivian
Airways  has more than 20 seaplanes, and the combined business
will operate 44 seaplanes with more than 100,000 flights
annually, Blackstone said.  “We are excited to partner with MAT and TMA, whose
seaplane operations have contributed significantly to the
development of resort islands,” said Prakash Melwani, chief
investment officer of Blackstone’s private equity unit, in the
statement.  Maldives , a group of 1,190 coral islands with a population
of about 400,000, is southwest of India. About 198 of the
islands, spread across 559 miles (900 kilometers), are
inhabited.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  served as advisers
to Blackstone, while Churchill Capital Ltd. and Northern Lights
Capital Group LLC advised the sellers, Blackstone said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
