Kuwait ’s real gross domestic product
growth is forecast to slow to 3.2 percent this year from 6.1
percent in 2012, supported by stable oil production,  National
Bank of Kuwait  said.  NBK raised its forecast for real non-oil growth in 2013 to
5 percent from 4 percent, “based largely on signs of a greater
determination by Kuwaiti authorities to implement large
infrastructure projects” that had previously stalled, the
country’s biggest lender said in an e-mailed report. “This
should ease the economy’s dependence on growth in the consumer
sector, which will nevertheless remain firm thanks to high
employment levels and fresh government measures to support
income growth.”  Kuwait, the fourth-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, posted a record budget surplus of
13.2 billion dinars ($47 billion) in the last fiscal year as oil
production and prices rose. The  International Monetary Fund 
forecasts economic growth at 1.8 percent this year, down from
estimated growth of 6.6 percent in 2012. The Gulf state pumped
2.75 million barrels of oil a day in January, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Kuwait’s government and parliament have pledged to put a
$110 billion development plan, first approved in February 2010,
on a fast track after political bickering slowed implementation.
The plan to diversify the oil-reliant economy and modernize the
country includes boosting crude and gas production, building a
metro and rail network, new hospitals, roads, power stations,
expanding the airport and building a port on Boubyan Island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
