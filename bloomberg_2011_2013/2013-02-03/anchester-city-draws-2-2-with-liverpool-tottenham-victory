Manchester City drew 2-2 with
Liverpool in English soccer’s Premier League, slipping to nine
points behind leader Manchester United following the weekend’s
games. Tottenham won 1-0 at 10-man West Brom.  Edin Dzeko and  Sergio Aguero  scored for defending champion
City at its Etihad Stadium.  Daniel Sturridge  and Steven Gerrard
got Liverpool’s goals. Gareth Bale scored for Tottenham at West
Brom, who had Goran Popov red-carded.  ``Liverpool played a good game and I think in the end
it is the right result,'' City manager  Roberto Mancini  told Sky
Sports. ``Today we didn't play well, we were so nervous, I don't
know why. But 13 games to the end is a long way. It's not over
yet, I think we can recover nine points.''  Manchester United has 62 points, City 53, Chelsea 46 and
