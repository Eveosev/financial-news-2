Paul Dickov resigned as Oldham
Athletic soccer manager, a week after the third-tier team had a
surprise 3-2 win over Premier League Liverpool in the fourth
round of the F.A. Cup.  Oldham has lost eight of the past nine league games,
including a 3-1 loss to Walsall yesterday, and is one point
above the relegation positions in League One.  The club announced Dickovâ€™s departure on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
