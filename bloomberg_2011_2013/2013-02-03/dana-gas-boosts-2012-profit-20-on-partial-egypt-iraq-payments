Dana Gas PJSC (DANA) , the oil and natural
gas producer forced to restructure its debt last year, boosted
full-year profit by 20 percent as it received payments for
output in Egypt and Iraq and benefited from higher crude prices.  Net profit  rose to $165 million from $138 million the
previous year, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Sales slipped to $636 million from $690 million as Dana slowed
investment in Egypt and reduced production there, it said.  The company, which produces oil and gas at deposits mainly
in Egypt and Iraq, seeks to increase output even as it faces
difficulties in getting paid. Dana said it collected $301
million in payments from Egypt and from authorities in  Iraq ’s
semi-autonomous Kurdish region, without saying how much money
it’s still owed.  Delays in payments by Egyptian and Iraqi Kurdish
authorities forced the company to renegotiate terms on nearly $1
billion in Islamic debt, or sukuk. Dana said it is seeking final
approval for the restructuring from shareholders, creditors and
regulators.  Annual profit for Dana, based in the United Arab Emirates
sheikhdom of Sharjah, exceeded the  median estimate  of four
analysts who forecast 2012 profit at $159 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The company, which lists shares on
the Abu Dhabi stock exchange, posted earnings of 9 fils (2.5
cents) per share. Its cash balance was 605 million dirhams at
the end of 2012. Brent crude oil rose 3.5 percent last year to
$111.11 a barrel.  Dana said it agreed with Sharjah and the U.A.E. emirate of
Ajman to begin development of the offshore Zora gas field. The
project will involve one production platform and ship fuel by
pipeline to the country’s mainland.  Production declined last year to 60,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day from 66,200 barrels at the end of 2011. The
company said it plans to raise output in  Egypt  after developing
three new gas fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
