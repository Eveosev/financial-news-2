(Corrects attribution, spelling of project name in second
paragraph of story first published yesterday.)  Nakheel PJSC, the indebted developer
of artificial islands off Dubai’s coast, is “evaluating finance
options” to build retail projects on a palm-shaped peninsula,
company spokeswoman Rebecca Rees said today.  Nakheel’s planned projects will cost a total of 3.3 billion
dirhams ($898 million) and include a mall on Palm Jumeirah
alongside another shopping project called The Pointe, the
official WAM news agency reported. In April, Nakheel chairman
Ali Lootah said the company was close to reaching a financing
agreement with banks to fund the construction of The Pointe,
without specifying the amount Nakheel sought to borrow.  Nakheel is trying to secure funds to revive projects on
Palm Jumeirah, where demand has improved since property prices
in Dubai sank 65 percent from a mid-2008 peak. The developer,
which wrote down the value of its real estate by $21 billion
from late 2008 through mid-2010, got an $8.6 billion bailout
from the Dubai government in 2009 to help avoid default.  Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum
“ordered the necessary measures to be taken to commence the
implementation of the two projects,” the United Arab Emirates
official news agency  WAM  reported today, without saying where
the funding will come from. The Nakheel Mall project and The
Pointe will cost 2.5 billion dirhams and 800 million dirhams,
respectively, WAM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
