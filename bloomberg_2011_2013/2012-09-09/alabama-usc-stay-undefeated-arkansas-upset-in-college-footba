Top-ranked  University of Alabama  and
No. 2 University of  Southern California  remained undefeated in
the second week of college football, while No. 8 University of
Arkansas was upset by the University of Louisiana-Monroe.  Among the Top 10 teams ranked by the Associated Press
Writers’ Poll, it was No. 1  Alabama  35, Western Kentucky 0; No.
2 USC 42, Syracuse 29; No. 3 Louisiana State 41, Washington 3;
No. 4 Oregon 42, Fresno State 25; and No. 5 Oklahoma 69, Florida
A&M 13.  Rounding out the top 10 yesterday, it was No. 6 Florida
State 55, Savannah 0; No. 7 Georgia 41, Missouri 20; Louisiana-
Monroe 34, No. 8 Arkansas 31; and No. 9 South Carolina 48, East
Carolina 10.  West Virginia , tied for ninth, didn’t play.  At Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, A.J.
McCarron completed 14 of 19 passing attempts for 219 yards and
four touchdowns for the Crimson Tide in the win over Western
Kentucky (1-1). Two touchdown passes went to Christian Jones and
two were caught by Kevin Norwood.  “AJ’s really stepped up,” Jones said. “He’s really
picked up that weight left off from that national championship
game a little bit from last year. He’s overall conquered a lot
of things with the passing game.”  Matt Barkley threw for a school-record six touchdowns,
three to Marqise Lee, in the Trojans’ rain-delayed victory at
Metlife Stadium in  East Rutherford ,  New Jersey . Ryan Nassib
completed 30 of 46 passing attempts for 322 yards and two
touchdowns and he ran for a third for Syracuse (0-2).  “That’s the No. 2 team in the nation,” said Orange
receiver Alec Lemon. “We put up a great fight against them.”  Storm Delays  In Tallahassee, Florida, E.J. Manuel passed for three
touchdowns in the first seven minutes as Florida State (2-0)
shut out Savannah State (0-2), which lost 84-0 to Oklahoma State
last week. The game was called in the third quarter because of
lightning after two storm delays, canceling the  Las Vegas 
wagering on the game, which had made Florida State a 70 1/2-
point favorite, the largest college football spread ever.  “I’ve never had that happen in my career,” said Seminole
coach Jimbo Fisher. “It’s easy for me to say I want to keep
playing, but I understand the situation.”  In the only upset in the top 10, quarterback Kolton
Browning scored on a 16-yard run in overtime to give the
Warhawks (1-0) a victory over the Razorbacks (1-1). Browning
passed for 412 yards and three touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
