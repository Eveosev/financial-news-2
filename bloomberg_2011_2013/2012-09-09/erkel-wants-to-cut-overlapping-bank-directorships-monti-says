German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
would like to follow Italy and limit the ability of directors at
banks and insurance companies to sit on multiple boards, Italian
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said.  “Mrs. Merkel told me, ‘In Germany, I really think we
should do something like this,’” Monti said in a speech today
at a conference in Cernobbio, Italy.  Monti cited how he passed a rule in Italy for “the
elimination of the possibility of interlocking directorates, or
the crossed positions on the boards of banks and insurers” as
an example of what he discussed with Merkel about doing in
Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
