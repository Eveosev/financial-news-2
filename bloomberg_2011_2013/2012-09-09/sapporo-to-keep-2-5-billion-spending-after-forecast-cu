Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501) , the Japanese
brewer that last month cut its profit forecast, will invest as
much as $2.5 billion over five years to boost growth and
consider acquisitions to expand in food and soft drinks.  The beer maker is keeping its pledge to invest 150 billion
yen to 200 billion yen ($2.5 billion) by 2016 even after cutting
annual revenue and profit projections, President Tsutomu Kamijo
said in a Sept. 6 interview in Tokyo.  Sapporo and larger competitors  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  and  Asahi
Group Holdings Ltd. (2502)  are making investments overseas and in
businesses such as food and soft drinks to help offset slumping
beer demand at home. Sapporo last month slashed its operating
income forecast 20 percent to 16 billion yen for 2012 on higher
marketing expenses.  “We lowered the earnings forecast so the level of
operating cash flow will be lower a little bit, but it won’t
have a big impact” on the investment plan, Kamijo said.  The brewer is planning the investments amid a slump in its
stock price this year. Sapporo shares dropped 0.5 percent to 214
yen at the close of  Tokyo  trading today. The stock is down 26
percent this year, compared with a 1.2 percent gain for the
Topix Index.  Sapporo wants to strengthen its domestic food business
after last year buying Pokka Corp., a Japanese beverage and food
maker.  Yogurt, Dairy Industries  “Sapporo should go ahead and buy something that has a
solid business with large shares even if it ends up costing a
little high,”  saidMikihiko Yamato, deputy head of research
for JI  Asia  in Tokyo.  The commercial sales of food and beverages in  Japan  fell
7.3 percent to 46 trillion yen in 2011 from 20 years ago,
according to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry.  Kamijo, without elaborating, said he is also “watching
with interest” for possible investment opportunities in the
domestic yogurt or milk industries. The company bought a 51
percent stake in U.S. beverage maker Silver Springs Citrus Inc.
earlier this year as part of its plan to expand in  North
America . Its domestic investments include a 49 percent stake in
a yogurt and milk product maker Azumino Shokuhin Kobo KK. in
2009.  Industrywide beer sales in Japan fell 3.7 percent to 442
million cases last year, the lowest level since records began in
1992.  “For beer, lowering production cost and increasing the
competitiveness is what the company needs” said Yamato. “It
needs to grow out of the business style that depends on
promotion.”  Sapporo posted 1.7 billion yen operating loss for the half
year ended in June partly due to increased marketing cost, the
company said in a statement in August. It posted 3 billion yen
profit a year earlier.  The company got 65 percent of its  2011 revenue  of 454
billion yen from the brewing business, 17 percent from the Pokka
Group and 8 percent from other drinks businesses, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The brewer last month reduced sales
forecast by 3 percent to 493 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
