Ireland’s education minister, Ruairi Quinn, said an agreement between the country’s former government
and labor unions on public workers’ pay should be renegotiated,
the Sunday Independent reported.  “We should anticipate a successor agreement and start
negotiating it now,” Quinn told the Dublin-based newspaper,
referring to the agreement which is designed to save the
government money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
