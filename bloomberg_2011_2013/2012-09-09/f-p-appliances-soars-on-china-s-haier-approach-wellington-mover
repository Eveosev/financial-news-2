Fisher & Paykel  Appliances Holdings
Ltd., a New Zealand refrigerator maker, rose the most in more
than three years after saying Haier Group Corp,  China ’s biggest
appliance maker, may make a takeover offer.  Haier, the company’s largest shareholder, expressed an
interest in making a cash offer at a premium to the Sept. 7
closing share price, Fisher & Paykel said in a statement. The
stock rose 29 percent, the biggest daily move since May 27,
2009.  Fisher & Paykel allowed Haier to undertake “limited” due
diligence, giving it access to part of a five-year strategic
plan, according to the statement. Haier had planned to approach
three of the company’s largest shareholders over the weekend.  “There can be no certainty that an offer for shares in
Fisher & Paykel Appliances or any other transaction will
result,” the company said.  Fisher & Paykel Appliances shares rose 22 New Zealand cents
to 97 cents in Wellington. They earlier rose as high as NZ$1.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
