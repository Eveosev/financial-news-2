Bettors who tried to profit on the
biggest point spread in college football history received
refunds instead when the game ended early with No. 6  Florida
State University  routing Savannah State 55-0.  Florida  State was made a 70 1/2-point favorite over
Savannah last week by Cantor Gaming. The spread closed at 69
points, according to Pregame.com.  All bets were canceled when the game was suspended after
two storm delays with 8 minutes, 2 seconds left in the third
quarter at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida.  “In  Las Vegas , wagers on college football are official
only after 55 minutes have been played,” said R.J. Bell of
Pregame.com in an e-mail. “Thus, the official ruling is ‘no
action -- all money will be refunded.’”  Since the game is considered a non-event in Las Vegas, the
record for the largest spread remains the 2007 matchup that had
Hawaii favored by 60 points over Northern Colorado.  Savannah, which lost 84-0 to Oklahoma State last week,
opened as a 67.5-point underdog. Action on the Tigers moved the
line down to 58 at game time.  “Many felt bad for Savannah State the last two weeks but
with amazing luck they somehow avoided going down in history as
the biggest underdog ever,” Bell said.  The Savannah,  Georgia , school got $385,000 for last week’s
game against Oklahoma State and will collect $475,000 for the
Florida State matchup, said spokesman Opio Mashariki. Together,
the games will cover 17 percent of the school’s $5.1 million
athletic department budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
