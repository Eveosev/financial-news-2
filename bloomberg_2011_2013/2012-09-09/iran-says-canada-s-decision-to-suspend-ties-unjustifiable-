Canada’s decision to suspend
diplomatic relations with  Iran  is “unprofessional,
unconventional and unjustifiable,” Iranian state television
reported, citing the country’s foreign ministry.  Canada’s decision violates international law and Canada is
responsible for the safety of Iranian diplomats, the Iranian
ministry said in the statement, according to state TV’s  website .  Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister  John Baird  said Sept. 7
his country is suspending diplomatic relations with Iran and
designating the country as a sponsor of terrorism. Canada will
close its embassy in Tehran and expel Iranian diplomats from
Canada, Baird told reporters in Vladivostok, Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
