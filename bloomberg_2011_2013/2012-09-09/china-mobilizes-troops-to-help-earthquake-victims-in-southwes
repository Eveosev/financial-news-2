China  dispatched 7,200 soldiers and
militiamen to boost rescue efforts after two magnitude-5.6
earthquakes struck the country’s southwestern provinces of
Yunnan and Guizhou, the official Xinhua News Agency said.  More than 11,000 rescuers are working to clear roads,
evacuate residents and search for the missing, Xinhua said
today, citing the rescue headquarters. The government is
“pouring” blankets, quilts, water and other relief items into
the mountainous areas, it said.  The casualty toll may rise beyond the known 80 killed, 820
injured and more than 6,650 homes destroyed by the Sept. 7
quakes, as damage to communications and infrastructure makes it
difficult to gather information, Xinhua said, citing rescue
officials.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  arrived in the region early yesterday
and spent a night visiting survivors and urging all-out rescue
efforts, Xinhua said. The Ministry of Finance allocated 1.05
billion  yuan  ($166 million) to Yunnan province for quake relief,
it said yesterday on its  website .  About 744,000 people were affected by the earthquakes, it
said. State and provincial civil affairs authorities have sent
21,000 tents, 31,000 quilts and 26,000 winter coats to Yunnan,
Xinhua reported.  Power and communications were cut off and transportation
disrupted in Luozehe, the town in Yunnan’s Yiliang county that
was worst hit, Xinhua said. More than 200,000 people in Yunnan
and 28,000 in Guizhou have been relocated, it said.  A magnitude-7.9 quake in neighboring Sichuan province in
May 2008 collapsed schools and other buildings, killing about
90,000 people and sparking protests and accusations that corrupt
officials turned a blind eye to substandard construction.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
