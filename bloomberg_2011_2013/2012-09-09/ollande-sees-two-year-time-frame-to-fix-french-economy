French President  Francois Hollande 
said his government will set up a two-year agenda to fix the
euro zone’s second-largest economy, including measures to
overhaul labor contracts and state-sponsored jobs to ease
unemployment.  “I have a mission: bring this country on the path of
recovery,” Hollande said today on TF1 television. “I am going
to set a recovery agenda. We have two years to roll out a policy
for jobs, a policy for competitiveness and a policy to rebuild
public finances.” He promised to have unemployment falling by
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
