The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 7.85 cents in the past
two weeks to $3.8376 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the two weeks ended Sept. 7 and is based
on information received from about 2,500 stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The average is up 17 cents
from a year earlier. Gasoline is 13 cents below the year-to-date
high of $3.9671 on April 6.  “Hurricane Isaac was the biggest individual contributor to
the price increase,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg
Survey, said today in a telephone interview. “The storm caused
refinery closures and partial closures.”  Prices at the pump rose as West Texas Intermediate crude on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  advanced 27 cents, or 0.3
percent, in two weeks to $96.42 a barrel on Sept. 7. Futures
have increased 24 percent since June 28, when they fell to a
year-to-date low of $77.69.  Gasoline futures on the Nymex fell 5.84 cents, or 1.9
percent, in the two weeks ended Sept. 7 to $3.0196, after the
September contract expired Aug. 31 at a 13.28-cent premium to
October. Prices are up 18 percent from the year-to-date low of
$2.5501 on June 21.  October-delivery gasoline increased 3.8 percent during the
period as Hurricane Isaac curtailed fuel output from refiners
along the  Gulf Coast . The storm shut seven plants and forced
four others to reduce operating rates.  Gasoline stockpiles declined 2.33 million barrels in the
week ended Aug. 31 to 198.9 million, the lowest level since
November 2008, Energy Department data showed Sept. 6.  Federal Reserve  Crude oil has risen on speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will move to boost stimulus efforts to offset a faltering
recovery. The  Federal Open Market Committee  will meet Sept.
12-13 to discuss monetary policy.  The Labor Department reported on Sept. 7 an increase of
96,000 jobs in August, following a revised 141,000 rise in July
that was smaller than initially estimated. The  unemployment rate 
fell to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent as 368,000 Americans left
the  labor force .  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said the
report will move the Fed closer to more quantitative easing. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in an Aug. 31 speech in Jackson,
Hole, Wyoming, that the central bank may need to do more to
boost economic growth.  Oil may decline this week on speculation that U.S.  Gulf of
Mexico  crude output will resume after Isaac, a Bloomberg survey
showed.  Oil Production  About 13 percent of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico
remained shut today, down from 95 percent on Aug. 31, according
to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.  Sixteen of 31 analysts, or 52 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Sept. 14. Nine respondents, or 29 percent,
predicted that futures will gain and six said there will be
little change in prices. Last week, 59 percent of analysts
projected a drop.  Regular gasoline on Long Island averaged $4.04 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$4.14.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in Chicago, where the average was $4.30 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in El Paso, Texas,
where customers paid an average of $3.44 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
