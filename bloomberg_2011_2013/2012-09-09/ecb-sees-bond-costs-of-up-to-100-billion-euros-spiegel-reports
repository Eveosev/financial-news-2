The  European Central Bank  may spend
between 70 and 100 billion euros ($90 to $128 billion) on bond
purchases this year if interest rates on Spanish and Italian
debt rise again “sharply”, Der  Spiegel  reported, citing
internal information used at the central bank.  The figures are based on a scenario under which the ECB
buys 10 to 14 percent of bonds eligible under the new plan,  Der
Spiegel  said. The European Commission sees a Spanish request for
ESM aid as “probable”, the German magazine said, citing a
member of the Commission it did not name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
