Peter Hanson  of  Sweden  won golf’s
KLM Open by two shots after none of the four overnight leaders
were able to break par today at Hilversum in the Netherlands.  The 34-year-old, whose last European Tour victory was at
the Czech Open in August 2010, finished on 14-under-par
following a 3-under final round.  Scotland’s Richie Ramsay, winner of last week’s European
Masters, and Spain’s Pablo Larrazabal were 12-under, with Scott
Jamieson another shot back. Sweden’s Henrik Stenson, England’s
Graeme Storm and Spain’s Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano were 9-under.  Larrazabal, Jamieson, Storm and Fernandez-Castano had all
shared the lead after the third round.   Hanson collects a check for 300,000 euros ($384,500), the
second-biggest prize of his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
