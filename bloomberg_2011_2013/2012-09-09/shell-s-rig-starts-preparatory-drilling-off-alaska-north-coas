Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said its Noble
Discoverer rig started drilling in the  Chukchi Sea  off the north
coast of  Alaska , beginning preparations to become the first
company to drill for oil in the U.S. Arctic in decades.  The company has been given permission by the U.S. Interior
Department to perform preparatory work as it awaits a final
permit to drill for oil.  Shell said it started drilling at 8:30 a.m.  New York  time.  “Today marks the culmination of Shell’s six-year effort to
explore for potentially significant oil and gas reserves, which
are believed to lie under Alaska’s Outer Continental Shelf,”
Kelly op de Weegh, a Houston-based spokeswoman for the company,
said in a statement.  She said it was the first time a drill has touched the U.S.
Chukchi sea floor in more than two decades.  The U.S. Interior Department on Aug. 30 said it would allow
the company to start drilling to a maximum depth of 1,400 feet
under the seabed, above the level of  oil fields . It won’t be
allowed to drill deeper because one of its oil spill response
vessels isn’t ready.  Shell has invested $4.5 billion on the offshore leases and
equipment and fought at least 50 lawsuits from environmental
groups, opposing the first wells in the Arctic waters in about
20 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
