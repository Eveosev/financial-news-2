U.K. business confidence fell to a
record low last month and a gauge of output indicated that the
economy is set to remain weak, according to BDO LLP.  The sentiment gauge fell to 89.1 from 93.1 in July, the
accountancy firm said in a report today in  London . That’s the
lowest since the series began in 1992. The output measure
dropped to 90.8 from 93.9, further below the 95 mark that points
to  positive growth  one quarter ahead. BDO said the decline
suggests growth “is likely to remain elusive in the final
quarter.”  “Difficult business conditions look increasingly likely to
prevail into 2013,” BDO said. “This is the sixth consecutive
decline in business confidence as the euro-zone crisis continues
unresolved and domestic demand remains weak.”  Separately, a survey by Lloyds Bank showed Britons’
assessment of employment prospects rose to minus 43 last month
from minus 51 in July. Lloyds’ index of consumers’ job security
increased 5 points to minus 14. In another report, KPMG LLP and
the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said their index of
hiring of full-time staff rose to 48.4 in August from 47.3 in
July. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  The BDO indexes are calculated by the Centre for Economics
and Business Research from a weighted average of all the U.K.’s
main business surveys in past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
