Tropical Storm Leslie, the 12th
named system of the Atlantic season, is battering  Bermuda  with
tropical-storm force winds as it passes to the east of the
island, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  Leslie was about 140 miles (230 kilometers) east of Bermuda
with winds of 60 miles per hour and moving north at 10 mph, the
Miami-based center said in an  advisory  issued at 11 a.m.
Atlantic Standard Time. An earlier update pegged wind speeds at
65 mph.  The eye of the storm is forecast to continue passing to the
east of Bermuda today and could strengthen to regain hurricane
status either today or tomorrow as it heads for the east of
Newfoundland, the NHC said. A tropical storm warning is in
effect for Bermuda.  Farther to the east, Hurricane Michael was about 955 miles
west-southwest of the Azores, spinning at 90 mph as it moved
west at 5 mph, the NHC said in a separate  advisory . The system
is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm by Sept. 11.  The hurricane center is also monitoring a tropical wave
that is about 200 miles west of the Cape Verde islands. The
system has a 40 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in
the next two days, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
