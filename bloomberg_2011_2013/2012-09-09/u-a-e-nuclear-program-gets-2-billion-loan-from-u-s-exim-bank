Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp. , the
state-owned company developing an atomic power plant in the
 United Arab Emirates , received a $2 billion loan from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.  The loan to the Barakah One Co., a unit of Emirates
Nuclear, will pay for American products and services used in the
construction of four 1,400 megawatt reactors, according to a
statement from the government-run bank. Westinghouse Electric
Corp., based in Pittsburgh, will supply some of the equipment
for the facilities, the bank said.  The first of the plantâ€™s four reactors will be ready in
2017, with each additional unit becoming operational every year
through 2020, according to Emirates Nuclear.  The U.A.E., the sixth-largest producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is developing nuclear power to
meet rising electricity demand from its growing population and
diversifying industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
