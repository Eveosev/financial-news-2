Billionaire financier and
philanthropist  George Soros  said he wants Germany to abandon its
demand for austerity from struggling euro-area member countries
or withdraw from the euro, the Financial Times reported, citing
an interview.  Soros emphasized he doesn’t want Germany to leave the euro
and instead called on the country to abandon its deflationary
stance. “Politically, it would be a terrible blow,” if Germany
were to leave, he said, according to the FT.  Demanding more stringent austerity conditions from such
countries as Spain and Italy “is a step towards making a two-
tier Europe permanent,” the FT cited Soros as saying.  Soros urged the creation of a European Fiscal Authority
that would take on the solvency risk of all  government bonds 
bought by the  European Central Bank , assume the operation of the
euro-region rescue funds and set up a debt-reduction fund that
would acquire all euro-area government debt higher than 60
percent of the countries’ GDP, the FT said.  Soros has been proposing the institution of such an EFA for
some time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
