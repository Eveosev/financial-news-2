A collision between two ships
resulted in an  oil spill  in the sea outside  Singapore , according
to the  Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore .           The
accident between bulk carrier, Sunny Horizon, and liquefied
petroleum gas carrier, Dl Salvia, happened at the Temasek
Fairway, about 700 meters east of Sultan Shoal at 2 p.m. local
time, the port authority said.  Workers are now cleaning up the oil spill. The two vessels
involved are safely anchored in the West Jurong anchorage. No
one was injured and port operations remain unaffected, the MPA
