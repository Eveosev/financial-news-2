Car bombs killed 12 people in  Iraq ’s
northern oil hub of Kirkuk, including seven recruits slain in a
blast while waiting outside the police headquarters of state-run
North Oil Co., security officials said.  “The explosion didn’t affect the production and export
operations because it happened outside the company’s
headquarters,” Oil Police Colonel Ghanim al-Quraishi said today
in a telephone interview from Kirkuk. No one claimed
responsibility for the attack, according to North Oil’s police.  A separate attack in Tuz Khormato district killed three
people, while two others died in a blast in al-Haweeja district,
police in Kirkuk said in an e-mailed statement. The suicide car
bomb at North Oil wounded 17 recruits, Aywa Salah, a North Oil
police colonel, said by phone from Kirkuk. An additional 39
people were hurt in the other two explosions, according to local
police.  Iraq, the largest producer, after  Saudi Arabia , in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumps crude oil
from fields near Kirkuk for export through a pipeline to the
port of Ceyhan,  Turkey . Kirkuk lies adjacent to Iraq’s semi-
autonomous Kurdish region and is claimed by Kurdish authorities,
though the central government in  Baghdad  controls the city. The
oil-export pipeline from Kirkuk has been a frequent target of
sabotage since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
