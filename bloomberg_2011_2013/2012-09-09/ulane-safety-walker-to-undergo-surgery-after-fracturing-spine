Tulane University  safety Devon
Walker will undergo surgery after fracturing his spine during
yesterday’s 45-10 loss to the  University of Tulsa .  Walker is in a stable condition in St. Francis Hospital in
Tulsa,  Oklahoma , and will need surgery in the “next day or
so,” Buddy Savoie, a Tulane team doctor, said at a news
conference after the game.  Walker, a senior at the New Orleans-based school majoring
in cell and molecular biology, was injured in a helmet-to-helmet
collision with teammate Julius Warmsley on the final play of the
first half at H.A. Chapman Stadium in Tulsa. Walker was taken
from the field in an ambulance.  “He was stable when we transported him,” Savoie said. “I
do not think, based on the information we have, his life was
ever in danger.”  Walker has some feeling in his arms and legs, Greg Stewart,
a Tulane team doctor, told the  New Orleans Times-Picayune . The
player is being treated for swelling to the neck and is in
traction, Tulane said in a statement last night.  The game was the first for the schools this season in the
 Conference USA  portion of their football schedules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
