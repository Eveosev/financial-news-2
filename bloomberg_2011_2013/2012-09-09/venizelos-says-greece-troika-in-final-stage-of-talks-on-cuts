Evangelos Venizelos , leader of the
Pasok party which supports Greece’s coalition government, said
negotiations with international creditors on an 11.5 billion-
euro package of spending cuts required in exchange for bailout
funds are in their final stage.  “The talks haven’t closed because the troika hasn’t
accepted the total package of proposed measures so now we need
to make counterproposals,” Venizelos said in live comments on
state-run NET TV after a meeting with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras in Athens today.  Venizelos said Pasok continues to support the three party
coalition government and once final decisions are taken on the
budget cuts for 2013 and 2014 the next tranche of bailout funds
will be immediately released to  Greece  and talks on a two-year
extension of the program and debt reduction will begin with
European Union officials.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
