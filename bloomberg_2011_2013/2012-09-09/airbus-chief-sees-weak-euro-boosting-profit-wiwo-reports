Airbus SAS may beat the operating
profit numbers it forecast by 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) due
to the weak euro,  WirtschaftsWoche  quoted Chief Executive
Officer Fabrice Bregier as saying in an interview.  The current exchange rate of 1.25 euros per dollars means
an additional operating profit of “about a billion euros,” the
magazine cited Bregier as saying in a preview of tomorrow’s
edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
