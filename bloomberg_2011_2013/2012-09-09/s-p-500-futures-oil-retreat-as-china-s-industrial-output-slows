U.S. equity futures fell, oil
dropped and the  New Zealand dollar  slid as China’s industrial
output grew at the slowest pace in three years and President  Hu
Jintao  said the economy faces “notable downward pressure.”  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures lost 0.1 percent to
1,436.60 as of 7:16 a.m. in Tokyo after the equity gauge last
week reached the highest level since 2008. Oil retreated 0.1
percent to $96.30 a barrel in New York. The New Zealand dollar
depreciated 0.2 percent to 81.09 U.S. cents.  Industrial production in China increased 8.9 percent in
August from a year earlier and fixed-asset investment growth in
the first eight months eased to 20.2 percent, the National
Bureau of Statistics said yesterday in Beijing. Inflation
accelerated for the first time in five months. The data
underscore risks that full-year growth in the world’s second-
biggest economy will slide to its lowest level in more than two
decades.  The  S&P 500  last week added 2.2 percent to 1,437.92, its
biggest rally since June. It rose within 10 percent of its all-
time high in October 2007. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
finished at the highest level since December 2007.  U.S. retail sales probably improved for a second month in
August as consumers overcame a lack of jobs and stagnant wages,
economists said before reports this week. A 0.7 percent increase
in purchases would follow a 0.8 percent July advance, according
to the median forecast of 66 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  ahead of Commerce Department figures on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
