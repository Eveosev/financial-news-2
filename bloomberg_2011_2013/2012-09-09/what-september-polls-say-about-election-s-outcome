Over the last 40 years, the shape of most presidential races was evident in the September polls that  followed the convention . A few anomalies, as measured by the  Gallup  poll: Four years ago, when Senator John McCain of Arizona got a bump that even most Republicans knew wouldn't last. And in 2000, when the Democratic nominee, Vice President  Al Gore , again with a convention bump, had a lead (actually, Gore ended up winning the popular vote that year). The real outlier was 1980, when  Ronald Reagan  trailed President Jimmy Carter by seven points in early September and ended up winning by almost 10 points; campaigns can matter. Here are Gallup's horse-race surveys in September of the last 10 presidential-election years compared with the final results.                                               Early Sept. poll              Final 2008 Barack Obama                        46                                52.9 John McCain                           48                                45.7 2004 John Kerry                              47                                48.3 George W.
