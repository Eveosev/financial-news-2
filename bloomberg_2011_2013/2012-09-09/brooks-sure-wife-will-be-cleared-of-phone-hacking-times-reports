Charlie Brooks is “100 percent
confident” that his wife, Rebekah, the former chief executive
of News International Newspapers Ltd., will be cleared of all
charges of phone hacking, he said in an interview with the
Sunday Times.  The racehorse trainer said he would be disappointed if the
phone-hacking allegations as well as the charge of conspiracy of
perverting the court of justice, for which Brooks and his wife
are scheduled to appear in court on Sept. 26, were dropped as it
would deprive the duo of the chance to clear their name,
according to the interview.  The regularity with which Brooks and his wife have had to
attend court hearings in recent months has resulted in the two
becoming “so weathered to it, we hardly bother to talk about
it,” he told the Sunday Times, adding that his wife may look
back on this phase of her life as a catalyst for the second half
of her life and regard it as a good thing to have happened.  Brooks also said in the interview that he thought his
friendship with British Prime Minister  David Cameron , whom he
attended Eton School with, could be resurrected in future years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
