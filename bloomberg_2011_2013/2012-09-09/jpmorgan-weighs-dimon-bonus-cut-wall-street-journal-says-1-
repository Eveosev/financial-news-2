JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is considering cutting 2012 bonuses for
senior managers including Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ,
according to the Wall Street Journal.  The bank’s board of directors is weighing the cuts after
botched bets on derivatives, the newspaper reported today,
citing people close to the discussions whom it didn’t identify.
 Joe Evangelisti , a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.  The market value of New York-based JPMorgan has dropped by
$20 billion since Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that the
firm amassed a large and illiquid position in credit derivatives
at its chief investment office in London. The bank lost $5.8
billion on the trades during the first six months of this year
and has said it could lose as much as $7.5 billion total while
closing out the position.  Dimon, who was awarded $23 million in salary and bonuses
for his performance in 2011, said previously it’s up to the
board whether his pay will be reduced when an internal  task
force  concludes an investigation into the botched trades.  “The board, as an independent group, is still guiding this
task force and will come to its own conclusions,” Dimon, 56,
said on a July 13 conference call with analysts and investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
