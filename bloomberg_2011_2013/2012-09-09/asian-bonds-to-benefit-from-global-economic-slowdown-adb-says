Investors will buy Asian bonds in
the next 12 months as slowing global growth makes other assets
less attractive, according to Iwan Azis, head of the office of
regional economic integration at the  Asian Development Bank .  Volatile equity markets and a banking industry ravaged by
the Libor scandal have increased the relative appeal of
emerging-market debt, Azis said by phone from Manila on Sept. 7.
The Philippines-based lender publishes its quarterly Asian Bond
Monitor today.  “Investors are having difficulty parking their money and
the  bond market  is the only ‘safe’ market,” Azis said. Fixed-
income securities will remain “strong,” implying continued
stagnation in the world economy, he said.  In the seven-day period ended Sept. 6, funds dedicated to
emerging-market debt had their 13th-straight week of inflows,
the longest stretch since mid-2011, according to a Morgan
Stanley report citing data provider EPFR Global.  Growth in the global economy will slow to 2.3 percent this
year from 2.9 percent in 2011, according to the median forecast
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Our message to policy makers is ’Don’t be complacent,
because the contagion is there,’ Azis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
