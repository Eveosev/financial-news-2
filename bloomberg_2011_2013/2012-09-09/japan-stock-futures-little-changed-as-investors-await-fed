Japanese  stock futures  were little
changed as investors considered whether the  Federal Reserve  will
step up economic stimulus this week and  China ’s industrial
output dropped. Australian equity futures gained.  American Depositary Receipts  of BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, gained 2 percent as metals
prices advanced. ADRs of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-
biggest construction-equipment maker that gets 24 percent of
sales in the Americas, climbed 0.4 percent after a weaker-than
estimated U.S. payrolls report. Hitachi Construction Machinery
Ltd. may be active as China’s industrial output grew at the
slowest pace in three years. Technology stocks from Nikon Corp.
to Tokyo Electron Ltd. may be active after  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the
world’s No. 1 semiconductor maker, cut its sales forecast.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring this
month closed at 8,875 in Chicago Sept. 7, down from 8,880 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,870 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 0.4 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.6
percent in Wellington. The  Federal Open Market Committee  will
meet Sept. 12-13 to discuss monetary policy.  “Following the weak U.S. jobs report, the backdrop is
ideal to act this week and deliver more quantitative easing,”
said George Boubouras, Melbourne-based head of investment
strategy at UBS AG’s Australian wealth management unit. The
Swiss bank has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management.
“This week is looking like the last window for the Fed to
act,” before the U.S. election.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The underlying index gained 0.4 percent on Sept. 7 as
Labor Department figures showed the economy added 96,000 workers
last month following a revised 141,000 increase in July that was
smaller than initially estimated. The median estimate of 92
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain of 130,000.
The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.1 percent, and
hourly earnings were unchanged.  Intel’s third-quarter sales will be $12.9 billion to $13.5
billion, down from a prior projection of $13.8 billion to $14.8
billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a
statement on Sept. 7. Analysts on average had estimated sales of
$14.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In China, industrial production increased 8.9 percent in
August from a year earlier and fixed-asset investment growth in
the first eight months eased to 20.2 percent, the National
Bureau of Statistics said yesterday in Beijing. The data
underscore risks that full-year growth in the world’s second-
biggest economy will slow to the weakest level in more than two
decades.  Europe Debt  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  has fallen more than 7 percent
from this year’s high on Feb. 29, dragging the value of shares
on the Asian benchmark index to 12.4 times estimated earnings.
That compares with 13.9 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 12 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Still, the Asian benchmark rallied Sept 7. by the most
since Dec. 1 after ECB President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers
agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program as they try to
regain control of  interest rates  in the euro area.  The London Metals Exchange of industrials metals surged 3
percent Sept. 7.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. advanced 1.2 percent on Sept. 7 to
end last week at 88.84.  To contact the reporter on this story:
