Defending champion Novak Djokovic
has evened his U.S. Open semifinal against fourth-seeded  David
Ferrer  of Spain in a match that was halted yesterday by the
threat of severe weather and resumed this morning at the
National Tennis Center in New York.  Djokovic, 25, from Serbia, who is trying to reach the final
for the third consecutive year, won the second set 6-1 after
Ferrer, 30, won the first set 6-2.  Ferrer was leading 5-2 in the first set yesterday when the
match was stopped because of the weather.  The winner will play third-seeded  Andy Murray , 25, of
Britain, who swept into the men’s final yesterday with a
blustery four-set victory against No. 6 Tomas Berdych of the
Czech Republic that was delayed by rain and bedeviled by wind.
Berdych had eliminated five-time champion  Roger Federer  of
Switzerland in the quarterfinals.  Three-time champion Serena Williams, 30, of the U.S. will
play top-seeded Victoria Azarenka, 23, of Belarus in the women’s
final later this afternoon. The match was postponed from last
night because of the severe weather.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
