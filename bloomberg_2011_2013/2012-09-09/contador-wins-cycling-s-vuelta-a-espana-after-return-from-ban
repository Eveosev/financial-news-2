Alberto Contador , who returned from
a two-year doping ban last month, won cycling’s Vuelta a Espana
for a second time today.  The 29-year-old Spaniard, who rides for the Saxo-Bank team,
finished ahead of countrymen Alejandro Valverde and Joaquim
Rodriguez in the three-week event, which he also won in 2008.  “This victory is maybe the most beautiful of all my
wins,” he told  Agence France-Presse .  Contador was suspended and stripped of his 2010 Tour de
France title after he tested positive for muscle-building
stimulant clenbuterol on the way to winning that race. He also
lost his 2011 Giro d’Italia title.  A laboratory in Cologne found 50 picograms per milliliter
of clenbuterol in a urine sample he gave to anti-doping
officials on the last rest day of the 2010 Tour de France, an
amount ruling body  Union Cycliste Internationale  called “very
small.” A picogram is one trillionth of a gram.  Veterinarians in Spain rejected Contador’s defense that the
presence of the drug came from eating contaminated beef.  Germany’s John Degenkolb of the Argos-Shimano team won
today’s final stage of the Vuelta, with Contador in 54th spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
