South Koreaâ€™s producer prices
returned to inflation in August after a dip into deflation in
the previous month.  Prices rose 0.3 percent from a year earlier, after a 0.1
percent decline in July, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement
today. The gain was 0.7 percent from the previous month.  Producer-price inflation has moderated this year from
levels as high as 7 percent during 2011, highlighting room for
cutting benchmark  interest rates  to support growth. Twelve
economists in a Bloomberg News survey all forecast that the Bank
of Korea will make a reduction at its next meeting on Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
