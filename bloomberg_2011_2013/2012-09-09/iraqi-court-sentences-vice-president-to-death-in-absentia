An Iraqi court sentenced Vice
President Tariq al-Hashimi, the top Sunni Muslim politician, to
death in absentia on terrorism charges, said Abdel Sattar al-
Bairaqdar, spokesman for the supreme judicial council.  Hashimi has the right to appeal the sentencing, al-
Bairaqdar said in a phone interview today. One of Hashimi’s
bodyguards was also given a death sentence.  Hashimi left  Baghdad  late last year after an arrest warrant
was issued for him. State-sponsored Iraqiya television aired
what it described as confessions by his bodyguards saying that
they committed murder at his request in return for money.
Hashimi said the confessions were fabricated.  The Sunni politician flew in April to Istanbul from  Qatar ,
where the minister of state in charge of foreign affairs had
refused an extradition request. Turkey has called efforts by
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite formerly exiled
in  Iran , to arrest Hashimi “unacceptable.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
