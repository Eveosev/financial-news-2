French President  Francois Hollande 
may lower the countryâ€™s 2013 economic growth forecast to 1
percent, Le  Journal du Dimanche  reported, without citing anyone.  Hollande may unveil the cut from the initial 1.2 percent
forecast during his television interview later today. He may
also announce the first elements of the 2013 budget, which is
due to be unveiled at the end of the month, the weekly newspaper
said today.  Hollande last week pledged to stick to his 3 percent budget
deficit target and may today announce taxes increases of as much
as 20 billion euros ($25.6 billion), JDD said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
