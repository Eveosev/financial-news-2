Ireland’s government is being
“pushed” to make faster progress on a property tax and a
reform of social welfare by the troika of the  International
Monetary Fund , the European Union and the  European Central Bank ,
the  Sunday Business Post  reported, without citing anyone.  The IMF’s quarterly report on the country will be published
tomorrow and will say that aspects of Ireland’s social welfare
system are “unsustainable” while a property tax should be
implemented quickly, the Dublin-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
