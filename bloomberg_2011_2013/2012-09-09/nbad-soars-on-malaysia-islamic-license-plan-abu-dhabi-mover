National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC 
climbed the most in almost a year after the largest lender in
the United Arab Emirates by  market value  said it plans to seek
an Islamic banking license in  Malaysia .  The shares jumped 4.4 percent, the most since Oct. 30, to
8.83 dirhams at the close in the emirate. The benchmark  ADX
General Index (ADSMI)  advanced 1 percent.  The Abu Dhabi-based lender wants to expand after starting
non-Islamic commercial banking operations in Southeast Asia’s
third-largest economy in July, Leong See Meng, chief executive
officer of National Bank of Abu Dhabi Malaysia Bhd, said in an
interview in Kuala Lumpur Sept. 7. Malaysia’s Islamic banking
assets rose 21 percent to 359 billion ringgit ($115 billion) in
July from a year ago, driven by government incentives for
Shariah-compliant products, according to central bank data.  “Investors liked the news that NBAD is venturing into
Islamic banking in Malaysia,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at
Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi was among five foreign
institutions, including  Indonesia ’s PT Bank Mandiri, which
received central bank approval in 2010 to begin non-Shariah
banking operations. “There are opportunities across the
board,” Leong said.  National Bank of  Abu Dhabi  already offers products that
comply with the religion’s ban on interest in the United Arab
Emirates, including  savings accounts , treasury instruments and
trade financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
