Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis, who supports the coalition government of Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras, said no decision had been taken on
11.5 billion euros of spending cuts needed to release
international funds.  Kouvelis said he aimed to protect lower-income earners from
the cuts and that another meeting would be held on Sept. 12.  “Our European partners need to know that Greeks can’t take
anymore,” Kouvelis said after meeting with Samaras and Pasok
leader  Evangelos Venizelos  in Athens today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
