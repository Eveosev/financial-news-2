England center-back John Terry will
miss the World Cup qualifying match against Ukraine on Sept. 11
with an ankle injury he sustained in a 5-0 win against Moldova
two days ago.  The Chelsea defender has returned to his club following
further treatment by England’s medical staff today, English
soccer’s Football Association said in a  statement  on its
website.  Terry’s club teammate  Ashley Cole  has already been ruled
out of the match at London’s Wembley Stadium.   Terry started alongside Joleon Lescott against Moldova.
 Gary Cahill  and Phil Jagielka are the other center-back options
in manager Roy Hodgson’s squad.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
