CBRE Group Inc. (CBG) , a commercial real
estate services firm, acquired U.K. real estate investment firm
Franc Warwick Chartered Surveyors.  Franc Warwick, led by co-founder Franco Sidoli, focuses on
shopping centers, hotels, industrial and high street retail, Los
Angeles-based CBRE said today in a statement. The terms of the
transaction were not disclosed.  “The U.K.’s, and more specifically  London ’s, property
sector is an increasingly international market, attracting
capital from all corners of the globe,” Franco Sidoli said in
the statement. “Access to a truly global network of highly
experienced investment and other experts is becoming an
intrinsic part of our market.”  CBRE’s Capital Markets teams advised on U.K. deals this
year including the acquisition of the Sentrum portfolio by
 Digital Realty Trust Inc. (DLR)  for 715 million pounds ($1.15
billion), CBRE said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
