Sainsbury’s Bank Plc will offer two
new credit cards beginning Sept. 11, doubling the number of
cards it provides, the company said in a press release today.  The Sainsbury’s Nectar Credit Card will allow customers to
receive five times the amount of loyalty points they would
normally receive from transactions at the store. The other card,
the Sainsbury’s Cashback Credit Card, will offer 5 percent cash
back on purchases made in the store for the first three months.  “With around 25 percent of all retail credit card
transactions taking place in supermarkets, now is a very
exciting time to launch a new credit card proposition,” said
Hannah Bernard, interim chief executive officer of Sainsbury’s
Bank.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , the U.K.’s third-largest grocery chain,
was the first major British supermarket to open a bank when it
created Sainsbury’s Bank in February 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
