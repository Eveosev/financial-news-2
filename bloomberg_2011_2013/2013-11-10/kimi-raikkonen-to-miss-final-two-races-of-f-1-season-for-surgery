Formula One driver  Kimi Raikkonen 
will miss the final two races of this season to have surgery on
his back, his Lotus team said in a statement.  The 34-year-old Finn, who will return to the Ferrari team
next season, currently lies third in the drivers’ standings
behind Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of
Ferrari. Vettel is already assured of a fourth straight title.  Raikkonen won the world title in 2007 with Ferrari.  Lotus said it will announce “in due course” who will
drive in Raikkonen’s place at the U.S. and Brazilian Grands
Prix, at Austin and Sao Paulo on Nov 17 and 24, respectively.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
