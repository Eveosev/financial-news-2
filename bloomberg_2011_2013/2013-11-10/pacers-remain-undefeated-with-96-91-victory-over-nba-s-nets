The  Indiana Pacers  extended their
win streak to seven games with a 96-91 National Basketball
Association victory over the Brooklyn Nets.  The Pacers are the only undefeated team in the league as
they make their best start in franchise history.  Paul George led the Pacers with 24 points as the team
trailed by 46-44 at halftime.  David West  added 18 points and Roy Hibbert and Lance Stephenson each had 15.  “We executed,” George told reporters last night. “That’s
the maturity for this team. Years ago we would have lost that
game.”  Deron Williams and Joe Johnson each scored 17 points for
the Nets who fell to 2-4 after the loss on their home court at
Barclays Center. Brook Lopez had 16 points and  Paul Pierce  added
15.  “We’re just learning to play together,” Williams said.
“We didn’t have everybody healthy for training camp and we’re
all coming together and trying to win a championship and it
doesn’t happen overnight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
