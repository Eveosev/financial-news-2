(Corrects two weeks to three in first paragraph.)  The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 14.57 cents in the past three weeks
to $3.2171 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey was conducted on Nov. 8 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak in the
survey of $3.795 on Feb. 22, is about 32.9 cents below the year-earlier price of $3.5454 a gallon.  “This may well be the end of the price cutting for now,”
 Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “It is mostly due to lower crude
oil prices that is the biggest reason for the declines at the
pump.”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was  San Francisco , at $3.67 a gallon,
Lundberg said.  The lowest price was in Tulsa, where customers paid an
average of $2.82 a gallon. Regular gasoline averaged $3.48 on
Long Island and $3.61 in  Los Angeles .  Gasoline futures  on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange fell
12 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $2.5534 a gallon in the three weeks
ended Nov. 8.  In the three weeks to Nov. 8, West Texas Intermediate crude
fell $6.21, or 6.2 percent, to $94.60 a barrel on the Nymex.  Since Sept. 6, gasoline prices have fallen by 36.76 cents,
Lundberg said.  Lundberg said there is less anxiety about the political
situation in Syria and  Iran , and that means confidence is high
for stable supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
