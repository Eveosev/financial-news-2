About 2,300 workers at  Anglo
American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) ’s Dishaba mine in  South Africa ’s Limpopo
province have been on an underground strike since 5 a.m.
yesterday, and some are said to be held against their will.  The workers are demanding a halt to the suspension of an
Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union shop steward,
Amplats said in an e-mailed statement today.  A rival union, the  National Union of Mineworkers , issued a
statement in which it called the sit-in a “hostage drama.”
Some of the workers at the mine, 113 miles (182 kilometers)
northwest of Johannesburg, are NUM members and are “being held
against their will,” Frans Baleni, NUM general secretary, said
by phone.  Amplats, the world’s biggest producer of platinum, accounts
for about 38 percent of world production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
