Iran ’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said
France has been “openly hostile” toward his country in recent
years in what amounted to an “imprudent and inept’ stance.  The comments, posted today on the Twitter account of
Khamenei, the country’s highest authority, follow three days of
negotiations between top officials from Iran and world powers
aimed at easing the dispute over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear
program. The talks ended in Geneva, Switzerland, late yesterday
without an accord.  Efforts faltered after French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius insisted that any deal should include suspension of
construction on Iran’s partially built heavy-water reactor in
Arak, along with commitments to reduce its stockpile of 20
percent enriched uranium.  ‘‘French officials have been openly hostile towards the
Iranian nation over the past few years,” Khamenei said in the
remarks on Twitter. “This is an imprudent and inept move.”  A Western diplomat, who asked not to be named because of
the delicacy of the negotiations, said yesterday that the U.S.,
the European Union and Iran had worked for months on a proposal
and criticized the French for raising last-minute objections.  A second message posted minutes later today on Khamenei’s
Twitter account and that carried a March date at the end, he
reiterated comments he seemingly made then with the addition of
the hashtag # France .  “A wise man, particularly a wise politician, should never
have the motivation to turn a neutral entity into an enemy,”
Khamenei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
