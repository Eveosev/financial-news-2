Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Famer
Bill Mazeroski’s memorabilia collection, including the uniform
he wore when he won the 1960 World Series with a Game 7 walk-off
home run, was sold at auction for more than $1.7 million,
according to Hunt Auctions.  The World Series uniform was sold for $632,500 yesterday at
the 10th Annual Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory Live Auction
in Louisville,  Kentucky .  “I was completely overwhelmed and humbled by the auction
of my sports memorabilia collection that I witnessed,”
Mazeroski said in a statement. “I had no idea the tremendous
value of these treasures I have held on to all these years.”  Mazeroski, 77, played for the Pirates from 1956-1972 and
was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001. He played on
two championship teams in 1960 against the  New York  Yankees and
1971 when the Pirates beat the defending champion Baltimore
Orioles in seven games.  Mazeroski’s bronzed bat went for $322,000; a set of bronzed
cleats was sold for $97,750; the player’s Gold Glove awards from
1958, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966 and 1967 fetched $193,775; the
Roberto Clemente bat given to Mazeroski was auctioned for
$86,250; and his 1960 Babe Ruth Award reached $41,400.  “Bill’s legacy as one of the greatest players in
Pittsburgh Pirates history coupled with the iconic status of his
legendary 1960 World Series home run served as an appropriate
foundation for the incredible prices realized at the auction,”
said David Hunt, president of Exton, Pennsylvania-based Hunt
Auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
