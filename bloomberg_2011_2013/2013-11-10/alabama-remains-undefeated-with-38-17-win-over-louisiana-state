A.J. McCarron threw for three
touchdowns as he helped top-ranked  University of Alabama  remain
undefeated with a 38-17 victory over No. 13  Louisiana State
University  in college football.  In other games involving top 10-ranked Bowl Championship
Series teams, it was No. 2 Florida State 59, Wake Forest 3; No.
8 Missouri 48, Kentucky 17; and No. 9 Auburn 55, Tennessee 23.  McCarron passed for 179 yards, including three touchdown
passes of 52, nine and three yards for the Crimson Tide (9-0,
6-0  Southeastern Conference ).  “All he does is win and does what his team needs for him
to do,” said Alabama coach Nick Saban, referring to his senior
quarterback. “I think the guy is the best quarterback in the
country.”  T.J. Yeldon rushed for 133 yards and scored on runs of four
and one yard to break a third-quarter 17-17 tie on LSU kicker
Colby Delahoussaye’s 41-yard field goal.  Zach Mettenberger passed for 241 yards and one touchdown
for the Tigers (7-3, 3-3 SEC) and was sacked four times at
Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama .  To contact the reporter on this story:
