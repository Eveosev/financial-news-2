The  New Orleans Saints  rebounded
from a Week 9 loss with a 49-17 rout of the  Dallas Cowboys  that
left the NFC East as the only National Football League division
without a team possessing a winning record.  Drew Brees  passed for 392 yards and four touchdowns last
night in New Orleans as the Saints (7-2) amassed 625 yards of
offense and an NFL-record 40 first downs.  Dallas fell to 5-5 and is tied atop the NFC East with the
 Philadelphia Eagles , who beat the Green Bay Packers 27-13 at
Lambeau Field as Nick Foles followed his record-tying seven
touchdown performance with three scoring passes. The  New York 
Giants pulled within 1 1/2 games of the division lead with a
third straight win following their 0-6 start, scoring the final
10 points in yesterday’s 24-20 victory over the Oakland Raiders.  “We’re trying to go one game at a time and see where we
are,” Giants coach  Tom Coughlin  said during a news conference.
“We just made it another notch closer.”  The Giants next play the Packers (5-4), who lost their
second straight game since losing 2011 NFL Most Valuable Player
 Aaron Rodgers  to a shoulder injury. Third-string quarterback
Scott Tolzien played for the Packers yesterday after Seneca Wallace suffered a groin injury on his team’s opening drive.  Peyton Manning  threw at least four touchdown passes for the
fifth time this season as the Denver Broncos (8-1) held on for a
28-20 win over the San Diego Chargers (4-5). Manning and
 Demaryius Thomas  hooked up for touchdowns on three straight
possessions spanning the second and third quarters as the
Broncos opened a 28-6 lead in San Diego.  Touchdown Passes  Manning’s 33 touchdowns are tied with  Tom Brady ’s 2007
tally for the most through the first nine games of an NFL
season. Manning said he’ll undergo tests today after suffering
an undisclosed left leg injury during the fourth quarter.  The  Detroit Lions  (6-3) took over first place in the NFC
North Division with a 21-19 win over the Chicago Bears (5-4).
 Matthew Stafford  threw three touchdown passes for the Lions,
including two to  Calvin Johnson .  The Baltimore Ravens gave up a tying touchdown on a
desperation pass on the final play of the fourth quarter before
beating the Cincinnati Bengals 20-17 on a 46-yard field goal by
Justin Tucker on the second possession of overtime. The Bengals
(6-4) forced overtime when  Andy Dalton ’s 51-yard heave into the
end zone was caught by A.J. Green after it was tipped into the
air by James Ihedigbo of the Ravens (4-5).  Seahawks Win  The Seattle Seahawks improved to 9-1 with a 33-10 win over
the  Atlanta Falcons  (2-7), avenging a defeat at the Georgia Dome
in last season’s playoffs. Russell Wilson threw two touchdown
passes for the Seahawks and Marshawn Lynch rushed for 145 yards
and a score.  The Jacksonville Jaguars (1-8) won their first game of the
season, 29-27 over Tennessee, by taking advantage of four
turnovers by the Titans (4-5), who were listed by oddsmakers as
11 1/2-point favorites. Will Blackmon scored a touchdown for the
Jaguars on a 21-yard fumble return with two minutes, 32 seconds
left in the fourth quarter.  The St. Louis Rams (4-6) pulled off a 38-8 upset of the
Indianapolis Colts (6-3) as rookie Tavon Austin scored
touchdowns of 98, 57 and 81 yards, while the Carolina Panthers
(6-3) extended their winning streak to five games with a 10-9
victory over the San Francisco 49ers (6-3), who had a five-game
winning streak halted.  Texans’ Skid  Elsewhere, it was Pittsburgh 23, Buffalo 10; and  Arizona 
27, Houston 24. It was the seventh straight loss for the Texans
(2-7), who were coached by defensive  Wade Phillips  while  Gary Kubiak  recovers from a mini-stroke he suffered during a Nov. 3
loss to the Colts.  Week 10 play -- which began Nov. 7 with a 34-27 win for the
Minnesota Vikings (2-7) against the Washington Redskins (3-6) --
concludes tonight as the winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers (0-8) host
the Miami Dolphins (4-4).  In New Orleans, Brees connected on 34-of-41 passes as the
Saints scored seven touchdowns and outgained the Cowboys 625-193
in total yardage. The tally was the most ever allowed by Dallas,
surpassing the 623 given up in a Week 8 loss to the Detroit
Lions. Saints defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was fired from the
same position with the Cowboys after last season.  “As players, we wanted to go out there and get this win
for Rob,” Saints linebacker Curtis Lofton said.  First Downs  Darren Sproles and Pierre Thomas each scored two touchdowns
for the Saints, who finished with only three fewer first downs
than the Cowboys’ total 43 offensive plays.  Tony Romo  completed 10-of-24 passes for 128 yards and a
touchdown for Dallas.  In East Rutherford, New Jersey, the Giants scored on a
blocked punt by Cooper Taylor and a five-yard pass from Manning
to Rueben Randle, yet trailed 17-14 at halftime as Tracy Porter
returned Manning’s league-leading 16th interception of the
season 43 yards for a touchdown.  Sebastian Janikowski kicked his second field goal of the
game to push the Raiders’ lead to 20-14 before Andre Brown,
playing for the first time since fracturing a leg bone during
the preseason, scored on a one-yard run for the Giants with 2:15
left in the third quarter. Brown had been activated three days
ago and rushed for 115 yards on 30 carries.  “He gave us what we needed,” Coughlin said. “He had a
little spark out there.”  The Kansas City Chiefs (9-0), the only undefeated team in
the league, New York Jets (5-4), New England Patriots (7-2) and
Cleveland Browns (4-5) don’t play this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
