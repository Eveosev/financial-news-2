Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Bob Menendez said he wants to advance a package of
added economic sanctions against  Iran  that could be lifted if an
“acceptable” deal on the nation’s nuclear program is struck.  He said it would provide “insurance” to the  United States 
that fall-back penalties would be in place if Iran won’t agree
to conditions that the U.S. and its allies can approve.  “I look forward to working with my colleagues in the
Senate to move forward on a package that ultimately will send a
very clear message where we intend to be if the Iranians don’t
strike a deal to stop their nuclear weapons program,” Menendez,
a New Jersey Democrat, said on ABC’s “This Week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
