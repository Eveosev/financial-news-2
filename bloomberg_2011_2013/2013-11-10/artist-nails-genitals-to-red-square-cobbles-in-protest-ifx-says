A Russian artist was detained by
police after he nailed his scrotum to the cobblestones near
Lenin’s Mausoleum on Red Square in Moscow, Interfax reported.  Pyotr Pavlensky was taken to hospital by police for
treatment and is being questioned, the news service said.  Pavlensky sewed his lips together last year to protest the
two-year sentence handed down to female Russian punk group Pussy
Riot for hooliganism and inciting religious hatred after they
performed a song critical of President  Vladimir Putin  inside
Moscow’s Christ the Savior cathedral, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
