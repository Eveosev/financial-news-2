Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish engineering
company with operations in more than 80 countries, will build
and operate a $165 million wind farm in Uruguay, its third in
that nation.  Construction of the 70-megawatt project in the northwestern
region of Salto is expected to start early next year and take 14
months, Seville-based Abengoa said today in a statement. The
project will have 35 two-megawatt wind turbines.  Abengoa expects to invest $6 million in the wind farm,
which will be leased to state-owned utility Administracion
Nacional de Usinas & Trasmisiones Electricas, according to the
statement.  Abengoa will soon complete a 50-megawatt wind farm in the
Tacuarembo region and is about to start construction on another
50-megawatt project in the Flores region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
