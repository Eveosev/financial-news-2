China banned officials from
spending money reserved for meetings on banquets or luxury
accommodation, as the Communist Party battles public discontent
over the waste of government funds.  Agencies shouldn’t hold meetings at scenic areas and events
that might last for three days should be shortened, the Finance
Ministry said on its website today. Officials should also hold
video or phone conferences to cut costs, it said.  The tighter rules add to restrictions the party has imposed
as part of a broader frugality campaign after President Xi
Jinping took over the Communist Party last year with a warning
that it had become “divorced from the people.”  The inappropriate use of money reserved for meetings has
“harmed the image of the party and government agencies” and
caused public discontent, the Finance Ministry said.  The frugality campaign previously targeted spending on
lavish receptions, trips abroad and even floral arrangements.
Officials were barred from accepting expensive mooncakes, a
popular gift during China’s Mid-Autumn Festival. In the city of
Wenzhou, officials may no longer expense shark’s fin soup and
high-end liquor.  The rules announced today take effect Jan. 1, and also bar
government departments from siphoning off money reserved for
meetings into “little treasuries” they hold, according to the
ministry.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
