The Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund
is boosting its holdings of high-yield debt, including floating-rate bank loans, while reducing equities to limit volatility.  The fund, which represents active and retired police
officers and firefighters from Ohio municipalities, plans to
lift its allocation of speculative-grade debt to 15 percent of
its $13.34  billion  from 12.3 percent in as soon as two years,
Executive Director  John Gallagher  said. PENN Capital Management
Co. Inc. and MacKay Shields LLC were approved to invest $400
million in senior bank loans in June, increasing the high-yield
allocation to $1.65 billion.  “It’s an effort to get more fully diversified across the
portfolio so we can absorb equity-market risk when it takes a
turn like it has in both directions,” Gallagher said in a Sept.
17 telephone interview. The goal for investing in bank loans was
to “keep it in the fixed-income market that we thought would be
a little less volatile and a little less exposed,” he said.  The fund, based in Columbus,  Ohio , has increased its
allocation of debt rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service
and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s  from 9.3 percent at
year-end, or $1.22 billion, according to its annual  report .  The fund’s U.S. equity holdings fell to 27.8 percent as of
July 31 from 32.2 percent at the end of 2012, according to the
report. Its non-U.S. equity holdings increased to 24.2 percent
from 23.7 percent.  Floating-rate bank debt is paid based on a spread over the
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, the rate at which banks
say they can borrow from each other. It was set at 25 basis on
Sept. 20. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
