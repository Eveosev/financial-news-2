Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-biggest
oil company, said annual production will rise in the next three
years as capital expenditure peaks.  Total will start up projects in  Norway ,  Angola  and the
North Sea in the coming months and keep output growth targets,
the company said in a statement today. Capital spending is
expected to fall to $24 billion to $25 billion in 2015 to 2017
compared with $28 billion to $29 billion this year, according to
Chief Financial Officer Patrick de la Chevardiere.  “The biggest part of the investment program is now behind
us,” Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said during
a presentation to brief investors on strategy. “The next step
is to bring the cash in.”  De Margerie has pledged to raise oil and natural gas
output, explore more aggressively for new deposits and sell
assets. A second-quarter  production increase  was the first year-on-year gain since the last three months of 2010. The explorer
has also set a goal of $15 billion to $20 billion in asset sales
from 2012 to 2014.  The shares rose as much as 1.6 percent and were trading
57.5 cents higher to 42.95 euros at 10:40 a.m. in Paris  “The group anticipates investments to trend down starting
in 2014 as it enters a growth phase for production and free cash
flow,” Total said in a statement. Total expects a “strong
increase in cash flow from upstream startups and downstream
restructuring.”  High Potential  Total is planning to drill “high potential” wells in the
Gulf of Mexico,  Iraq ,  Brazil  and Angola by the end of 2014, it
said today.  The oil explorer reiterated a goal to raise output
potential to about 3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in
2017 and said it would reach 2.6 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2015. Production advanced 1.3 percent to
2.29 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the second
quarter.  The number of projects starting up in the next three years
will almost double compared with the previous three, Total said
in a presentation. It also plans to sanction investment in the
Yamal LNG project as well as one at Fort Hills in  Canada  this
year, both of which would begin production in 2017.  Total confirmed a target to reduce its European refining
and petrochemicals business by 20 percent from last year to
2017. It pledged to raise a profitability target to 13 percent
from 9.5 percent currently for the division overall while
lowering capex 30 percent through 2017.  Growing Markets  In the marketing and services division, Total plans to
“adapt its positions in Europe and expand in growing markets
particularly in  Africa  and the Middle East,” it said.  The number of retail stations in Africa and the Middle East
will increase to 5,400 in 2017 from 4,400, Total said.  As the biggest refiner in western Europe, where it operates
eight plants including five in France, the company has borne the
brunt of lower margins and a drop in the consumption of fuel
products.  “Consumption and demand are declining in Europe,” de la
Chevardiere said today at a press conference in  London . “We may
reduce capacity of some plants.”  The explorer won’t close a European refinery in the next
two years, he said.  As well as investing in new fields, Total has sold assets
such as a gas network in  France  and a field offshore Nigeria.  To contact the reporters on this story:
