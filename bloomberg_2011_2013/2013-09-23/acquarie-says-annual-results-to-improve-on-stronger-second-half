Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia ’s
largest investment bank, expects its financial results for the
year ending March 2014 will improve from the previous 12 months,
driven by a stronger second half.  Results for the six months ending Sept. 30 will be broadly
in line with the previous half year, Sydney-based Macquarie said
in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange today, without
providing figures. The comments are in line with those the bank
made at its annual general meeting in July.  “Over the medium term, Macquarie remains well positioned
to deliver superior performance,” it said in the statement,
which accompanied presentation materials to be shown at a CLSA
Investors Forum in  Hong Kong  today. “We are seeing the ongoing
benefits of continued cost initiatives, our  balance sheet  is
strong and conservative, and we have a proven risk management
framework and culture.”  Macquarie’s profit for the 12 months ended March 31 rose to
A$851 million ($799 million) from an eight-year low of A$730
million a year earlier. The bank is expected to report earnings
of A$1.09 billion this fiscal year, according to the average
estimate of 13 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  In its presentation materials, Macquarie reiterated that it
expects improved profits from its funds and trading units and
from its advisory and underwriting businesses.  Shares of Macquarie fell 1.6 percent to A$49.21 at 11:04
a.m. in Sydney trading. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index dropped
0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
