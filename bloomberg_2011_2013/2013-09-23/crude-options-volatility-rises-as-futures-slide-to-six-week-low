Crude options volatility rose as
the underlying futures slid to the lowest level in six weeks.  At-the-money volatility for November options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was 21.23
percent at 3:25 p.m., up from 20.08 percent on Sept. 20.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell
$1.16, or 1.1 percent, to  $103.59, the lowest since Aug. 8,
when prices settled at $103.40. Crude declined as confidence
increased that the U.S. will avoid a military strike against
 Syria  and as oil production gained in Libya and  Nigeria .  “The $103 level is a critical support level,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“The concern is if you can’t take support out, you could see a
rebound back up.”  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 52 percent of
electronic trading volume today.  November $100 puts were the most active options, rising 27
cents to $1 a barrel on volume of 3,100 contracts at 3:30 p.m.
The next most-active option, November $107 calls, dropped 41
cents to 90 cents on volume of 1,784 contracts.  Previous Session  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 55
percent of the 81,828 lots traded.  June $75 puts were the most active options on Sept. 20 with
4,220 contracts changing hands as they rose 3 cents to 95 cents
a barrel. November $100 puts, the next most-active, increased 14
cents to 73 cents on volume of 3,532 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
