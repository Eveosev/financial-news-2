Deposits of Swiss francs held by
foreign banks with Swiss counterparts fell 3.6 percent in July,
central bank data published today showed.  Deposits dropped for a fifth month to 96.2 billion francs
($105.5 billion) from 99.8 billion francs in June, according to
the  Swiss National Bank ’s  monthly bulletin  of banking
statistics.  Investors tend to buy the franc at times of high  risk
aversion , and their anxiety about the euro area’s debt crisis
led to demand so strong the franc nearly touched parity with the
euro in August 2011. The SNB then set a cap of 1.20 per euro on
the franc in September of that year, citing the risk of
deflation and recession brought about by the overvalued Swiss
currency.  An easing of the euro area’s debt crisis has led to lower
demand for haven assets, allowing the franc to weaken 2 percent
against the euro since the start of the year.  The euro area’s economy returned to growth last quarter for
the first time since 2011, ending the longest recession in the
currency union’s history. While the outlook has improved, the
recession has left the region with a youth unemployment rate of
24 percent, and parts of southern  Europe  remain mired in a
slump.  The SNB kept its cap on the franc at its quarterly policy
review last week, saying the measure was essential given the
risk of the  European debt crisis  intensifying again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
