Indonesia  may restrict the number
of terminals allowed to export coal as it seeks to control
shipments and boost revenue.  “Coal can currently be exported from any loading point,
which makes it difficult for us to control,” Edi Prasodjo, the
coal director at the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, said
in an interview at an industry meeting in Bali today.“We’re
discussing restricting exports in the future to certain ports or
shipping points to avoid illegal deliveries.”  Most Indonesian miners use barges to ship coal over a
network of rivers before loading the fuel into bigger vessels.
There are 56 million metric tons of  coal  production annually
that can’t be verified, resulting in potential losses to the
state of as much as 5.5 trillion rupiah ($493 million),
according to a Sept. 9 study by the Indonesian Coal Mining
Association.  The government should oversee coal terminals and
transportation facilities, Prasodjo said in a separate
presentation in Bali. The government is still studying whether
the planned policy would include private terminals, he said.
Companies such as PT Bumi Resources, Indonesia’s largest coal
producer, and PT Adaro Energy have their own terminals and
trans-shipment points to move coal.  Indonesia may produce 391 million tons this year, rising
from 386 million tons in 2012, according to Prasodjo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
