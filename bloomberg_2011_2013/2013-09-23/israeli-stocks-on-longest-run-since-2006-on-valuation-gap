Israeli stocks are extending their
longest winning streak since 2006 as valuations below
international peers attract buyers encouraged by Federal Reserve
stimulus and efforts to avert a strike on Syria.  The benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  advanced for a ninth day,
advancing as much as 2 percent before narrowing gains at 0.6
percent to 1,260.41 by 2:13 p.m. in Tel Aviv for today’s fifth-best best performance among 94 world indexes. While the gauge is
at its highest level since July 2011, valuations at 11.7 times
 estimated earnings  are 29 percent lower than the average for the
MSCI World Index of developed markets, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Tel Aviv shares jumped 3.1 percent last week as America and
Russia struck a deal to take control of chemical weapons in
Syria and avert a military strike on Israel’s neighbor. U.S.
stocks, as measured by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , rose to
a record last week after the Fed on Sept. 18 said it needs more
evidence of lasting economic improvement before reducing its
asset purchases.  “Israeli shares are cheap, which is boosting gains” Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at  Ramat Gan , Israel-based Excellence
Nessuah Brokerage Ltd., said by phone today. “The latest
developments are also bringing back foreign investors to the
market.”  Foreign investors have increased holdings in  Strauss Group
Ltd. (STRS) , the country’s largest food producer by sales, by 2.6
percent so far this quarter, according to  data compiled  by
Bloomberg. Jerusalem-based  Rami Levi Chain Stores Hashikma
Marketing 2006 Ltd. (RMLI) , the third-largest food retailer, has seen
FMR LLC and MSD European Opportunity Fund LP, part of MSD
Capital Ltd., increase stakes in the company in recent months.  Israel’s economy will expand 3.6 percent this year compared
with 1.6 percent in the U.S. and a contraction of 0.4 percent in
Europe, according to the average forecasts of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
