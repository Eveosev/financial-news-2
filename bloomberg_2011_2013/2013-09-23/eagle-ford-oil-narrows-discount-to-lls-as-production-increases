Eagle Ford crude strengthened to
the smallest discount to the U.S. Gulf Coast benchmark light
crude as  Texas  regulators reported that production from the
shale formation grew 36 percent from the year before in July.  Plains Marketing LP’s  posted price  for Eagle Ford light oil
was $101.25 a barrel Sept. 20. The price relative to Light
Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 81 cents to a discount of $3.81
a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the
smallest level since Plains began posting prices in 2010.  The spread has narrowed 86 percent since reaching a year-to-date wide level of $26.46 a barrel on March 20.  The nine fields that make up the majority of Eagle Ford
yielded 569,191 barrels of crude a day, according to preliminary
data released by the  Texas Railroad Commission , which oversees
oil and gas drilling in the state. That is 36 percent more than
he fields produced in July 2012.  May output was revised to 656,853 barrels a day from the
preliminary report of 617,884, the commission said. Production
totals typically increase in subsequent months as the state
receives revised, corrected or late reports.  The Port of  Corpus Christi , where much of the Eagle Ford
crude is shipped to by pipeline, shipped out 367,535 barrels of
oil a day in August, up 91 percent from the same month in 2012.  LOOP Shipments  The  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , the largest waterborne
petroleum import terminal in the U.S., received 2.4 million
barrels of oil from Texas in June. LOOP received its first
tanker of domestic crude in August 2012 after making
modifications to one of its three offshore buoys to allow
receipts from smaller domestic vessels, such as those carrying
Eagle Ford crude out of Texas.  Growing production from Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in Texas crude. The  state  produced a total of 2.58
million barrels a day in June, the highest monthly level since
May 1981, according to the Energy Information Administration,
the statistical arm of the Energy Department. The EIA hasn’t
released July production data for the state.  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle
Ford play, with 639,000 net acres.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  is
next with 485,000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
