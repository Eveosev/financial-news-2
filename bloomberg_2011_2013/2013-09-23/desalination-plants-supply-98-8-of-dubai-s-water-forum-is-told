Desalination plants that make
seawater potable supply 98.8 percent of Dubai’s water, with the
remaining 1.2 percent coming from groundwater sources, the
Arabian Water and Power Forum was told today.  Dubai is the commercial, banking and tourist hub of the
 United Arab Emirates , the second-biggest Arab world economy
after  Saudi Arabia . The arid, water-scarce U.A.E. contains about
6 percent of Earth’s proven oil reserves.  Producing desalinated water is so energy-consuming that
future water and energy plans must aim for a more sustainable
balance, Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, chief executive officer of the
state-owned utility Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, or
DEWA, told the forum.  “We succeeded in reducing our unaccounted-for water in our
water supply system to 10.88 percent in 2012 from 42 percent in
1988,” the CEO said, according to a statement. “The combined
power generation and desalinated water production in Dubai is
most-efficiently done using natural gas and liquefied natural
gas as the primary fuel” in almost all cases supplemented by
diesel oil as a secondary fuel, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
