(Corrects weekly shilling move in fifth paragraph.)  Kenya ’s shilling headed for its
biggest drop against the dollar in more than three weeks after a
terrorist attack in the capital, Nairobi, killed at least 68
people and injured more than 200 others.  The shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 87.50 per dollar by
9:44 a.m. local time, heading for its largest drop on a closing
basis since Aug. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenyan police have cornered as many as 15 al-Qaeda-linked
gunmen who are holding an unknown number of hostages for a third
day at the upscale Westage mall. It’s the East African nation’s
deadliest terrorist attack since 1998 when the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people. More than
1,000 people have been rescued since attack began Sept. 21.  “The shilling has proven to be remarkably resilient and
will take a short-term hit,” Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive
officer of Rich Management Ltd., a Nairobi-based adviser to
companies and high net-worth individuals, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “Its fortunes depend entirely on whether
Westgate is a one-time event or represents a new and more
dangerous normal.”  Kenya’s shilling recorded its strongest week against the
dollar in two months last week when it advanced 0.3 percent to
87.35 per dollar, the most since the five days to July 19.  The Nairobi Securities Exchange’s FTSE NSE 25 Index
declined 0.7 percent to 163.50, on track for its largest drop
since Aug. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
