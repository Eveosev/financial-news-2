NYSE Euronext (NYX)  has submitted a rule
filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that
modifies its guidelines for dealing with erroneous trades in the
U.S. options market, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  The proposal is part of an attempt to harmonize rules among
the nation’s options markets, said the person briefed on the
matter, who asked to not be named because the document is
confidential.  Rich Adamonis , a spokesman for New York-based NYSE
Euronext, declined to comment.  When Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sent mistaken trades to U.S.
options markets on Aug. 20, rules for canceling or upholding the
transactions differed among exchanges. In a Sept. 12 meeting,
SEC Chairman Mary Jo White told exchange owners to develop
uniform guidelines for options order cancellations. The change
NYSE Euronext is now proposing has been under consideration for
months, according to the person familiar with the matter.  The Financial Times reported NYSE Euronext’s proposal
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
