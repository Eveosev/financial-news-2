Germany ’s Greens party is open to
talking to  Chancellor Angela Merkel  about joining her third-term
government as it seeks to refocus on the switch to clean-energy
sources to win over alienated voters.  The Greens are “ready to hold talks” with Merkel’s
Christian Democratic bloc if the request were to come, Claudia Roth, the Greens co-leader, said today in Berlin. The party
should focus on “core” issues such as sustainability and
ecology after its vote share declined and it placed fourth in
yesterday’s vote, fellow co-leader Cem Oezdemir said.  “I believe that there are many more people in society than
voted for us who think green, act green,” Oezdemir told
reporters. “Our goal must be to win them over.”  Merkel is seeking a coalition partner to replace her Free
Democratic ally after it failed to win any seats in parliament.
The Greens were unable to unseat Merkel in a coalition with the
Social Democrats after campaigning on higher taxes for the
wealthiest and mandatory vegetarian meals at public cafeterias.  The anti-atomic Greens took 8.4 percent yesterday after
polling as high as 28 percent in 2011 in the wake of the
Fukushima nuclear disaster. The Greens were co-architects of the
country’s first nuclear exit agreement struck under Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder in 2001.  Yesterday’s result is “a very hard and painful loss,” and
may lead to a reshuffle of leadership, Roth said. The Greens
federal board will resign at the next party convention to free
the way for new leaders to guide the party into the 2017
elections, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
