Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and Virgin
Atlantic Airways Ltd., the carrier majority owned by billionaire
 Richard Branson , won U.S. antitrust immunity to let them
coordinate fares and schedules on flights across the Atlantic.  Today’s approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation
lets the airlines combine their networks and complete a
commercial relationship driven by Delta’s June purchase of a 49
percent stake in the U.K. carrier. No other airlines opposed the
tie-up, the DOT said today in a filing.  Delta and Virgin Atlantic began a code-share agreement
earlier this year, enabling them to book passengers on each
other’s jets on a single itinerary. Antitrust immunity will let
them deepen ties by sharing costs and revenue as though they
were a single entity. U.S. and European laws ban foreign
majority ownership of airlines.  The move is also a challenge to  British Airways (IAG)  and  AMR
Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines, which now control more than half of
trans-Atlantic service. Delta, based in Atlanta, bought the
stake in Virgin from  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  for $360 million
this year to add trans-Atlantic flights, the world’s richest
market for premium passengers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
