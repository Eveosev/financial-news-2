Inversiones La Construccion SA (ILC) ,
which controls Chile’s second-largest pension fund manager,
posted a record rally after agreeing to buy the insurance
businesses of billionaire Alvaro Saieh.  Shares of the company also known as ILC jumped 5.2 percent
to 7,100 pesos at 3:26 p.m. in Santiago, the biggest gain on a
closing basis since its listing in July 2012. The IPSA benchmark
index advanced 2.9 percent, the most since October 2011.  La Construccion, which owns a controlling stake in AFP
Habitat SA, the largest pension fund manager in Chile by assets
under management after AFP Provida SA, agreed to pay $170
million in cash, plus assumption of debt, for a 67 percent stake
in Corp Group Vida  Chile  SA, the insurance company owned by
Saieh, according to a statement posted today on the website of
Chile’s securities regulator.  The deal “will give ILC a presence in the annuities market
and may fit well with its other businesses,” Jason Barratt, an
analyst at brokerage BICE Inversiones in Santiago, said in a
phone interview.  Saieh has agreed to provide $300 million by year-end for
SMU SA, a retailer he controls. It recorded a record loss in the
second quarter and announced in July a debt-covenant breach
related to accounting errors. SMU is also selling some assets to
pay debt and fund operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
