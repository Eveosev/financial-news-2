India ’s rupee fell for a second day
after the central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates and
scaled back earlier measures meant to support the currency.  The Reserve Bank of India boosted its benchmark  repurchase
rate  to 7.50 percent from 7.25 percent at a Sept. 20 review. It
was the first increase since 2011, while all 36 economists in a
Bloomberg survey predicted no change. The move will “arm”
Governor Raghuram Rajan against the inevitable paring of U.S.
stimulus, according to Andhra Bank.  “In the short term, the hike disappointed market hopes,
and we are also seeing importers bidding for dollars today,”
said Vikas Babu, a trader at state-run Andhra Bank in Mumbai.
“In the longer run, the rate hike is a positive as a lowering
of rates would have rendered India vulnerable when the tapering
actually begins.”  The rupee weakened 0.2 percent to 62.3975 per dollar as of
9:53 a.m. in Mumbai, adding to a 0.8 percent loss on Sept. 20,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 17.37 percent.  India’s gross domestic product increased 5 percent in the
year ended March 31, the slowest pace since 2003, official data
show. The RBI raised its main rate even after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Sept. 18 he wants to see more
evidence of a recovery in the U.S. economy before tapering
monthly bond purchases of $85 billion.  ‘Right Thing’  RBI Governor Rajan also cut the marginal standing facility
rate to 9.5 percent from 10.25 percent and relaxed some curbs on
cash supply put in place by his predecessor  Duvvuri Subbarao .
Rajan “did the right thing,”  Bhanu Baweja , head of emerging-markets cross-asset strategy at UBS AG in  London , said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV India, telecast today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.3 percent to
63.88 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts advanced 0.1 percent to 64.23. Forwards
are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
