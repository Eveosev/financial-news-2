Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , the
world’s largest corn processor, is looking to move its global
headquarters from central  Illinois  after 44 years to gain better
access to customers as it expands.  ADM expects to relocate about 100 corporate jobs and create
an information technology center at its new base that will add a
further 100 posts in the next few years, the Decatur, Illinois-based company said today in a statement.  “We need a global center in a location that allows us to
travel and work efficiently with customers and employees
throughout the world,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Patricia Woertz said in the statement.  Earlier this year, ADM agreed to buy Australian crop
handler GrainCorp Ltd. to gain control of seven of the eight
ports that ship grain in bulk from the nation’s east coast.  The company is considering locations and holding talks with
public officials and advisers. It doesn’t expect to discuss
those details publicly, the statement showed.  The company doesn’t plan any layoffs in connection with the
move and 4,400 employees will continue to work in Decatur,
Woertz said.  Decatur will serve in future as ADM’s North American
headquarters.  -Editors: Stephen Cunningham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
