Can you hear me now? If you're in Burundi, probably not. On the heels of our  slideshow highlighting countries  with the highest percentage of people per capita on 4G mobile data networks, here's the other side: a ranking of the nations with the lowest percentage of subscribers to any kind of mobile service. Several factors affect people's ability to access mobile services around the world. The main ones are obvious - poor or politically unstable countries lack the resources to build networks. But there are other reasons as well, such as the geography of a nation and the overall population.  What follows is a list of the 10 countries with the lowest percentage of mobile subscribers per capita in the world, based on projections this year from Juniper Networks, a large maker of telecommunications equipment. The list is a good reminder that as consumers in affluent economies  celebrate getting their hands on the latest iPhones , there are still many other people across the globe who would be happy just to have mobile access.
