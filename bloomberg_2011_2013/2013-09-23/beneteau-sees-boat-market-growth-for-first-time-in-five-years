The global boat market is forecast
to grow for the first time in five years in the 2014 season,
according to  Beneteau (BEN) , the world’s largest yacht builder.  Beneteau’s boat sales rose 2.3 percent to 624 million euros
($842 million) in the fiscal year through August, with sales
outside of Europe jumping 28 percent to 232 million euros, the
St. Gilles Croix de Vie, France-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  Asia and South America “are confirming their status as
structurally growing regions for pleasure cruising,” the
company said, while Europe is “faced with a significant
contraction and major regional differences.”  Sales in Europe fell 10 percent, while in  North America ,
the largest yacht market, sales jumped 47 percent, according to
the boat maker, whose products include Lagoon catamarans and
Jeanneau motorboats. Business in Asia and  South America 
increased 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
