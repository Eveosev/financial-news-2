Telefonica SA (TEF)  signed two contracts
valued at 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) to transmit data
from U.K. power and gas meters, a record deal for the industry.  Telefonica signed the 15-year agreements today with Capita
Plc, just more than a month after the government’s Department of
Energy and Climate Change said the Madrid-based company was the
preferred bidder, according to an e-mailed  statement .  The company’s British unit will build networks transmitting
information about usage from power and gas meters in  Wales  and
southern and central England to data storage sites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
