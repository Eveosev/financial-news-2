Taiwan’s dollar touched a four-month high as local markets reopened for the first time since
the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from tapering asset
purchases.  Government bonds  advanced.  The island’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to NT$29.629 versus
the greenback, prices from Taipei Forex Inc. show. It touched
NT29.505 earlier, the strongest since May 10, and has rallied
1.7 percent this quarter. Local markets were closed for public
holidays on Sept. 19 and 20.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Sept. 18 the pace of bond
buying would depend on economic data and there is no set
schedule for cutting stimulus that has boosted demand for
emerging-market assets. A Bloomberg survey of economists had
predicted a reduction of $5 billion in monthly purchases known
as quantitative easing. Global funds bought more local stocks
than they sold for a 17th trading day today, taking net
purchases in 2013 to $5.09 billion, exchange data show.  “All Asian currencies have been rising as the expected
announcement that the Fed would taper QE didn’t come,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in
Taipei. “Taiwan has already been seeing fund inflows, but now
there will be even more.”  The currency was trading 0.7 percent stronger 19 minutes
before the 4 p.m. close today. The island’s central bank has
sold the local dollar in the run-up to the close on most days
since March 2012, according to traders who asked not to be
identified.  “If the central bank lets go, the  Taiwan dollar  may
strengthen even further,” Union Bank’s Tong said.  Bonds, Volatility  The yield on the 1.75 percent government notes due
September 2023 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 1.65 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the Taiwan dollar
climbed 0.1 percent to NT$29.495, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped two
basis points to 3.95 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.386 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
