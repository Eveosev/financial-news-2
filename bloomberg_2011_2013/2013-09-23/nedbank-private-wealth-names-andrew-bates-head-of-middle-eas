Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South
African bank controlled by  Old Mutual Plc. (OML) , said it appointed
Andrew Bates as head of its private banking unit in the Middle
East as the bank targets wealthy clients in the region.  Bates, who joined Nedbank Private Wealth in 2004, is based
in Dubai and will also head the bank’s Asia operations,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the bank.  Banks are boosting private banking in the Middle East as
the number of millionaires increases, rising 2.7 percent to
450,000 in 2011, according to  Cap Gemini SA (CAP)  and RBC Wealth
Management. Coutts & Co., the wealth management unit of  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc , said in April it hired Michael Dismorr as a managing director for the  Middle East . JPMorgan
Chase & Co. said last week it hired Antoine Massoud from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. for its private banking team.  Bates will work alongside Marl Leale, regional manager of
the Dubai office who started the bank’s Middle East operations
in April 2011, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
