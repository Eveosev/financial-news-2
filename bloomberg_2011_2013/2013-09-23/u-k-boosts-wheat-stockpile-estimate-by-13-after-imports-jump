U.K. wheat stockpiles at the end of
June were 13 percent bigger than previously estimated after
imports surged to the highest since 1978, Department for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs data show.  Inventories at the end of June were 2.19 million metric
tons, up from an estimate in May at 1.94 million tons, according
to Defra data distributed today by the Agriculture &
Horticulture Development Board. Supplies were 46 percent higher
than a year earlier even as excess rain cut domestic production
by 13 percent to 13.26 million tons. U.K. wheat imports during
the 2012-13 season were 2.94 million tons, more than triple a
year earlier and the highest since 1978, customs data show.  “It has been particularly challenging to construct final
balance sheets for wheat and maize this season where imports
were much higher than anticipated and did not correlate well
with the Defra usage and stocks survey data,” according to the
report. “Investigations revealed some under reporting of stocks
held by merchants, ports and cooperatives,” spurring the upward
revision in the inventory estimate.  Supply and demand figures for corn, also known as maize,
and oats are “still under investigation due to discrepancies in
the data that need to be explored further,” according to
today’s report. Customs data show U.K. corn imports of 1.69
million tons during the 2012-13 season, while Defra usage and
stockpile figures indicate imports of 1.36 million tons.  “Investigations are being undertaken to identify the
source of the discrepancy, these will include discussions with
ports, consumers and stock holders to ascertain if under- or
over-reporting has occurred in any of these areas of the balance
sheet,” according to the report. “Defra welcome input from
those involved in the U.K. maize market to assist in this
process.”  U.K. stockpiles of barley at the end of June were pegged at
997,000 tons, 4.5 percent more than estimated in May and 6
percent more than a year earlier, Defra data show. Imports
during the season were 235,000 tons, compared with exports at
384,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
