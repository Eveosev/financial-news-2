Pork stockpiles in the U.S. fell
7.8 percent at the end of August from a year earlier as
slaughter rates slowed, the government said.  Warehouses held 540.028 million pounds of pork, down from
 585.796 million  on Aug. 31, 2012, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Inventories fell less than 1
percent from the end of July.  Commercial hog  slaughter  in August totaled 9.56 million
head, down 3.9 percent from a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. U.S.  exporters  shipped 406.6 million
pounds (184,400 metric tons) of pork in July, up 2.1 percent
from a year earlier, today’s USDA data show.  There’s a “shortfall in slaughter,” Bob Brown, an
independent market consultant in Edmond,  Oklahoma , said in a
telephone interview before the report. “Total pork volume is
down. July and August might have had some pretty good exports.”  As of Aug. 31, stockpiles of pork bellies, which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, rose 34.6 percent from a year earlier
to 19.130 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham rose 2.4 percent to a record 200.584 million
pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of August were 4.8
percent larger than a year earlier at 691.316 million pounds,
the USDA said. Beef supplies rose less than 1 percent to 433.842
million pounds during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
