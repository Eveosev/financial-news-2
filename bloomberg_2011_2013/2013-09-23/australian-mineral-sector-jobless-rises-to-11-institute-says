Unemployment in Austalia’s minerals
sector has grown to almost 11 percent from less then 2 percent
within the past year, according to the Australasian Institute of
Mining and Metallurgy.  “Traditionally, a downturn in mining industry investment
and operations impacts first on exploration geologists and then
other professionals,” Geoff Sharrock, president of the
institute, said today in a statement. “The impacts this time
have been sudden and have bitten deeply into the professional
employees who are central to finding, developing and running the
mining operations that underpin our economy.”  Mining companies in  Australia , the biggest exporter of iron
ore and coal, are cutting staff and delaying new operations as a
decade-long boom in prices peaks. Growth in  China , the world’s
biggest metals consumer, has slowed as the government seeks to
cool a credit-driven expansion.  The survey, conducted across the institute’s 13,500
members, compares with Australia’s unemployment rate of 5.8
percent during August, the highest since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
