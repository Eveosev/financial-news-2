Chris Greer, global head of a
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  business introducing hedge-fund clients to new
investors, has left the New York-based lender.  A replacement for Greer hasn’t been named, Scott Helfman, a
company spokesman, said today in an e-mail. Greer reported to
Alan Pace, global head of prime brokerage and client experience.
The business provides financing to hedge funds while also
helping the firms process trades and attract investors.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat , 53, is seeking to
expand prime brokerage as it pulls back from other businesses.
The lender hired at least two senior executives for the unit
earlier this year, including David H. Tenney as head of sales
for the Americas and  Matthew Clark  to run client solutions.  Greer’s departure was reported earlier by Absolute Return
magazine, which said he was leaving to join a family office in
Greenwich, Connecticut. Greer didn’t respond to e-mail and phone
messages left at his home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
