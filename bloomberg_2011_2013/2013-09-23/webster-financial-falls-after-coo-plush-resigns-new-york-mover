Webster Financial Corp. (WBS)  fell the
most in almost a month after saying Chief Operating Officer
Gerald P. Plush resigned to pursue other interests.  Webster fell 2.2 percent, to $24.91 at 10:43 a.m. in New
York, the  second-worst  performance among 50 lenders in the KBW
Regional Banking Index. The shares earlier dropped as much as
3.7 percent, the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 27.  Plush, who’s also a member of the board, “made a personal
decision to pursue other career interests” and will resign as
of Sept. 30, the Waterbury, Connecticut-based bank said today in
a statement. Plush, 54, joined Webster as chief financial
officer in 2006 and also served as chief risk officer. He became
COO and joined the board in 2011, the company said.  “This is Jerry Plush’s decision, it’s something we respect
and he’s had a very positive experience here,” Bob Guenther, a
spokesman for Webster, said in a phone interview.  Webster, with $20.3 billion in  assets  as of June 30, has
about 170 offices in  Connecticut , New York,  Rhode Island  and
Massachusetts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
