Premier League leader Arsenal said
its fiscal-year profit declined after the north London soccer
club earned less from selling players and wage costs rose.  Net income fell to 5.8 million pounds ($9.3 million) from
29.6 million pounds in the 12 months ended May 31, the team said
today in a PR Newswire statement. Revenue rose to 280 million
pounds from 243 million in the year-earlier period.  The Gunners earned 47 million pounds from the sale of
players including striker Robin van Persie to Manchester United
and midfielder Alex Song to Barcelona. That was 18.5 million
pounds less than it earned from trades in 2012. The club’s wage
payments surpassed 150 million pounds for the first time, and it
also wrote down the value of some players.  “We are not yet fully where we want the club to be, but
everyone is looking forward to the challenges ahead and
competing for and winning trophies,” Chief Executive Officer
 Ivan Gazidis  said in the statement.  The team got revenue of 37.5 million pounds from property
development as it continued to work on the areas surrounding its
new Emirates Stadium and the old Highbury, which has been turned
into housing. It had 7.7 million pounds in revenue from its
property business in the 2012 fiscal year.  Arsenal had cash and short-term deposits of 153.5 million
pounds, little changed from 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
