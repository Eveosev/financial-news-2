A case of 2009 Chateau Pichon
Longueville Comtesse de Lalande, a second-growth Pauillac wine
estate, sold for a 15-month high of 1,195 pounds ($1,920) on
Liv-ex amid demand for growers beyond  Bordeaux ’s top five.  The wine, from the Medoc peninsula northwest of the city,
sold for 14 percent more than the 1,050 pounds at which it
traded at the end of 2012. That price was a record low reached
after a yearlong price slide, according to data on Liv-ex’s
Cellar Watch website.  While the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading
Bordeaux vintages, has gained 3 percent since the start of this
year, that reflects an 8 percent advance in the first 11 weeks
of the year followed by a retreat in the six months since then.
Price declines have been led by first-growths, with other wine
estates in the Medoc and Saint-Emilion showing more resilience
and the critically-acclaimed 2009 vintage particularly buoyant.  Bordeaux wines from that year have been “in favor” in the
past couple of months, even as investor attention has switched
to alternative regions including Rhone, Italy and Champagne,
according to Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch market report. “The 2009s
saw the most Bordeaux trade” in August, accounting for 22
percent of deals on the exchange by value, it said.  Pichon Lalande 2009 has sold at higher prices at auction
this year, with one case fetching $1,968 at an  Acker Merrall &
Condit  sale in  New York  this month and another selling for
$2,031.50 at  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co . in  Chicago  in June,
according to results on their websites.  Cabernet Sauvignon  Pichon Lalande’s 2009 wine is its fourth-most expensive of
the past 15 years, according to merchant prices tracked by 
Liv-ex.  The 2009 Pichon Lalande was awarded 95 points out of 100 by
U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker  in an online tasting note in
February 2012, putting it among the estate’s top four of the
past decade, according to the  eRobertParker  website.  The wine comprises 75 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20
percent Merlot and 5 percent Petit Verdot, the blend’s highest
proportion of  Cabernet Sauvignon  since the start of this
century. Parker described it as “a deep purple-hued, charming,
surprisingly open-knit Pauillac with wonderful freshness” and
“one of the great Pichon Lalandes of the last 20 years.”  17th Century  The estate traces its history back to the late 17th
century, when Bordeaux merchant Pierre de Mazure de Rauzan
acquired parcels of vineyard in the area.  His descendants, including Virginie Comtesse de Lalande,
who inherited part of the land in 1850, owned the vineyard until
1925, when it was bought by the wine broker Edouard Miailhe and
his family. Miailhe’s daughter May Eliane de Lencquesaing took
it over in 1978, built the business back up over two decades and
in 2007 sold it to Champagne Louis Roederer SA.  The interests of Roederer extend beyond Champagne and
Pichon Lalande to independently managed wineries such as
Roederer Estate and Scharffenberger in  California , Maison Delas
in the Rhone valley, Ramos Pinto in  Portugal ’s Douro and
Bordeaux estates Chateau de Pez and Chateau Haut Beausejour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
