Construction has begun on a C$49.6
million ($48.2 million) water-treatment project in Corner Brook
thatâ€™s being financed by the city, federal and Newfoundland and
Labrador governments to improve drinking supplies on the island.  The facility in western Newfoundland will use UV and
chlorine treatments with a dissolved air flotation process to
help ensure access to clean, potable water, Infrastructure
Canada said today in a statement. It said almost half of the
costs will come from the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund
that supports such projects as roads, bridges and water plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
