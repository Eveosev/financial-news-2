Pitcher CC Sabathia will miss the
 New York  Yankees’ final six regular-season games with a strained
hamstring and won’t be available if the team somehow reaches the
playoffs.  Sabathia, 33, sustained a Grade 2 strain of his left
hamstring in the Yankees’ Sept. 20 win over the  San Francisco
Giants  and will need eight weeks to recover, the team said in an
e-mailed statement.  The win, in which Sabathia allowed one earned run over
seven innings, raised the left-hander’s record to 14-13 this
season. His 4.78 earned run average is the worst of his 13 Major
League Baseball seasons.  The Yankees, 82-74 with six games remaining in the regular
season, are four games out of the competition for one of two
wild-card playoff berths given to non-division winners. The
Tampa Bay Rays (86-69) and Cleveland Indians (86-70) are leading
the race, while New York also trails the  Texas Rangers  (84-71)
and Kansas City Royals (82-73).  To contact the reporter on this story:
