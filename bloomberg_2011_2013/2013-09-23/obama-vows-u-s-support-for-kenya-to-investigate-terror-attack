President  Barack Obama  said the
U.S. will provide any law enforcement resources needed by  Kenya 
in the aftermath of the deadly terrorist attack on a shopping
mall in Nairobi.  “The United States will continue to work with the entire
continent of Africa and around the world to make sure we are
dismantling these networks of destruction,” Obama told
reporters at the start of a meeting with Nigerian President
Goodluck Jonathan in New York, where they are attending the
 United Nations General Assembly .  Obama said he’s spoken with Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta. Jonathan expressed sympathy for the Kenyan people and
called on the world’s leaders to “come together to fight
terror.”  The annual gathering of heads of state from around the
world is getting under way in  New York  as authorities are
struggling to end a two-day siege in Nairobi that left 69 people
dead. A separate attack on Christian church service in Peshawar,
Pakistan, killed 81 people.  The Kenya attack is the deadliest in the country since the
1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in downtown Nairobi that killed
213 people. Al-Shabaab, the Somali Islamist militant group,
claimed responsibility for the raid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
