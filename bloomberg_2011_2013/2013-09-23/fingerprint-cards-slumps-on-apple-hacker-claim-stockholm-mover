Fingerprint Cards AB (FINGB)  and  Precise
Biometrics AB (PREC)  slumped more than 30 percent in Stockholm trading
because of concerns over the safety of biometrics amid claims
the sensors on  Apple Inc.’s (AAPL)  latest iPhone can be hacked.  Fingerprint lost as much as  36 percent  to 41.2 kronor, its
steepest drop since July 10 2012. The stock fell 14 percent to
55.50 kronor as of 2:50 p.m. local time, with trading volume at
more than five times the daily average in the past three months.
Shares of Precise Biometrics declined as much as 34 percent to
2.28 kronor, their biggest drop since December 1999. The stock
decreased 18 percent to 2.83  kronor at 2:50 p.m.  The U.K.’s  Guardian newspaper  reported today that a group
known as  Germany ’s Chaos Computer Club claims to have cracked
the technology used in the iPhone 5S, using a photograph of a
user’s fingerprint on a glass surface to create a fake print on
a plastic film to unlock the phone.  “Do you think its easy to first take a high-resolution
picture of your fingerprint and then steal your mobile?”
Fingerprint Cards Chief Executive Officer Johan Carlstroem said
in a telephone interview today. “Wouldn’t it be better to pick
up a gun and press it against your temple and ask you to unlock
it?”  Fingerprint Cards and Precise Biometrics have soared more
than fivefold since the end of last year through Sept. 20,
partly because of predictions that all smartphones will
eventually be equipped with fingerprint technology after Apple
added such sensors to its iPhone 5S. Fingerprint said today it
expects “all Tier 1 smartphone OEMs will have a capacitive
fingerprint sensor in their flagship models by the end of
2014.”  The company also said it plans to take 60 percent of the
market for touch sensors in smartphones, excluding Apple’s, in
2014 and 2015. Fingerprint said it forecasts that the market for
integrated sensors in consumer electronics will exceed 500
million units in 2014 and more than 3 billion units in 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
