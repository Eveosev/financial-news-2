U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened
relative to futures as regional refineries running more crude
for the season than any other year on record boost supplies in
the region.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline , or RBOB, on the Gulf
Coast slid 1.25 cents to a discount of 15.75 cents a gallon
versus  New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at 3:54 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gulf Coast refiners processed 8.47 million barrels of crude
in the week ended Sept. 6,  the most  for this time of year in
Energy Information Administration data back to 1993 and 19
percent above the average of the past five years.  Inventories are at a five-year seasonal high on the Gulf
Coast, the region known as PADD 3. Stockpiles of gasoline in the
area narrowly declined to 77.7 million in the week ended Sept.
13 after rising by more than 2 million barrels the week before,
Energy Information Administration data showed.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , retreated $1.38 to $5.85
a barrel.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in  Chicago 
slipped 10 cents to a discount of 8 cents a gallon against
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:04 p.m.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  slid 0.13 cent to a premium of 2.25 cents a
gallon. The  Chicago crack spread , based on WTI, tumbled $3.71 to
$9.03 a barrel.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in  San Francisco 
weakened by 0.5 cent to a premium of 6 cents a gallon more than
futures on the Nymex after Valero Energy Corp. reported a fluid
catalytic cracker at its Benicia, California refinery restarted
and was at planned rates today.  Carbob in  Los Angeles  strengthened by 1 cent to a premium
of 12.5 cents a gallon at 3:54 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
