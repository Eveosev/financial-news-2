President  Barack Obama  has no plans
to name a nominee for Federal Reserve chairman this week,
according to a person familiar with administration
deliberations.  Fed Vice Chairman Janet Yellen remains the leading
candidate to replace Ben S. Bernanke when his term expires on
Jan. 31. She has been picking up support from Democratic
senators and party leaders including former President Bill Clinton following a decision by former Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers to withdraw from consideration.  White House officials made calls last week to influential
senators to encourage them to voice support for a Yellen
nomination to head off any attacks on her before Obama announces
a decision.  The Fed nomination is subject to U.S. Senate confirmation.  Obama is going to New York today for two days of meetings
connected to the United Nations General Assembly session. He
also is in the midst of attempting to negotiate a budget deal
with congressional Republicans before the Sept. 30 end of the
fiscal year and getting Congress to raise the federal debt
ceiling by the middle of next month.  He also is scheduled to leave for a series of summits in
Asia at the end of next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
