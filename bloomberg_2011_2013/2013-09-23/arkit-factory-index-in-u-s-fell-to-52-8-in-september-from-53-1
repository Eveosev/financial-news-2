The Markit Economics preliminary
index of U.S.  manufacturing  fell to 52.8 in September from a
final reading of 53.1 at the end of last month, the London-based
group said today.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 20 economists
called for an increase to 54, with estimates ranging from 50.7
to 56. A reading greater than 50 for the purchasing managers’
figure indicates expansion.  The Markit purchasers measure is based on replies from 85
percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  A Chinese manufacturing index rose to a six-month high in
September, signaling that a rebound in the world’s second-largest economy is gaining steam. HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics said today the gauge climbed to 51.2 from 50.1 in
August.  In the euro-region, factories showed the third straight
month of expansion. Markit’s  manufacturing  index declined to
51.1 this month from 51.4 in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
