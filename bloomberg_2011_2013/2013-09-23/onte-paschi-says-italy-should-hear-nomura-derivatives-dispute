Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA 
told a London court that Italy was the proper venue for its
dispute with  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  over a derivatives deal at the
center of a criminal probe.  Monte Paschi sued Nomura in Florence seeking about 700
million euros ($944 million), saying the Japanese lender
colluded with its executives to conceal losses in “a series of
complex financial transactions,” the Italian bank said in
documents at the U.K. hearing today. The lawsuit led Nomura to
file the separate complaint in London to have the contracts
upheld.  Losses from derivatives prompted Monte Paschi to seek state
aid of 4.1 billion euros in February. Prosecutors had sought
authorization to seize as much as 1.95 billion euros of Nomura
assets, consisting mostly of funds pledged by Monte Paschi to
Nomura as security for the derivatives contracts and deposited
in Germany.  The U.K. doesn’t have jurisdiction to hear Nomura’s London
lawsuit because the Italian case was filed first, Monte Paschi
said in court documents.  Rob Davies , a Nomura spokesman, declined to comment. The
bank’s agreements with Monte Paschi are governed by English law,
it said in documents at the hearing.  The U.K. case is Nomura International Plc v.  Banca Monte
Dei Paschi Di Siena SpA (BMPS) ,  High Court  of Justice, Queen’s Bench
Division, Commercial Court, 13-292  To contact the reporter on this story:
