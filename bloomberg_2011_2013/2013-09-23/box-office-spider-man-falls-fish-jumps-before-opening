The Daily Bugle newspaper continues
to founder along with  Peter Parker  and his alter ego.  “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,” the $75 million
spectacle that’s been setting new lows on Broadway since late
August, dropped again last week, grossing $719,000. Once one of
theater’s top sellers, it did less than “Jersey Boys”
($877,000) and “ Mamma Mia !” ($776,000), both of which opened
years earlier and are playing in smaller houses.  In the first eight months of 2012, “Spider-Man,” with
music by Bono and The Edge of the band U2, was regularly
grossing twice as much as it did last week. Its weekly losses,
estimated to be hundreds of thousands of dollars, raise
questions about how long the producers will keep it open.  “Spider-Man” intends to be here for a long time to
come,” a spokesman for the production, Rick Miramontez, said in
an e-mail.  “ Big Fish ,” a new Susan Stroman-directed musical that
opens Oct. 6, sold $690,000, up 18 percent. “The Glass
Menagerie,” the Tennessee Williams classic with Cherry Jones
and Zachary Quinto opening on Thursday, did $424,000.  Both “Annie” ($412,000) and “Cinderella” ($625,000)
slid to new lows. Yet neither approached the results of “Soul
Doctor.” It bounced 47 percent since the Jewish New Year to
$144,000, but remains at a fifth of its potential gross.  Muse highlights include  Lili Rosboch  on art and John
Detrixhe on  travel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
