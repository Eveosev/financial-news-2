Suning Commerce Group Co. (002024)  surged to
a two-year high on speculation it may be awarded a private bank
license as  China ’s policy makers prepare to open the financial
sector to more companies that aren’t state-owned.  The retailer of electronics and home appliances gained by
the 10 percent daily limit in Shenzhen to  12.01 yuan , the
highest close since August 2011. China’s benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index gained  1.3 percent . The shares resumed trading
after a Sept. 19 halt.  Chinese authorities may approve the set up of a new private
bank before March of next year, the 21st Century Business Herald
reported today, citing a draft plan submitted to the nation’s
banking regulator for approval. Suning’s shares have risen 50
percent since the company, based in the eastern city of Nanjing,
said Aug. 23 it had submitted preliminary plans to relevant
government departments to set up a bank.  A Suning press officer, who declined to be identified
because of the company’s rules, said the retailer had no comment
beyond on its Aug. 23 statement.  The State Council, China’s cabinet, said  July 5  it would
encourage private investment in financial institutions,
including banks, leasing firms and consumer finance companies.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s largest Internet company by
market value, is among those that have applied to start a
banking business, Shanghai Securities News reported Sept. 13.

pledged to “stir things up” in banking.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
