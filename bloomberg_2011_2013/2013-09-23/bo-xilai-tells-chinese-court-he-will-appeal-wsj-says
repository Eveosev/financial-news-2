Ousted Chinese Communist Party
Politburo member Bo Xilai has told the court that he will
appeal, the Wall Street Journal  reported  on its Chinese website
today, citing people it didn’t identify.  The report didn’t provide any details about the appeal. Bo
was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of
taking 20.4 million  yuan  ($3.3 million) in bribes, embezzling 5
million yuan and abusing his power, the Jinan Intermediate
People’s Court said on its microblog yesterday.  Bo’s sentence, following a trial that exposed graft at the
highest levels of the government, was delivered as the country’s
leaders prepare to lay out an economic reform agenda. The
verdict precedes a party conclave in November where Chinese
President Xi Jinping and Premier  Li Keqiang  may seek to bolster
their grip on power.  The 64-year-old Bo’s case strictly followed legal
procedures, and there were clear facts and sufficient evidence
for a guilty verdict, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
today, citing a commentary first published in Legal Daily, the
newspaper of the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of
the CPC Central Committee.  Two calls by  Bloomberg News  to the Shandong High People’s
Court after office hours went unanswered.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
