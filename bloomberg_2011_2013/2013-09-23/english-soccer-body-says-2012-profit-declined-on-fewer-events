The Football Association, English
soccer’s governing body, said 2012 profit fell 13 percent after
it earned less from events at Wembley Stadium.  Net income fell to 35 million pounds ($56 million) from 40
million pounds in 2011, the London-based F.A. said in a report
released today. Sales fell to 318 million pounds from 329
million pounds.  The decline would have been greater without prize money
earned from the performance of the men’s national team in the
2012 European Championship.  England  won its group in the opening
stage of the tournament before losing a penalty shootout against
 Italy  in the quarterfinals.  The F.A. is “well placed to continue to deliver
significant investment into the game,” Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Crean said at a briefing in London.  Income from selling broadcast rights was unchanged, as were
sponsorship and licensing sales. The current domestic television
rights contract expires in 2014, and the deal for international
broadcast rights runs out in 2018.  Sales generated by soccer and other events declined to 40
million pounds from 62 million pounds because Wembley hosted
fewer events than the previous year. One of those 2011 events
was the UEFA Champions League final, which returned to Wembley
this year. Only one music concert was held at the stadium in
2012, compared with nine in 2011. The decline in event sales was
partly offset by the staging of nine Olympic soccer games.  Revenue from events at Wembley should return to the 2011
level or higher this year, Roger Maslin, managing director of
the stadium, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
