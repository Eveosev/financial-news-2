Just about the only thing Apple and BlackBerry still have in common is that they're both named after fruit. On Friday, when  Apple fanatics were lined up  outside stores around the world for the release of the new iPhones,  BlackBerry said it would cut 4,500 jobs  and write down as much as $960 million in its fiscal second quarter BlackBerry, which released the flagship Z10 touchscreen phone earlier this year, sold 5.9 million smartphones during the last three months. Apple sold more than 9 million over the weekend. The companies' different trajectories became even more vivid today when BlackBerry said it tentatively agreed to a  $4.7 billion buyout  by a group led by Fairfax Financial Holdings. Meanwhile, Apple's stock rose 5 percent following the sales announcement, giving the California company a market value of almost $446 billion. In the mobile industry, giants fall fast and hard. Device sales for the once-mighty BlackBerry "are cratering," said Jan Dawson, an analyst at research firm Ovum.  Compare that with Apple, which said today the debut of the  iPhone 5s and 5c set a sales record  for the company. It was the first time Apple began selling its new iPhones in the  crucial Chinese market  on launch day, which no doubt helped to exceed goals. Apple also said quarterly revenue and gross margin will be at the top end of its prior forecast. During Apple's last quarter -- before the new phones came out -- the company took in $18.2 billion in revenue from the iPhone unit, which doesn't include accessories, software or services. BlackBerry expects its entire company to generate $1.6 billion in revenue in the second quarter. You'd have to add up BlackBerry's last seven quarters of revenue to reach what Apple generated from selling smartphones in one quarter. And it wasn't even a particularly great one for Apple.
