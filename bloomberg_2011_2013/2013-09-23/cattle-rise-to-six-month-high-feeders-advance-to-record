Cattle rose to a six-month high and
feeder cattle climbed to a record after a report showed feedlots
added the fewest animals to herds for the month of August since
the current method of tracking the data began in 1996.  So-called placements tumbled 11 percent to 1.788 million
head of cattle from a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture figures showed after the close of regular trading on
Sept. 20. The number of animals added to the feedlot herd also
fell in May, June and July.  The report “suggests we’re going to have very tight supply
of fed cattle this year and in early 2014,”  Dan Vaught , an
economist at Doane Advisory Services in  St. Louis , said in a
telephone interview.  Cattle futures for December delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$1.30575 at 11:27 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price reached $1.30775, the highest for the most-active contract since March 5.  Feedlot operators typically buy 1-year-old cattle that
weigh 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders,
which are fattened on corn until they weigh 1,300 pounds and are
sold to meatpackers.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement climbed 1
percent to $1.62325 a pound. Earlier, the price reached a record
$1.62475. Through Sept. 20, the most-active contract climbed 4.2
percent this year.  Hog futures for December settlement gained 0.3 percent to
86.3 cents a pound, the first increase in three sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
