Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in
a month amid speculation local companies were boosting dollar
purchases to meet month-end debt and import payments.  Government
bonds  declined.  The currency weakened 1.3 percent to 11,498 per dollar as
of 11:25 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since Aug. 20, prices
from local banks show. In the offshore market, one-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.6 percent to 11,305, 1.7 percent
stronger than the spot rate. The contracts were on average 2.2
percent weaker than the onshore rate in the past month.  The currency sank 5.9 percent in August, the biggest loss
since November 2008, and the central bank said Sept. 12 that
 recent moves  were justified by economic fundamentals and the
depreciation would help tackle the nation’s current-account
deficit.  Bank Indonesia  doesn’t want to see the currency “too
strong,” spokesman Peter Jacobs said last week. The  current-account gap  was a record $9.8 billion in the second quarter and
imports exceeded exports by $2.3 billion in July.  “The view is still bearish on the rupiah in the short
term,” said Suriyanto Chang, head of treasury at PT Bank QNB
Kesawan in Jakarta. “There’s regular dollar demand from
companies around this time, but the rupiah should be supported
at about 11,500 as there’s a lot of interest to sell dollars
around that level.”  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed 11 basis points to 16.96 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. A  fixing  used to settle the rupiah forwards was
set at 11,136 per dollar today, from 11,011 on Sept. 20,
according to the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  “With the rupiah weakening, the trade deficit will
eventually recover on slower imports and see the rupiah
consolidate toward 10,800 by year-end,” Chang said.  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.90
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
