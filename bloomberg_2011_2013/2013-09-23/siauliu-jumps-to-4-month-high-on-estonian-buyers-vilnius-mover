Siauliu Bankas AB climbed to a
four-month high after a newspaper recommended the Lithuanian
lender and triggered buying by Estonian investors.  The stock rose 7.3 percent to 0.279 euro at 11:22 a.m. in
Vilnius, putting the bank’s value at 70 million euros ($94
million) and extending a gain of 2 percent from Sept. 20. Volume
of 224,387 shares was more than triple the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Estonia ’s Aripaev business newspaper said in an  article 
last week that Siauliu Bankas is one of the best equity picks
for retail investors in the three Baltic countries. The bank,
which is 19.6 percent owned by the  European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development , agreed in February to assume
insured deposits from Ukio Bankas AB in a deal that almost
doubled its size.  “Interest started Friday with large buy orders coming out
of Estonia, and today we’re seeing a big flow of orders through
an Estonian intermediary,” Marius Ignotas, head of equity
trading at Swedbank in Vilnius, said by e-mail. “It looks like
retail investors took interest in Siauliu Bankas after Aripaev
said it was a rapidly growing lender with big ambitions.”  Arvydas Jacikevicius, senior broker at SEB in Vilnius, said
by e-mail that, in his view, the main reason for the share’s
gain was “a large seller who dominated the market in recent
months has been nowhere to be seen since Friday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
