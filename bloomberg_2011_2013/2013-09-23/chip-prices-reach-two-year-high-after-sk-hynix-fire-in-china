Smartphone and computer makers face
higher costs for a key component as memory-chip prices surged 42
percent, reaching the highest in more than two years, following
a fire at an  SK Hynix Inc. (000660)  plant in  China .  The  price  of the benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit dynamic random-access memory chip reached $2.27 yesterday, compared with $1.60
on Sept. 4, when a fire forced the closing of SK Hynix’s factory
in Wuxi, according to DRAMeXchange, Asia’s largest market for
the components. Icheon, South Korea-based SK Hynix expects to
resume production on the fire-hit line next month.  SK Hynix, the world’s second-largest producer of memory
chips with  customers  including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and  Sony
Corp. (6758) , has boosted production in  South Korea  to reduce the
impact of the fire. The surge in prices may affect smartphone
makers as International Data Corp. forecasts that China
shipments alone will surge to 450 million units next year from
360 million units this year.  “Chip prices will continue to rise throughout the fourth
quarter or at least there will be no drop until the operation
gets into full swing,” Oh Sang Woo, a Seoul-based analyst at
Leading Investment & Securities Co., said yesterday. “The
market previously expected the price to peak out in the fourth
quarter.”  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  may be the biggest beneficiary as an
alternative supplier, Oh said. The Boise, Idaho-based company’s
stock has risen 23 percent since the fire.  Samsung Electronics  SK Hynix shares  rose  0.8 percent to 30,550 won at the close
of trade in Seoul. The stock has  gained  19 percent this year,
compared with a 0.6 percent rise in the benchmark Kospi index.  Before the fire, memory-chips hadn’t crossed $2.20 since
February 2011, when they reached $2.30.  The blaze, which occurred during the installation of
equipment, burned for about 90 minutes before being extinguished.
One person suffered minor injuries.  SK Hynix said Sept. 13 it will fully recover normal output
levels in November after resuming part operation at an
unaffected line on Sept. 8. The company yesterday declined to
comment beyond its earlier statement.  SK Hynix makes half of its chips in Wuxi. The company held
about 30 percent of the global DRAM market in the second quarter,
following  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co.’s 32.7 percent, TrendForce
said in an Aug. 8 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
