More than a dozen firms that
produce fake online reviews of businesses agreed to stop the
practice under a settlement with the New York Attorney General
Eric T. Schneiderman.  The attorney general’s office said today that 19 companies
involved in producing bogus reviews will also pay $350,000 in
penalties. An undercover probe dubbed “Operation Clean Turf”
turned up evidence that the companies were paid by local
businesses to flood the Internet with comments on websites
including Yelp, Google Local and CitySearch, the office said.  “‘Astroturfing’ is the 21st century’s version of false
advertising, and prosecutors have many tools at their disposal
to put an end to it,” Schneiderman said in a statement.  The companies were also accused of violating state laws
against deceptive business practices.  Online reviews can have a dramatic effect on local
businesses, University of California, Berkeley economists found
in a 2011 study. The research concluded that an extra half-star
rating on Yelp could increase a restaurant’s likelihood of
filling all of its tables by 49 percent, according to the study.  In the probe, investigators posed as the owner of a yogurt
shop in  Brooklyn , New York, and called search-engine
optimization companies for help in combating negative reviews,
according to Schneiderman’s office. The companies subject to
today’s settlement offered to provide fake reviews by freelance
writers from places including the  Philippines ,  Bangladesh  and
Eastern Europe, the office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
