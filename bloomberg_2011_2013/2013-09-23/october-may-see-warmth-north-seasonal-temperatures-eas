Warmer-than-normal temperatures may
spread across the northern U.S. while most of the East Coast
remains seasonal through the first week of October.  Temperatures from the Pacific Northwest to northern  New
England  will be about 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.8
Celsius) higher than usual from Sept. 28 to Oct. 7, while much
of the Midwest and East have normal readings, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .
Readings across central  Canada  may be much warmer.  “Outside of some stronger cooling for the interior West in
the short range,” the outlook for the 6- to 15-day forecast
“is one of very few extremes overall as the main impressive
warm anomalies reside in Canada,” Rogers said in an e-mailed
forecast today.  Energy traders watch temperature fluctuations to gauge how
much natural gas, oil and coal will be needed for heating homes
and businesses. When daily averages fall below 65 degrees there
is usually a boost in demand for the day.  Above-normal temperatures are expected to cover the West
from British Columbia to California, according to  MDA Weather
Services  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Readings in western
California may be 5 to 8 degrees above the usual from Oct. 3 to
Oct. 7.  The daily average temperature in New York on Oct. 2 is
about 62 degrees, according to MDA. In Boston it’s 58; in
Chicago, 57;  St. Louis , 63; Houston, 74; Seattle, 57; and in
Burbank, California, it’s 70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
