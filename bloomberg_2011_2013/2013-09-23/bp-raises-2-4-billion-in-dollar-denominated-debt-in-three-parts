BP Plc, the oil and natural gas
producer, sold $2.4 billion of dollar-denominated bonds in three
parts.  The company’s BP Capital Markets unit issued $1.65 billion
of five-year debt, comprising $900 million of 2.241 percent
debentures yielding 80 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $750 million of floating-rate notes paying 63
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $750
million of 3.994 percent, 10-year securities at a relative yield
of 130 basis points.  BP’s $1.5 billion of 2.75 percent debentures due 2023, sold
in May at a relative yield of 108 basis points, traded at 91.25
cents on the dollar to yield 3.85 percent on Sept. 19, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the offering
for the London-based company, Bloomberg data show.  The bonds are expected to be rated A2 by Moody’s Investors
Service and proceeds will be used for general corporate
purposes, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
