An Azeri court sentenced opposition
leader Ali Karimli’s son to 25 days in prison for “not
obeying” police, a charge Karimli said was aimed at putting
pressure on him before next month’s presidential election.  Turkel Karimli, a graduate of the U.K.’s University of
Bristol, and two of his friends were detained late yesterday
after they allegedly tore down campaign banners in the capital,
Baku, Karimli’s People’s Front of Azerbaijan Party, or AXCP,
said today in a statement on its website.  “AXCP views this as pressure against the party, democratic
forces as a whole and Ali Karimli himself,” it said. The
charges are “groundless and politically motivated.”  AXCP and its allies last month nominated Camil Hasanli, a
historian and professor at Baku State University, to challenge
President  Ilham Aliyev  in the Oct. 9 vote. Aliyev, 51, who
succeeded his father in a disputed presidential ballot 10 years
ago, is competing for a third term in office. His family has run
the oil-rich  Caspian Sea  state for more than four decades.  The authorities are engaged in a “deliberate” and
“abusive” strategy to limit dissent before the vote,  Human
Rights Watch  said Sept. 2. The New York-based group also
reported a “dramatic” deterioration in the government’s record
on freedom of expression, assembly, and association in the last
18 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
