Sugar fell the most in almost four
weeks in  New York  on signs supplies are expanding in India, the
world’s second-biggest producer,  Thailand  and  China . Cocoa rose.  Sugar production in India will be 25 million metric tons in
2013-14, 5.5 percent more than estimated in July as the best
monsoon rainfall in almost two decades boosts yields, the Indian
Sugar Mills Association said on Sept. 16. An “excellent
monsoon” will also mean bigger output in China and Thailand,
the second-biggest exporter, Tom McNeill, a director at
Brisbane, Australia-based sugar and biofuels researcher Green
Pool Commodity Specialists Pty. said by e-mail today.  “We boosted our China production forecast to over 13
million tons last week, and the Thai crop also seems to be
firming for around 11 million tons,” McNeill said in a report
e-mailed today. “ India ’s output is also expected higher, with
raw exports being touted for early in an early harvest.”  Raw sugar for delivery in March fell 0.9 percent to 17.59
cents a pound by 7:07 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
price fell as much as 1.2 percent, the most since Aug. 27. White
sugar for December delivery slid 0.4 percent to $484.30 a ton on
NYSE Liffe in London.  Chinese production will expand in the 12 months starting
Oct. 1 from a previous forecast of 12.8 million tons, McNeill
said. While Thailand is currently set to produce 10.8 million
tons in the period, output may reach as much as 11 million tons,
he said. That compares with 10 million tons in 2012-13. Indian
exports are forecast to reach as much as 3 million tons in
2013-14, Marex Spectron Group said in a report e-mailed today.  Surplus  Raw sugar futures, down 9.8 percent this year, are heading
for a third annual decline, the longest slump since 1992.
Supplies will outpace demand by a record 10 million tons in the
season ending this month, estimates the  International Sugar
Organization  in London. A smaller surplus of 2 million tons is
forecast for next season, according to Czarnikow Group Ltd in
London, which traded 2.4 million tons of raw sugar in 2012.  Large and small speculators excluding  index funds  turned

Bloomberg showed. Their net-long position was 20,371 contracts

now recognized that ‘the future is bullish,’ or that they are
accumulating ammunition with which to sell the market,” said
Robin Shaw, an analyst at Marex Spectron. “No one seems to have
a strong view on sugar today.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to
