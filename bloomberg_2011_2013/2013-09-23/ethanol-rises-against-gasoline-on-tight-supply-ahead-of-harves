Ethanol advanced versus gasoline on
concern that distilleries will face challenges in obtaining corn
before the harvest is finished.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 8.12 cents to
73.7 cents a gallon. A Sept. 18 Energy Information
Administration report showed ethanol stockpiles in the Midwest
region were 20 percent lower in the week ended Sept. 13 than a
year earlier.  “Product continues to be tough to come by in the short
term,” said Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels desk at
Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in New York. “There’s not much of it
around and volumes will be low until we get some new-crop
ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery climbed 2 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $1.886 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have declined 14 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery slipped 6.12 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.623 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The U.S. corn harvest is usually from September through
November.  Corn for December delivery added 2.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.5325 a bushel in Chicago. The December crush
spread of corn to ethanol was break-even, down from 1 cent Sept.
20. All other crush spreads through 2015 were negative.  Ethanol Stockpiles  Total ethanol  stockpiles  have fallen 16 percent in the past
year to 16.2 million barrels, data from the EIA, the Energy
Department’s analytical arm, show. Production has dropped 5.3
percent to 838,000 barrels a day from this year’s high in June.  Imports have also dropped, plummeting 96 percent to 3,000
barrels a day from the high in January, according to the EIA.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 5 cents to $2.45 a
gallon in  New York  and 5 cents to $2.325 a gallon on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices in the U.S. Gulf
sank 4.5 cents to $2.33 and in Chicago fell 2.5 cents to $2.975.  The Gulf’s premium to the West Coast shrank by 9.5 cents to
0.5 cent, while New York’s  premium  to Chicago slipped 7.5 cents
to 52.5 cents from a record.  A 2007 energy law known as the Renewable Fuels Standard
requires the country to use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this
year. Tracking certificates called Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINS, are attached to each gallon of biofuel to help
monitor compliance.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs fell 1 cent to 54 cents and
advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, declined 1 cent to 63 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
