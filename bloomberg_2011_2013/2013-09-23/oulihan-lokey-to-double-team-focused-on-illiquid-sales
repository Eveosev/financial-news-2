Houlihan Lokey, the closely held
investment bank that started advising on secondary sales of
private-equity and hedge-fund stakes fours years ago, plans to
more than double staff in that unit to 20 professionals or more
as it expands into sales of other illiquid assets.  Houlihan Lokey created an Illiquid Financial Asset practice
to advise on the sales of assets such as stakes in loan pools,
life settlements, minority positions, pharmaceutical royalties
and operating leases, the Los Angeles-based firm said today in a
statement. The unit will also advise private-equity firms on
structured deals in situations where they are unable to raise
successor funds.  Interests in existing private-equity funds and similar
offerings can typically be bought and sold only through
negotiated sales on the secondary market. Houlihan Lokey’s
secondary-advisory group was created in 2009 to advise on the
sale of stakes in private-equity funds and deals, and almost
immediately added sales of hedge-fund assets. Houlihan Lokey’s
secondary team, which currently has eight professionals, has
opportunistically advised on the disposal of other illiquid
assets by banks, insurance companies and other financial
institutions.  The new practice, which will be co-led by Jeff Hammer and
Paul Sanabria, will add staff in New York,  London  and Hong Kong.
The firm will hire Dilip Awtani on Oct. 1 as a managing director
in London. Awtani had previously served as managing director and
head of European debt investments at real estate investment firm
Colony Capital LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
