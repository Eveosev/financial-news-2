New infections with HIV fell by one
third globally between 2001 and 2012, according to a United
Nations report that shows the success of efforts to turn back
the tide of the world’s deadliest infectious disease.  Worldwide, 2.3 million people were newly infected with the
AIDS-causing virus last year, compared with 3.4 million in 2001,
the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS, or UNAIDS, wrote in a report
today. AIDS-related deaths fell 30 percent to 1.6 million last
year from the peak in 2005, the Geneva-based agency said.  Investment in antiretroviral drugs increased to $18.9
billion last year compared with $3.8 billion in 2002. More than
half of that comes from low- and middle-income countries,
according to the report.  “Today we have the tools we need to lay the groundwork to
end the AIDS epidemic,” Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS’s executive
director, said in the report. Still, “in several countries that
have experienced significant declines in new HIV infections,
disturbing signs have emerged of increases in sexual risk
behaviors among young people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
