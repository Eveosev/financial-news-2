American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
and  Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A)  agreed to end a 2009
lawsuit in which Brookfield sought a judge’s ruling that the
insurer’s collapse triggered default provisions in  interest-rate
swaps .  Brookfield sued in federal court in Manhattan, alleging New
York-based AIG and its Financial Products unit “refused to
concede the occurrence” of a default even though AIG got a
$182.3 billion bailout package from the U.S. government.  Brookfield, based in Toronto, and its Brysons International
Ltd. unit, which joined in the suit as a plaintiff, sought a
declaration from a federal judge that the insurer’s collapse
triggered default provisions in two 1990 interest-rate swaps.
AIG had said that Brookfield, based in Toronto, had attempted to
evade a $1.5 billion debt.  Brookfield, Brysons and AIG notified U.S. District Judge
Ronnie Abrams in filings today that the companies agreed to end
the suit and that each party would “bear its own costs, fees
and expenses.”  Andrew Willis, a Brookfield spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to a phone call seeking comment on the court filing.  Jon Diat, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment.  In August, AIG agreed to accept $905 million from
Brookfield to resolve the litigation.  The case is Brookfield v. AIG, 09-cv-8285, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
