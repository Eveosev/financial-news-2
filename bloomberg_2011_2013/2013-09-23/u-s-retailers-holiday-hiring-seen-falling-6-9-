Holiday hiring by U.S. retailers
may fall about 6.9 percent this year as shaky  consumer
confidence  and more efficient store practices reduce demand for
seasonal workers, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.  Retailers will hire about 700,000 temporary staff this
year, down from 751,800 last year, the Chicago-based employment
consulting firm said today in a statement. Last year’s hiring
was a 12-year high and up 14 percent from 2011, the firm said.  The forecast signals retailers are approaching the holiday
season with caution after second-quarter results at companies
from  Macy’s Inc. (M)  to  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  showed shoppers were
restraining purchases on non-essential items. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary  index  of consumer
sentiment this month fell to the lowest level since April.  “While the economy and the job market are improving, it
has now been four years since the recession officially ended and
millions of Americans are still unemployed or underemployed,”
Challenger Chief Executive Officer  John Challenger  said in the
statement. “As a result, consumers remain uneasy, which is
evidenced by wide monthly mood swings in confidence surveys.”  Retail sales at stores may rise 2.4 percent during November
and December, down from a 3 percent increase in 2012 and a 4
percent gain in 2011, research firm ShopperTrak said last week.
Store traffic may drop 1.4 percent from last year, the Chicago-based researcher said.  Shorter Season  Deloitte LLP, a New York-based consulting firm, said today
that retail sales including online and other non-store purchases
may rise as much as 4.5 percent from November through January,
in line with last year’s gain.  Stores traditionally start hiring for the holiday season,
which starts on Black Friday and ends at Christmas, in October.
The holiday shopping period is important for retailers’ sales
figures, and this year’s holiday season is six days shorter than
last year, making up only 25 days instead of the 31 shopping
days in 2012.  Some retailers have begun announcing holiday hiring plans.
Wal-Mart said today that it would boost holiday hiring to
55,000, a 10 percent increase from last year’s 50,000 seasonal
hires. The company also will move 35,000 workers to full-time
status from part-time and another 35,000 to part-time from
temporary.  Target Corp. (TGT)  said in a post on its website last week last
week it would take on about 70,000 workers, 20 percent fewer
than a year earlier.  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS)  said last week that it plans to hire about
53,000 workers for the holiday season. That number will include
6,400 seasonal positions at distribution centers and about 40
workers per store, the  Menomonee Falls , Wisconsin-based retailer
said. Kohl’s, which operates 1,158 stores, made a similar number
of hires last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
