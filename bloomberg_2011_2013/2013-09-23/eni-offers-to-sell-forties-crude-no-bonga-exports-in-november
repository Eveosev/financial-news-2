Eni SpA (ENI)  failed to sell three  North
Sea  Forties crude cargoes at lower prices than its previous
offer. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals crude.  No exports of Nigerian Bonga crude are planned in November,
compared with six cargoes totaling 193,555 barrels a day next
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.
Royal Dutch Shell Plc declared force majeure on Bonny Light
exports and closing Trans Niger Pipeline,  Precious Okolobo , a
Lagos-based spokesman, said by e-mail.  North Sea  Eni offered the first Forties lot for loading Oct. 4 to
Oct. 6 at 30 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the second at
a premium of 50 cents for Oct. 8 to Oct. 10 and the third at
plus 65 cents for Oct. 10 to Oct. 12, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window. That compares with its offer at $1.05 a barrel above the
benchmark on Sept. 20.  Trafigura Beheer BV withdrew its bid for Forties for Oct.
15 to Oct. 18 at 25-cents premium, the survey showed.  Eni was unable to sell Ekofisk for Oct. 8 to Oct. 10 at a
premium of $2.25 to Dated Brent, according to the survey. This
is the first offer since Aug. 1.  Brent for November settlement traded at $108.01 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.12 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $107.29, a discount of 72 cents to November.  Forties F1008 will load on Oct. 14 to Oct. 16, two days
earlier than planned, two people with knowledge of the shipping
program said. This is the third advancement for October.  Urals/Mediterranean  Iraq will increase shipments of Kirkuk crude in October via
Turkish port of Ceyhan to 16 cargoes, or 243,871 barrels a day,
a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed. This
compares with 11 lots, or 109,333 barrels a day in September,
the lowest since at least June 2011, when Bloomberg started
tracking data.  Russia will export 16 cargoes of Urals via Primorsk on the
 Baltic Sea  and 10 cargoes ex-Ust-Luga, both from Sept. 30 to
Oct. 11, a preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News showed. Shipments are 100,000 metric tons each.  Four lots of 140,000 tons each and seven 80,000-ton
shipments of crude will be exported via Novorossiysk in the
 Black Sea  on Oct. 1 to Oct. 11, according to the plan.  Libya ’s Hariga terminal will reopen soon as “technical
issues” are being resolved, Jamal Ben Zuglam, coordinator for
the Oil and Gas Workers Union, said by phone from Tripoli today,
without giving an exact date for the reopening.  Sarir and Mesla oil fields will start pumping once the port
opens, Ben Zuglam said.  PKN Orlen SA closed a tender today to buy 100,000 tons of
Urals for loading from the Baltic Sea, said two people who have
received the tender, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  West Africa  BP Plc (BP/)  offered 600,000 barrels of Qua Iboe at either $5.50
a barrel more than Dated Brent for Oct. 8 to Oct. 13 delivery to
Rotterdam, or plus $5.35 to Lavera in  France  on the Dilong
Spirit crude carrier, according to the survey. This is unchanged
from its previous offer on Sept. 19.  The export restrictions on Bonny and gas supply to Nigeria
LNG Ltd. came after Shell shut the pipeline for repairs of new
leaks at Bodo West and Oloma due to theft. About 150,000 barrels
a day of oil and 500 million cubic feet of gas are deferred.  The drop in Bonga shipments is because the oil field will
be shut for planned maintenance, said two traders who
participate in the market, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential. The start date and duration of
the halt is unclear, they said.  Officials from Shell, which operates the field, declined to
comment from London and  Nigeria  on the maintenance plan.  Nigeria will keep crude  exports  for November little changed
from October, according to loading programs.  The nation will ship 63 cargoes or 1.89 million barrels a
day in November, the plans showed. Africa’s largest oil producer
will ship five Akpo, four Usan, three each of Amenam and Erha,
and two EA in November. Cargoes are mostly of
950,000 to 1 million barrels.  Indian Oil Corp. bought two Nigerian Qua Iboe cargoes for
November loading from Vitol Group via a tender, which closed
last week, said three traders who participate in the market. The
company also purchased one cargo each of Qua Iboe and EA from
Shell via the same tender, two traders said last week.  India ’s largest refiner has bought eight cargoes of 1
million barrels each of Nigerian crudes for November via the
last two tenders, including five lots of Qua Iboe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
