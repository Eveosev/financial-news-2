Julie Dickson,  Canada ’s top
financial industry regulator, said insurance-linked securities
such as catastrophe bonds can be helpful in managing risks of
major losses.  Dickson, who heads the Ottawa-based Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said in a speech today
there has been an increase in the “frequency and severity” of
such losses.  “Catastrophe bonds can be used to help companies to reduce
exposure to certain risks, including earthquakes,” Dickson said
in the text of the speech she’s giving to a conference of
insurers near Ottawa. Such bonds “can be a good addition to an
insurer’s risk management program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
