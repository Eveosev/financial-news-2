Money managers more than doubled
bearish bets on robusta coffee traded in  London  as  Vietnam , the
world’s leading producer of the variety used in instant drinks
and espresso, is set for a record crop, NYSE Liffe data showed.  Investors held a net-short position, or a bet on falling
prices, of 6,216 futures and options in the week ended Sept. 17,
the Commitments of Traders report on the bourse’s website today
showed. That compares with 2,619 contracts a week earlier and is
the biggest bet on lower prices since July 9, according to
exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. Robusta coffee futures fell
2.8 percent in the seven days to Sept. 17.  Vietnam’s robusta crop probably will rise 17 percent to a
record 1.7 million metric tons in the 2013-14 season starting
Oct. 1, the median of nine estimates from local traders and
shippers compiled by Bloomberg last month showed. That implies a
harvest of 28.3 million bags, each weighing 60 kilograms (132
pounds). Volcafe, a unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings
Ltd., on Aug. 30 predicted a 30 million-bag crop.  “Robusta remains weak with the proximity of the big
Vietnamese harvest as well as rising production in  Africa ,”
 Rodrigo Costa , a trading director at Caturra Coffee Corp. a
dealer in Elmsford,  New York , wrote in a report e-mailed today
for Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting, where he is a
contributor. Robusta, trading at $1,676 a ton, is technically
targeting support at $1,600 a ton, he said.  Buyers of coffee from the new crop in Vietnam want to get a
discount to futures prices, Volcafe said in a Sept. 20 report.
There is “constant demand” for beans for shipment in November
and December, the trader said. While the first red cherries in
Vietnam have already been picked by farmers, the majority of the
new crop “will only come from December,” Amsterdam-based
trader Nedcoffee BV said in a Sept. 17 report.  Cocoa  In cocoa, money managers cut bullish bets from a record in
the period, the data showed. Investors held a net-long position,
or a bet on higher prices, of 60,460 futures and options from a
high of 61,644 contracts a week earlier. NYSE Liffe started
publishing trader holdings in 2011. The beans for December
delivery rose 1 percent in the period.  In white, or refined, sugar, money managers more than
doubled their net-long position. Investors were betting on
higher prices by 9,422 futures and options as of Sept. 17, up
from 4,566 contracts a week earlier, exchange data showed. The
sweetener slid 2.2 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers decreased their net-short
position to 485 contracts from 580 lots a week earlier. The
grain retreated 2.1 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
