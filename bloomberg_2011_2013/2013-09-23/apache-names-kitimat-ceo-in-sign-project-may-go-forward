Apache Corp. (APA)  appointed Rod Eichler
to be chief executive officer of Kitimat, a proposed Canadian
liquefied natural gas export facility, indicating the project
may be moving forward.  “It’s a veiled hint that they are positively inclined this
project is going to move forward,”  Leo Mariani , an oil and gas
analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a phone interview today.
“He knows the international markets and has run a lot of
international business for them.”  Eichler has been with Apache for 20 years, including the
past two years as chief operating officer, the Houston-based
company said in a statement today. The appointment was announced
as part of a series of executive changes that will be effective
Jan. 1. Bill Mintz, an Apache spokesman, declined to comment on
whether the project was more likely to go forward. Eichler will
ensure the company’s resources are aligned to push to a final
 investment decision , he said in an e-mail.  The Kitimat project, 50 percent owned by  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
would allow for exports of Canadian gas to overseas markets,
including Asia. It’s one of several facilities proposed for the
Pacific Coast as production in Western Canada has increased.
Chevron said last month a final investment decision on the
project probably won’t come until 2014.  The Eichler appointment “shows an emphasis on the
project,”  John Malone , an executive director at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc., said in a phone interview. “It’s an
encouraging sign that they’re putting someone at that level of
the company in charge of the development of the project.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
