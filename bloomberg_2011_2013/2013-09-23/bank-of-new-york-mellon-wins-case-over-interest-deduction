Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  is
entitled to deduct interest on a loan linked to a transaction
with a British bank that generated disallowed tax credits, a
U.S. Tax Court judge ruled.  The loan “served a purpose beyond the creation of the tax
benefits,” Judge Diane Kroupa wrote in an opinion released
today.  Kroupa’s decision grew out of her ruling earlier this year
that BNY Mellon could not claim $199 million of tax credits and
related expense deductions for 2001 and 2002 from a series of
transactions with London-based  Barclays Banks PLC (BCS)  because they
had no economic substance.  BNY Mellon didn’t challenge Kroupa’s ruling on the tax
credits and instead argued that since she ruled that the loan
proceeds could be used by the bank for business purposes,
interest on them is deductible.  Kroupa agreed, writing that “despite being overpriced, the
loan proceeds were available” for banking and thus BNY Mellon
“is entitled to deduct the interest that accrued on the loan
for the years at issue.”  The ruling didn’t indicate the amount of interest at stake.  The  case  is Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. v. IRS, 09-26683,
U.S. Tax Court (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
