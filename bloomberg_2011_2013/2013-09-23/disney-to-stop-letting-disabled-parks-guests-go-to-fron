Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  will stop letting
disabled people go to the front of the line at its U.S. parks,
in part because some people were abusing the program.  Under the new plan, guests with disabilities will receive
appointments based on current waiting times for rides, according
to the company.  “We are changing our process to create a more consistent
experience for all our guests while providing accommodations for
guests with disabilities,” Kathleen Prihoda, a spokeswoman for
Walt Disney World in  Orlando ,  Florida , said yesterday in a
statement. “We engaged disability groups, such as Autism
Speaks, to develop this new process, which is in line with the
rest of our industry.”  The changes at Disney, the world’s largest theme-park
operator, were partly motivated by abuse of the system,
according to Prihoda. The “Guest Assistance Card” program that
sent disabled guests to the front of attractions at Disneyland
in Anaheim, California, and Walt Disney World will be replaced
on Oct. 9.  The change was reported earlier by the  Orange County
Register  in Southern California. The New York Post  reported  in
May that some wealthy parents from Manhattan were hiring
disabled people to pose as family members to get to the front of
the line.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, was little changed at
$64.70 as of 12:52 p.m. in New York. Through yesterday, the
shares had advanced 30 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
