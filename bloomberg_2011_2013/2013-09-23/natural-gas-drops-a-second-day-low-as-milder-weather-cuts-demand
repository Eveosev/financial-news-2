Natural gas fell to a one-week low
in  New York  on speculation that mild weather will reduce demand
for the fuel, accelerating stockpiling.  Gas declined as much as 1.5 percent as forecasts showed
seasonal weather across most of the lower 48 states from Sept.
28 through Oct. 2, with some higher readings in the Midwest,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .
An unusually hot end to summer slowed  inventory gains  over the
past month.  “It’s a neutral weather scenario and it’s putting pressure
on the market as a result,” said Bob Yawger, director of the
futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “If
you don’t get some unexpected pluses or minuses to your
forecasts, the market will generally drift lower on demand
destruction.”  Natural gas for October delivery fell 4.1 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.646 per million British thermal units at 9:18
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after dropping to
$3.632, the lowest intraday price since Sept. 16. Trading was 13
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices
are up 8.8 percent this year and 2.3 percent for the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
