A solar-thermal power plant that
 Areva SA (AREVA)  is building for Indiaâ€™s  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  will start
operating by the end of this year, the French manufacturer said.  The  Press Trust of India  reported last week that the 21
billion-rupee ($335 million) plant would start next month, which
is wrong, the company said by e-mail in response to a query.  The 100-megawatt project missed a May deadline as
authorities in Rajasthan state failed to lay a water pipe to the
site in time, Reliance Power Chief Executive Officer Jayaram P.
Chalasani said that month.  Solar-thermal plants focus sunlight on liquids to produce
steam for turbines and are valued for their ability to deliver
electricity around the clock. Areva is the biggest producer of
nuclear reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
