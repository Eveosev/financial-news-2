General Electric Co. (GE)  won contracts
for $2.7 billion from a unit of Sonelgaz,  Algeria ’s national
electricity and gas company, in one of the U.S. company’s
largest power-plant orders ever.  GE will supply gas turbine combined-cycle and
aeroderivative gas turbine technology for nine power plants in
the country, adding almost 9 gigawatts of electricity to help
meet rising demand in that country, Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE said in a statement today.  Energy demand in Algeria is growing at an estimated average
annual rate of about 14 percent, GE said, rising from about 12
gigawatts to 20 gigawatts by 2017. Algeria’s government is
committed to boosting energy capacity, GE said.  “Our latest agreements with Sonelgaz underscore our
continuing commitment to supply the best technology and services
to assist Algeria in meeting its growing energy needs,”  Steve Bolze , head of GE Power & Water, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
