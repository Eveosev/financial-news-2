U.K. stocks  fell, following three
weeks of gains, as a report showed the euro area’s manufacturing
industries grew at a slower-than-expected pace this month and
investors assessed the result of  Germany ’s federal election.  National Grid Plc (NG/)  slipped 1.5 percent after UBS AG lowered
its rating on the energy-network operator.  Randgold Resources
Ltd. (RRS)  and Polymetal International Plc both lost more than 1
percent as precious-metal producers declined.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 39.06 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,557.37 at the close in London. The equity benchmark has still
risen 2.3 percent so far this month as Chinese economic reports
beat forecasts and the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly refrained
from reducing its monthly asset purchases. The FTSE All-Share
Index lost 0.6 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped
0.3 percent.  “The market’s digesting a number of factors: the German
election, last week’s Fed decision and various data,”  Keith Bowman , an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in London,
said by telephone. “The Chinese data was reasonably positive.”  The FTSE 100 has risen 5.5 percent so far this quarter,
extending its rally since the beginning of the year to 11
percent. That was its best performance for the first nine months
of the year since 2009.  In the euro area, a measure of  manufacturing  slipped to
51.1 in September from 51.4 in August. That fell short of the
median economist forecast for a reading of 51.7. A gauge of
growth in  services industries  climbed to 52.1 from 50.7. That
exceeded the median estimate of 51. Readings above 50 mean that
activity increased.  Germany’s Election  In Germany,  Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic Union  and
its Bavarian allies fell five seats short of a majority in
 federal elections  yesterday. Merkel needs to find a new
coalition partner after the Free Democrats gained just 4.8
percent, less than the 5 percent threshold needed to win seats
in the lower house of parliament.  In China, the world’s second-largest economy, a
manufacturing index rose to a six-month high in September. The
first reading of 51.2 for a purchasing managers’ index released
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics exceeded the 50.9
 median estimate  of 14 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  National Grid slipped 1.5 percent to 747 pence, its biggest
drop since June. UBS cut its rating to neutral from buy, saying
that the current share price already reflects expected growth in
the value of its assets.  The brokerage  also lowered its 12-month
price forecast to 740 pence from 800 pence.  Randgold and Polymetal, which both mine precious metals,
lost 1.2 percent to 4,621 pence and 1.6 percent to 658 pence,
respectively. The price of gold dropped as much as 3 percent on
Sept. 20, extending its decline after the close of European
equity markets.  Croda International Plc (CRDA)  gained 1.8 percent to 2,727 pence.
Credit Suisse Group AG raised the world’s second-largest maker
of chemicals for cosmetics to outperform from neutral, meaning
that investors should buy the shares. The brokerage said the
company has moved into a period of growing sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
