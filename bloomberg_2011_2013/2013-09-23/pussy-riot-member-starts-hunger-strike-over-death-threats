A jailed member of the female
Russian punk group Pussy Riot began a hunger strike to protest
what her lawyer said were death threats from prison officials.  Nadezhda Tolokonnikova is seeking to either be transferred
out of the facility in the Mordovia region about 450 kilometers
southeast of Moscow or placed in solitary confinement to ensure
her safety, according to a  statement  posted on Openinform.ru and
confirmed by Irina Hrunova, her lawyer.  Tolokonnikova, 23, was convicted of hooliganism and
inciting religious hatred last August for performing a song
critical of President  Vladimir Putin  inside Moscow’s Christ the
Savior cathedral. The case spurred protests by freedom-of-speech
advocates across  Russia  and abroad. Tolokonnikova is serving a
two-year sentence. One member of the group freed last October.  Hrunova said Tolokonnikova has filed a formal complaint
with the Prosecutor General’s Office. Prosecutors have received
the complaint and “will send it to investigators for
checking,” the Interfax news service reported today, citing a
statement by the regional branch of the office.  Penal Colony No. 14, where Tolokonnikova is being held,
declined to comment, according to a woman who answered the
prison’s main number and identified herself as a duty officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
