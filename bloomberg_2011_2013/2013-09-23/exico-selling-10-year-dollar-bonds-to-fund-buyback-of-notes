Mexico  is selling 10-year dollar
bonds in international markets to fund a buyback of shorter-term
securities.  The government said in a regulatory filing in the U.S. that
it will use as much as 75 percent of the cash raised from the
sale to repurchase notes due from 2015 to 2020. Mexico may issue
the 10-year bonds to yield about 1.5 percentage points more than
U.S. Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the
transaction. The sale will be for at least $500 million,
according to the person, who asked not to be identified because
terms of the offering aren’t public.  Latin America ’s second-biggest country is extending bond
maturities after the  Federal Reserve ’s surprise decision last
week to leave its monetary stimulus program intact spurred a
rally in emerging-market debt. The average yield on Mexican
dollar bonds fell 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage point, last
week to 4.89 percent, according to data compiled by JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Barbados is also taking advantage of the rally, saying
today that it plans to sell 2025 bonds to buy back debt due in
2021 and 2022.  Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley are arranging Mexico’s offering. The country last sold
bonds abroad on July 30, when it issued $815 million of yen-denominated notes due in three, five and six years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
