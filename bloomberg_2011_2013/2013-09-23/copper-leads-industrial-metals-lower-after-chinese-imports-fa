Copper led declines in industrial
metals, falling by most in more than a week as lower imports by
China suggested demand by the largest consumer may be weaker
than estimated.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped 1.3 percent to $7,188.50 a metric ton at 10:09
a.m. in Singapore, the biggest drop since Sept. 12. Nickel slid
1.3 percent and tin fell 1.2 percent.  Refined copper imports by China fell 10 percent to 262,942
tons in August from July, the General Administration of Customs
said yesterday. Markets reopened in China,  Hong Kong , South
Korea and Taiwan today after holidays last week when the  Federal
Reserve  unexpectedly announced on Sept. 18 that it needed more
evidence of a U.S. economic recovery before paring its stimulus
program.  “Copper imports may fall further as consumption might be a
bit disappointing in the second half,” said Wu Jianguo, an
analyst at Maike Futures Brokerage Co, citing his own research
after visiting fabricators in eastern China. Wu said prices on
the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange were weaker-than-expected after
the break.  Futures for delivery in December in Shanghai rose 0.3
percent to 51,850  yuan  ($8,472) a ton after being closed on
Sept. 19 and 20. Futures for delivery in December on the Comex
in New York were down 1.4 percent to $3.2740 a pound. Comex
prices rose 3.7 percent last week while on the LME they advanced
3.4 percent.  LME futures had fallen as much 1.6 percent today before a
Chinese manufacturing index rose to a six-month high. The
preliminary reading of 51.2 for September a  Purchasing Managers ’
Index by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics beat the median
estimate of 50.9 from 14 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
