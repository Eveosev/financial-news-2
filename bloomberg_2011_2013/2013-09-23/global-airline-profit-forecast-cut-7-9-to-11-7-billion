Airline profits worldwide in 2013
will be 7.9 percent smaller than estimated at $11.7 billion amid
sluggish travel demand and rising oil prices tied to the  Syria
crisis , the International Air Transport Association said.  The forecast released today compares with IATA’s projection
in June for 2013 profit of $12.7 billion. The new figure would
be a 58 percent jump from 2012’s $7.4 billion, according to an
update from the Montreal-based industry group, whose members
account for 84 percent of global air traffic.  The economy is “not improving as quickly as we expected,”
IATA Chief Executive Officer Tony Tyler said on a conference
call with reporters. IATA predicts global gross domestic product
to expand 2 percent in 2013, down from 2.2 percent last year.  Slowing demand for travel in countries such as  Brazil  is
damping revenue while fuel costs rise. Crude oil, from which jet
fuel is refined, jumped 12 percent since IATA’s last forecast on
June 3, to $104.36 a barrel. Fuel costs will be 31 percent of
airline expenses this year, IATA said.  Passenger growth will be 5 percent this year, short of the
5.3 percent expansion in the previous forecast, IATA said.
That’s also short of last year’s 5.3 percent increase. Cargo
will grow 0.9 percent, down from a forecast of 1.5 percent.  Record Profits  Profits will more than double this year for North American
airlines to $4.9 billion, up from a previous forecast of $4.4
billion, IATA said, as mergers and joint ventures to serve
international markets help improve efficiency. European airlines
are projected to report record profits of $1.7 billion, $100
million more than previously expected.  IATA said profits at Asia-Pacific airlines may be as low as
$3.1 billion -- $1.5 billion less than its June estimate -- amid
slow growth in the region’s emerging economies. African
carriers, which in June were projected to post profits of $100
million, are now expected to lose that amount.  Airlines will see a “significant boost” in 2014 because
of rising  consumer confidence  and improvement in cargo growth,
IATA said. Earnings are forecast to rise to $16.4 billion in
2014 on sales of $743 billion, with all regions seeing improved
profitability.  North American carriers may post $6.3 billion in profits
next year, the industry’s strongest, helped by an improving
economy and “capacity discipline.” Profits at European
airlines are expected to almost double to $3.1 billion.  Carriers including  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) , the
world’s biggest airline, have resisted adding more seats this
year amid concern that slow economic growth would damp travel
demand. That restraint is helping keep planes filled at near-record full levels.  Tyler also cited what he sees as the “increasingly onerous
regulation and government intervention” in the U.S. Department
of Justice’s suit to prevent a merger between American Airlines
and  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)   Today’s forecast is not contingent on the merger going
through, IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
