Australia’s dollar traded 0.6
percent from an almost five-year low versus its  New Zealand 
counterpart on bets interest rates at the nations’ central banks
will diverge.  Traders see 50 percent odds that the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will reduce its cash target rate by April next year,
interest-rate swaps data compiled by Bloomberg show. They see an
87 percent chance the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will raise
borrowing costs in the same period. The Aussie held its first
gain in three days against the greenback as investors ponder
whether the  Federal Reserve  will start to taper stimulus that
has weighed on the U.S. currency.  “The Aussie-kiwi cross is drifting lower on the expected
trajectories of both central banks,” said Alex Sinton, director
for institutional foreign exchange in Auckland at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “The NZ$1.12 zone in recent
times has presented some difficulty, and we really need some new
news to break that.”  The Australian dollar was little changed at NZ$1.1272 as of
9:46 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, after touching NZ$1.12 on
Aug. 1, the weakest since October 2008. It traded at 94.22 U.S.
cents, after gaining 0.4 percent yesterday to 94.31. New
Zealand’s dollar slid 0.2 percent to 83.59 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
