Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot
cargo from  Trinidad & Tobago , ship-tracking data show.  The Madrid Spirit, with a capacity of about 135,000 cubic
meters, will arrive at  Rio de Janeiro  on Sept. 25, according to
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The vessel
loaded the supercooled natural gas from Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point
Fortin terminal and departed Sept. 9, the data show.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Petrobras, as the
Brazilian state-owned company is known, has a floating
regasification terminal at Guanabara Bay.  Petrobras will import as many as 60 cargoes this year, up
from 56 in 2012, the company said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
