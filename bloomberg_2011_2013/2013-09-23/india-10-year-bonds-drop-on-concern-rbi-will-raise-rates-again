India ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
second day on speculation the central bank will further tighten
monetary policy after Governor Raghuram Rajan unexpectedly
increased borrowing costs last week and vowed to tame inflation.  The Reserve Bank of India raised its benchmark  repurchase
rate  to 7.5 percent from 7.25 percent on Sept. 20, the first
increase since 2011. All 36 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
predicted no change. The decision triggered the biggest drop in
government bonds in almost a month, prompting DSP BlackRock
Investment Managers Pvt. to say it is cautious on the notes.
Nomura Holdings Inc. predicts the rate will rise to 8 percent by
March 31 as consumer-price gains average 10 percent this year.  The yield on 7.16 percent sovereign notes due May 2023
jumped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 8.74
percent as of 10:46 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. It surged 39 basis points on Sept. 20.  “A further uptick in inflation ahead of next policy review
will feed into the odds of another rate rise,” DBS Bank Ltd.
economists including Singapore-based Radhika Rao wrote in a
research report. “Friday’s hike is unlikely to mark the
beginning of an aggressive rate-hiking cycle, but much will
depend on how growth and inflation risks evolve, with the latter
likely to remain the policy prerogative.”  India’s  wholesale-price index  rose 6.1 percent in August,
the most in six months, according to the latest government data.
The RBI predicts gains in wholesale prices will be around 5.5
percent in the fiscal year through March 2014. A separate gauge
of  consumer prices  rose 9.52 percent last month.  Rupee Measures  Rajan cut the  marginal standing facility rate  to 9.5
percent from 10.25 percent and relaxed some curbs on cash supply
placed by his predecessor Duvvuri Subbarao to support the rupee.
A weaker currency stokes  inflation  as India imports about 80
percent of its oil needs.  The rupee’s more than 10 percent rebound from a record low
of 68.845 reached Aug. 28 and an “improved” external
environment have allowed the RBI to ease some of those
“exceptional measures,” the central bank said. The RBI’s next
scheduled policy meeting is on Oct. 29.  “The RBI policy has made it very clear that they will look
at curbing inflationary pressures,” Dhawal Dalal, the Mumbai-based head of fixed income at DSP BlackRock, a unit of the
world’s largest asset manager, said in an interview on Sept. 20.
“What comes out very clearly is that we should see a further
increase in the repo rate. The RBI’s current thought process
makes me a little bit more cautious once again.”  Primary dealers underwrote 136.06 billion rupees ($2.2
billion) of the 150 billion rupees of bonds India’s government
will auction today, the RBI said in a statement on Sept. 20.  India’s one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract
used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two
one basis points to 8.85 percent today, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
