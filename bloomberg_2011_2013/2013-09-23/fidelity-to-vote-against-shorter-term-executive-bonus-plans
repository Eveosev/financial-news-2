Fidelity Worldwide Investment ,
which oversees about $257 billion in assets, said it will vote
against executive compensation plans unless companies extend the
minimum periods for bonuses to pay out.  The money manager wrote 400 publicly traded European
companies last summer urging boards to lengthen the period that
executives must own shares to five years before they are allowed
to sell, Fidelity, the world’s second-largest mutual fund
manager, said in a statement today. If they don’t, Fidelity said
it will vote against company compensation reports.  “We have not set out to be radical nor confrontational,”
Dominic Rossi, Fidelity Worldwide’s global chief investment
officer of equities, said in the statement. The proposal
requires “an executive to hold more shares for longer, rather
than cashing them out at the earliest opportunity. This results
in a far better alignment between executive compensation and the
long-term performance of the company.”  Starting in January, Fidelity said it will require
companies in the U.K. and Europe to extend the holding period to
more than three years. The period must then be extended to five
years by January 2015, it said.  The Financial Times reported Rossi’s comments earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
