Brazil ’s swap rates declined to a
one-month low as central bank President Alexandre Tombini said
the $60 billion currency intervention program has been
successful in slowing inflation.  Swap rates due in January 2015 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage points, to 10.05 percent at 12:57 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the lowest level on a closing basis since Aug. 14. The
real climbed 0.5 percent to 2.1999 per dollar after rallying 3.2
percent last week.  Tombini said today on a conference call that the central
bank must remain vigilant in preventing a weaker currency from
stoking inflation. The real has advanced 10 percent since Aug.
22, when Brazil announced a program of currency-swap and credit-line auctions. That is the best performance among all of the
world’s dollar counterparts.  “The swap rates curve is being influenced by the real’s
appreciation,”  Andre Perfeito , the chief economist at Gradual
Investimentos in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  Brazil’s annual inflation slowed in the year through mid-September to below 6 percent for the first time in nine months,
the national statistics agency reported last week.  Policy makers have raised the  target lending rate  by 1.75
percentage points from a record low 7.25 percent in April, the
fastest pace of monetary tightening among 49 major economies
tracked by Bloomberg. At 9 percent, the central bank has the
highest target lending rate in  Latin America .  To contact the reporters on this story:
