Ablynx NV (ABLX) , a Belgian developer of
an experimental drug against rheumatoid arthritis, rose to the
highest price in more than two years after selling rights to the
treatment to  AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)  for as much as $840 million.  Ablynx climbed as much as 14 percent to 8.47 euros, the
highest since July 2011. The shares traded 11 percent higher at
8.25 euros as of 9:34 a.m. in Brussels. The stock has almost
doubled in the past year,  compared  with a 20 percent gain in the
benchmark Bel20 Index.  AbbVie, the North Chicago-based drugmaker carved out of
Abbott Laboratories at the start of the year, will pay $175
million for the rights to develop ALX-0061 in rheumatoid
arthritis and lupus, the two companies said in a statement
today. Payments linked to development and sales could make the
deal worth as much as $665 million, and Ghent-based Ablynx may
also receive “double-digit” royalties on revenue from the
drug, the companies said.  The terms of the deal are “well beyond our initial
expectations,” Jan De Kerpel, an analyst at KBC Securities in
Brussels, wrote in a note today.  ALX-0061 is in the second of three stages of patient trials
usually required for U.S. regulatory approval. If successful,
the drug would compete with  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Actemra. Ablynx
will be responsible for completing the so-called phase-two
studies, after which AbbVie will take over development of the
drug.  To contact the reporter on this story:
