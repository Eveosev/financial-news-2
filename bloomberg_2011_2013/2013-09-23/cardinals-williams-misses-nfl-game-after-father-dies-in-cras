Arizona  Cardinals nose tackle Dan
Williams missed yesterday’s National Football League game after
his father was killed in a car accident while traveling to New
Orleans from  Memphis  to see his son play.  Williams, 26, was the Cardinals’ first-round pick in the
2010 NFL draft out of the University of Tennessee.  “Our prayers and thoughts go to Dan,” Cardinals coach
Bruce Arians said after yesterday’s 31-7 loss in New Orleans.  The Cardinals said on their website that Williams’s father,
Thomas Williams, was killed in the accident while his mother and
sister, who were also in the car, are both expected to recover.
Williams’s mother remains in a hospital in Jackson,  Mississippi .
The Arizona Republic said the accident occurred on Sept. 20.  “It was very tough,” defensive tackle Darnell Dockett
told reporters after the game. “I thought about him in the game
a few times. We miss him, but family is much more important than
the National Football League on any level. He needs to take as
much time as he can with his family.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
