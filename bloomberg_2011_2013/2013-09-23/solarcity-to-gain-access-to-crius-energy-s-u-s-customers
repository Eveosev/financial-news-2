SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the rooftop-solar
power provider that’s quadrupled in value since its December
initial public offering, struck a marketing partnership that
gives it access to  Crius Energy Trust (KWH-U) ’s customer base in the
U.S. Northeast.  Crius, a Toronto-based energy retailer, has about 230,000
customers in nine U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and will
initially offer SolarCity’s services in New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and Delaware, the solar
company said today in a statement. Crius will earn a commission
on every sale.  The agreement is expected to reduce San Mateo, California-based SolarCity’s customer-acquisition costs and help Chief
Executive Officer  Lyndon Rive  reach a goal of 1 million
customers, or 6,000 megawatts installed, by 2018. Rive estimated
in July that acquisition costs in the industry are about $2,000
to $3,000 and should eventually fall to $50 to $100.  The partnership makes “clean energy more accessible and
affordable to a wide range of American homeowners,” Rive said
in the statement. The company had installed a total of 387
megawatts as of June 30.  SolarCity agreed in August to acquire the direct marketing
company Paramount Energy Solutions LLC for about $120 million in
stock and cash to boost sales. The company slipped 1.3 percent
to $36.73 at 10:14 a.m. in New York. It went public in December
at $8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
