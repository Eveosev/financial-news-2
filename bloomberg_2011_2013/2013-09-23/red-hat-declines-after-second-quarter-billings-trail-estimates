Red Hat Inc. (RHT) , the largest seller of
Linux operating-system software, fell the most since 2006 after
reporting second-quarter billings that missed analysts’
estimates.  Billings, a predictor of future revenue, rose 8 percent
from a year earlier to $376 million, the Raleigh, North
Carolina-based company said yesterday in a statement. Analysts
at CLSA had projected an increase of 17 percent, and Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. predicted 14 percent growth.  Red Hat’s business was hurt by a slowdown in Europe, while
billings were lower than expected because of exchange rates and
as customers set up contracts with longer payment terms, the
company said. That will continue as Red Hat lands more large
deals with flexible payment options for customers, Chief
Executive Officer Jim Whitehurst said in an interview.  “It’s going to happen more as we continue to grow,”
Whitehurst said. “It will continue to be a bit of a drag.”  Red Hat  fell  12 percent to $46.73 at the close in New York,
the biggest decline since October 2006. The shares are also down
12 percent so far this year, while the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  gained 19 percent.  Sales in the period ended Aug. 31 rose 16 percent to $374.4
million, compared with the $372.1 million average analyst
estimate, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit,
excluding some costs, was 35 cents a share, topping the 33-cent
average estimate. Net income rose 17 percent to $40.8 million,
or 21 cents a share, from $35 million, or 18 cents, a year ago.  Billings Miss  Investors focused on the billings number even as revenue
and earnings per share topped estimates.  “While Red Hat beat on revenues, EPS and cash flows, it
missed the key billings metric by a wide margin,” wrote Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc., in a note to
clients. On average, analysts had estimated billings of $398
million, said Lamba, who has a buy rating on the shares.  Red Hat forecast third-quarter sales of $381 million to
$384 million, lagging the $391.5 million average analyst
estimate. For the full year, sales will be $1.51 billion to
$1.52 billion, below the $1.53 billion average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
