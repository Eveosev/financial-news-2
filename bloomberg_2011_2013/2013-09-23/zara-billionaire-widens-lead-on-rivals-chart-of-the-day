Amancio Ortega , the world’s third-richest man, widened his lead over billionaire fast-fashion
rivals  Stefan Persson  and Tadashi Yanai last week, as strong
performance from his  Inditex SA (ITX)  gave further rise to a fortune
that has risen more than 57 percent since the March 2012 debut
of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows Ortega’s Inditex is the only one
among Persson’s Hennes & Mauritz AB and Yanai’s  Fast Retailing (9983) 
Co. with an expanding margin on earnings before interest, taxes,
amortization and one-time items the past three years on a
trailing 12-month basis. The middle panel shows the store count
for the Arteixo, Spain-based  retailer , which also includes
Massimo Dutti products, has grown to 6,100 outlets, more than
twice that of Persson’s  H&M (HMB)  and five-fold more than the
chain controlled by Yanai,  Japan ’s richest man.  The bottom panel compares consensus analyst
recommendations, with Zara’s operator scoring 3.5 out of a
possible 5, compared with 2.9 for Stockholm-based H&M and 2.7
for Uniqlo-led Fast Retailing.  “Inditex has managed to outdo rivals such as H&M and Fast
Retailing in Ebitda because it’s better at readjusting its
different brands and launching new ones,” Francisco Salvador, a
Madrid-based strategist at FGA/MG Valores, said in a phone
interview. “Zara is both cheap and cool. A top model or even a
princess may regularly buy at Prada, but they would also be
proud of wearing and showing off Zara clothes. They will
probably never acknowledge wearing H&M or Uniqlo, though.”  Ortega, 77, has a net worth of $61.1 billion, according to
the index, a rise from $38.8 billion in March 2012 and up 6
percent in 2013. Sweden’s Persson is the world’s 16th-richest
person with $29.7 billion, up 21 percent this year. Yanai is
ranked 41st with $18.4 billion, a 46 percent increase.  Inditex reported a 0.7 percent rise in first-half profit to
951 million euros ($1.3 billion) on Sept. 18. The performance
beat the 934 million-euro average of seven estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Inditex revenue increased 5.7 percent in the first
half to 7.7 billion euros. H&M reported monthly sales that beat
analysts’ estimates last week, sending shares to a record high.
The company will report third-quarter earnings on Sept. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
