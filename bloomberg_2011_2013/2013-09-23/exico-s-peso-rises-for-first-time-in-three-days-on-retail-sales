Mexico ’s peso snapped a two-day
losing streak as a report showing that retail sales rose more
than forecast in July eased concern that Latin America’s second-biggest economy is slowing.  The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 12.7936 per dollar
at 9:29 a.m. in Mexico City. Yields on benchmark peso bonds
maturing in 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.87 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Retail sales rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through
July, the national statistics agency said today, exceeding the
0.5 percent median growth estimate among 15 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Mexico cut its 2013 gross domestic product growth
estimate to 1.8 percent in August from 3.1 percent amid slowing
exports.  While the retail sales figures are from two months ago, the
market’s reaction is amplified because investors are more
closely scrutinizing economic data releases after the government
made “such a strong reduction” in the growth projection,  Ramon Cordova , a trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia,
Mexico, said by phone. “There was a lot of weight placed on the
fact that they cut their expectations for GDP growth for the
year,” he said.  Mexico is selling 10-year dollar bonds in international
markets to fund a buyback of shorter-term securities.  The government said in a regulatory filing in the U.S. that
it will use as much as 75 percent of the cash raised from the
sale to repurchase notes due from 2015 to 2020.  Mexico may issue the 10-year bonds to yield about 1.5
percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to a
person familiar with the transaction. The sale will be for at
least $500 million, according to the person, who asked not to be
identified because terms of the offering aren’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
