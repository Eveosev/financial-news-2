The pound climbed toward an eight-month high against the dollar before reports this week that
economists said will show gross domestic product,  house prices 
and  consumer confidence  all improved.  Sterling has appreciated at least 1 percent versus all 16
of its major counterparts in the past six months amid signs
Britain’s economy is gaining momentum. The pound has climbed for
the last three weeks against the U.S. currency as the  Federal
Reserve  maintained stimulus measures that have debased the
dollar. U.K. gilts rose before the government sells inflation-linked bonds through banks this week.  “Expectations for U.K. GDP are running high,” said  Neil Jones , head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in London.
“There is improving data ahead, and growing confidence in
the U.K. both domestically and overseas. I doubt this trade
is over.”  The pound advanced 0.2 percent to $1.6036 at 4:15 p.m.
London time after climbing to $1.6163 on Sept. 18, the highest
level since Jan. 11. The U.K. currency gained 0.4 percent to
84.13 pence per euro after appreciating to 83.53 pence on Sept.
18, the strongest since Jan. 17.  Sterling has risen 5.6 percent in the past six months, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 4
percent, while the dollar weakened 0.3 percent.  Economic Expansion  U.K. GDP  expanded  0.7 percent in the second quarter,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the
data from the  Office for National Statistics  on Sept. 26.
Industry reports the following day are forecast to show consumer
confidence and house prices climbed this month.  Homes approved for construction in the U.K. rose 49 percent
in the three months through June 30, the Home Builders
Federation said today. Approvals climbed to 37,000 from the same
period a year earlier, the Federation said.  Futures traders decreased bets the pound will weaken
against the dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the pound compared with
those on a gain -- so-called  net shorts  -- was 6,310 on Sept.
17, compared with 38,166 a week earlier.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.90 percent after climbing
to 3.05 percent on Sept. 11, the highest level since July 2011.
The 2.25 percent bond due in September 2023 rose 0.155, or 1.55
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.35.  Highest Yield  Investors are demanding the highest yield on 10-year gilts
relative to Treasuries in seven months as they accumulate bets
the  Bank of England  will start raising  interest rates  before the
Federal Reserve. U.K. bond yields rose last week after minutes
published Sept. 18 showed policy makers agreed that the economy
no longer needs more stimulus.  Treasury 10-year yields were at 2.70 percent today. U.S.
rates exceeded those on gilts as recently as Sept. 4 based on
closing prices.  The U.K. will sell inflation-linked securities due in March
2068 this week. The Debt Management Office has hired Barclays
Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Morgan Stanley to
manage the deal.  Prospects for the inflation-linked bonds “appear
positive,”  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in London, wrote last week in a note to clients.
“Expectations for an ongoing  bear market  in fixed income have
been rocked by the Fed’s latest dovish twist.”  U.K. gilts lost 4.5 percent this year through Sept. 20,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities
dropped 2.4 percent and Treasuries fell 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
