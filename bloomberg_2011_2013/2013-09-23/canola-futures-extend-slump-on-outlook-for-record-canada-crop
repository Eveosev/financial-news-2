Canola futures tumbled for the
third straight session, touching a six-week low, on signs that
farmers will harvest a record crop in  Canada , the world’s
largest grower.  Output may climb to 14.78 million metric tons, up from last
month’s forecast of 14.6 million tons and exceeding the record
production in 2011, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said in a
Sept. 18 report. Yields in parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta are
as high as 60 bushels an acre, FarmLink Marketing Solutions said
in a Sept. 19 crop  report .  “The canola weakness right now is the growing perception
of the crop size, ” David Reimann, a market analyst with
Cargill Limited’s grain-marketing-services division, said in a
telephone interview from Winnipeg. “We just continue to hear
average and above-average yields.”  Canola futures for November settlement fell 1.2 percent to
close at C$478.10 ($465.08) a ton at 1:27 p.m. on ICE Futures
Exchange in Winnipeg, after touching C$477.60, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 7. The oilseed has dropped 19
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
