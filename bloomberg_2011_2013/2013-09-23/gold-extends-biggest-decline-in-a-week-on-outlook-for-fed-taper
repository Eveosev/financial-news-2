Gold fell for the second straight
session after a Federal Reserve official said policy makers may
start reducing U.S. fiscal stimulus as early as next month.  The central bank’s decision last week to refrain from
paring its $85 billion in monthly bond buying was a
“borderline” call, and tapering may start in October, Fed Bank
of St. Louis President James Bullard said on Sept. 20. Gold
dropped 2.7 percent on that day, the most since July 5. Prices
surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to June 2011 as
the Fed bought debt and stoked inflation concerns.  “The wind was taken out of the market’s sails, and we’re
seeing some carry-through selling,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “There’s not a lot to support prices
now.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,327 an ounce at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
On Sept. 19, the price jumped 4.7 percent, the most since March
2009, after the Fed said that it wants to see more evidence of
an economic recovery before cutting stimulus.  Futures slumped 21 percent this year after a U.S. equity
rally to a record and low inflation eroded the appeal of gold as
an alternative investment. Holdings in exchange-traded products
backed by the metal have tumbled to the lowest in three years.  Gold may drop below $1,250 before the end of the year as
the U.S. economy gains and investors expect the Fed to start
reducing asset purchases, Citigroup Inc. said today in a report.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$21.857 an ounce on the Comex.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,425.90 an ounce. Trading
was 83 percent above the average in the past 100 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Palladium futures for December delivery dropped 0.6 percent
to $717.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
