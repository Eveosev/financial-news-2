Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the mining
company with operations from  Australia  to Brazil, expects output
at its biggest nickel project to remain curtailed until mid-2016
as it rebuilds two furnaces to fix design problems.  Anglo will produce between 20,000 and 25,000 metric tons of
nickel at its Barro Alto facility in Brazil this year and will
reach its nominal average output capacity of 36,000 tons by June
2016, head of nickel Walter De Simoni told reporters yesterday.
The company, which expected to achieve full production at the
project in late 2012, will fix one of the furnaces next year and
the second in 2015, he said.  “We didn’t reach the maximum production capacity because
we had some problems with the electric furnaces,” De Simoni
said at a mining conference in Belo Horizonte,  Brazil . “To
correct this, we need to reconstruct the furnace.”  Anglo, based in London, started production at the $1.9
billion Barro Alto project in Brazil’s Goias state in March
2011, seeking to gain market share in the industrial metal used
to prevent corrosion in stainless steel. Rio de Janeiro-based
Vale SA, the world’s second-largest nickel producer, also faced
furnace design problems at its Onca Puma project in northern
Brazil.  Each Barro Alto furnace will be shut for six to eight
months during the reconstruction, De Simoni said, adding that
the company is still assessing how much the work will cost.
Anglo is contacting possible suppliers, he said.  Anglo  fell  1.1 percent to 1,573.5 pence at the close in
 London  yesterday. The stock has dropped 17 percent this year.
Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange
fell 0.6 percent to $13,950 a ton yesterday, extending its
decline this year to 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
