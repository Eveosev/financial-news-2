Steel reinforcement-bar futures
gained in  Shanghai  after a manufacturing gauge rose to the
highest in six months in  China .  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange erased losses of as much as 0.6 percent and added 0.1
percent to 3,637 yuan ($594) a metric ton at 10:58 a.m. local
time. On Sept. 18, the last session before a two-day holiday,
rebar futures closed at 3,633 yuan, the lowest since July 30.  The preliminary reading of 51.2 for a Purchasing Managers’
Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compared with a median estimate of 50.9 from a Bloomberg News
survey. The gauge was 50.1 in August, the first above-50 reading
since April. A number above 50 indicates an expansion.  “The positive PMI touched off a rebound in rebar, boosting
an optimism in the market,” said Wu Zhili, an analyst at
Shenhua Futures Co. in Shenzhen.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port closed 0.1
percent higher at 131.80  yuan  on Sept. 19. The average spot
price of rebar traded at 3,528 yuan a ton on Sept. 18, dropping
for a 10th straight session, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
