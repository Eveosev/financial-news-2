The Philippine peso dropped the
most this month, after touching a three-month high earlier, as a
technical indicator signaled recent gains were excessive.  The currency rose 1.9 percent against the dollar last week,
the best performance in a year, as the  Federal Reserve  decided
not to taper stimulus that has fueled demand for emerging-market
assets. The dollar’s 14-day relative-strength index against the
peso reached 28 on Sept. 19 and 20, below the 30 level that some
investors see as an indication the greenback will rally.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 43.263 per dollar, the most
since Aug. 28, in  Manila , data from Tullett Prebon Plc show. It
touched 43.01 today, the strongest since June 18, and has gained
3.1 percent this month.  “A correction is warranted,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief
market strategist at  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO)  in Manila. “It’s now the
uncertainty on when the taper will happen.”  The  Philippines  is prepared for a possible reduction of the
Fed’s $85 billion a month of debt purchases, central bank Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said over the weekend.  “We can ride out any turbulence as we have policy tools in
our hand that we can deploy anytime,” Guinigundo said in a
briefing in Manila on Sept. 21. The measures include boosting
dollar and peso liquidity, careful surveillance of risk, use of
forward guidance, tapping currency-swap agreements and possible
tightening of monetary policy, he said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, slid 20 basis
points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 5.96 percent.  The yield on the 8 percent sovereign bonds due July 2031
climbed six basis points to 4.78 percent, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
