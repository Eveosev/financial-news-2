Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index retreating from the highest close since
February, as trading began after the morning session was
canceled due to a typhoon.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slipped 0.2 percent to 23,455.72 as of
1:08 p.m. in Hong Kong. The gauge posted its third weekly
advance last week after the  Federal Reserve  unexpectedly
refrained from cutting record stimulus. Hong Kong Exchanges &
Clearing Ltd. delayed the opening of the stock market today in
the wake of Typhoon Usagi, which killed at least 25 people in
China.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the H-share index, fell 0.1 percent. The H-share index entered a bull
market this month after rebounding more than 20 percent from a
June low, while the  Hang Seng Index  erased its 2013 loss.  Hong Kong’s equity benchmark traded at 11.3 times estimated
earnings on Sept. 20, compared with 15.5 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  A Chinese manufacturing index rose to a six-month high in
September. The preliminary reading of 51.2 for a Purchasing
Managers’ Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with a median estimate of 50.9 from 14
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The report showed
increases in output, new orders, export orders and prices, while
employment fell at a slower rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
