Russian stocks declined for a
second day as JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced the nation’s equities
to the equivalent of sell on declining crude prices.  The Micex slid 0.3 percent to 1,472.12 by 12:34 p.m. in
Moscow. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, dropped 1.2
percent to 260.03 rubles. Steelmaker OAO Severstal declined 1
percent to 296.70 rubles.  JPMorgan reduced its weighting of Russian equities to
underweight, citing a drop in the crude price as the risk of
U.S. military action in Syria fades. Oil has averaged $105.93 a
barrel in New York this quarter amid concern an attack may
distrupt supplies, helping the benchmark index of the world’s
biggest energy exporter gain 11 percent since June.  “We’ve seen the Micex gain a lot this quarter, we were
expecting a slight correction, but valuations remain
attractive,” Dmitri Kryukov, the chief investment officer at
Verno Capital, said by phone from Moscow. “Oil has been
declining for the past few days.”  Crude lost as much as 0.5 percent to $104.10 today.
Polymetal International Plc, a Russian gold and silver miner,
lost 2.5 percent to 339.57 rubles, a second day of declines.  OAO Moscow Exchange fell 2.9 percent to 61.20 rubles, the
most on the index. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. removed the stock
from its central and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa
focus list, according to a note today.  Moscow Exchange shareholders will vote at a Nov. 14
extraordinary meeting in Moscow on whether to approve the
buyback of a 4.2 percent stake, the bourse said in a statement
on Sept. 19 after the market close. The exchange plans to buy
the shares at 55 rubles apiece, allowing stockowners as of Sept.
25 to participate in the plan, it said. The company will buy the
shares from its unit, OOO  Micex (INDEXCF)  Finance, after which it will
cancel them, it said.  Volume, Valuations  OAO Alrosa, the world’s biggest diamond miner by output,
added 1.7 percent to 35.10 rubles, the biggest advancer. The
company may sell a 14 percent stake in October, two people with
direct knowledge of matter said on Sept. 17.  Average trading volume on the Micex was about 47 percent
below the 30-day average today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Ten-day price swings climbed to 15.864. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index dropped 0.8 percent to 1,451.94. The gauge closed 19.9
percent above this year’s low on June 24, 0.9 index point short
of a bull market, after the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly
decided against reducing monetary stimulus.  Even after last week’s 2.5 percent rally, Russian equities
have the cheapest  valuations  among 21 emerging economies tracked
by Bloomberg. The Micex Index’s 12-month estimated price-to-earnings ratio was at 4.3 today, compared with a multiple of
10.7 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian stocks in New York tumbled 1.5 percent on Sept. 23,
while the  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, dropped 1.6 percent. The ruble
weakened 0.2 percent to 31.9265 against the dollar today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
