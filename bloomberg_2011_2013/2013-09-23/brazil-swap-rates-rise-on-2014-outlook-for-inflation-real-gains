Brazil ’s swap rates climbed from a
one-month low after economists raised their forecasts for
inflation in 2014, spurring speculation that the central bank
will sustain the pace of increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2017 rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 11.11 percent at 10:03 a.m. in Sao
Paulo after falling on Sept. 20 to a one-month low of 11.10
percent. The real climbed 0.2 percent to 2.2054 per dollar today
after rallying 3.2 percent last week.  Economists in a weekly central bank survey increased their
median 2014 inflation forecast to 5.96 percent from 5.90
percent. The real has climbed 10 percent since Aug. 22, when the
central bank announced a $60 billion intervention program to
support the currency and rein in inflation. That is the best
performance among all of the world’s currencies. The real is
still down 7.2 percent this year.  “The expectation for inflation is worsening with the
impact of the weaker exchange rate,” Flavio Serrano, senior
economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimentos, said in a
phone interview from Sao Paulo. “The expectation is that the
increase in producer prices from 2013 could affect consumer
prices in 2014.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
