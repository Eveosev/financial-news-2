Sales of coffee by U.S. retailers
climbed 17 percent to $1.25 billion in the 13 weeks ended March
25 from a year earlier as prices rose and demand increased for
single-cup packets, market researcher SymphonyIRI Group said.  Prices per unit sold rose by 86 cents to $6.81 from a year
earlier, Chicago-based SymphonyIRI said in an e-mail. The data
exclude sales at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s largest
retailer, as well as club and convenience stores.  Ground coffee accounted for about 64 percent of the sales,
followed by single-cup servings with 17 percent, instant coffee
with 10 percent, and whole beans with 7.2 percent, the figures
show.  Total units sold gained 1.9 percent from a year earlier,
with single packets jumping 77 percent, the data show. Units of
ground non-decaffeinated coffee sales dropped 4 percent and
sales of whole beans declined 0.7 percent, SymphonyIRI said.  The U.S. is the world’s largest coffee consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
