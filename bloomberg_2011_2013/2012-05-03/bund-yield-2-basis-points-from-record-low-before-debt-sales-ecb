German 10-year bund yields were two
basis points from a record low as Spain and  France  prepared to
auction debt today before the  European Central Bank  announces
its interest-rate decision.  Spanish bonds held losses from yesterday before the
government sells as much as 2.5 billion euros ($3.29 billion) of
three-and five-year notes. France will auction up to 7.5 billion
euros of securities due between 2017 and 2025. The ECB will keep
its main refinancing rate at 1 percent, according to all 58
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A report today is forecast to
show euro-area producer-price inflation slowed in March.  “We expect the ECB to sound a bit more dovish then last
time as things have deteriorated since April, but we don’t
expect any rate action,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . “For now
the risks are ones which encourage people to put money into safe
havens, and Germany is the ultimate safe haven in  Europe .”  The German 10-year yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.62 percent at 9:22 a.m. London time,
after falling to a record 1.599 percent yesterday. The 1.75
percent bond due in July 2022 fell 0.105, or 1.05 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.205.  Yields on German two-, five-, 10- and 30-year securities
all dropped yesterday to the lowest since Bloomberg began
tracking the data amid speculation Europe’s economic slump is
deepening and exacerbating the region’s financial crisis.  Spanish Yields  Spain ’s  five-year  note yield were little changed at 4.77
percent.  French 10-year bond yields  increased one basis point to
2.98 percent.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  will hold a press conference at
2.30 p.m. in Barcelona to explain the central bank’s decision.
Policy makers kept the rate at 1 percent at their previous
monetary-policy meeting on April 4.  Producer prices in the 17-nation euro region rose 3.4
percent from a year earlier, after increasing 3.6 percent in
February, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey.  German bonds returned 1.6 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities lost 1.2
percent, and French debt gained 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
