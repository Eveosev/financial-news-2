JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  raised its
recommendation on the debt of oil and gas driller  Chesapeake
Energy Corp. (CHK)  to overweight from neutral.  “We upgrade the senior notes to buy from hold based on
cheap valuation,” because the company can overcome liquidity
concerns, analysts at the bank led by Gregg Brody wrote in a
research note dated May 2.  The cost to protect against losses on Chesapeake’s debt
yesterday jumped to the highest since September 2009 as the
second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer, which reported an
unexpected first-quarter loss, said it may run out of money next
year.  Chesapeake’s $1.3 billion of 6.775 percent senior unsecured
notes due March 2019 fell 3.25 cents yesterday to 95.75 cents on
the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
