Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  rose 0.6 percent to 59,285.68 at the close in Istanbul,
increasing for a second day and paring its loss on the week to
2.2 percent.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Dardanel Onentas Gida Sanayi AS (DARDL TI), a Turkish
producer of frozen and canned food, plunged the most since June
2008, dropping 13.7 percent to 1.26 liras after talks with ADM
Capital and Turkey’s Yildiz Holding AS for a sale of stake
ended. The company, which trades on the exchange’s “watchlist
market” for firms under heightened supervision, ended the talks
after failing to reach an agreement on its debt payments to

the market closed yesterday. It will continue to seek partners
and hold talks to restructure loan repayments.  Otokar Otomotiv & Savunma Sanayi AS (OTKAR)  , a Turkish
producer of buses and military trucks, fell 2.3 percent to 30.20
liras after first-quarter profit declined 31 percent. Net income
retreated to 6.33 million liras ($3.6 million) from 9.19 million
liras a year ago, the company said in a statement to the
exchange today.  Sekerbank TAS (SKBNK)  , a Turkish lender, rose the most
since Jan. 12, gaining 4.3 percent to 97 kurus after reporting
that first-quarter profit doubled to 60.7 million liras from a
year earlier, beating estimates.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL)  ,  Turkey ’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, surged 3.9 percent to 8.98 liras,
the biggest gain since Dec. 20, after profit in the first
quarter rose 56 percent, beating estimates. Net income increased
to 514.8 million liras from 330.1 million liras a year earlier,
the company said in a statement to the exchange after the close
