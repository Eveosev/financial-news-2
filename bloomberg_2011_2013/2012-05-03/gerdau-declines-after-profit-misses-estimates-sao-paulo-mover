Gerdau SA (GGBR4) ,  Latin America ’s largest
steelmaker, posted its biggest one-day decline in more than a
week after first-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  The company, based in  Porto Alegre ,  Brazil ,  dropped  2.5
percent to 17.37 reais in Sao Paulo, its biggest one-day drop
since April 23. The stock has risen 20 percent this year, more
than the 9.6 percent gain for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa  Index. (IBOV)   Net income fell 5.4 percent to 369.6 million reais ($192.2
million) from 390.8 million reais in the year-earlier period,
after heavy rains in Brazil hindered shipments and costs
increased more than sales, the company said yesterday in a
 statement . Gerdau was expected to post profit of 435.6 million
reais, excluding some items, according to the  average of nine 
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Brazilian steelmakers, including Gerdau, are struggling as
a global glut reduces their ability to boost prices. Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA, the second-largest Brazilian
steelmaker by output, said April 23 its first-quarter loss more
than doubled to 70.8 million reais.  Gerdau’s net sales in the quarter rose 10 percent to 9.2
billion reais, less than the 12 percent increase in the cost of
goods sold during the period. Shipments were little changed in
the quarter, while exports from Brazil dropped 21 percent as
rains hindered production, the company said.  “The higher cost of sales on a consolidated basis mainly
reflects higher costs in raw materials,” Gerdau said in the
statement, which was issued after the close of regular trading
in Brazil. “Greater costs were also influenced by the heavy
rains during the beginning of 2012.”  ‘Sizeable Improvement’  Crude-steel production rose 4 percent to 4.94 million
metric tons in the quarter, the company said. Profit margins
fell to 11 percent, compared with 13 percent in 2011, it said.  “We still expect Gerdau to deliver a sizeable improvement
in the upcoming quarters,” Felipe Reis and Alex Sciacio,
analysts at Banco Santander SA in  Sao Paulo , said in a note on
April 27. “We maintain our bullish call on Gerdau, as we expect
it to rebound from expected weak operating results.”  Gerdau, which plans to invest 10.3 billion reais between
2012 and 2016, said yesterday that it will spend 838 million
reais in expanding its Acominas unit’s iron-ore production
capacity 77 percent to 11.5 million metric tons by 2014 as a way
of reaching self-sufficiency in the steelmaking ingredient. The
company is also spending 192 million reais increasing its
Colombian steel operations, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
