Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker
Terrell Suggs will probably miss the National Football League
season after tearing his Achilles tendon,  NFL.com reports ,
citing an unnamed person familiar with the situation.  Suggs, who was voted the NFL’s Defensive Player of the Year
last season after recording 14 sacks, was injured while working
out and doing drills in  Arizona , NFL.com said.  Ravens spokesman Billy Jones said in a telephone interview
that he couldn’t confirm the severity of Suggs’s injury.  “We are in contact with Terrell,” the Ravens said in an
e-mailed statement. “He will see a specialist early next week,
and we’ll know more at that time.”  Suggs, 29, has spent his entire nine-year NFL career with
the Ravens. He had 70 tackles, seven forced fumbles and two
interceptions last season, when the Ravens went 12-4 and had the
NFL’s third-ranked defense in yards and points allowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
