Bill Winters , the former co-chief
executive officer of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment bank,
said banks misled municipal officials into buying derivatives
they didn’t understand.  Asked in an interview on PBS Frontline’s “Money, Power and
 Wall Street ” if he held banks responsible for leading less
sophisticated investors such as the Italian city of Cassino down
the wrong path, he concurred.  “Because of the opaqueness of derivatives, it was probably
easier to abuse in some cases,” said Winters, who left JPMorgan
in 2009. “It obviously doesn’t cover the profession in glory.”  Cassino, an Italian town that entered an interest rate swap
with Bear Stearns Cos. in 2003, was left with a 577,000-euro
($760,000) loss after reaching a settlement with JPMorgan, which
bought Bear Stearns in 2008, according to documents obtained by
Bloomberg News under a court ruling.  Winters didn’t return calls and e-mail seeking comment.
Officials at JPMorgan in Milan couldn’t immediately comment on
Winters’s remarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
