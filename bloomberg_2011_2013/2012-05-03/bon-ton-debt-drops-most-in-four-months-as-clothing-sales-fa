Bon-Ton Stores Inc. (BONT) ’s bonds dropped
the most in four months as the retailer reported that sales fell
last month.  Bon-Ton’s $464 million of 10.25 percent notes due in March
2014 fell 3.9 cents to 77.1 cents on the dollar to yield 26.6
percent as of 9:22 a.m. in New York, the biggest drop since Jan.
12, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The York, Pennsylvania-
based retailer said today in a statement that comparable store
sales fell 5 percent in the four weeks that ended April 28.  Bon-Ton, which has department stores in the U.S. Northeast
and Midwest, is seeking to lure new customers with trendier
apparel as it tries to make enough money to pay off or refinance
some of its debts before its 10.25 percent notes come due in
March 2014. In January, the chain appointed Brendan Hoffman, the
former head of Lord & Taylor LLC, as chief executive officer.  “April sales did not meet our expectations,” Hoffman said
in the statement. “Ready-to-wear in ladies’ and men’s did not
perform well.”  Total sales dropped 5.3 percent to $187.2 million for the
period, from $197.7 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. Bon-Ton also said today that it had $400 million of
excess borrowing capacity under its credit facility, down from
$438 million at the end of January, according to a March
conference call with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
