Titan Cement Co SA (TITK) ,  Greece ’s biggest
producer of the building material, posted a wider first quarter
loss as the country’s construction industry slowed and bad
weather conditions hit the Balkans, Turkey and Greece.  The net loss was 19.4 million euros ($25.5 million) in the
three months through March 31, compared with a 4.3 million-euro
loss in the same period a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Athens-based company  today .  “The severe and extended winter period this year across
the Balkans, Turkey and Greece significantly affected building
activity in these regions,” the company said.  Sales declined to 225.4 million euros from 252.9 million
euros. Revenue from the Greek market dropped 37 percent to 46
million euros.  Demand in Greece is expected to mark a “further
substantial decline” in 2012, Titan said. Public and private
building activity in Greece, now in its fifth year of recession,
fell 23 percent in the 12-month period through January 2012,
according to the Hellenic Statistical Authority. The figure is
measured by the number of permits issued.  The company said it sees sales in southeastern  Europe 
advancing this year and is “cautiously optimistic” about
demand in  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
