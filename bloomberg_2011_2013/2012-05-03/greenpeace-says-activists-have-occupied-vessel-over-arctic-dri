Greenpeace said six activists from
five countries have boarded the Shell-contracted icebreaker, the
Nordica, off the coast of  Sweden  and are occupying the vessel in
protest at Shell’s Arctic drilling campaign.  The vessel is bound for  Alaska  where it will join Shell’s
fleet to support risky oil drilling, according to an e-mailed
statement by the environmental group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
