The Eagle Ford shale formation will
put out 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day by the end of the
year,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  Chief Executive Officer Bill Klesse
said after the company’s annual meeting in  San Antonio .  Producers have told him output from the South Texas
formation may rise to 1 million barrels a day in the next few
years, Klesse said. Production in 2011 averaged 60,000 barrels a
day, according to data from the Texas Railroad Commission, which
regulates the energy industry in the state.  “It’s going to back out sweet crude imports into the
United States, and that’s going to happen by 2014,” Klesse
said.  The rising production is decreasing feedstock cost at
Valero refineries in Houston,  Corpus Christi  and Three Rivers.
The Houston refinery, which used to get all its crude oil from
west Africa, now runs almost entirely on cheaper domestic crude,
he said.  Klesse said he expects more oil from  Canada  and the U.S.
Midwest to be moved to the Gulf Coast in the coming years.  He said he believes President Barack Obama will approve the
northern leg of the Keystone pipeline project in early 2013 if
re-elected.  “My goodness, we slapped Canada in the face,” Klesse
said. “He’ll fix it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
