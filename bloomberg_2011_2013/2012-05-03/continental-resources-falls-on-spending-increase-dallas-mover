Continental Resources Inc. (CLR) , the
biggest petroleum leaseholder in North Dakota and Montana’s
Bakken Shale, dropped the most in more than eight months after
boosting  capital spending  by 31 percent to increase production.  Continental, based in Oklahoma City,  declined  9.3 percent
to $81.94 at the close in  New York , the biggest decline since
Aug. 18, 2011.  The company yesterday raised its 2012  capital budget  to
$2.3 billion excluding acquisitions, compared with a previous
forecast of $1.75 billion. Continental said its production
growth for the year is expected to be 47 percent to 50 percent,
surpassing an earlier estimate of 37 percent to 40 percent.  “People felt like this company would be able to really
increase their full-year production guidance range without
bringing the capex up,” said Brian Lively, an analyst at Tudor,
Pickering, Holt & Co. in Houston. “That was not our analysis,
but I think it was just a situation where expectations were
higher than what the company could possibly deliver.”  Lively, who spoke in a telephone interview today, has a
hold rating on Continental shares and doesn’t own any.  To contact the reporter on this story:
