California  Governor  Jerry Brown  said
he’ll propose “serious cuts” when he unveils a revised budget
in two weeks, after  tax revenue  trailed his projections by $3.1
billion.  The 74-year-old Democrat was already facing a $9.2 billion
deficit before the shortfall made it worse. Income-tax revenue
in April alone fell short of his budget estimate by $2 billion.  The governor of the most populous U.S. state is seeking a
voter initiative to temporarily raise income taxes and sales
levies to help prevent further cuts. California has fought
deficits every year since 2007 as the longest recession since
the Depression reduced tax collections.  “On May 14, I’m going to present a balanced budget
proposal with very serious cuts,” Brown said in an interview in
 Los Angeles  yesterday. He declined to specify areas that may
bear the biggest reductions, saying much depends on the fate of
his November ballot initiative.  “This is a budget proposal that will work,” Brown said.
“It will balance the budget and it will contain more cuts than
taxes.”  Brown spoke at an event promoting the California Pet
Lover’s License Plate, which helps finance low-cost spay and
neuter programs.  “Unlike some politicians who can’t chew gum and jump rope,
I can do multiple tasking,” he said when asked how he could
take time away from more pressing matters like solving the state
deficit. “More people care about dogs and cats than they do
about the folks in  Sacramento . We’re doing stuff.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
