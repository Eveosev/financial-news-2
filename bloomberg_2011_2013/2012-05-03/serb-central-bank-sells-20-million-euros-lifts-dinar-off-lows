Serbia ’s central bank sold 20 million
euros ($26.3 million) today to bolster the weakening dinar,
after the local currency fell to its lowest in a decade three
days before presidential and parliamentary elections.  The Narodna Banka Srbije acted to “ensure the smooth
functioning” of the market, the Belgrade-based bank said in a
statement on its website. The dinar was trading at 111.66 to the
euro at 4 p.m. in Belgrade after declining to 112.22 at 10:05
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dinar’s weakness is temporary and the currency should
strengthen if the government that emerges from May 6 elections
convinces the International Monetary Fund it’s serious about
fiscal tightening, the newspaper Novosti cited central bank
Governor Dejan Soskic as saying today.  The central bank has spent 728.5 million euros this year so
far to curb the dinar declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
