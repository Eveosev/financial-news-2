Miami Heat  forward  Chris Bosh  is
trying to make it back to New York in time for tonight’s
National Basketball Association playoff game against the Knicks
after flying home yesterday to be with his expectant wife.  Bosh’s wife, Adrienne, gave birth to a son at 3 a.m. today
and the seven-time All-Star aims to make it back before the
start of tonight’s 7 p.m. game, team spokesman Tim Donovan said
at the team’s practice at Madison Square Garden.  “He’s a big part of what we do,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Having his presence would help even if he
wasn’t 100 percent.”  Heat guard  Dwyane Wade  said he expected Bosh to be back for
Game 3 of the best-of-seven series, which Miami leads 2-0. Wade
said other players, including Heat forward Mike Miller, played
in games shortly after their wives had children.  “Most of them play pretty well,” Wade said at practice.
“They play with a light heart and a smile on their face.”  Bosh, 28, is averaging 15 points and five rebounds in the
playoffs, third on the team in both categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
