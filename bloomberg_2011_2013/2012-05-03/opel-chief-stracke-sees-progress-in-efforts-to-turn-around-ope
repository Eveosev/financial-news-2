General Motors Co. (GM)  is making progress
with efforts to return the European business to profitability.  “Although I am absolutely dissatisfied with the business
figures, I see a lot of signs for progress,” Karl-Friedrich Stracke, head of the Opel unit, said in a letter to staff today
on the company’s earnings.  The European business, which mainly comprises the Opel and
Vauxhall brands, posted an adjusted operating loss of $256
million in the first quarter. Stracke said a difficult business
environment with lower sales, especially in January and
February, was the reason for the loss. The market situation
improved in March, he said.  Opel exceeded its own internal plans for reducing material
costs in the first quarter, Stracke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
