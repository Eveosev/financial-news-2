Soil-water reserves in France, the
European Union’s largest wheat producer, climbed across the
country in April as more rain fell than usual, the  Agriculture
Ministry  reported.  Rainfall was 65 percent above the long-term average last
month, while temperatures of 11 degrees Celsius (51.8 degrees
Fahrenheit) on average were close to normal levels for the
month, the ministry wrote in a  report  on its website today.  France received 7 percent more rain than usual since March
1 on average, according to the ministry, after a deficit from
the start of September through March. Soil-water reserves stayed
below normal across much of the country, the report showed.  “After a start of the year marked by weak rains, all the
territory benefited from precipitation that was particularly
welcome in the west and southwest regions,” the ministry wrote.  Average April rainfall was 101 millimeters (4 inches) for
 France , according to the report. Rainfall in the center-east
region was 50 percent above normal, the north got 69 percent
more than usual and the northeast received 16 percent more than
in an average year, the ministry reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
