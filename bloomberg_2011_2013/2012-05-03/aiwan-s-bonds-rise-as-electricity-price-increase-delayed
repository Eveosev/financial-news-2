Taiwan ’s government bonds rose,
pushing benchmark  five-year  yields to the lowest level since
March, after the government postponed an electricity-price
increase. The local dollar weakened.  Electricity prices will climb from June 10, later than the
originally scheduled May 15, and changes will be phased in over
a period of more than six months, according to a statement
posted by the island’s presidential office on May 1. Official
data will show on May 7 Taiwan’s consumer prices rose 1.3
percent in April from a year earlier, after a 1.21 percent
increase the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “It looks like inflation pressure has eased a bit,” said
 Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay United
Bank Co. “That’s why we’re seeing falls in short-term yields.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.98
percent, the lowest level since March 14, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.1 percent to NT$29.27 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
touched NT$29.08 yesterday, the strongest level since Sept. 8.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings traders use to price options, rose 15 basis points to
4.15 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.505 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.509 percent
yesterday, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
