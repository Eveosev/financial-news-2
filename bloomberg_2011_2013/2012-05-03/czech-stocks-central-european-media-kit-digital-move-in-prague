The Czech  PX (PX)  stock index dropped for a
second day, sliding 0.9 percent to 924.9 at the close in  Prague .  The following were among the most active equities in the
Prague market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   jumped
5.7 percent to 163.8 koruna, its highest in more than two
months. Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday it may upgrade
the broadcaster’s B3 corporate family rating after a planned
debt reduction announced earlier this week.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the biggest Czech power utility, retreated
1.5 percent to 738.9 koruna, its lowest in almost five months.

part of its output, fell yesterday to 50 euros per megawatt-
hour, its lowest close since November 2010. The futures contract
was unchanged today.  Kit Digital Inc. (KITD)   retreated 23 percent to 95.70
koruna, the lowest price since cross-listing its New York-traded
shares in Prague in January 2010. The online video software

trailing the $72.4 million mean estimate of analysts polled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
