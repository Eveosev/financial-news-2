First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, headed for its
biggest gain in two weeks after reporting that first-quarter
profit doubled.  The stock rose 5 percent, the maximum daily limit and the
most since April 19 on a closing basis, to 10.99 naira as of
11:10 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  Profit for the three months through March soared to 24.5
billion naira ($156 million) from 12.2 billion naira a year
earlier, the bank said yesterday in a statement on the website
of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Revenue advanced 42 percent to
92.3 billion naira.  “I see growth, I see opportunities in the stock,” Eugene
Ezenwa, chief operating officer for Lagos-based PAC Securities
Ltd., said by phone today. “If the bank maintains the current
run rate, I expect its price to hit 20 naira by year end,” he
said.  First Bank shares have climbed 23 percent this year,
compared with a 9.4 percent increase in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
