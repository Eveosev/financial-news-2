France ’s 10-year bonds advanced after
borrowing costs fell at an auction of 7.43 billion euros ($9.76
billion) of debt, the last sale of  government securities  before
the nation chooses its next president.  German  government bonds  snapped a two-day advance as
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  indicated policy
makers didn’t discuss an interest-rate cut at their policy
meeting this week. Spain’s five-year notes climbed after it
auctioned 2.52 billion euros of securities, exceeding the
maximum target, and stayed higher after the nation’s credit
rating was lowered by DBRS.  “The French auction results were very solid,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “The French elections appear to have
had no effect.”  France’s  10-year bond  yields dropped six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 2.91 percent at 4:40 p.m.  London  time.
The 3 percent security due April 2022 rose 0.47, or 4.70 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.75.  Investors bought French benchmark bonds at an average yield
of 2.96 percent at today’s auction, compared with 2.98 percent
on April 5, debt-agency data showed. The nation also sold
securities due in 2017,2021 and 2025.  French voters go to the polls on May 6 in the second round
of elections that pit President Nicolas Sarkozy against
Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande .  Spanish Auction  Spain auctioned notes maturing in 2015 and 2017. Its five-
year note yield fell seven basis points to 4.70 percent.  Yields on Euribor futures rose as traders cut bets that the
ECB will lower borrowing costs after Draghi told a press
conference in Barcelona today that the central bank didn’t talk
about cutting rates. The implied yield on the contract expiring
in June 2013 rose one basis point to 0.605 percent.  “The fact that they didn’t talk about cutting  interest
rates  is a little bit disappointing for those that had been
hoping for that,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income
strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “The fact that
bunds haven’t sold off that much shows that some people in the
market think the ECB will eventually have to do something.”  German two-year note yields climbed one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 0.09 percent.  Ten-year  bund  yields were little changed at 1.61 percent.
They slid to a record 1.599 percent yesterday, when two-, five-
and 30-year securities also dropped to the lowest since
Bloomberg began tracking the data.  The ECB left its main rate at 1 percent, as predicted by
all 58 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Draghi “has not given a signal of lower rates,
particularly by admitting that a rate cut was not discussed at
all today,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at
WestLB AG in London. “Markets are on balance a bit disappointed
so far.”  German bonds returned 1.6 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities lost 1.2
percent, and French debt gained 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
