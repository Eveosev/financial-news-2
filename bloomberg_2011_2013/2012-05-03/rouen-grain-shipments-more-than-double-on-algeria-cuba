Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, more than doubled,
boosted by wheat destined for Algeria and Cuba.  Export cargoes climbed to 102,935 metric tons between April
26 and May 2 from 37,585 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River
port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. That included 88,834
tons of soft wheat, compared with 16,145 tons the previous week.  Algeria was the biggest destination, taking 51,650 tons of
soft wheat, followed by Cuba with 25,754 tons of wheat, the
first cargo to the island nation in four weeks.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port data.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
