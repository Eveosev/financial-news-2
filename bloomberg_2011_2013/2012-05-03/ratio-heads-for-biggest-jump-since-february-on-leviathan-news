Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP (RATIL)  headed
for the biggest jump in more than two months after  Noble Energy
Inc. (NBL)  said it sees “potential for significant oil resources” at
the Leviathan site.  The shares were up 6.8 percent, set for their steepest gain
since Feb. 29, and traded at 0.331 shekel as of 3:26 p.m. in Tel
Aviv.  Noble said yesterday it suspended drilling at Leviathan due
to high well pressure and mechanical limitations of the drilling
equipment and plans to secure a different rig to continue work
at the site.  “It seems likely that they will drill again, perhaps with
higher probability for oil and this is taken in the market as
better than a situation of a dry well,” Dan Harverd, an equity
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in  Tel Aviv , said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
