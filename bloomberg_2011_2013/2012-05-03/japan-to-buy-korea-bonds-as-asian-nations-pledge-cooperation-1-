China , Japan and  South Korea  agreed to
encourage investment in each others’ bonds, according to a joint
statement released by the Bank of Korea.  The nations aim to “further strengthen our cooperation”
amid risks and uncertainties for the global economy, the trio
said after a meeting of central bank governors and finance
ministers in Manila today.  Japan will start buying South Korean bonds as part of
efforts to diversify the larger economy’s foreign-exchange
reserves, Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  told reporters in
Manila. Purchases will start with a small amount, he said.  “Today’s statement from the three countries shows the
governments’ will to enhance the status of Asian currencies by
encouraging investment within the region,” said Choi Seok Won,
head of research at  Hanwha Securities Co. (003530)  in Seoul. “It would
have the effect of reducing volatility” from “money coming in
and out from other regions.”  Japan, China, South Korea and 10 Southeast Asian nations
are finishing a plan to boost the so-called Chiang Mai
Initiative Multilateralization agreement to $240 billion. The
expansion of the foreign-currency pool will make it “more
effective as a liquidity safety net,” according to Philippine
central bank Governor Amando Tetangco.  To contact the reporters on this story:
