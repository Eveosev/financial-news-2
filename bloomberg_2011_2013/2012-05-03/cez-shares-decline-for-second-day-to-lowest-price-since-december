CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility in
the Czech Republic, fell for a second day to its lowest price in
almost five months.  The stock retreated 0.9 percent to 743 koruna by 12:36 p.m.
in Prague, extending this year’s loss to 5.5 percent. A close at
that level would be CEZ’s weakest since Dec. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
