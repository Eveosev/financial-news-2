  Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) , the maker of namesake
nutritional and weight loss supplements, posted a record three-
day decline in  New York  trading after hedge-fund manager David Einhorn questioned the company’s disclosures.  The shares fell 12 percent to $46.20 at the close in New
York. That’s 34 percent below Herbalife’s closing price on April
30, marking the biggest three-day drop since the shares began
trading in December 2004.  Einhorn, chairman of  Greenlight Capital Re Ltd. (GLRE) , asked
executives on a May 1 conference call why Herbalife had stopped
disclosing a breakdown of three groups of distributors in
filings that it had previously provided. The questions sent the
shares down 20 percent that day.  Einhorn also asked for an explanation of financial
incentives given to supervisors who sign up new distributors.
The independent contractors earn revenue by selling products
directly to customers and recruiting new distributors, for which
they earn a share of those sales and incentives from the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
