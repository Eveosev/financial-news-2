J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  hired  MEMC Electronic
Materials Inc. (WFR) ’s Ken Hannah as chief financial officer as Chief
Executive Officer  Ron Johnson  replaces top managers at the
fourth-biggest U.S. department store chain.  Hannah, 43, was most recently president of solar energy at
MEMC and previously served as the company’s CFO, Plano, Texas-
based J.C. Penney said in a statement today. Hannah was also
senior vice president of finance at  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the company
said. Former CFO Michael Dastugue left last month after more
than 20 years at J.C. Penney.  Johnson, who took over in November after leading Apple
Inc.’s retail business, has installed new management at J.C.
Penney as he works to remake the retailer. Thomas Engibous
became the company’s new chairman on Jan. 28 and Johnson has
refreshed almost all executive roles, mostly with former Apple
employees.  “Ken brings a broad knowledge of finance, controls and
operations to the CFO role,” Johnson said in today’s statement.
“His experience with top companies known for financial and
operational excellence will be instrumental in helping J.C.
Penney as we transition to become America’s favorite store.”  Hannah stepped down as CFO of MEMC, the second-largest U.S.
polysilicon maker, in November 2009, according to MEMC’s most
recent annual filing. He had joined the company from Home Depot,
where he was senior vice president of operations covering the
U.S., Mexico and Canada. Before that, he was senior vice
president of finance at the home improvement retailer.  J.C. Penney fell 0.6 percent to $35.07 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
