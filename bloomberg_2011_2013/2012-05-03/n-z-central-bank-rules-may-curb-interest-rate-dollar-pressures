New Zealand ’s central bank will use
new banking rules to help contain  interest rate  and currency
pressures, the Deputy Governor said today.  The so-called macro-prudential policy “will have an
important influence on monetary policy, in a similar way to
fiscal policy,” Grant Spencer said in e-mailed notes of a
 speech  in Auckland today.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand wants to strengthen the
nation’s financial system after learning prudential lessons from
the global financial crisis, Spencer said. As well as tightening
liquidity requirements, the new rules seek to combat credit
booms and protect the economy from  bank failures .  “Such policies will also tend to have the effect of either
dampening the credit cycle or dampening international capital
flows and hence exchange rate pressures,” Spencer said.  The central bank is to increase the core funding ratio,
which determines how much of lending must be funded by retail
deposits and long-term borrowing, to 75 percent from Jan. 1,
2013, Spencer said. It originally planned to raise the ratio
from 70 percent in June, deferring the increase last year
because of global turmoil.  The macro-prudential rules, which use balance sheet ratios
and other regulatory requirements to influence bank lending,
will complement the central bank’s use of interest rates to
control inflation, he said. They will never be as influential as
monetary policy, he said.  The bank is developing an outline of the rules to be agreed
by Finance Minister  Bill English  as a basis for future policy
decisions, according to Spencer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
