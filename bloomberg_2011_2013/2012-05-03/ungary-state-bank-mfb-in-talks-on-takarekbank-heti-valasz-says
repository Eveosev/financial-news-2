Hungary ’s state-owned development bank
MFB Zrt. is in talks with DZ Bank AG of  Germany  about buying
DZ’s stake in Hungary’s Takarekbank,  Heti Valasz  reported,
citing MFB’s chief executive officer Laszlo Baranyay.  The talks may yield a result “in the near future,”
Baranyay told the Budapest-based weekly newspaper in an
interview.  MFB also held talks with Hungarian lenders Granit Bank and
Szechenyi Bank, which are now negotiating directly with the
state and won’t merge with MFB, Baranyay said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
