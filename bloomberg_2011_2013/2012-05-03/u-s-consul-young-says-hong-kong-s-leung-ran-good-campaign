Stephen M. Young, U.S. consul general
for  Hong Kong , comments on the city’s chief executive election
and U.S. relationship with China at a press conference today.  Leung Chun-ying, a former government adviser, was picked in
March to head the city by a 1,193-member panel of Hong Kong
billionaires, academics and professionals, over two other
candidates.  On the election:  “He ran a pretty good campaign. It left one with a
strongest feeling that this was an important building block to
prepare for full universal election.”  The “long-standing U.S. policy has supported the express
desire of the people of Hong Kong to participate in free
elections by universal suffrage at the earliest possible date.”  On closer cooperation with  China :  “The  United States  seeks more opportunities for
cooperation with Beijing, including greater communication
between our militaries to promote understanding and avoid
miscalculation.  “We will attempt to do this, even as we continue to speak
candidly to Beijing about the importance of upholding
international norms, meeting international commitments, and
respecting universal human rights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
