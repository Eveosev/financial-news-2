LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the biggest
professional-networking website, closed at the highest price
since its market debut, after reporting first-quarter sales and
profit that beat analysts’ estimates amid a jump in membership.  LinkedIn advanced 7.2 percent to $117.30 at the close in
New York, the highest level since it listed on the New York
Stock Exchange in May, 2011. The shares have more than doubled
since then.  LinkedIn said membership increased to 161 million from 150
million in the fourth quarter. Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Weiner  is pushing mobile technology to woo more professionals to
its subscription services and attract advertisers who want to
reach the growing user base.  “Since they’ve been public, they’ve outperformed,” said
Kerry Rice, an analyst with Needham & Co. in  New York .  Sales more than doubled to $188.5 million, topping the
$178.4 million average estimate of analysts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income rose to $5 million, or 4 cents
a share, from $2.08 million, or 0 cents, a year earlier, the
company said yesterday in a statement. Analysts projected break-
even earnings. The company also agreed to buy SlideShare Inc., a
professional content-sharing site, for about $118.8 million.  Profit excluding some items increased to 15 cents a share
from 6 cents a year earlier, beating the average analyst
estimate of 9 cents. Sales this year will be $880 million to
$900 million, the  Mountain View , California-based company said.
That’s more than the $876.7 million predicted by  analysts  and
raised from an earlier company forecast of $840 million to $860
million.  Higher Costs  Revenue in the second quarter will be $210 million to $215
million, compared with the $208.4 million estimated by analysts.
Mobile is the company’s fastest-growing service, Weiner said
yesterday on a conference call following results.  Even as profit rose, costs soared 92 percent to $177.8
million. Sales and marketing was the largest expense at $65.9
million, followed by product development at $47.1 million.
LinkedIn added 331 employees in the first quarter, Weiner said.  The company will pay for SlideShare, which was founded in
October 2006 and had almost 29 million unique visitors in March,
with about 45 percent cash and 55 percent stock, LinkedIn said
in a statement. LinkedIn has made at least  five  acquisitions in
the past two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “SlideShare is used by professionals primarily to share
presentations, which fits nicely with LinkedIn’s professional
focus,” said Rice, who recommends investors hold LinkedIn
shares. “It’s a popular app on LinkedIn already.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
