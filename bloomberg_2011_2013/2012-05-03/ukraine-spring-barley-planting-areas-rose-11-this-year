Ukraine’s spring barley areas rose 11
percent year-on-year after farmers completed planting,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  Farmers planted 2.81 million hectares (6.9 million acres)
of barley for the 2012 harvest, Prysyazhnyuk said in an e-mailed
statement today. This compares with 2.53 million hectares sowed
last year, statistics data shows.  Ukraine’s early spring grain areas rose by 200,000 hectares
to 3.6 million hectares, he said.  Corn, a late spring grain, has so far been planted on 2
million hectares, or 44 percent of what the government plans,
Prysyazhnyuk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
