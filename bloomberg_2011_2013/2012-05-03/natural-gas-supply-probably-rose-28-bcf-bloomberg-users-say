The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 1.1 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 28 billion cubic feet in the week ended April
27 to 2.576 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for June delivery rose 6.8 cents, or 3 percent,
to $2.321 per million British thermal units on the  New York
