Finland  is facing a period of slowing
growth as exporters struggle to keep up with global competition,
the Federation of Finnish Technology Industries said.  It’s “alarming” that Finland is moving into a trade
deficit and shows how the competitiveness of exporters is being
eroded in the long term, the Helsinki-based  industry group  said
in a report today.  New orders in the Finnish technology industry fell 7
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the
organization said. Its members generate more than a half of
Finnish  sales abroad . Biggest order losses occurred in the
electronics industry, where new orders fell an annual 29
percent.  “This is the final moment to turn the ship around,” the
organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
