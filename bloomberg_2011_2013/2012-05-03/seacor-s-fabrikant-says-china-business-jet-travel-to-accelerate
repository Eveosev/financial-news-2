Charles Fabrikant, chairman of  Seacor
Holdings Inc. (CKH) , comments on the business-aviation market in China
and the global offshore sector. Seacor, based in  Fort Lauderdale ,
Florida, operates helicopters and offshore support vessels, as
well as investing in business-aviation service providers.
Fabrikant spoke in an interview in Hong Kong today.  On China’s business-aviation market:  “It’s growing now, and I think the growth will accelerate.
Apart from using aircraft now for external use, the efficiency
of using it internally in China will grow.  “Eventually, some of the scheduled services to smaller
cities will be reduced, if they’re not cost efficient. Those who
want to oversee production, quality assurance or do transactions
there will then find it more beneficial to fly privately.  “China has something that is distinct -- it has a lot of
people, it is still a maturing economy, you would expect any
excess investment, whether on aviation or real estate, to get
absorbed.  On offshore services:  “You see opportunities in  East Africa  which are relatively
new -- you’ve got more drilling over there. Everyone knows
Brazil is an extremely active area. I actually think that the
 Gulf of Mexico , which was a dead area because of the moratorium,
is going to experience more activities again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
