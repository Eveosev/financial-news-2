U.K. The Serious Organised Crime
Agency’s website was disrupted yesterday after it was targeted
by computer hackers.  The crime agency temporarily took the website out of
 service  after it was hit by a so-called distributed denial of
service attack last night, said Stuart Hadley, a SOCA spokesman.
The agency’s website was also attacked last year by hackers
linked to the groups LulzSec and Anonymous.  A DDOS attack occurs when a website is visited by a large
number of visits causing the web address to go off line. SOCA’s
website remains out of service today.  “The action was taken to limit the impact of a DDOS attack
on other clients hosted by our service provider,” the agency
said in an e-mailed statement today. “SOCA’s website contains
only publicly available information and does not provide access
to operational material.”  A British man was arrested in June for attacking websites
including SOCA’s and charged with committing unauthorized acts
with a computer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
