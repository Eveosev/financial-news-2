East African Breweries Ltd. (EABL) , the
region’s biggest brewer by sales, gained the most in more than
six weeks after announcing a new chief executive officer.  The stock of EABL, as the company is known, rose 3.4
percent, the most since March 21, to 216 shillings by the close
in Nairobi.  “It is a short term excitement because normally when a new
person comes there is new energy and new strategy,” George
Bodo, head of research at Nairobi-based Old Mutual Securities,
said in a phone interview today.  Seni Adetu will step down as CEO of EABL, the Kenyan unit
of  Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s biggest distiller as of July 1, the
company said April 28. He will move into the same position at
Diageo’s Nigerian unit, Guinness Nigeria Plc, with the managing
director at that business, Devlin Hainsworth, replacing him at
EABL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
