Global funds pulled money from  South
Korea ’s local-currency bonds and stocks in April, the first time
they cut holdings of both securities since November, according
to data from the financial regulator.  The value of won-denominated debt owned by overseas
investors fell by 1 trillion won ($884 million) to 87.6 trillion
won from the previous month, and accounted for 7.1 percent of
outstanding notes, the  Financial Supervisory Service  said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Funds based in  Thailand  were the biggest sellers, with
ownership falling 854.2 billion won, followed by the Netherlands
and the U.K., FSS data showed. French investors were the top
buyers ahead of Kazakhstan and  Norway , adding 380.5 billion won,
according to the regulator. South Korea’s three-year government
bond yields fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to
3.45 percent last month, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  Overseas investors sold 595.7 billion won more of the
nation’s equities than they bought last month, led by the U.K.,
the U.S. and Luxembourg. Foreign funds offloaded South Korean
shares in April to profit from the stock rally this year and as
the European debt crisis re-ignited, according to the financial
watchdog.  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index fell 1.6 percent in April, the biggest
monthly loss since November. It closed at 1,999.07 yesterday, a
gain of 9.5 percent in 2012. The won traded 0.3 percent lower at
1,130.63 per dollar as of 11:37 a.m. in  Seoul , and has climbed
1.9 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
