Giulio Andreotti, who played a
dominant role in postwar Italian politics serving seven times as
prime minister, was hospitalized in serious condition in  Rome .  Andreotti, 93, was admitted today to the Gemelli hospital
with cardiac complications after suffering a respiratory
infection, the hospital said in an e-mailed statement.  Andreotti was a key figure in the  Christian Democrats , the
party that played a role in every post-World War II government
in  Italy  until dissolving in July 1993 in the wake of a
political corruption scandal. Apart from seven terms as premier,
Andreotti served as defense, foreign, finance and interior
ministers in various governments and remains a Senator for Life,
an honorary title that allows him to vote in Parliament.  A devout Catholic with close ties to the Vatican,
Andreottiâ€™s legacy of public service was marred by allegations
of ties to the Mafia and a conviction for murder. He was
indicted for colluding with the Sicilian Mafia in exchange for
votes. An appeals court in 2003 eventually acquitted him, saying
his ties had lasted only until 1980 and the statute of
limitations had kicked in. That same year an appeals court
overturned his conviction and a 24-year jail sentence for
playing a role in the murder of an Italian journalist.  Andreotti was born in Rome on Jan. 14, 1919 as the youngest
of three children. He was instrumental in shaping foreign
policy, leading Italy into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the  United Nations  and making the country one
of the founding members of the European Union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
