European Union governments may
increase the capital of the EU’s in-house investment bank amid
calls from southern Europe and the campaign trail in France for
more pro-growth policies.  A proposal to put an additional 10 billion euros ($13
billion) into the  European Investment Bank  could unleash 60
billion euros in loans to co-finance projects worth as much as
180 billion euros, EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  said.  “It’s a gigantic multiplier,”  Van Rompuy  said at the
bloc’s Committee of the Regions in Brussels today. “I’m happy
that no small number of governments have already said that they
favor such an operation.”  Lending by the EU-owned EIB took on a central role in the
growth-boosting efforts demanded by the frontrunner in France’s
presidential campaign, Francois Hollande, in his debate against
incumbent  Nicolas Sarkozy  yesterday.  A now-dormant fund used in the early stages of the debt
crisis has about 10 billion euros left, potentially providing
the capital to transfer to the Luxembourg-based investment bank.  The bank signed loan agreements worth 61 billion euros in
2011. The capital increase, on the agenda for a June 28-29
summit, would require approval of all 27 EU leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
