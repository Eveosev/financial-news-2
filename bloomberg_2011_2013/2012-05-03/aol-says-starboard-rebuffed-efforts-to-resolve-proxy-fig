AOL Inc. (AOL) , facing a fight with investor
Starboard Value LP over board seats, said it tried to resolve
the dispute as recently as April 25 but was rebuffed.  To avoid a “costly and damaging proxy fight,” AOL reached
out to Starboard Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey C. Smith,
aiming to put out a joint statement about the company’s business
plan and strategy, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong said today in a letter
to shareholders. “However, Starboard declined the offer and to
date, the parties have not been able to reach an amicable
resolution.”  Starboard has asked AOL to return more cash to shareholders
and is putting forth its own candidates for the company’s board.
The investment firm first announced a plan to nominate directors
in February.  AOL, which once got most of its revenue from dial-up
Internet subscriptions, has struggled to transform itself into
an advertising-based Web publisher. The New York-based company
has seen its revenue and share price slump since it was spun off
from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
