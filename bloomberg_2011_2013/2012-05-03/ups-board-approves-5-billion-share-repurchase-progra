United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the
world’s biggest package-delivery company, approved a $5 billion
share buyback program and boosted the amount of cash it plans to
use to buy  TNT Express NV. (TNTE)   The share repurchase plan has no expiration date and
replaces one announced in 2008, Atlanta-based UPS said in a
statement today. The company announced the authorization after
its annual meeting.  UPS, which announced in March that it will buy TNT Express
for $6.8 billion to expand in  Europe , said it plans to finance
the purchase with about $5 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in
debt. That’s a $2 billion-increase in the cash portion compared
with the company’s original guidance.  “UPS’s legacy of financial strength allows us to complete
the acquisition of TNT primarily using cash,” Chief Executive
Officer Scott Davis said in the statement. “At the same time,
UPS remains committed to its policy of shareowner returns
through dividends and share repurchases.”  UPS also said it plans to buy back $1.5 billion of stock
this year and next. In January, the company forecast it would
spend $2.7 billion on share repurchases this year, the same as
what it spent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
