California-blend gasoline in San
Francisco rose to the highest level in almost 32 months on
speculation that work at  Phillips 66 (PSX-W) ,  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  refineries will cut supplies in the market.  California-blend gasoline inventories  tumbled last week to
the lowest level since Aug. 28, 2009, a state Energy Commission
e-mailed report yesterday showed. Stocks dropped, 485,000
barrels, or 9.8 percent, to 4.46 million barrels, the agency’s
report showed.  Tesoro shut the hydrocracker at the Golden Eagle refinery
until around May 21 for work, a person with knowledge of the
schedule said earlier this week. Phillips 66 is also performing
a turnaround on a hydrocracker at the Rodeo plant, two people
said April 26. Shell shut a catalytic cracker at the Martinez
refinery April 21 for a month, a regulatory notice shows.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in  San Francisco 
advanced 9.5 cents to a premium of 51 cents a gallon against
gasoline futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at
1:40 p.m. East  Coast time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since Sept. 9, 2009.  Los Angeles Carbob rose 5 cents to a 41-cent-a-gallon
premium to gasoline futures, the highest since Feb. 24.  Phillips 66 was scheduled to flare gases through today at
the 139,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles refinery, which is
performing planned maintenance.   Supplies of California-blend, or CARB, diesel slipped 5,000
barrels, or 0.2 percent, to 2.25 million barrels, according to
the state report.  Diesel Spreads  California-blend diesel in San Francisco dropped 2.5 cents
to a premium of 18.5 cents a gallon versus Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in  Los Angeles  fell 1.75 cents to a 9.75-
cent-a-gallon premium to futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , a
benchmark for the U.S. Northwest, strengthened 10.5 cents to 33
cents a gallon above gasoline futures.  Gasoline inventories  on the U.S. West Coast, known as the
PADD 5 region, dropped 3.6 percent to 28.3 million barrels last
week, the Energy Department said in a report yesterday. That’s
the lowest level since Dec. 23.  Low-sulfur diesel  in Portland  fell 1 cent to a 25-cent
premium to heating oil futures. Distillate fuel supplies on the
West Coast fell 3.2 percent to 11.6 million barrels last week,
the Energy Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
