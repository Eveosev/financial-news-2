Mortgage rates  for 30-year fixed U.S.
loans fell to a record low, reducing borrowing costs as concerns
about the U.S. economic recovery and euro-region unemployment
drove investors to the safety of  government bonds .  The average rate for a 30-year mortgage fell to 3.84
percent in the week ended today from 3.88 percent,  Freddie Mac 
said in a statement. It was the lowest in the McLean, Virginia-
based mortgage-finance company’s records dating to 1971. The
average 15-year rate dropped to 3.07 percent from 3.12 percent.  Yields for 10-year  U.S. Treasuries , a benchmark for
mortgages, approached the lowest level in almost three months
yesterday after reports showed that euro-area unemployment rose
to a 15-year high and manufacturing contracted for a ninth-
month. American companies added 119,000 workers in April, the
smallest gain in seven months, according to figures from ADP
Employer Services.  “Lower  interest rates  do provide support for housing,”
said  Keith Gumbinger , vice president of HSH.com, a mortgage-
information website based in Pompton Plains, New Jersey.
“Unfortunately the economy appears to be sputtering again and
that doesn’t foster the kind of confidence needed for consumers
to want to take on what is one of life’s biggest financial
obligations.”  U.S.  homeownership  fell to the lowest level in 15 years in
the first quarter as borrowers lost homes to foreclosure and
tighter credit kept buyers off the market. The rate dropped to
65.4 percent from 66 percent in the fourth quarter, the Census
Bureau reported on April 30.  Demand Increasing  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s home-loan  purchase  index
rose 2.9 percent in the week ended April 27, while its  refinance 
gauge dropped 0.7 percent, the Washington-based group reported
yesterday.  The housing market appears to be bottoming as demand picks
up. Contracts to buy previously owned homes climbed 4.1 percent
in March from the previous month to the highest level since
April 2010, the National Association of Realtors said last week.
New homes  sold  at an annual pace of 328,000 in March, up 7.5
percent from a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported
April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
