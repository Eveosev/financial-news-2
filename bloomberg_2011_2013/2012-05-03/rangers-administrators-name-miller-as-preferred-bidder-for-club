The administrators for Rangers
Football Club chose American businessman  Bill Miller  as the
preferred bidder for the Glasgow soccer team.  Rangers, which has won a record 54 Scottish titles, went
into administration, a form of bankruptcy, in February as U.K.
tax authorities chased the team over unpaid bills.  “Mr. Miller now proposes to complete his transaction by
the end of the season,” administrators Duff & Phelps said in a
statement on Rangers website.  Miller is founder of Miller Industries, a towing equipment
company based in  Tennessee .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
