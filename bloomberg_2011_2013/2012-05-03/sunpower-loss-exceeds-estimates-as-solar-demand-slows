SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , the solar-panel maker
majority owned by Total SA, reported a first-quarter loss that
exceeded estimates as slowing demand reduced sales.  The loss was $74.5 million, or 67 cents a share, San Jose,
California-based SunPower said today in a statement. That was
more than the 50-cent average of 10 analysts’  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales were $494.1 million, compared with $451.4
million a year earlier.  Global installations of solar panels may fall this year
after governments in Europe and the U.S. trimmed subsidies.  “We expect deep European subsidy cuts to weaken demand in
the normally strong” second half of the year, Robert Stone, a
Cowen and Co. analyst in Boston, said in a research note May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
