Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  rose for a seventh day in Czech trading, headed for the
longest stretch of gains since September 2009, on optimism that
the television broadcaster’s debt will decline.  The stock of Bermuda-registered CME climbed 7.7 percent to
167 koruna by 10:48 a.m. in Prague, making it the best performer
today in the  PX (PX)  equity index, which was little changed.  Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday it may upgrade its
B3 corporate family rating on CME after the broadcaster said on
April 30 that  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , its biggest shareholder, will
provide a $300 million loan to help repay debts coming due next
year and increase its stake in the company to 40 percent.  “The transaction will see CME emerge with an improved
liquidity profile as the company will have no debt maturing
until the 2014 notes come due,” the ratings company said in an
e-mailed statement. “The decrease in debt should also help CME
in reversing the trend of producing negative cash flows.”  Time Warner and billionaire  Ronald Lauder ’s RSL Capital LLC
will pay $86.4 million for 11.5 million Class A shares, and CME
will use proceeds from the sale to repay part of the new loan,
according to the company’s April 30 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
