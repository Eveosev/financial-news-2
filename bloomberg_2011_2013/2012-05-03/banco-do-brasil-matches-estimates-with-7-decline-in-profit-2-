Banco do Brasil SA ,  Latin America ’s
largest lender by assets, reported a 7 percent decrease in
first-quarter adjusted net income, matching analysts’ estimates
as provisions mounted.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time charges,
declined to 2.7 billion reais ($1.4 billion), or 89 centavos a
share, from 2.92 billion reais, or 1.03 reais, the Brasilia-
based lender said today in a regulatory filing. That compares
with an  average  estimate of 2.69 billion reais in a Bloomberg
survey of 11 analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Aldemir Bendine boosted provisions
at the Banco Votorantim unit as  Brazil ’s rate of consumer-loan
defaults rose in the first two months of this year to the
highest level since December 2009. Higher inflation and a
slowing economy eroded borrowers’ ability repay debts on time.  “Losses at Votorantim remained elevated given a continued
pick-up in auto delinquencies,”  Mario Pierry , an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note today.  Banco do Brasil dropped 1.3 percent to 22.64 reais in Sao
Paulo at 2:56 p.m., compared with a 0.8 decline for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa. Itau, Latin America’s largest bank by market
value, fell 0.3 percent to 29.14 reais.  Delinquencies, Provisions  Brazilian consumer-loan delinquencies reached 7.6 percent
in January and February before falling to 7.4 percent in March,
the central bank said April 25. Economic growth slowed to 2.7
percent last year after expanding 7.5 percent in 2010, while
consumer prices  rose  6.5 percent in 2011, the most since 2004.  Banco do Brasil increased provisions for bad loans to 3.58
billion reais from 2.89 billion reais in the previous quarter
and 2.63 billion reais a year earlier, according to the
statement today. Default rates for debt payments overdue more
than 90 days climbed to 2.2 percent in the first quarter, up
from 2.1 percent in December and in March of last year.  The lender expects provisions to be 3.6 billion reais to
3.8 billion reais in the second quarter and 3.5 billion reais to
3.7 billion reais in both the third quarter and fourth quarter,
according to a regulatory filing.  Banco Votorantim, which mainly handles auto loans, posted a
loss of 597 million reais after reporting a loss of 656 million
reais in the fourth quarter and net income of 385 million reais
in last year’s first quarter.  Second Quarter  Banco do Brasil expects Votorantim to post second-quarter
results better than it did in the first quarter, Chief Financial
Officer Ivan Monteiro told reporters in  Sao Paulo  today. He said
the unit’s third-quarter results will beat its second-quarter
and improve further in the fourth.  Management expenses rose 16.4 percent to 6.63 billion reais
from a year earlier. The loan portfolio expanded 19 percent in
the first quarter to 473.1 billion reais. Total assets reached 1
trillion reais, a 16 percent increase from  the previous year,
according to the statement.  Banco do Brasil will announce further interest-rate cuts
for individuals tomorrow as it increases credit lines, Alexandre Correa Abreu, vice-president of the retail business, told
reporters in Sao Paulo today. He declined to say how large the
rate reductions will be or by how much it will boost lending.
The bank will also lower administration fees for funds next
week, he said.  Last month, the federally controlled lender cut interest
rates on loans as President  Dilma Rousseff  called for lower bank
spreads to help support the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
