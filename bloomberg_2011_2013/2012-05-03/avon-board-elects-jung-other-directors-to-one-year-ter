Avon Products Inc.’s (AVP)  board elected
former Chief Executive Officer  Andrea Jung  and nine other
directors to a one-year term as the door-to-door cosmetics
seller resists a $10 billion takeover bid from Coty Inc.  Shareholders at Avon’s annual meeting in  New York  today
voted on the reelection of the board members and approved a new
director, former Campbell Soup Co. CEO Douglas Conant, Jennifer Vargas, an Avon spokeswoman, said by e-mail.  Avon named Johnson & Johnson’s Sherilyn McCoy as CEO last
month, replacing Jung who remains chairman. The New York-based
company is working to reverse three years of profit declines and
conclude an investigation related to the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.  “They are going to give her a chance,”  Don Wordell , an
Orlando, Florida-based fund manager who oversees about $2.4
billion in the RidgeWorth Mid-Cap Value Equity Fund, said today
by telephone. He said he sold the fund’s Avon shares last month.
“The Coty bid is probably dead. So it’s back to blocking and
tackling for the new CEO. It’s going to take time.”  On April 2, Avon rejected a $23.25-a-share cash offer from
Coty, the New York-based maker of perfumes by Heidi Klum and
 Beyonce Knowles , saying the bid doesn’t reflect the value of the
company.  Avon  slipped  1.2 percent to $19.68 at 2:18 p.m. in New
York. The shares had advanced 14 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
