  Modiin-LP (MDINL)  advanced the most since
March in Tel Aviv trading after  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  suspended
drilling operations in the Leviathan offshore field.  The  shares  of the oil and gas explorer rose as much as 7.4
percent and were trading 6.2 percent higher, the biggest gain
since March 13, at 0.36 shekel as of 11:43 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  “The Noble announcement that it finished the drilling for
oil in Leviathan means that the rig may now pass over to Mira
and Sara, where Modiin has interests,” said Guil Bashan, an
analyst at I.B.I- Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel
Aviv. “So this could signal the beginning of drilling at those
sites.”  Israel Land Development Co., also a partner in the Mira and
Sara gas fields, added 5.2 percent to 0.715 shekel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
