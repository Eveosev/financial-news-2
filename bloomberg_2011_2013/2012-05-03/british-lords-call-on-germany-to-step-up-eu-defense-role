Britain’s upper chamber of parliament
called on  Germany  to “pull its weight” in defending the
European Union as the U.K. cuts military spending.  “Germany, Europe’s biggest economy and key player in every
other area of EU activity, must play a bigger role,” Liberal
Democrat peer Lord Robin Teverson said in a statement by the
cross-party European Union Committee of the House of Lords
published today in London. “It cannot be left to the U.K. and
France to continue to carry the burden.”  The U.K. is reducing its  defense budget  by 8 percent over
four years to tackle a 38 billion-pound ($61.5 billion)
shortfall. Plans announced in 2010 following a review included
the ordering of fewer, cheaper planes for one new  aircraft
carrier  and the possible mothballing of a second, which will
carry only helicopters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
