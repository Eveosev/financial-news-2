Kenyan remittances from citizens
abroad jumped 49 percent in March to a monthly record, amid
efforts to lure investment from the diaspora and improved
methods for the data’s classification, the central bank said.  Kenyans living overseas sent home $106.4 million in the
month, up from $71.6 million a year earlier, the bank said in a
statement on its website today. In the first quarter, Kenya
received $300.1 million in remittances compared with $196.5
million a year earlier, the bank said.  “Banks are now making better judgment calls in
categorizing money regularly coming in as remittances,” Aly- Khan Satchu, chief executive of Nairobi-based investment company
 Rich Management , said in a phone interview. “The data are
significantly under-counted, especially by informal channels.”  The majority of March remittances, 54 percent, came from
 North America , the bank said.  The East African government last year began targeting
citizens living abroad for investment in infrastructure bonds
and longer-dated securities including the so-called savings
development bond with a 30-year maturity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
