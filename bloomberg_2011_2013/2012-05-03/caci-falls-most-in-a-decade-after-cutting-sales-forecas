CACI International Inc. (CACI) , a provider of
professional services and technology consulting to the U.S.
government, tumbled the most in a decade after cutting its
annual sales forecast.  The shares fell 16 percent to $51.52 at the close in New
York, for the steepest decline since April 2002. The shares have
fallen 7.9 percent this year.  Fiscal 2012 revenue will be $3.73 billion to $3.83 billion,
the Arlington, Virginia-based company said today in a statement.
It had originally predicted sales of as much as $4.05 billion,
while analysts had estimated $3.95 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  CACI blamed the shortfall in part on slower-than-
anticipated procurement by customers. The company expects its
growth rate to decelerate because of uncertainty in government
budgeting and “the drawdown in Southwest  Asia .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
