Romania  may ask Canada’s  Gabriel
Resources Ltd. (GBU)  to revise its Rosia Montana gold mine project
after a court annulled a previous zoning plan last month,  Mediafax 
said, citing outgoing Environment Minister Korodi Attila.  A team of lawyers advised the ministry that the lack of a
valid plan may hurt the project’s permitting process, which is
being conducted by a special commission, Korodi, who was ousted
last week after the government lost a no-confidence vote in
Parliament, told the Bucharest-based news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
