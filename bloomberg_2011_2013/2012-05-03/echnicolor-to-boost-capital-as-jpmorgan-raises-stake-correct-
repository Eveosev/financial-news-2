(Corrects shares trading in final paragraph.)  Technicolor said it plans to raise as
much as 158 million euros in capital through a sale of stock to
shareholders and with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  boosting its stake in
the producer of film-making products and technology.  JPMorgan, which owns 1 percent of Technicolor, plans to buy
a stake through its One  Equity Partners (NBPE)  arm, and will own
between 25 percent and 29.96 percent of Technicolor, the Paris-
based company said in an e-mailed statement.  “The capital increase we are planning will provide the
company with a stronger financial structure and a stable
shareholder base to implement its growth strategy,” Technicolor
Chief Executive Officer Frederic Rose said in the statement.  The two-step capital-raising exercise will include a sale
of shares to a JPMorgan-linked investment vehicle for 1.60 euros
a shares and a rights offer, or a sale of stock to existing
shareholders, at 1.56 euros a shares. JPMorgan’s stake will be
determined by the level of participation in the rights offer by
Technicolor’s shareholders.  Technicolor  shares closed  13 percent higher at 1.599 euros
on April 30. The stock was suspended from trading yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
