Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,  Europe ’s biggest
buyer of real estate in the past year, agreed to sell three
central London student residences to Round Hill Capital LLC for
about 415 million pounds ($670 million), according to four
people with knowledge of the transaction.  Round Hill, run by former Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds
executive  Michael Bickford , acquired the three Nido-branded
properties owned by funds managed by Blackstone, the people
said. They declined to be identified because the transaction
won’t be completed until later this month.  Blackstone declined to comment in an e-mailed statement,
while no one from Round Hill Capital was immediately available
to return two calls seeking comment.  The Nido sale is the largest in the niche U.K. student
accommodation market in at least a year and follows 1 billion
pounds of transactions last year, according to estimates by
Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  A larger deal may be pending. Barclays Infrastructure
Managers is in exclusive talks to sell an 80 percent stake in
University Partnerships Programme to PGGM, the second-largest
Dutch pension fund manager. The sale may fetch about 850 million
pounds, according to a report by researcher Real Capital
Analytics Inc.  The three Nido residences are at King’s Cross, Notting Hill
and Spitalfields and have a combined 2,500 student rooms, cafes,
fitness centers and laundries, according to the  website.   Nido’s Barcelona development and other projects aren’t
included in the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
