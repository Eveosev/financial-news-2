First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest
maker of thin-film solar modules, raised its earnings forecast
and promoted  James Hughes  to chief executive officer after
posting its second-ever quarterly loss.  Net income this year will range from $4.00 to $4.50 a
share, up from the company’s earlier forecast of $3.75 to $4.25,
according to a statement today.  The company expects higher earnings in part from cost
savings after it announced plans to cut 30 percent of its
workforce this year.  First Solar is reducing capacity after a global surplus
drove down solar-panel  prices  49 percent in the past year and
waning government support in  Europe  slowed demand. The company
said March 17 it would fire about 2,000 workers worldwide and
close a plant in  Germany .  “Closure of the German operation is indicative of
permanent change in Europe,” Rob Stone, an analyst at Cowen &
Co. in Boston, said in a research note May 1. “We expect
sizable charges for capacity adjustments to overwhelm operating
results.” Stone has a neutral rating on the shares.  Hughes joined First Solar in March as chief commercial
officer. He replaces Mike Ahearn, the company’s chairman and co-
founder who stepped in as interim CEO in October after the
company ousted Rob Gillette.  Excluding restructuring charges and warranty expenses,
First Solar reported a loss of 8 cents a share. The company was
expected to earn 48 cents a share, according to the average of
29  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 12 percent to
$497 million.  Company’s First Loss  First Solar reported a net loss of $413.1 million in the
fourth quarter, the first since it went public in 2006. The
first-quarter results were released after the close of regular
U.S. trading today. Shares fell 0.8 percent to $18.07 at the
close in New York.  First Solar plans to close its plant in  Frankfurt  an der
Oder, Germany, with about 560 megawatts of annual production
capacity, in the fourth quarter. The company spent 170 million
euros ($224 million) to double capacity at the facility and it
reached full production in November.  The company also idled four production lines in Kulim,
 Malaysia , last month.  First Solar had 2,520 megawatts of production capacity at
the end of the fourth quarter, and expects to produce 1,500 to
1,800 megawatts globally this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
