On Wednesday evening, Exercise Book, a user of the Sina Weibo microblog, posted  a message  for his 2.5 million followers: “I’ve finally figured out where the safest place in China is…” The message was anything but cryptic. Only hours earlier, state-run Chinese media began  reporting  what much of the world had known for  almost a week : Legal activist Chen Guangcheng, who is also blind, had escaped from house arrest in Shandong Province and was granted refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Chinese netizens were quick to jump on the startling news, and by 8:00 a.m. on Thursday, they’d posted more than 4,500 comments to Exercise Book’s Weibo post. At least a  third of the responses  speculated where the safest place in China was, with the vast majority guessing the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. As subtle, uncensored rejoinders to Chinese official statements go, this was powerful. Nonetheless, Exercise Book and his followers likely didn't see the U.S. as a proverbial “ beacon of hope .” Rather, like other netizens across  China ’s microblogging platforms, they were using the best means available to criticize the Chinese Communist Party and government. To be sure, parsing Chinese public opinion from the country’s fractious but tightly regulated and censored microblogs is a tenuous act. Chinese microbloggers represent the most educated and wealthiest strata of society, and less than one third of the Chinese population. Meanwhile, microblog censors -– at the behest of Chinese internet authorities -– delete posts perceived as harmful to the party and government while restricting searches on sensitive topics. Therefore, the name “Chen Guangcheng,” and terms that might be associated with him, such as “blind lawyer,” do not bring up results. In the case of  Chen Guangcheng , that’s convenient: He is not a household name in China and very few netizens appear to be familiar with his activism against forced sterilizations and  abortions  that led to years of persecution and home detention. His daring escape to Beijing, followed by his refuge at the U.S. embassy and the ensuing  diplomatic tussle , have not created big news in China. State-run coverage of Chen has mainly focused on  his presence at the embassy , with some criticism of the U.S. -- and a  little schadenfreude  at its current diplomatic predicament. But as stripped down as those official Chinese reports are, they seem to have struck a nerve with a sizable number of Chinese netizens who re-tweet them -– and comment on them -- by the thousands. (Note: Censors, for the moment,  give comment threads wider latitude  than actual posts, or tweets.) On Wednesday afternoon, Xinhua, China’s state-owned news agency,  posted a Chen-related message  to its official Sina Weibo account: By Thursday morning, that tweet had been re-posted more than 6,000 times and garnered nearly 2,000 comments -– many of which jumped on the suggestion that the U.S. “reflect.” One of the most biting responses was from an anonymous microblogger in Hangzhou,  who suggested  that Chinese behavior toward Chen Guangcheng is the real threat to  U.S.-China relations . It’s a devastating critique that, if posted separate from a comment thread, would almost certainly be deleted: Nonetheless, from an official Chinese perspective, there’s a big difference between criticizing individual government officials' decisions, and criticizing the structure and legitimacy of the Communist Party and its government. As this  second Chen-related post  from Xinhua showed, the former is occasionally tolerated and the latter is not: This has received 2,000 re-tweets and 35 comments. Any attempt to add a new comment to the 35 is met with the message: “Sorry, the content is in violation of relevant regulations and policies and cannot be published.” The message, for netizens, is clear: Do not criticize the system. Critical comments on the Foreign Ministry’s views on the rule of law in China exist on microblogs, but they are reserved for the actions of individual officials. For example, the independent Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper in Guangzhou posted  the same news  to its Sina Weibo account, but received comments such as  this scathing one  from a user with the English-language handle GhostInTheHell: Answers to those questions won’t come soon, but it’s also unlikely that the questions will stop. China’s netizens are becoming savvier about their news, their rulers and the role they play in making the latter responsive to the former. Wednesday night,  NB Jianbo , an entrepreneur in Ningbo, a boomtown south of Shanghai, summarized that new role in an affecting tweet that referenced news about Chen Guangcheng and several additional “sensitive” news stories from recent weeks: So far, there are five comments to  this post . The second is the most eye-catching, however. It technically reads: “The Communist Party won’t let us be patriotic.” But in place of the characters for Communist Party, it uses a small hammer and sickle character.
