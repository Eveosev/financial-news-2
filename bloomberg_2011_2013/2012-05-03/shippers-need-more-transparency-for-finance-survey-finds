Shipping companies need to be more
transparent to raise financing, according to a survey of German
ship owners conducted by KPMG LLP.  Ninety percent of respondents said the shipping market’s
future will depend on “securing new equity sources,” and 62
percent said “transparency of company structures” will be
increasingly important, KPMG said today. The survey, conducted
in the second half of 2011, represents owners of 42 percent of
the German fleet, the London-based advisory firm said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
