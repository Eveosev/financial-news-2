Clashes involving Burundi’s rival
political groups that left scores of people dead since 2010 have
yet to be fully investigated, raising concerns that impunity in
the country is worsening,  Human Rights Watch  said.  The “tit-for-tat” politically motivated attacks between
ruling-party supporters and pro-opposition followers surged
after an election in 2010 that returned President Pierre Nkurunziza to power for a second term, the New York-based
advocacy group said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  The worst violence came in September 2011, when 37 people
were killed in a bar in Gatumba town. The trial for the case was
unfair, amid claims by some defendants that they were tortured,
and concluded after “just a few days,” HRW said. Most of the
other reported murders remain unsolved, it said.  Burundi, a coffee-producing nation of 8 million people is
recovering from a decade-long civil war in which 300,000 people
died. Security has improved in Burundi since the beginning of
this year, HRW said.  The Burundian government considers the report to be
“misleading and subversive,” Interior Minister Edouard
Nduwimana told reporters today in the capital, Bujumbura.  Nkurunziza leads the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy, whose members
hold the majority of seats in parliament, while the opposition
is the National Liberation Forces, known by its French acronym
FNL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
