Delhaize Group SA (DELB) , the owner of the
U.S. Food Lion stores, fell to the lowest value in almost nine
years in Brussels after forecasting earnings will drop as much
as 20 percent and a decline in same-store sales accelerated.  Delhaize slumped as much as 12 percent to 31.49 euros on
Euronext Brussels, the lowest intraday price since August 2003,
and  traded  11 percent lower at 31.84 euros by 9:44 a.m. The
shares have lost 45 percent in the past 12 months, the  fourth-
worst  performance of the 25 companies included in the Stoxx 600
Retail Index.  Operating profit before expenses and writedowns linked to
store closures will fall 15 percent to 20 percent when not
taking into account currency fluctuations, the Brussels-based
company said today in a statement. Profit on that basis fell 17
percent to 189 million euros ($248 million) in the first
quarter, missing the 204.7 million-euro average of seven analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “A very poor first quarter and the full year won’t be much
better,” John David Roeg and Jan Meijer, analysts at ING Groep
NV in Amsterdam, wrote in an investor note today. “From a
regional performance, poorest performer was the U.S. where the
underlying margin fell by 100 basis points.”  Price Cuts  Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.6 percent
in the three months through March, the biggest drop in more than
a year and accelerating from a 0.4 percent decline in the prior
quarter. In  Belgium , same-store sales fell 0.9 percent, for a
third straight decline. Delhaize’s  gross margin , or the
proportion of revenue left after subtracting costs of goods
sold, shrank 86 basis points to 24.8 percent, reflecting U.S.
price cuts and the lower profitability of the Delta Maxi DOO
business in eastern  Europe  it bought last year in its biggest
acquisition in a decade.  The grocer said it will extend price cuts this year in its
Belgian supermarkets and Hannaford stores in the U.S. to retain
customers and began repositioning an additional 250 Food Lion
supermarkets at the end of March. The grocer is also adding
Bottom Dollar Food stores, a lower-margin discount format, in
the Pittsburgh area.  Delhaize cut its forecast for  capital spending  by 100
million euros to offset the decline in earnings, setting a
target of generating  500 million euros  of cash not required for
reinvestment this year. That compares with 343 million euros in
2011, excluding the cash spent to buy Delta Maxi. Net debt fell
to 2.51 billion euros from 2.65 billion euros at the end of
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
