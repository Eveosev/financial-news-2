Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, also
known as Sofaz, will start investing in real estate in three to
four months as it seeks to increase returns and diversify its
holdings, Dasinmaz Amlak magazine reported.  Sofaz will initially invest in commercial real estate in
business centers of some European cities with transparent market
environment and high liquidity, Israfil Mammadov, head of
Sofaz’s fund management department, told the state-run magazine.
It will later look into investment opportunities in other parts
of the world, Mammadov was cited as saying.  The oil fund is working with foreign companies and
organizations to establish a specialized structure that will
handle investments in real estate, Mammadov said.  Sofaz, established in 1999 to manage state income from oil
and gas sales, saw its assets grow 31 percent last year to $29.8
billion. Azerbaijan is the third largest oil producer in the
former  Soviet Union  after Russia and  Kazakhstan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
