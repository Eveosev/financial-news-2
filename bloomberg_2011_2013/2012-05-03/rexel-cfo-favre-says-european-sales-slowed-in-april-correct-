Michel Favre said European sales growth slowed in April compared
with the first quarter, partly because branches were closed on
the eve of the May 1 holiday.  In April, “we have clearly a lower trend than in the first
quarter,” Favre said on a conference call with journalists.
“ Europe  is probably slowing down a little.”  Total sales growth in April was 1 percentage point “below
the trend of the first quarter,” Favre said. For the rest of
the year, “we have no expectations that there will be a quick
recovery” in Spain and Italy, where sales are “probably
bottoming” after slumping since the middle of last year.  In  France , where sales rose 0.1 percent in the first
quarter, “we expect to remain in this kind of waters” in
coming months as consumers are “very, very cautious” on
spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
