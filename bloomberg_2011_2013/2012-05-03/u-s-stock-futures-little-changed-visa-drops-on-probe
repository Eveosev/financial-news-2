U.S. stocks fell, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index down a second day, amid disappointing service
industries data and as investors awaited tomorrow’s jobs report
to gauge the pace of growth at the world’s largest economy.  Commodity and technology shares fell the  most  among 10  S&P
500  groups as  Alcoa (AA)  Inc. and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  slid at least
1.5 percent.  General Motors Co. (GM)  sank 2.4 percent after earnings
tumbled 61 percent.  Target Corp. (TGT)  lost 2.5 percent as April sales
missed projections.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  plunged
48 percent as  profit  will be less than it expected. Carlyle
Group LP advanced 0.2 percent in its  first day  of trading.  The S&P 500 retreated 0.8 percent to 1,391.57 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time, dropping 1 percent in two days. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  declined 61.98 points, or 0.5 percent, to
13,206.59. The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  of small companies decreased
1.5 percent to 806.59. About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 3.8 percent above the three-month average.  “It’s a bump in the road,” said  Jeffrey Saut , chief
investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates in  St.
Petersburg , Florida. His firm oversees more than $300 billion.
“The economic data has turned softer. I wouldn’t be surprised
to see the jobs report tomorrow disappoint. All that will do is
allow the market to work off its overbought condition.”  The two-day drop in stocks, which pulled the Dow down from
a  four-year  high, came as concern about the economy grew. A
measure of forecasting accuracy shows economic data have been
worse than predicted. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index is
at minus 24.20, the lowest since September.  160,000 Jobs  Equities fell today as service industries grew at a slower
pace than projected in April, a sign the largest part of the
economy may  struggle  to accelerate. The report overshadowed data
showing that jobless claims fell to 365,000 in the week ended
April 28, a one-month low. The Labor Department may say tomorrow
that the U.S. added 160,000 jobs in April, compared with a gain
of 120,000 the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “The jobless claims are good,”  Philip Orlando , the New
York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors Inc.,
which oversees about $370 billion, said in a phone interview.
“This gives us the read-through that May’s jobs numbers are
likely going to be better. Yet tomorrow’s report will probably
still be consistent with this temporary soft patch.”  Concern about growth also intensified after European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the economic outlook
has worsened, adding that policy makers didn’t discuss cutting
the benchmark rate below its current record low of 1 percent.  Earnings Season  Today’s decline pared the 2012 rally in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  to 11
percent. Investors bought stocks this year on better-than-
estimated profits. About  71 percent  of S&P 500 companies that
reported results since the start of the earnings season have
beaten projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eight out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 retreated today as
commodity shares slumped at least 1.1 percent. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to the economy
slid 1.5 percent. Alcoa dropped 1.5 percent to $9.58. Hewlett-
Packard decreased 3.1 percent, the most in the Dow average, to
$24.48.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  lost 2 percent to $8.  GM sank 2.4 percent to $22.37. Profit at the largest
automaker was affected by widening losses in Europe. The results
resemble  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s profit as North American income was
countered by losses in Europe, as well as a higher tax rate.  Green Mountain plunged 48 percent, the biggest decline
ever, to $25.87. It’s seeing more competition from private-label
capsules that fit into Keurig machines and from  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ,
which plans to sell its own single-serve brewer later this year.
The company has introduced the Vue coffee machine to help combat
rivals when the main patents for its K-Cups expire in September.  Retailers Slump  Retailers in the S&P 500 lost 0.9 percent after companies
including Target and  Macy’s Inc. (M)  posted April same-store sales
that trailed analysts’ estimates as an earlier Easter holiday
pulled sales into March and cooler weather cut mall traffic.  Target, the second-biggest U.S. discount chain, slid 2.5
percent to $56.55. Macy’s, the second-biggest U.S. department-
store chain, rose 0.7 percent to $41.55.  Gap Inc. (GPS) , the largest
U.S. apparel chain, slumped 1.6 percent to $28.67.  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  tumbled 10 percent, the most in
the S&P 500, to $54.81. The second-biggest U.S. life insurer
swung to a first-quarter  loss  as the value of the company’s
derivative contracts fell.  Visa Inc. (V)  slid 4.7 percent to $116.41. The world’s biggest
payments network disclosed a U.S. antitrust probe into its
pricing and strategy for debit-card transactions.  Facebook’s IPO  Facebook Inc. (FB) , the most popular social-networking site, is
seeking as much as $11.8 billion in its initial public offering,
the largest on record for an Internet company. About 337.4
million shares are being sold at $28 to $35 each.  Founded in 2004 and led by 27-year-old Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook has amassed more than 900
million users and  reported  a 24-fold increase in sales over the
past four years. The company’s popularity as a tool for staying
connected online will spur demand for the stock, even as some
investors steer clear of a valuation they deem too high, said
Francis Gaskins, president of researcher IPOdesktop.com.  “Some people will buy Facebook stock no matter what --
they’ll just buy it,” said Gaskins, who is based in Marina Del
Rey, California. “There’s going to be an initial push of
enthusiasm and money, but ultimately, in a year or so, it will
come down to valuation metrics. It has to.”  Carlyle Group (CG)  rose 0.2 percent to $22.05, trimming a gain
of 2.1 percent. It raised $671 million by selling 30.5 million
shares at $22 each, according to a statement yesterday. The
price for Carlyle, which had offered the shares for $23 to $25,
represents a 65 percent discount to rival  Blackstone (BX)  Group LP.  Hard to Predict  In pricing its IPO, Carlyle sought to avoid the fate of
Blackstone, Apollo Global Management LLC and other alternative
asset managers, whose stocks have tumbled in public trading.
Investors have struggled with how to value private equity firms
partly because their earnings are hard to predict, with the bulk
coming from buyout funds that sell assets at various times.  “Private equity firms in general struggle with initial
public offerings mainly because of the way their business is
structured, and Carlyle is no different,” said Tom Murphy, a
partner in the law firm of McDermott Will & Emery LLP.  Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM)  jumped 7.6 percent to $90.69. The
largest U.S. natural-goods grocer posted profit that topped
analysts’ estimates on increased demand for organic foods.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   shareholders  missed out on better
returns from the S&P 500 by sticking with Chairman  Warren Buffett  after each of his last three annual meetings.  2012 Gathering  Berkshire fell 2.4 percent from the firm’s April 30, 2011,
meeting through yesterday, compared with the 2.8 percent advance
in the S&P 500. This year’s gathering, planned for May 5 in
Omaha, Nebraska, concludes three years in which Berkshire
climbed about 32 percent, trailing the S&P 500’s gain of around
60 percent.  Buffett, 81, is seeking to reassure investors that the $200
billion company he built over  42 years  as chief executive
officer is positioned to thrive after his eventual departure.
Growth slowed in the last 15 years as Buffett, a former hedge
fund manager, directed Berkshire’s earnings toward takeovers in
industries like machine tools, power production and railroads.  “They’re very steady, but they’re not necessarily fast
growers,” Cliff Gallant, an analyst at KBW Inc., said about
Berkshire operating units. A “lack of clarity” about Buffett’s
successor may also be weighing on the stock, Gallant said. He
rates Berkshire “outperform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
