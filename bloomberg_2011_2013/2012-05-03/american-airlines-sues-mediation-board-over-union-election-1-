American Airlines Inc., the bankrupt
carrier fighting to cut labor costs, sued the  National Mediation
Board  over a decision directing a union election among a group
of nonunion employees.  The board applied the wrong standard when it ordered a
union-representation election for passenger service employees,
American said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
 Fort Worth ,  Texas , where the airline is based.  American’s lawsuit comes as it’s seeking court approval to
void labor contracts with unions as part of its bankruptcy
reorganization. The airline is seeking to cut $1.25 billion in
annual labor costs.  American said it has about 10,000 passenger service
employees, who work at airport ticket counters, gates and
baggage areas. The “vast majority” of them didn’t provide an
authorization card expressing an interest in having a union-
representation election, American said in its complaint.  A spokesman for the National Mediation Board didn’t return
a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is American Airlines Inc. v. National Mediation
Board, 12-00276, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas
(Fort Worth).  To contact the reporter on this story:
