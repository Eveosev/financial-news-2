Q-Cells SE (QCE) , the German solar-cell and
panel maker that filed for insolvency last month, is supplying 7
megawatts of modules to IKEA Group, the world’s biggest
furniture retailer.  The thin-film modules will be installed on the roof of
IKEA’s main warehouse in Piacenza, northern  Italy , in the
“coming months,” Thalheim-based Q-Cells said today in an e-
mailed statement, without disclosing terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
