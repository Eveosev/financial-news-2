The number of female board members in
Finnish listed companies increased by 20 percent from a year
ago, according to the countryâ€™s Chamber of Commerce.  Women now constitute 22 percent of all board members in
Finnish companies, compared with 18 percent in spring 2011, the
Helsinki-based organization said in a report published today.  The average annual salary for chief executive officers in
companies with large market capitalization amounted to about 1
million euros ($1.3 million), two thirds of it in fixed salary
and one third in incentive bonuses, according to the
organization. The number does not include long-term incentive
programs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
