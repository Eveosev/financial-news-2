Germany ’s Ver.di labor union rejected
a 4.2 percent wage increase over 30 months offered today by the
country’s private and public banks to their 230,000 workers.  The offer equates to a pay raise of 1.3 percent over 12
months and is “entirely insufficient” and is “far below”
raises won in other sectors of the economy, Berlin-based Ver.di
said in an e-mailed statement.  The AGV Banken umbrella group’s offer is for increases in
three steps through August 2014, and is the first wage offer in
the third round of negotiations with Ver.di, the group said in
an earlier statement.  “This offer does justice to the possibilities of companies
and the interests of the workers,” Ulrich Sieber, AGV Banken’s
chief negotiator, said in the statement.  Pay demands may increase banks’ costs as German lenders
work to fill a 13.1 billion-euro ($17.2 billion) capital gap
identified by European regulators and the sovereign debt crisis
weighs on earnings. Ver.di won a 6.5 percent wage increase last
month for about 2 million public-sector workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
