Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , the U.S. biotechnology
company backed by the oil refiner Total SA and the specialty
chemicals maker  Lanxess AG (LXS) , fell the most in six months after
rival Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC asked the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to reexamine a disputed patent.  Gevo, based in Englewood, Colorado,  declined  11 percent to
$8.92 at the close in  New York , the most since October 31.  Butamax, a joint venture of  BP Plc (BP/)  and DuPont Co., said
Gevo’s patent may be invalid because it’s based on technology
that “was well known at the time the patent was filed,”
according to a statement today.  The companies have been  sparring  since January 2011 over
 patent rights  for systems that convert corn and non-food crops
into isobutanol. The Patent Office granted an earlier Butamax
request last on March 23 to reexamine another Gevo patent,
according to the statement. Patent reexaminations take about
three years on average.  The Patent Office is also reviewing two Butamax patents, at
Gevo’s request.  Isobutanol is blended with gasoline or refined into
specialty chemicals or jet fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
