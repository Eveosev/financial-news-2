Soybean traders are the most bullish
in seven weeks as drought damage to crops in Argentina and
Brazil boosts demand for supplies from the U.S., the biggest
producer of the oilseed.  Sixteen of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to gain next week and one was neutral, the highest proportion
since March 16. Soybean futures reached $15.125 a bushel this
week, the highest since July 2008.  Hedge funds  are making the
biggest bet on rising prices since at least June 2006, data from
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  has announced daily
sales of at least 100,000 metric tons of soybeans 10 times since
the start of April, dominated by purchases from  China . Archer
Daniels Midland Co., the largest grain processor, told analysts
this week that it would be “difficult to buy beans going
forward” because of declining South American exports.  “As the soybean supply in Brazil is running out, that is
forcing the Chinese to return to the U.S.,” said Chris Gadd, an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London. “You’d expect to see
continued strength in U.S. exports.”  Soybeans rose 22 percent to $14.685 on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade this year, rebounding from last year’s 14 percent slump.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials climbed 1.1
percent as the MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities added
7.5 percent. Treasuries returned 0.2 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  Biggest Consumer  China, the world’s biggest soybean consumer, bought 921,642
tons of U.S. soybeans in the four weeks ended April 26, nearly
triple the amount in the same period in 2011, the USDA said
yesterday. It’s booked 7.121 million tons of soybeans for
shipment in the next crop year, 21 percent more than at this
time last year, USDA data show.  Prices may match the record $16.3675 set in 2008 this
quarter, Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank International
in  London , wrote in an e-mail April 30. UBS AG raised on April
26 its forecast for this quarter’s average price to $14.227 from
$12.70. Oil World, a research company in Hamburg, cut its
prediction for global production to 238.1 million tons on May 1,
10 percent less than a year earlier.  Viterra Inc., a grain handler based in Regina,  Canada , said
last week that oilseed supplies may be limited through the next
growing season that begins Sept. 1. ADM Chief Risk Officer Craig
Huss said on a conference call May 1 that South American exports
would decline as countries “rationalize what they have.”  Argentina’s Crop  The jump in prices is already curbing demand, according to
Oil World. Consumption will climb 1.4 percent this season,
compared with a 6.3 percent expansion a year earlier, the
company forecast in a report dated April 27.  “We’re starting to see a bit of demand destruction at
these levels,” said FitzPatrick of Rabobank. “We still don’t
have a good handle on what  Argentina ’s crop is going to be and
how many  acres  will be planted in the U.S. The degree of how
much we’ll need to ration demand will be based on these crop
sizes, and that still isn’t clear yet.”  U.S. soybean planting probably will be 1.8 million acres
more than the 73.9 million projected by the USDA on March 30,
according to Rabobank. The U.S. planted 74.98 million acres last
year. The USDA updates its estimate on June 29.  World soybean production may drop to 240 million tons this
season, 9.5 percent less than a year earlier, the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said in a report
yesterday. South American output will decline 14 percent after
dry weather in  Brazil , Argentina and  Paraguay  “decimated
yields,” the FAO said.  ICE Futures U.S.  In other commodities, 15 of 24 people surveyed by Bloomberg
anticipate higher corn prices next week. The grain slipped 5.4
percent to $6.1175 a bushel this year in Chicago. Five of 12
people surveyed said raw sugar will fall next week three were
neutral. The commodity dropped 11 percent this year to 20.84
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Ten of 23 traders and analysts surveyed expect copper to
decline next week and six were neutral. The metal for delivery
in three months, the London Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract,
rose 7.6 percent to $8,174 a ton this year.  Gold futures on the Comex in  New York  increased 4.8 percent
to $1,642.10 an ounce this year. Prices gained the previous 11
years and holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products are
about 1.2 percent below the record 2,410.2 tons set March 13,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Fifteen of 28 traders and
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said gold would climb next week
and five were neutral.  Goldman Sachs  Money managers cut wagers on higher prices across 18
commodities by 29 percent in the past two months, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s analysts,
led by  Jeffrey Currie  in New York, said in a report April 24
they expect raw materials to return 13 percent over the next 12
months. Combined open interest, or contracts outstanding, across
the 24 commodities in the S&P GSCI rose 17 percent this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The global recovery will gain in pace later this year and
next, but we expect more temporary setbacks in the short to
medium term,” said Filip Petersson, an analyst at SEB AB in
 Stockholm . “That may actually offer good opportunities to buy
commodities.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
