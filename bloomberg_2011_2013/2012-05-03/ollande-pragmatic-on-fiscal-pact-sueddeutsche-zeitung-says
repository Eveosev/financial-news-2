French Socialist presidential
candidate  Francois Hollande  would be ready for a “pragmatic
solution” to a disagreement with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  over the so-called fiscal pact that would limit
government spending in European Union countries,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  said.  Hollande’s team has “concrete proposals” on how the
fiscal pact can be complemented by measures to stimulate
economic growth, the newspaper said, citing notes documenting
talks between German diplomats and Hollande aides. Merkel would
agree to such an amendment, which may be decided at an EU
leaders’ summit in Brussels at the end of June, the newspaper
said without citing anyone.  Hollande is aware that he would have to speak “tough
truths” at the beginning of his term and that there’s no way
around pushing  France ’s budget deficit below 3 percent of gross
domestic product next year, the newspaper said, citing notes on
the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
