  Kosmos Energy Ltd. (KOS)  tumbled after the
U.S. oil explorer said it will plug and abandon the Teak-4A
appraisal well offshore  Ghana .  The well, located northwest of the company’s Teak-1
discovery, “encountered thin, non-commercial reservoirs,”
Kosmos said in a statement today.  The company, based in  Dallas , said it will move the Atwood
Hunter rig to its Akasa oil discovery once it completes
operations at the Teak wells.  Kosmos dropped 8.5 percent to $11.07 at 4:56 p.m., after
the statement was issued following the close of regular U.S.
trading. In November, Kosmos said the Teak prospect extended
farther than originally thought. The well results will be
integrated into plans for the Teak field to determine future
appraisal and development, Kosmos said today.  Kosmos, with a 30.9 percent interest, operates the West
Cape Three Points Block where Teak-4A is located. Other partners
include  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) ,  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , Sabre Oil &
Gas Holdings Ltd. and Ghana National Petroleum Corp.  Gross production at the Jubilee field off Ghana averaged
67,000 barrels of oil a day in the first quarter,  Anadarko  said
April 30.  Also today, Kosmos said it terminated its proposed
acquisition of Sabre’s participating interest in the Deepwater
Tano Block off Ghana. The parties reached a mutual agreement,
Kosmos said, and the company will keep an 18 percent stake while
Sabre’s is about 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
