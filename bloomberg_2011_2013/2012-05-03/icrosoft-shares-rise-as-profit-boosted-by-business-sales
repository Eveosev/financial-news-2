Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the largest software
maker, expanded the number of directors on its board to 11 with
the addition of  Seagate Technology Plc (STX)  Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Luczo, whose expertise includes finance and data
storage.  Luczo has been CEO of the worldâ€™s largest maker of disk-
drives since 2009, his second stint in that role, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said in a statement. He has also
joined the audit committee. Existing board member John Thompson
joined the compensation committee, replacing  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  CEO
Reed Hastings.  Luczo brings experience in helping companies store and
manage data, and his finance background includes a stint as a
managing director at investment banking firm Bear Stearns & Co.,
Microsoft said. The appointment follows the February appointment
of Thompson, the former chairman and chief executive officer at
 Symantec Corp. (SYMC)  That added security expertise as the company aims
to expand in mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones.  The board has been closely monitoring the performance of
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer in these areas, giving
Ballmer half of his maximum allowed bonus in 2010 and 2011,
citing issues such as market-share losses in phones.  Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $31.76 at the close
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
