Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , the fifth-
largest U.S. cable provider by subscribers, declined the most in
two months after its cash flow decreased more than some analysts
estimated.  Cablevision’s adjusted operating cash flow fell 7.6 percent
to $513.5 million, a larger drop than analysts such as  David
Joyce  at Miller Tabak & Co. projected. Joyce cut his rating for
Cablevision to neutral from a buy recommendation following the
company’s quarterly earnings report.  The shares declined as much as 7.4 percent to $13.2 at 9:47
a.m. in New York, the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
