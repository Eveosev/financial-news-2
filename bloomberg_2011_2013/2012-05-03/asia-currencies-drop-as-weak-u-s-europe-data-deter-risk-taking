Asian currencies fell, led by  India ’s
rupee, after reports showing U.S. companies added the fewest
workers in seven months and euro-area unemployment rose to a 15-
year high cooled demand for riskier assets.  The rupee sank to a four-month low and South Korea’s won
retreated from a one-month high as the MSCI Asia-Pacific
excluding Japan Index of shares dropped for the first time in
eight days. U.S employers hired 119,000 workers last month,
compared with a median forecast for 170,000 additions in a
Bloomberg survey, data showed yesterday. The euro-area jobless
rate rose to 10.9 percent in March, the highest since April 1997,
the European Union announced.  “Asian currencies are not on the firm side with  risk
aversion  driving the dollar strength,” said Irene Cheung, a
Singapore-based currency strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group. “The euro-area data is clearly weakening and we
still expect to see a period of consolidation in U.S. numbers.”  The rupee slumped 0.6 percent to 53.30 per dollar as of
1:51 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 53.31, the weakest level since Jan. 2. The won closed
0.1 percent lower at 1,129.03, while Thailand’s baht fell 0.1
percent to 30.91.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index declined for a
third day, with its 60-day volatility declining to 2.73 percent
from 2.80 percent. The MSCI Asia-Pacific excluding Japan Index
dropped 0.3 percent.  “Growth concerns are causing some panic in the market that
the rupee may fall much further,” said Kamlakar Rao, head of
foreign-exchange trading in Mumbai at state-run Allahabad Bank.
“We are seeing importers buying dollars and corporates hedging
foreign-currency loans.”  Geithner in China  The  yuan  rose 0.03 percent to 6.3050 per dollar, reversing
an earlier loss, after Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  told
reporters in Beijing that  China  had a trade surplus of more than
$10 billion in April. U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  and Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  are in Beijing
for an economic dialogue that started today and may include
discussion of China’s exchange-rate policy and trade imbalances.  The People’s Bank of China weakened its  reference rate  0.04
percent today to 6.2697 per dollar, after strengthening it 0.53
percent in the four trading days leading up to the discussions.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent to
9,200 per dollar and Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.1 percent to
NT$29.266. Malaysia’s ringgit traded at 3.0280 from 3.0287
