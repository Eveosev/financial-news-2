Cattle rallied to the highest price in
almost two weeks on signs that a case of mad cow disease
reported last week hasn’t slowed demand for U.S. beef. Hogs
climbed.  Beef-export sales totaled 16,829 metric tons in the week
ended April 26, up 8.8 percent from a week earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Mexico,  Japan ,  Egypt ,  South
Korea  and Canada reported increases, the agency said in a  report 
today.  “This morning’s beef export sales report didn’t show any
big drop-off in beef sales,”  Rich Nelson , the director of
research for Allendale Inc. said in a telephone interview from
McHenry, Illinois.  Cattle futures for June delivery rose by the 3-cent
exchange limit, or 2.7 percent to settle at $1.15875 a pound at
1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange. That’s the highest
since April 20.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement advanced by the
3-cent limit, or 1.9 percent, to $1.57225 a pound in Chicago,
the highest since March 16.  The USDA said on April 24 that a dairy cow in  California 
was infected with mad cow disease, the nation’s first case since
2006. On that day, cattle futures fell 2.6 percent to a nine-
month low. Prices rebounded 1.1 percent in the next three
sessions as Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea, the world’s
biggest buyers of U.S. beef last year, said that they won’t halt
purchases. After the first case was reported in December 2003,
dozens of markets halted or restricted imports of U.S. beef.  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.6 percent to settle
at 84.925 cents a pound on the CME.  Wholesale  ham  reached 65.92 cents a pound yesterday, a two-
month high, USDA data show.  Higher ham prices are giving the market “a little
bounce,” Ryan Turner, a risk-management consultant at FCStone
Group Inc. said in a telephone interview from  Kansas City ,
Missouri. “That has helped packer margins, and I think that if
you can see the product stabilize, you very well may see the
futures market stabilize.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
