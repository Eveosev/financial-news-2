Twin blasts at a police checkpoint in
the Dagestan region of southern  Russia  killed at least 13 people
and injured more than 120, the Interfax news service reported,
citing unidentified law enforcement officials.  A car bomb exploded, drawing rescue workers to the scene
when a second blast ensued, Magomed Baachilov, secretary of the
security council in mainly Muslim region of the North Caucasus,
said by phone. The first blast was equivalent to more than 50
kilograms (110 pounds) of TNT, and the second was bigger,
Interfax said.  The North Caucasus has been the scene of separatist
violence since the collapse of the  Soviet Union . Federal forces
fought two wars against rebels in Chechnya, and violence has
been flaring in neighboring Dagestan, with a suicide bombing on
March 6 and an attack on a local polling station during the
March 4 presidential election. The government blames continuing
violence on Islamist fighters and insurgents.  Law-enforcement agencies killed 171 militants and arrested
211 in Dagestan last year, according to regional  security
council  data.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  is due to be sworn in for a
third term as president on May 7, more than a dozen years after
he ordered forces into Chechnya to re-establish federal control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
