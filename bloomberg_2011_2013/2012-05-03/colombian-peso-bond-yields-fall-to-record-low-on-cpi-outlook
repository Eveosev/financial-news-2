Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a record low, as speculation inflation will remain in
check and expectations for a lower budget deficit buoyed demand
for the fixed-rate securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 7.05 percent, according to the central bank. That’s
the lowest level on a closing basis since the debt was issued in
2009. The bond’s price rose 0.414 centavo to 123.635 centavos
per peso.  “Colombia’s fundamentals remain strong,” said Pedro
Ospina, a fixed-income analyst at Interbolsa SA, the country’s
biggest brokerage. “Prospects for a lower budget deficit and
falling inflation expectations are all good signs” that boost
demand for the bonds, said Ospina.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.45 percent in April, within
the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target, from 3.40
percent in March, according to the median estimate of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics agency
will release the monthly report on May 5.  The central government  budget deficit  this year may be 2.4
percent of gross domestic product, below the 2.6 percent target,
Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said April 27.  The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due 2013 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of
annual consumer price increase expectations, fell to 2.58
percentage points, from 4.07 on Feb. 17.  Bond Sale Plans  Colombia plans to issue new 15-year fixed-rate peso bonds
every other year to create long-term benchmark securities,
according to two traders who attended a Finance Ministry meeting
on the matter yesterday.  Colombia would also issue 20-year inflation-linked peso
debt every other year, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because the plans haven’t been made public.  The government is seeking to have benchmark fixed-rate
bonds, known as TES, due in five, 10 and 15 years and benchmark
debt in inflation-linked currency units, known as TES UVR, due
in five, 10 and 20 years, according to the people.  Colombia would reissue the 20-year inflation-linked debt in
10 and 15 years and the 15-year fixed-rate securities in five
and 10 years, the people said. An official at the  Finance
Ministry  declined to comment.  The peso closed little changed at 1,756.45 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,757.05 yesterday. It has rallied 10.4 percent this year
in the second-best performance after the Hungarian forint among
all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  In a bid to ease the local currency’s rally, the central
bank said on April 30 it will buy a minimum of $20 million daily
in the  spot market  until at least Nov. 2, extending the program
by three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
