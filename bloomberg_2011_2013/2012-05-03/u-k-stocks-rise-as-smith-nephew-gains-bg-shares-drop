U.K. stocks  advanced as  Smith & Nephew (SN/) 
Plc rallied after earnings topped estimates, outweighing worse-
than-forecast growth in U.S. service industries.  Smith & Nephew, Europe’s biggest maker of artificial hips
and knees, rose 4 percent.  BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-
largest gas producer, dropped 1.8 percent after reporting an
increase in spending.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  tumbled 4.4 percent as its
copper output decreased.  The FTSE 100 Index added 8.44, or 0.2 percent, to 5,766.55
at the close in  London , having earlier rallied as much as 0.7
percent. The gauge has  gained 3.5 percent in 2012  as investors
bet growth in the U.S. and  China  will outweigh spending cuts in
the euro area. The FTSE All-Share Index advanced 0.1 percent
today while Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 0.5 percent.  “Once again it has been poor U.S. data that has scuppered
this rally,” Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index,
wrote in e-mailed comments. “It appears that, as we move
towards non-farms tomorrow, the outlook is firmly downbeat.”  Service industries  in the U.S. expanded at a slower pace
than projected in April, a sign the largest part of the economy
may struggle to accelerate in the absence of faster job growth.
The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index
fell to a four-month low of 53.5 from 56 in March, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group’s data showed today. The median forecast of
74 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to
55.3. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  U.S. Payrolls  A Labor Department report tomorrow is forecast to show
employers added 160,000 workers to payrolls last month after a
120,000 gain in March, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  Britain’s services growth also slowed more than economists
forecast in April as companies said some customers remained
reluctant to spend, data from Markit Economics and the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed today.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  pared its advance as European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers didn’t discuss cutting
 interest rates  at their meeting this week. The ECB held its
 benchmark rate  at a record low of 1 percent, as predicted by all
46 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Smith & Nephew rose 4 percent to 629.5 pence. First-quarter
trading profit, which excludes restructuring and acquisition
costs, increased to $252 million from $241 million a year
earlier. Earnings on that basis were 19.5 cents a share,
exceeding the 19-cent  average of eight analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Burberry Rises  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the maker of high-end trench coats and
handbags, gained 1.4 percent to 1,536 pence. French rival Hermes
International SCA reported first-quarter sales that exceeded
analysts’ estimates, easing concern that luxury demand is
weakening amid slower economic growth.  James Fisher & Sons Plc (FSJ)  jumped 8.3 percent to 590 pence,
the biggest increase since March 2009. The U.K. tanker owner and
provider of marine services said sales gained more than 20
percent in the first four months of this year.  BG Group dropped 1.8 percent to 1,424.5 pence after saying
 capital spending  increased to $11.5 billion in 2012 from $10.6
billion. BG said its spending plans for 2013 grew to $12 billion
from $11.4 billion. The company also reported that net income
surged to $1.22 billion in the first quarter from $597 million
in the year-earlier period.  Antofagasta declined 4.4 percent to 1,108 pence. The copper
producer controlled by Chile’s Luksic family said first-quarter
output declined 13 percent from the previous three months
because of disruption at its Esperanza mine.  Randgold Retreats  Randgold Resources Ltd. slid 3.7 percent to 5,150 pence as
the gold producer that mines two-thirds of its output in  Mali 
said it expects instability to persist in the West African
country until elections in a year’s time.  Randgold’s first-quarter net income more than doubled to
$89.4 million after output increased and prices gained, the
Jersey, Channel Islands-based company said today.  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  fell 3.1 percent to 118 pence.
The insurer said first-quarter sales were little changed at 434
million pounds ($703 million), compared with 433 million pounds
in the same period a year earlier. That missed the 443.5
million-pound estimates of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
