Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) ,
 Canada ’s third-largest energy company by market value, said
first-quarter profit rose almost 10-fold as production increased
and the oil-sands producer benefited from higher crude prices.  Net income climbed to C$427 million ($432 million), or 39
cents a share, from C$46 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement today. Excluding
share-based compensation and changes in exchange rates, earnings
missed by 16 cents the 43-cent average of 17 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 20 percent to C$3.97 billion.  West Texas crude, the U.S. benchmark, traded at an average
of $103.03 a barrel in  New York  during the first three months of
the year, 8.9 percent more than a year earlier. Canadian Natural
pumped 395,461 barrels of oil and natural-gas liquids a day in
the period, an 11 percent gain from a year earlier.  The company operates the Horizon oil-sands project in
 Alberta  and produces crude and gas from fields in  North America ,
the North Sea and offshore West Africa. Heavy crude-oil
production reached a quarterly record, increasing 24 percent
from a year earlier to more than 120,000 barrels a day,
according to the statement.  The shares were unchanged at C$32.94 after the close in
Toronto. The stock has 19 buy and six hold  recommendations  by
analysts.  Suncor Energy Inc. and Imperial Oil Ltd. are the first and
second-largest Canadian energy companies by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
