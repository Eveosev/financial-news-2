U.S. stock futures and European shares
trimmed gains, while a rebound in the euro faded, as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the region’s economic
outlook has become more uncertain.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
were little changed at 1,398 after rallying as much as 0.4
percent earlier after U.S. jobless claims decreased more than
forecast. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was up 0.3 percent after
rallying as much as 1 percent on earnings. The euro, which had
recovered from a 0.5 percent slide, was down less than 0.1
percent at $1.3150.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
