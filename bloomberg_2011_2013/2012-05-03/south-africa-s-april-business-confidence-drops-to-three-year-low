South African business confidence fell
to the lowest level in more than three years in April as weak
 consumer spending  curbed demand in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The  business confidence index  fell to 94.3 from 95.7 in
March, the Johannesburg-based South African Chamber of Commerce
and Industry said in an e-mailed statement today. The index is
compiled from 13 economic indicators, including retail sales,
 inflation  and financial gauges, such as a stock-market index and
currency.  “Households’ income statements and balance sheets remain
weak,” Sacci said. “With high and rising unemployment and
available household resources under stress, the expectation that
household consumption expenditure should spark the economic
recovery grows weaker.”  South African economic growth will probably slow to 2.7
percent this year from 3.1 percent in 2011 as a recession in
Europe curbs demand for exports, according to government
forecasts. The economic recovery is further at risk from rising
oil prices, an appreciation of the rand this year and inflation
pressures, Governor Gill Marcus said on March 29.  Lending remains “risk-averse” and consumers are reducing
debt, the central bank said in its Financial Stability Review on
April 25. Lower demand may undermine corporate earnings, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
