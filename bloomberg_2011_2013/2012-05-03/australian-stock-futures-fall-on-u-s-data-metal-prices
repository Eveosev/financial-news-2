Australian  stock futures  dropped after
U.S. service industries expanded less than projected and as
falling commodity prices weakened the outlook for earnings at
raw-material producers. New Zealand stocks retreated.  American depositary receipts of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s largest mining company, fell 1.3 percent from the
closing share price in Sydney. ADRs of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s

it’s now catching up with the rest of the world,” said Stan Shamu, a market strategist at IG Markets in  Melbourne , a
provider of trading services in stocks, bonds and commodities.
“Commodities prices have weakened, so the likes of BHP will be
negatively affected.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent

projected in April, a sign the largest part of the economy may
