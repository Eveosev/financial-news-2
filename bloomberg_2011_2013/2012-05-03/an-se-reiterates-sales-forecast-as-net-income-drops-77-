MAN SE (MAN) , the German truckmaker
controlled by car manufacturer  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , stuck to a
forecast that sales this year will fall after first-quarter
profit plunged 77 percent.  Net income dropped to 129 million euros ($170 million) from
565 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company said
today in a statement. Earnings before interest and taxes slipped
23 percent to about 250 million euros, while revenue rose 2.7
percent to 3.8 billion euros, it said, reiterating figures
released last month.  MAN expects 2012 sales to be “slightly” lower as global
economic growth slows. Industrywide sales of trucks heavier than
16 tons fell 2.8 percent in  Europe  in the first quarter as
central bankers predict a recession in countries using the euro,
according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.  The company plans to capitalize on high economic growth in
China and  Russia  in the coming years while it faces increasing
competition in Europe, Chief Executive Officer Georg Pachta- Reyhofen said last month, adding that the truckmaker expects the
global economy to recover in 2013. Slowing Brazilian demand, as
sales retreat from a spike last year prompted by a regulatory
change, will reduce the company’s revenue there in 2012, he
said.  Volkswagen increased its stake in MAN, Europe’s third-
biggest truckmaker, to 73 percent of the common shares on April
12. The carmaker has been accumulating control of MAN to forge
closer links with  Scania AB (SCVB) , the Swedish commercial-vehicle
manufacturer that VW also controls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
