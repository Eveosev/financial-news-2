Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO) ,
owner of skyscrapers in the U.S., Canada and  Australia , promoted
Chief Executive Officer Ric Clark to chairman and named
President Dennis Friedrich as his replacement.  The changes become effective July 1, the New York-based
real estate company said in a statement today. Tom Farley,
Brookfield’s co-president, will become its sole president and
continue to serve as chief operating officer.  The changes are part of a plan by Toronto-based  Brookfield
Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A)  to publicly list its real estate business
as Brookfield Property Partners Inc. Clark, 54, will become
Brookfield Property’s CEO, according to the statement. The
company will hold Brookfield Asset’s stake in Brookfield Office,
which totaled 50 percent as of Jan. 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “I am pleased to be passing the CEO mantle to Dennis
Friedrich, who, given his past contributions and successes at
Brookfield Office Properties, is certain to do an outstanding
job,” Clark said in the statement.  The announcement was made after the close of regular U.S.
trading. Brookfield Office fell 1.1 percent to $18.34 today in
 New York . Its  shares  have gained 17 percent this year, more than
the 13 percent increase in the Bloomberg’s real estate
investment trust index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
