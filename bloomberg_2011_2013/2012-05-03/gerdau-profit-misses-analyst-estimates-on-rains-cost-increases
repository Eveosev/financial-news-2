Gerdau SA (GGBR4) ,  Latin America ’s largest
steelmaker, said first-quarter profit dropped 5.4 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates, after heavy rains in Brazil
hindered shipments and costs grew more than sales.  Net income fell to 369.6 million reais ($192.2 million)
from 390.8 million reais in the year-earlier period, the  Porto
Alegre , Brazil-based company said yesterday in a  statement .
Gerdau was expected to post profit of 435.6 million reais,
excluding some items, according to the  average of nine  analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Brazilian steelmakers, including Gerdau, are struggling as
a global glut reduces the companies’ ability to boost prices.
Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA, the second-largest
Brazilian steelmaker by output, said April 23 its first-quarter
loss more than doubled to 70.8 million reais.  Gerdau’s net sales in the quarter rose 10 percent to 9.2
billion reais, less than the 12 percent increase in the cost of
goods sold during the period. Shipments were little changed in
the quarter, while exports from  Brazil  dropped 21 percent as
rains hindered production, the company said.  “The higher cost of sales on a consolidated basis mainly
reflects higher costs in raw materials,” Gerdau said in the
statement, which was issued after the close of regular trading
in Brazil. “Greater costs were also influenced by the heavy
rains during the beginning of 2012.”  Gerdau  dropped  0.6 percent to 17.81 reais in Sao Paulo
yesterday. The stock has increased 23 percent this year, more
than the 10 percent gain for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa  Index. (IBOV)   ‘Sizeable Improvement’  Crude-steel production rose 4 percent to 4.94 million
metric tons in the quarter, the company said. Profit margins
fell to 11 percent, compared with 13 percent in 2011, it said.  “We still expect Gerdau to deliver a sizeable improvement
in the upcoming quarters,” Felipe Reis and Alex Sciacio,
analysts at Banco Santander SA in  Sao Paulo , said in a note on
April 27. “We maintain our bullish call on Gerdau, as we expect
it to rebound from expected weak operating results.”  Gerdau, which plans to invest 10.3 billion reais between
2012 and 2016, said yesterday that it will spend 838 million
reais in expanding its Acominas unit’s iron-ore production
capacity 77 percent to 11.5 million metric tons by 2014 as a way
of reaching self-sufficiency in the steelmaking ingredient. The
company is also spending 192 million reais increasing its
Colombian steel operations, it said.  (Gerdau has scheduled a  conference call  with investors
today at 2 p.m.  New York  time)  To contact the reporter on this story:
