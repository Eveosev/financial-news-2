The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 3.5 basis points to
157 as of 10:30 a.m in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  The gauge climbed 7.4 basis points in April for its second
straight monthly advance, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 2 basis points to 165 as of
8:50 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The
index rose 5.3 basis points last month, according to CMA, which
is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  Japan was closed for a public holiday. The  Markit iTraxx
Japan  index fell 5.9 basis points this year to 180.9 as of May
2, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
