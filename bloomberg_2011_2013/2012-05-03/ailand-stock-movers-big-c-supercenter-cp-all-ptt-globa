July 1996.  Big C Supercenter Pcl (BIGC)  , Thailand’s second-biggest
operator of hypermarket stores, jumped 7.4 percent to 210 baht,
on course for a record close. Big C raised about 4.2 billion
baht ($136 million) by selling 23.6 million new shares at 176
baht each in a private placement, it said in an e-mailed
statement. Investors sought more than four times the number of
shares offered, it said.  CP All Pcl (CPALL)  , the country’s largest convenience
store operator, surged 10 percent to 41.50 baht, bound for a
record close. The company’s revenue may climb as much as 15
percent in 2012 on new stores and higher domestic consumption,
Kriengchai Boonpoapichart, the head of finance and investor
relations, said by phone from Bangkok today.  PTT Global Chemical Pcl (PTTGC)  , the nation’s largest
petrochemical producer, climbed 1.4 percent to 72 baht, poised
for the highest close since March 29. The company was upgraded
to outperform, the equivalent of buy, from neutral by Paworamon Suvarnatemee, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. The company
should benefit from rising oil prices and a recovery in the
spread between high density polyethylene and naphtha, the
analyst wrote in a May 2 note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
