Myopia may affect as many as 90
percent of high school graduates in east Asian cities, with
recent evidence implicating longer schooling and less time spent
by teenagers outdoors for the increased short-sightedness,
according to a paper in  The Lancet .  The rate of myopia suggests that cities including Hong Kong
and  Singapore  face having an adult population with pathological
short-sightedness this century, according to the researchers,
who reviewed 101 papers and sources.  The condition, previously thought to be driven mainly by
genetic factors, can be addressed with optometric care, said Ian
Morgan, a professor at the  Australian National University  in
Canberra, and lead author of the study  published  in the medical
journal today.  “It poses a major challenge to ensure that all the kids
who need glasses or contact lenses get them,” Morgan said by e-
mail.  The cities discussed in the study include those in  China ,
Taiwan, Hong Kong,  Japan , Singapore and  South Korea .  In Singapore, the three major ethnic groups of Chinese,
Indian and Malays had all experienced sharp rises of short-
sightedness since 1996, suggesting similar sensitivity to shared
risk factors such as the environment, according to the study.  Short-sightedness imposes a disease burden, the paper said,
with as many as 20 percent of the population surveyed having
“high” myopia, which can lead to vision loss and blindness.  The generic drug atropine has been shown to slow the
progression of myopia, although it causes unwanted side effects,
the researchers said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
