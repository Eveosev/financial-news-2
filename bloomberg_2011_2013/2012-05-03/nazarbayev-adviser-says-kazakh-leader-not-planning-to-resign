Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev 
is “full of strength and new plans” for the country and
speculation that he may be planning to step down is groundless,
said Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, an adviser to the Kazakh leader.  “All the talk about Nazarbayev’s time drawing to a close
is pure nonsense,” Yertysbayev said in an  interview  published
in the Liter newspaper today. “There’s also the president’s
team, which will continue Nazarbayev’s strategic course under
any conditions.”  On Feb. 8, Nazarbayev fended off speculation about
declining health, saying that he was physically in the “best
possible shape.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
