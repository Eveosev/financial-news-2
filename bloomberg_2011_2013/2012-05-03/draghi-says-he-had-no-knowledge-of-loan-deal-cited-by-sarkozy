European Central Bank chief  Mario Draghi  said he was unaware of a deal that French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said was struck with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to back ECB loans to banks before the policy was
announced by the central bank.  “I didn’t know it, I didn’t know it. I knew nothing about
this agreement, so I don’t know,” Draghi told reporters today
in Barcelona when asked about Sarkozy’s account. Merkel’s
spokesman, Steffen Seibert, declined to comment when contacted
by text message.  In a campaign debate late yesterday against his Socialist
challenger,  Francois Hollande , Sarkozy took credit for the loans
that have helped ease the financial crisis. He said the key
meeting was a Nov. 24 gathering in Strasbourg, France, with
Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti.  Responding to Hollande’s criticism that he had bowed to
 Germany  throughout the crisis, Sarkozy retorted, “the stability
of economic governance? Germany didn’t want it, it was a French
request.”  “Secondly,” Sarkozy continued, “when the ECB lends at 1
percent, as you mentioned, violating the letter of its treaties,
I obtained this at the Strasbourg summit with Monti, from
Germany.” Draghi announced the unlimited three-year loans Dec.
8.  French government spokeswoman and Budget Minister Valerie Pecresse declined today to elaborate on Sarkozy’s comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
