Ratings companies are consistently
wrong on  Turkey  and have “mis-rated” the country by three to
four levels, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc chief  emerging markets 
economist Tim Ash said.  “It is two to three notches mis-rated by any fair
assessment,” Ash said in an e-mailed message to clients today
after Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  lashed out at
Standard & Poor’s today for cutting Turkey’s outlook earlier
this week. “It should be investment grade already.”  S&P on May 1 cut the outlook on Turkey’s rating to stable
from positive, reducing prospects for an upgrade over the next
12 months. The company rates Turkey BB, the second-highest non-
investment grade ranking.  Fitch Ratings , which has Turkey at
BB+, one step below investment grade, also cut its outlook on
Turkey to stable from positive in November, citing Turkey’s
current-account deficit.  “The  ratings agencies  put too much weight on external
financing risks” and “do not put enough weight on Turkey’s
willingness to pay, as proven by its track record of paying even
in times of stress,” Ash said. “I think many in the market
would have a lot of sympathy for Erdogan and Turkey.”  Erdogan called S&P’s revision of Turkey’s outlook
“strange” and “ideological” in a speech in Istanbul today.
“If necessary, we’ll make them pay with a statement that we
don’t recognize S&P,” he said, without explaining what that
entailed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
