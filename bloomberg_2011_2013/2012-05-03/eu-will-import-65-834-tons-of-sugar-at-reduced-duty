The European Union will import 65,834
metric tons of sugar at a reduced duty in the first of three
planned tenders to ease shortages in the market.  The EU accepted bids to import 58,000 tons of raw sugar for
refining at a minimum duty of 289.36 euros a ton ($379.84) and
7,834 tons of white, or refined, sugar at a minimum duty of 320
euros a ton at the tender today, the European Commission, the
blocâ€™s regulatory arm, said in an e-mailed statement.  The EU said on April 12 it would allow local producers to
sell an additional 250,000 tons of the sweetener domestically
after consumers complained about shortages.  Under EU rules, producers can sell a limited amount in the
domestic market. The rest has to be exported or put to non-food
use. Food manufacturing in the region has been disrupted by a
lack of sweetener, according to the Committee of European Sugar
Users, which represents companies including  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)   The next two tenders will take place on May 23 and June 6.
The duty charged to import raw sugar for refining is usually 339
euros a ton, according to  Roger Waite , a spokesman for the
European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
