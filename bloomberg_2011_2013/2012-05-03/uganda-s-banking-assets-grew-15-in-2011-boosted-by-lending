Total assets in  Uganda ’s banking
industry rose 15 percent in 2011 as growth in the first nine
months compensating for an economic slowdown toward the end of
the year, the East African country’s central bank said.  Total assets climbed to 13 trillion Ugandan shillings ($5.3
billion) for the 12 months through December from 11.3 trillion
shillings a year earlier, the Bank of Uganda said on its  website 
today.  “Although deposit growth slowed, credit growth was very
rapid in the first nine months of the year, an indication that
banks ‘intermediated’ a larger share of the deposits,” the bank
said.  Deposits grew 11 percent to 8.9 trillion shillings while
loans expanded 28 percent to 7 trillion shillings, the bank
said. Overall bank profitability climbed to 488.3 billion
shillings from 268.7 billion shillings, driven by a rise in
lending rates in the second half of the year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
