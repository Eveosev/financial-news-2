The Philippine peso retreated from its
strongest level since February and  government bonds  rose on
concern the global economic recovery is stalling.  The currency snapped a five-day advance after data showed
yesterday companies in the U.S. added the fewest workers in
seven months in April and the jobless rate in the euro area rose
to a 15-year high. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell
for a third successive day as a survey showed China’s non-
manufacturing industries grew at a slower pace in April.  Yesterday’s data played “a big part in creating concerns
globally,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “The peso is in
a tight range. The general trend is that the peso will be
supported in terms of economic fundamentals.”  The currency declined 0.1 percent to 42.240 per dollar as
of 9:41 a.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency touched 42.110 yesterday, the strongest level since
Feb. 9. One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-
rate swings used to price options, was little changed at 4.50
percent.  Losses in the peso may be limited at 42.50, Supaat
predicted. The  World Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund 
have forecast that growth in the Philippine economy will
accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2012 from 3.7 percent last year.  The yield on the Philippines’ 7 percent bonds due March 2017
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.725
percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
