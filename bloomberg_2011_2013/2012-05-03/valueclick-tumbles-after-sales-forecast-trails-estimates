ValueClick Inc. (VCLK) , the  Westlake Village ,
California-based Internet-advertising company, fell after
forecasting second-quarter revenue that trailed analysts’
estimates as the company reduces paid traffic in its Owned &
Operated unit.  ValueClick sank 22 percent to $16.80 at the close in New
York, the steepest decline since August 2004. The shares have
risen 3.1 percent this year.  The company’s Owned & Operated business, which includes
Investopedia.com, is winding down other properties in that unit
because they’re less profitable than others, said Carter Malloy,
an analyst with Stephens Inc. in  Little Rock ,  Arkansas .  “The O&O business has some great owned-content sites in it
-- i.e. Investopedia.com.,” Malloy said in an e-mail. Other
smaller sites “can create unnecessary volatility in revenue.”  Revenue in the second quarter will be as much as $160
million, ValueClick said yesterday in a statement. Analysts
projected $167.9 million, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We’re very surprised at the stock reaction today as
overall the fundamental story is intact,” said Malloy, who
rates the shares the equivalent of hold. “Management is
executing against the plan and the stock seems undervalued.”  ValueClick reported first-quarter profit excluding certain
items of 38 cents a share. Analysts had predicted 34 cents.
Revenue for the period rose 31 percent to $152.9 million. That
compared to analysts’ estimates of $157.9 million.  Net income rose to $21.6 million, or 26 cents a share, from
$16.9 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
