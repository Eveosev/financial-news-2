Ethanol futures rebounded from a two-
day skid in  Chicago  on concern that money-losing margins will
lead to lower production.  Futures climbed as the loss for making the fuel from a
bushel of widened to 18.54 cents a gallon, assuming one bushel
yields at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A loss of 18.81 cents on May 1 was the
steepest since at least December 2009.  “Things are pretty tight from a margin perspective,” said
Mike Blackford, a consultant with INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “Maybe the trade is fearful that we’ll get a slowdown in
production.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery climbed 0.6 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $2.181 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices are down 1 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  slipped 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.24 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
decreased 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.175, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast dropped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.305 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive decreased
0.5 cent to $2.23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
