(Corrects spelling of name in headline.)  Chinese legal activist  Chen Guangcheng 
has had a change of heart after a deal in which he agreed to
remain in China, and the U.S. is speaking with him and his
family about what to do next, U.S. State Department spokeswoman
 Victoria Nuland  told reporters in Beijing today.  “We need to consult with them further, get a better sense
of what they want to do and together, consider their options,”
Nuland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
