Dardanel Onentas Gida Sanayi AS (DARDL) , a
Turkish producer of frozen and canned food, plunged the most
since June 2008 after saying it ended stake sale talks with ADM
Capital and Turkey’s Yildiz Holding AS.  Dardanel, which trades on the  Istanbul Stock Exchange ’s
 watchlist market  for companies under heightened supervision,
fell 14 percent to 1.26 liras at the close in Istanbul.  Dardanel ended stake sale talks after failing to agree with
ADM and Yildiz on payments for its debts to banks and will
continue to seek new partners and hold talks to restructure loan
repayments, it said in a filing with the Istanbul bourse after
the market closed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
