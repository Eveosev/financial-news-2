Dropbox Inc., a provider of online
storage, is partnering with  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  to preload
its application on smartphones and tablets running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android operating system.  The app will come installed on Samsung devices distributed
worldwide later this year, said Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, head of
mobile business development at Dropbox, in a telephone
interview. The announcement of the partnership with the San
Francisco-based company is tied to a Samsung event in London
today.  Founded in 2007 by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox
has reached more than 50 million users by allowing them to
synchronize and share files on any web-enabled device. The app
is available for download from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Google online
stores and Dropbox is scouting for more partnership deals as it
seeks to expand its customer base.  “We’re working with the guys that are most relevant,”
Fjeldsoe-Nielsen said.  The company has already signed similar partnerhip deals for
its app with  HTC Corp. (2498)  and Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications,
enabling users to get increased amounts of free storage when
they buy the devices.  Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, regained the lead in
smartphones from Apple in the first quarter. The maker of the
Galaxy range of phones sold 44.5 million handsets in the first
quarter, compared with 35.1 million from Apple, according to
market researcher  Strategy Analytics .  To contact the reporter on this story:
