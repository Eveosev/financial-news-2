China ’s non-manufacturing industries
grew at a slower pace in April, a survey indicated.  A purchasing managers’  index  was at 56.1, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing  said  in a statement today in Beijing. That compares
with 58 for March. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.  Manufacturing gauges for April signaled the world’s second-
largest economy may be stabilizing after a slowdown. A PMI
backed by the government showed the fastest expansion in a year,
while a separate measure from HSBC Holdings Plc and  Markit
Economics  indicated a slowing contraction.  The federation’s non-manufacturing PMI is based on a survey
of 1,200 companies in 27 industries including transportation,
real estate, retailing, catering and software.  Lu Ting, a Hong Kong-based economist with Bank of America
Corp., previously described the gauge as low-quality data,
subject to seasonal distortions and with much less “predictive
power” than equivalent surveys for manufacturing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
