a 46.6 percent stake in  Murray & Roberts Holding Ltd. (MR)  from the
construction company’s South African parent and Trinvest, the
 Herald  reported, citing the  Zimbabwe  Stock Exchange.  The transaction took place in a “special bargain” on the
Zimbabwean bourse, with 99.8 million shares changing hands at
1.47 U.S. cents each, compared with the 7 cents the stock last
traded at, the Harare-based newspaper said.  The group of investors that bought the stake includes
Canada Malunga, the former chief executive officer of Murray &
Roberts Zimbabwe, and Paddy Zhanda, a local businessman, it
said.  Ed Jardim, a spokesman for Johannesburg-based Murray and
Roberts Holdings Ltd., didn’t immediately respond to voicemails
messages on his mobile and office phone and an e-mail requesting
