Thailand’s baht dropped for a second
day on speculation importers are stepping up dollar buying to
take advantage of a favorable  exchange rate . Bonds declined.  The currency touched a five-week high yesterday as the Bank
of Thailand said it will lift its 2012 economic growth forecast
this month, after raising it to 5.7 percent from 4.9 percent in
March. Imports gained 21.5 percent in March from a year earlier,
the most since September, official data showed on April 30, as
companies replaced machinery damaged in last year’s floods.  “We may see some importer demand for the dollar,” said
Norawit Suparinayok, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank
Pcl. Still, he added, the baht was unlikely to weaken
significantly because “Asia still has room to grow faster than
other regions.”  The baht declined 0.1 percent to 30.92 per dollar as of
3:19 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 30.68 yesterday, the strongest level since March 28.
The currency may trade between 30.75 and 31 this week, Norawit
forecast. One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-
exchange swings used to price options, was little changed at
4.52 percent.  Consumer prices rose 2.47 percent in April from a year
earlier, the least since 2009, official data show. The commerce
ministry is forecasting inflation of between 3.3 percent and 3.8
percent this year.  The Bank of  Thailand  left its benchmark interest  rate  at 3
percent yesterday. The current level is “deemed to be
appropriate in supporting a smooth recovery of economic activity
to normal levels while keeping inflation within target,” Bank
of Thailand Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said in a
statement.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.60 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
