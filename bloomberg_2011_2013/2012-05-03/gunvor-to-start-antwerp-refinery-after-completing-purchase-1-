Gunvor Group Ltd. said it plans to
start an  oil refinery  in Antwerp, Belgium, “in the next few
days,” after it completed the purchase of the 107,500 barrel-a-
day plant from Petroplus Holdings AG.  “Independent Belgian Refinery NV, as the new 100 percent
Gunvor-owned and Belgian subsidiary is named, has obtained all
the necessary permits, licenses and authorizations from the
relevant Belgian authorities in order to operate the refinery,”
the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Gunvor, a commodities trader with offices in Geneva and
 Singapore , said it will retain the entire staff of more than 200
at the Antwerp facility and will invest in improvements in
safety, operational and environmental standards. It also
completed negotiations with Petroplus Marketing AG to buy
remaining inventory at the refinery.  The Antwerp plant was one of five European refineries
operated by  Petroplus (PPHN)  until the Swiss oil refiner filed for
insolvency earlier this year. Varo Holding SA, a venture of
Vitol Group and AtlasInvest, agreed to buy its Cressier plant in
 Switzerland , Petroplus said today in a statement. Petroplus’s
facilities in France and  Germany  are still for sale.  The Swiss refiner’s Coryton plant in the U.K. is operating
under a tolling agreement with Morgan Stanley, KKR & Co. and
AtlasInvest, whereby the investors supply the crude, pay a fee
to have it processed and take ownership of the refined products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
