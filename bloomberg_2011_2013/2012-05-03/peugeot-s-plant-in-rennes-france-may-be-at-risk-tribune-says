PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ’s factory in
Rennes,  France , which employs 5,900 people, may be under threat
as work originally destined for that plant may go to other
factories, La Tribune reported, citing people at the company it
didn’t name.  The Citroen C5 replacement, known internally as X8, may be
based on the platform of an Opel model instead of a Peugeot
platform, and thus get built in an Opel factory, the newspaper
said. The Rennes plant  has focused on luxury models including
the Citroen C5 and C6 and Peugeot 508 models, and has had less
work amid weak demand for those models, La Tribune said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
