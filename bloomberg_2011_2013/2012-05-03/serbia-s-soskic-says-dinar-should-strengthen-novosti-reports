The Serbian dinar’s weakness is
temporary and the currency should strengthen if the government
that emerges from May 6 elections convinces the  International
Monetary Fund  it’s serious about fiscal tightening, Novosti
cited central bank governor Dejan Soskic as saying.  The National Bank of Serbia has sold 708.5 million euros
($931 million) since the start of the year to prevent the
weakening dinar from fuelling inflation and causing financial
instability, Soskic told the Belgrade newspaper.  Supporting the dinar has been “very expensive” and can be
conducted for a limited time, Novosti cited him as saying.  The dinar traded at 112.0294 to the euro at 10:50 a.m. in
Belgrade, 10.11 percent lower than a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
