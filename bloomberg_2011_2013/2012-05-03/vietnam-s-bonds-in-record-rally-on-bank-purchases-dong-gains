Vietnam ’s benchmark bonds rallied for
a 12th day, the longest run of gains in data going back to July
2006, on speculation banks are boosting holdings of the
securities. The dong strengthened.  “Banks have bought more bonds since they have surplus
cash,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, the Ho Chi Minh City-based
head of fixed-income trading at  Asia Commercial Bank. (ACB)  “Declines
in overnight  interest rates  in the money-market showed liquidity
has increased at banks.”  The  overnight interbank deposit fixing  dropped 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 4.54 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate has tumbled 727 basis
points this year.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bond declined eight
basis points today to 10.50 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest level
since November 2010. Three-year yields slid nine basis points to
10.46 percent.  The  dong  appreciated 0.1 percent to 20,845 per dollar as of
4 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editor: James Regan  To contact the reporters on this story:
