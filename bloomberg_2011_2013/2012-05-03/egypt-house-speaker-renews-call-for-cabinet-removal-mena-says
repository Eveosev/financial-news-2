Egypt ’s parliamentary speaker renewed
a call for the military to dismiss the Cabinet, saying ruling
generals must act because lawmakers has rejected the
government’s program, the state-run Middle East  News Agency 
reported today.  Saad el-Katatni, the speaker of parliament’s lower house,
also said an agreement would be reached next week about the
formation of a panel to draft the country’s new constitution
after political groups agreed on a framework, the Cairo-based
agency reported.  El-Katatni had announced earlier in the week that the lower
house would suspend sessions until May 6 in protest over the
failure to act on repeated calls to dismiss the government. He
later said the military had promised to announce a change within
48 hours - a deadline that passed two days ago with no action
taken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
