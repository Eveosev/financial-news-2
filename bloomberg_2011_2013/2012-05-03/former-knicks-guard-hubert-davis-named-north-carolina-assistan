Hubert Davis was named an assistant
menâ€™s basketball coach at the  University of North Carolina , the
school he helped to the 1991 Final Four.  Davis, who played 12 seasons in the  National Basketball
Association  and worked the last seven as an analyst on ESPN, was
hired to replace Jerod Haase, the Chapel Hill, North Carolina-
based school said on its website. Haase left in March to become
the head coach at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  Davis, 41, played at the university from 1988-92, when the
Tar Heels went 102-37, twice winning the Atlantic Coast
Conference tournament. The school reached the semifinals of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in 1991,
losing 79-73 to the University of Kansas.  Davis, 41, was a first-round draft pick of the  New York 
Knicks in 1992. He played with the Knicks for four seasons and
also had stints with the Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks,
Washington Wizards,  Detroit Pistons  and  New Jersey Nets ,
averaging 8.2 points and 1.7 assists per game for his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
