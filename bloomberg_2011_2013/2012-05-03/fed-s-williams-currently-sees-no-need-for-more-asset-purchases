Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
President John C. Williams said he doesn’t currently see the
need for a new round of bond buying by the U.S. central bank.  “I’m not in favor of going into QE3 at this time,”
Williams said, referring to a third round of so-called
quantitative easing. “Right now, our policy is correctly
calibrated,” he said today.  Williams, speaking as part of a panel discussion in  Santa
Barbara ,  California , said more asset purchases may be warranted
if the economy worsens.  If the expansion flags, “then it’s natural to say we need
to have more monetary stimulus in order to get us closer to our
objectives,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
