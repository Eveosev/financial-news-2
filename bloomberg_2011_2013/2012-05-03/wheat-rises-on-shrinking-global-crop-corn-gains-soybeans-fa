Wheat rose from a two-week low on
speculation that adverse weather will curb global output,
increasing demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s top
exporter. Corn advanced, and soybeans fell from a 44-month high.  The global wheat harvest may slip 3.6 percent to 675.1
million metric tons, and stockpiles will slide 6.5 percent to
182.7 million tons, the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture
Organization said today in a report. Shrinking wheat supplies
may increase demand for corn in livestock feed.  “World wheat supplies will be smaller this year, and that
will help to drive business to the U.S.,” Mike Zuzolo, the
president of Global Commodity Analysts & Consulting LLC in
Lafayette,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview. “The supply
of feed wheat for livestock has been depleted, and that should
help to boost corn demand.”  Wheat futures for July delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
close at $6.155 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the first gain in three days. Yesterday, the grain
dropped to the lowest price since April 18 on speculation that
rains will boost U.S. production. The July contract on the
Kansas City Board of Trade rose 0.4 percent to $6.33 a bushel.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to $6.145 a
bushel in  Chicago , after falling 3.6 percent the past two days.
The contract for December delivery, after the U.S. harvest, fell
0.3 percent to $5.295 on speculation that rain and warm weather
this week will boost yields. Farmers told the government in
March they intended to plant the most corn acres in 75 years.  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 0.8 percent to
settle at $14.735 a bushel on the CBOT, after yesterday touching
$15.125, the highest since July 2008. The oilseed used to make
 animal feed  and cooking oil has jumped 22 percent this year
after hot, dry weather reduced production in  South America .  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
