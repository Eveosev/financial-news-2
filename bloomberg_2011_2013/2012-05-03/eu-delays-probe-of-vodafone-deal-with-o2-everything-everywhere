Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s joint venture
with  Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s O2 and Everything Everywhere Ltd. to create
a U.K. mobile-phone payment system faces a delayed deadline to
win approval from European Union regulators.  The European Commission prolonged its deadline by an extra
17 working days to Sept. 19, according to a filing on its
website today. The EU’s merger control authority didn’t give a
reason for the extension.  Regulators last month opened an expanded investigation into
the venture, citing concerns that the companies may be able to
block competitors from offering their own “mobile wallet”
services to U.K. customers or to “degrade the quality” of
services to make them less attractive.  The U.K.’s three largest mobile operators are seeking EU
approval for the joint venture to help banks and advertisers
access services which will allow people to buy items from
groceries to clothes with their smartphones. After losing out to
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  in offering online application
stores, the companies want to accelerate the development of
additional services to drive revenue and boost smartphone sales.  O2 referred to an April statement by the three companies
that said they were “confident that an extended review will
conclude that the proposed joint venture is pro-competitive.”  Everything Everywhere declined to immediately comment and
Vodafone didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail and a call
seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
