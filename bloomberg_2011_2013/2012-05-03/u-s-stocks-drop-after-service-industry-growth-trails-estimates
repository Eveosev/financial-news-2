U.S. stocks retreated after an
industry report showed growth in  service industries  slowed in
April, trailing economists’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to
1,398.24 at 10:02 a.m. in New York.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing industries, which account for almost 90 percent of
the U.S. economy, decreased to 53.5 in April from 56 a month
earlier. Economists had predicted a reading of 55.3, according
to the median estimate in a survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
