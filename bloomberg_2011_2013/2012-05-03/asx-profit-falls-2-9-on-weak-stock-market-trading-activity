ASX Ltd. (ASX) , operator of Australia’s main
stock exchange, reported a 2.9 percent drop in profit through
the end of March as  stock trading  waned in the first nine months
of the fiscal year.  Statutory profit after tax fell to A$256.3 million ($264.2
million) in the nine months through March 31 from a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. Operating
revenue dropped 1.4 percent to A$454.2 million and cash
operating expenses rose 4.3 percent to A$104.8 million.  “Equity markets have experienced significantly reduced
trading activity compared to a year ago when market conditions
were more favorable,” ASX Chief Executive Officer Elmer Funke
Kupper said in the statement. “Despite some signs of
improvement in the U.S. and continued economic growth in  Asia ,
the  euro zone  continues to struggle economically and
politically. Investors respond cautiously to the continued
economic uncertainty as a consequence.”  ASX shares lost 2.9 percent to A$31.30 as of 10:07 a.m. in
Sydney, the most since August.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 9.4 percent this year
through yesterday amid signs that Chinese and U.S. economic
growth is intact and as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis abates.  Derivatives, ASX’s largest business, grew 9.1 percent in
the period, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
