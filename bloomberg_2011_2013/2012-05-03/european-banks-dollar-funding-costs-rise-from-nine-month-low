The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars rose from the lowest in nine months, according to a
money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 44 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12 p.m. in
London, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure was minus
43.5 yesterday, the cheapest level since July 28.  The one-year basis swap was 50.5 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 51 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another held
near a nine-month low. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference
between the borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, was
little changed at 39 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 803 billion euros ($1
trillion) with the ECB from 789 billion euros on April 30.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.70 percent from 0.704 percent.
One-week Euribor rose to 0.317 percent from 0.316 percent.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged for the fourteenth day at 0.466
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
