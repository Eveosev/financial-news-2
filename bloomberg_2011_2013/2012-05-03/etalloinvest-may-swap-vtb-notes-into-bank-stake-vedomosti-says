Metalloinvest, the Russian iron-ore
producer 20 percent-held by VTB Group, may exchange $2.48
billion in VTB promissory notes in return for the stake,
 Vedomosti  reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  The swap may be carried out by the end of the year, the
newspaper said. Metalloinvest bought VTB notes last year when
the state-controlled lender acquired its holding in the company
from billionaire Vasily Anisimov, according to Vedomosti.  Fellow billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , who controls
Metalloinvest, said April 27 that the company may study buying
back VTB’s stake and is in preliminary talks with the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
