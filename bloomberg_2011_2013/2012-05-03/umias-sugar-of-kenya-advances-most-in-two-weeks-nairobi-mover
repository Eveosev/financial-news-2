Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, gained the most in almost two weeks
after Old Mutual Securities Ltd. started coverage of the stock
with a “strong buy” recommendation.  The shares climbed 6.6 percent, the most since April 20, to
close at 5.65 shillings in Nairobi.  “Our investment premise is based on high sugar prices
prevailing in the market both locally and internationally and
the sugar deficit in the local market,” Old Mutual said in an
e-mailed note to clients late yesterday.  Higher sugar prices have been the main driver of revenue
for the company and have cushioned it from inconsistent supply
of good quality cane, Old Mutual said.  The price target was set at 9.87 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
