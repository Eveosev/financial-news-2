Schaeffler Technologies AG said it
made the bearings in the gearboxes of 376 V90  wind turbines  that
 Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  identified as needing require additional
repairs and maintenance.  “The mentioned bearings in the Vestas interim report are
from Shaeffler,” Marcus Brans, a spokesman for Schaeffler, said
today in a telephone interview. “We have some damage to the
bearings on this type of turbine.”  Vestas, the biggest wind turbine maker, yesterday said it
was providing 40 million euros ($53 million) more to pay for
extra maintenance, repair or replacement of malfunctioning
bearings in the turbines, including machines operating offshore.
The gearboxes were supplied by ZF Wind Power Antwerpen NV, it
said, without naming the bearings manufacturer.  “We will pursue all available avenues with regard to
compensation for this,” Vestas Chief Executive Officer Ditlev Engel said yesterday in an interview. He cited “unexpected
additional warranty provisions” as one of the reasons for a
wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter.  Brans declined to comment on who would pay to remedy the
faults.  “These are main rotor bearings that are fitted in the
gearbox input,” Brans said. “These are currently being
investigated by us to determine the cause of the damage and we
are closely and constructively working with our customer on this
topic. It’s an ongoing process.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
