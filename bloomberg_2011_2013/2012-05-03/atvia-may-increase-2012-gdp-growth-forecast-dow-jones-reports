Latvia may make a “substantial”
increase to its 2 percent economic-growth forecast for this year
as tax revenue has exceeded plans, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said in an  interview  with Dow Jones Newswires.  Tax revenue was 16 percent more than envisaged in the first
quarter, which may allow a revision to the growth projection
next month, Dombrovskis said, according to Dow Jones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
