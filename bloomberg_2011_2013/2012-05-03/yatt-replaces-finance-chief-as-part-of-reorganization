Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) , the chain
controlled by the Pritzker family, named Gebhard F. Rainer as
its new chief financial officer as part of a reorganization.  Rainer, currently managing director of Europe, Africa and
the  Middle East , will replace Harmit J. Singh on Aug. 15,
Chicago-based Hyatt said today in statement. After exiting the
CFO post, Singh will serve as an executive vice president
through Dec. 31, then leave the company, Hyatt said.  The reorganization includes the formation of a new real
estate and capital strategy group to focus on buying and selling
hotels and manage finances to further the company’s expansion.
Steve Haggerty, currently head of real estate and development at
Hyatt, will lead the new unit.  The company also will create three regional operations and
a global operations center “to enhance organizational
effectiveness and adaptability,” it said in the statement. The
regions will be Asia, the Americas and Europe, Africa and the
Middle East. The reorganization is scheduled for completion by
the end of September.  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) , the  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based owner of the luxury St. Regis and W brands,
last month announced management changes and said it is combining
its operations in North America and Latin America.  Hyatt plans to report its first-quarter earnings tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
