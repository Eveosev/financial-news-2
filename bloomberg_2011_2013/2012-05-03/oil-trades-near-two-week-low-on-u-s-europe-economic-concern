Oil traded near its lowest level since
February and headed for a weekly decline after a U.S. Labor
Department report showed payrolls increased less than economists
predicted last month.  Futures fell as much as 2.1 percent. Employers in the U.S.
added fewer workers than forecast in April and the jobless rate
unexpectedly declined as people left the  labor force .  “There were some fears that it could be worse, but it’s
not a great number either so everything is in standstill after
the release,” Olivier Jakob, managing director of Switzerland-
based consultant Petromatrix GmbH said by e-mail,  Crude for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
fell as much as $2.11 to $100.43 a barrel, the lowest since Feb.
14, and was at $100.66 at 1:46 p.m. London time. Prices are down
4.1 percent this week and poised for the first weekly decline in
three.  To contact the reporter on this story:
