(Corrects details of purchase in May 3 story beginning in
first paragraph.)  Faurecia SA (EO) , Europe’s largest maker of
car interiors, agreed to buy  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s car interior
business in Saline, Michigan, for an undisclosed amount to
increase its market share in the U.S.  Saline has $1.1 billion in annual sales from cockpit
modules, instrument panels, door panels and center consoles for
vehicles assembled at Ford plants, the Paris-based company said
in an e-mailed statement.  The unit is owned by Ford’s Automotive Components Holdings
unit and makes automotive interiors for vehicles such as the
F150. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford will become Faurecia’s
third-largest customer after  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  PSA Peugeot
Citroen (UG) , the company’s majority shareholder.  Faurecia said it will create a Detroit-based joint venture
with Rush Group Ltd. Faurecia would own 45 percent of the
company, which will make injection molding and assemble interior
trim components, according to the statement. Some of Saline’s
activities will be shifted to the venture, after which Saline
will focus on injection molding, skin manufacturing and foam and
have annual revenue of about $400 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
