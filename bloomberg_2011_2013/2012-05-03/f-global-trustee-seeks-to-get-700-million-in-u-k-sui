A trustee for failed brokerage  MF
Global Inc. (MFGLQ)  has begun litigation in the U.K. that aimed at
recovering $700 million in customer funds, according to a
statement.  The trustee, James Giddens, said in April that he had been
working since November to return the money and filed a claim
with the administrators overseeing the company’s MF Global UK
Ltd. unit. According to today’s statement, an application for
direction, which begins the legal process, has been filed with
the English court.  “As the advocate for all former customers of MF Global
Inc., we are prepared to fight in any jurisdiction for the
return of customer funds to their rightful owners,” Giddens
said in the statement. The trustee has said a dispute over
whether the money should have been segregated under  English law 
must be decided in a lawsuit.  Giddens, appointed under the Securities Investor Protection
Act to return funds to former customers of the failed brokerage,
has estimated there is a $1.6 billion shortfall compared to what
they are owed.  MF Global was the operating unit of MF Global Holdings
Ltd., which filed for bankruptcy in October.  The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan). The parent’s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court ,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
