Brazil ’s government will seek to limit
returns on newly opened savings accounts to 70 percent of the
nation’s benchmark  interest rate  under rules being proposed
today to pave the way for lower borrowing costs, a government
official said.
  The changes being announced by President Dilma Rousseff’s
government won’t affect existing deposits, which will continue
to earn more than 6 percent, according to the official, who is
familiar with the plans and isn’t authorized to discuss them
publicly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
