One North Sea Forties crude cargo for
loading in May was delayed by one day, bringing total deferrals
for this month to nine shipments, according to three people with
knowledge of the export program.  The shipment with parcel number F0511 will load on May 18
to May 20, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is confidential.  Most of the deferrals were made after a halt at the 200,000
barrel-a-day Buzzard oil field, the biggest contributor to the
Forties blend.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , operator of the Buzzard deposit,
started pumping from the reserve on April 25 after shutting for
four days because of a fault at the fourth platform.  Forties is one of four grades that make up Dated Brent, the
benchmark grade used to price more than half of the world’s oil.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of deferrals and cancellations of Forties cargoes
for loading in May are as follows and don’t include two lots
that were delayed from April to this month:  To contact the reporter on this story:
