Antonis Samaras, leader of  Greece ’s
New Democracy party, appealed to Greeks for the support that
will give him victory at elections on May 6 and allow him to
govern without the support of rival party, Pasok.  Teaming up with Pasok would leave his party “hostage, when
New Democracy wants to be rid of Pasok,” Samaras told thousands
of flag-waving supporters at his final campaign rally in the
capital Athens today. Such a government “isn’t in the interests
of the people,” he said.  Samaras is making his final push to close in on an outright
majority even as most polls show his party will fall short of
the 151 seats needed to govern alone. Cooperation between  New
Democracy  and Pasok, Greece’s two largest political parties and
current government partners, could collect the votes needed to
form a government and continue implementing austerity measures
required to keep bailout funds flowing.  Failure to keep to those pledges, which underpinned a 130
billion-euro ($172 billion) second rescue package earlier this
year, could threaten Greece’s place in the euro area.  “I seek your vote to change everything,” Samaras said. He
repeated pledges to put growth first on the agenda for Greece’s
recovery, slash state spending, sell assets and lower taxes to
boost an economy stuck in a fifth year of recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
