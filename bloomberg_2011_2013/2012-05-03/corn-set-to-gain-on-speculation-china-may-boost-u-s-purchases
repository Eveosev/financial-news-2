Corn rose for the first time in three
days on speculation that  China  may boost purchases from the U.S.
after drought cut the harvest in  Argentina .  Exporters in the U.S., the biggest grower and shipper, sold
130,000 metric tons of corn to unknown destinations for delivery
for the year starting Sept. 1, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Last week, the agency said exporters
sold 1.44 million tons to unknown destinations, the biggest one-
day sale since December 1994.  “China could be on a buying spree,” Lynette Tan, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by phone from  Singapore 
today. “They will not have enough corn to meet their demand.”  Corn for July delivery gained 0.1 percent to $6.1225 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:15 p.m.  London  time,
after earlier gaining as much as 0.4 percent. The price lost 3.6
percent in the past two days.  Corn production in Argentina will drop to 21.2 million tons
in the crop year that began March 1, compared with 23.6 million
tons a year earlier, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service
said in a report yesterday. Output will rebound next year,
reaching 24.68 million tons, the FAS said.  Wheat for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to $6.175 a
bushel. The grain tumbled 4.4 percent yesterday, the most in
more than three months, on speculation rain and warm weather
will boost yields in the U.S. In Paris, November-delivery
milling wheat fell 0.4 percent to 201 euros ($263.73) a ton.  Farmers in southwestern and central  Kansas  and parts of
northern Oklahoma may collect 48.5 bushels an acre this year,
according to a survey of 566 fields during the first two days of
the Wheat Quality Council’s crop tour. The record yield in
Kansas was 49 bushels an acre in 1998, according to the USDA.  Farmers in Kansas, the biggest U.S. grower of winter wheat,
may plant “a lot” of soybeans because the wheat harvest is
progressing faster than usual and the price of the oilseed has
rallied, said  Tom Leffler , owner of Leffler Commodities LLC.
Winter  wheat  is harvested in May and June, about the same time
as soybean  planting .  July-delivery soybeans dropped 0.2 percent to $14.8225 a
bushel, the third straight decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
