OAO Surgutneftegas fell to the lowest
level in more than a week after  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil
producer swung to a loss as a stronger ruble cut the value of
its foreign currency holdings.  The company’s shares retreated 0.6 percent to 28.194 rubles
by the close in Moscow, their weakest price since April 24. The
preferred stock slid 1.5 percent to 19.098 rubles.  The western Siberian-based  oil company  reported a net loss
of 4.66 billion rubles ($158 million) in the first quarter
compared with net income of 15.3 billion rubles a year earlier,
according to a financial report under Russian accounting
standards posted on its website.  The ruble advanced 9.2 percent against the dollar during
the first three months of the year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
