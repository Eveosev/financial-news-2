Lower temperatures in the South will
probably damp any increase in energy use through mid-May, said
 Matt Rogers , President of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland .  Temperatures will range from seasonal levels to to 3
degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) below normal, curbing the need
for air conditioning throughout the region and keeping energy
use down, Rogers said in a May 8-17 forecast for clients.  “There is a brief period toward the middle of next week
when slightly enhanced northern heating demand coincides with
about normal lingering cooling demand in the South,” Rogers
said. “Otherwise, the South trends tend to offset any heating
demands in the North.”  Commodities traders watch temperature forecasts to gauge
energy consumption. About 51 percent of U.S. households use gas
for heating, according to the Energy Department, while demand
from electricity generators peaks in the summer months to meet
air conditioning needs.  Temperatures in the eastern U.S. are forecast to fall while
temperatures in the West may rise to 3 degrees above normal
across most of the region and by 5 degrees in an area from
northern California eastward through Nevada and Utah, Rogers
said in his 11- to 15-day forecast for May 13 to May 17.  The normal average temperature for May 7 in  New York  is
about 60, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. It’s 55 in  Boston , 57 in Chicago, 64 in  St. Louis , 68
in Atlanta, 73 in Dallas, 75 in Houston, 55 in Seattle and 65 in
Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
