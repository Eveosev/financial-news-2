Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) , owner
of cable networks Animal Planet and TLC,  agreed to acquire
online-video startup Revision3 as part of a strategy to own and
distribute reality programming.  Revision3 , based in San Francisco, bills itself as a Web
television network, producing and distributing reality shows
like “Annie’s Bits” and “Epic Meal Time,” across sites such
as Google Inc.’s YouTube and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes. Terms of the
deal weren’t disclosed.  Discovery, which plans to report quarterly earnings May 8,
has benefited from producing its own content, Chief Executive
Officer David Zaslav, said in November. The Silver Spring,
Maryland-based company bought Betty, a London-based production
company, that month.  Founded in 2005 by Kevin Rose and led by Chief Executive
Officer Jim Louderback, a former editor-in-chief of PC Magazine,
Revision3’s programming draws about 23 million viewers every
month, according to a statement today.  Discovery rose 1.8 percent to $55.13 at the close in  New
York . The shares have risen 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
