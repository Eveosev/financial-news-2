Mexico ’s peso declined after a report
showed that service industries in the U.S. expanded at a slower
pace than projected in April, dimming the outlook for the Latin
American nation’s exports.  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 12.9715 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:47 a.m. in Mexico City, from 12.9378 yesterday. It has
rallied 7.4 percent against the dollar this year, the best
performance among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
 index  fell to a four-month low of 53.5 from 56 in March, below
the median forecast of 55.3 among economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Readings above 50 signal expansion. The U.S. buys
about 80 percent of Mexican exports.  “The news that has come out, in general, hasn’t been
good,” Rodriguez said by phone from Guadalajara, Mexico.
“We’re very tied to the  U.S. economy .”  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark bonds due in 2024 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.18 percent. The
price rose 0.43 centavo to 133.38 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
