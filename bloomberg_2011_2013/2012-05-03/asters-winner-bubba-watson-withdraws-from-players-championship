Bubba Watson, winner of last month’s
Masters Tournament, withdrew from next week’s  Players
Championship , citing a desire to spend more time with his wife
and son.  Watson disclosed his decision on his  Twitter  account.  “I’ve decided to pull out of the Players,” Watson wrote.
“I need to spend more time with Caleb and Angie.” He added
that he plans to take at least a month off.  Watson and his wife adopted a one-month-old boy two weeks
before he went on to win the Masters, his first major golf
victory. He beat Louis Oosthuizen on the second playoff hole to
take the title.  He previously withdrew from this week’s U.S. PGA Tour event
in  Charlotte , North Carolina, a tournament in which  Tiger Woods ,
Phil Mickelson and Rory McIlroy are each making their first
appearances since the Masters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
