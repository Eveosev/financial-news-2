Egypt â€™s central bank left its key
interest rate unchanged as the economy struggles after more than  a year of unrest.  The Monetary Policy Committee left the overnight deposit
rate at 9.25 percent and the overnight lending rate at 10.25
percent, the central bank said today on its website. All seven
economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated the move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
