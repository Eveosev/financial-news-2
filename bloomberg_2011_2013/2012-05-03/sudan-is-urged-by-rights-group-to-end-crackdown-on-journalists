Sudanese authorities should end a
crackdown on journalists that has intensified since the start of
uprisings in North Africa last year,  Amnesty International  said.  Reporters and editors are being charged, newspapers
confiscated and vendors prevented from distributing copies, the
London-based human-rights organization said in a statement
today.  “Although attacks against freedom of expression are not
new to  Sudan , the pattern of harassment and intimidation of
critics of the government has intensified since January 2011,”
said Erwin van der Borght, Amnesty’s Africa Director.  Sudanese authorities shut down 15 newspapers, confiscated
more than 40 newspaper editions, arrested eight journalists and
banned two from writing since May 2011, Borght said in the
statement.  Al-Obeid Murawih, spokesman for Sudan’s Foreign Ministry,
didn’t answer his phone when Bloomberg called seeking comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
