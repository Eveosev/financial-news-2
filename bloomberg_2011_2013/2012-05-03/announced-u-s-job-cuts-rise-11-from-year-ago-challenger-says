Employers in the U.S. announced more
job cuts in April than a year earlier, led by education and
government agencies.  Planned  firings  rose 11 percent to 40,559 from April 2011,
according to figures released today by Chicago-based Challenger,
Gray & Christmas Inc. The monthly average of 45,913 cuts through
the first four months of this year is lower than the full-year
average of 50,507 for 2011.  Employers in education, government, and the  consumer goods 
and transportation industries are easing the pace of dismissals
even as they continue to trim headcount, the report said.  Job
creation  in the world’s largest economy is yet to reach a level
that will make a “substantial dent” in joblessness, it said.  “We do not foresee a sudden upsurge in downsizing
activity,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of
Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “The monthly
totals remain well below levels that would signal a reversal in
the recovery.” At the same time, demand for goods and services
isn’t enough that it “warrants accelerated hiring,” he said.  Compared with March, job-cut announcements were up 7.1
percent. Because the figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal
effects, economists prefer to focus on year-over-year changes
rather than monthly numbers.  Educational institutions led firings with 9,027 planned
cuts in April, followed by 3,100 in government. Even so, the
pace of reductions in education so far this year is down 32
percent compared with the same time in 2011, and 83 percent
lower at government agencies.  Consumer Goods  Firings have waned since February at consumer goods firms -
- the biggest job-cutters this year -- and at transportation
companies, the latest data showed.  Michigan led all states with 5,094 announced job cuts last
month, followed by  California  with 4,070. Washington state had
3,329 reductions and  Pennsylvania  had 3,292.  The report also showed that employers announced plans to
 take on  11,794 workers in April compared with 12,390 the prior
month.  The Labor Department tomorrow may report tomorrow that
payrolls climbed by about 160,000 workers last month after a
120,000 increase in March, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The  unemployment rate 
probably held at 8.2 percent.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose jobs are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
