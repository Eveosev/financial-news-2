European Investment Bank President
Werner Hoyer welcomed talks about a potential capital increase
at the lender, saying that if the European Union wants to target
growth, the EIB is the best vehicle, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported.  A capital increase of 10 billion euros ($13 billion) would
mean enough private funds could be invested to finance
infrastructure projects of as much as 60 billion euros, the FAZ
cited Hoyer as saying. The EIB is already at a threshold and
will have to scale back its activities if it doesnâ€™t get a
capital increase, Hoyer told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
