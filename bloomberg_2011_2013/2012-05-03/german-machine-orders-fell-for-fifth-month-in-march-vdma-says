German plant and machinery orders
declined for a fifth month in March as domestic demand dropped,
the VDMA machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 4 percent from a year
earlier after declining an annual 16 percent in February, the
Frankfurt-based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today.
Domestic orders sank 9 percent, while export orders slipped 2
percent. In the three months through March, orders decreased 9
percent compared to the same period a year ago.  While there are signs of stabilization, “caution remains
advisable,” VDMA chief economist  Ralph Wiechers  said in a
statement. He said that orders from the euro area plunged 17
percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
