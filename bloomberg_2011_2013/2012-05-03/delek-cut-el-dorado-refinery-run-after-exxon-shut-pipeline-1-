Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK)  cut runs at its
El Dorado,  Arkansas , refinery to 69 percent of capacity after a
pipeline that supplies it was shut April 28.  Refinery throughput has been reduced to 55,000 barrels a
day, Chief Financial Officer Mark Cox said on a conference call
from Delek’s Brentwood, Tennessee, headquarters.  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ’s North Line pipeline supplies El Dorado with Gulf Coast
crudes.  The refinery runs about 35,000 barrels a day of West Texas
Intermediate-linked crude from other sources, Chief Executive
Officer Uzi Yemin said on the same call.  El Dorado has a capacity of 80,000 barrels a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Delek completed the  acquisition 
of Lion Oil Co., which owned the El Dorado refinery, in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
