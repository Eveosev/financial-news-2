Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , the gold
producer that mines two-thirds of its output in Mali, expects
instability to persist in the West African country until
elections in a year’s time.  “Elections can’t happen until there is some stability,”
Chief Executive Officer  Mark Bristow  said today in an interview
in  London . “That’s probably a year out if not a little longer.
Right now we’ve had no impact on our gold shipments or any key
supplies.”  Mali returned to a civilian-led administration last month
after three weeks of military rule following a coup on March 22
over the handling of a Touareg insurgency in the north. The
country is expected to hold a presidential election in 12
months’ time, the Economic Community of West African States said
April 26.  Shares in Randgold, which operates the Morila, Loulo and
Gounkoto mines in  Mali , slumped 22 percent in the two weeks
following the coup. Dioncounda Traore, former president of the
National Assembly, has since been sworn in as interim president
as part of a deal that saw military leaders hand power back to
civilians. The  stock  traded down 2.2 percent at 5,235 pence as
of 8:51 a.m. in London.  Randgold’s first-quarter net income more than doubled to
$89.4 million after output increased and prices gained, the
 Jersey , Channel Islands-based company said today in a statement.
Randgold produced 165,443 ounces in the period, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
