Scor SE (SCR) ,  France ’s largest reinsurer,
returned to profit in the first quarter after an increase in
premiums at its life and property-and-casualty businesses.  Net income was 104 million euros ($137 million), after a
loss of 80 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Paris-
based reinsurer said in a statement today. That missed the 125
million-euro average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The global-life unit’s embedded value, a measure of
profitability, rose 50 percent to 3.3 billion euros in 2011,
partly because of the acquisition of Transamerica Re from Aegon
NV, Scor said. The company completed the purchase of
Transamerica assets in August.  Scor fell as much as 2.1 percent in Paris trading and was
down 0.7 percent at 20.28 euros as of 10.25 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
