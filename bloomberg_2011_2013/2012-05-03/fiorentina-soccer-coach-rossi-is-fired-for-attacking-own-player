Former Fiorentina coach Delio Rossi
was suspended three months by the Italian soccer league after
attacking one of his own players during a game last night.  Fiorentina forward Adem Ljajic appeared to applaud Rossi’s
decision to substitute him in the first half of the match
against Novara, and television pictures showed the coach
responded by pushing the Serbian and aiming a punch at him.  “The TV shots demonstrate thoughtless conduct, both
violent and unexpected, whose seriousness can’t be excused
because of the emotions of a tense phase of the match,” a
statement on the Serie A website read.  Fiorentina president Andrea  Della Valle  fired Rossi hours
after the incident.  “For his own good to make him understand he has made a
mistake, I had to take this decision,” Della Valle said in a 
statement  on the club’s website. “No provocation justifies the
reaction.”  Ljajic will also be punished for his part in the incident,
Della Valle added. Fiorentina rallied from 2-0 down to draw 2-2
against Novara and go six points clear of the three-team
relegation positions with two matches remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
