Murray & Roberts Ltd. (MR)  of  South Africa 
and Trinvest Investments Ltd. of Zimbabwe sold their 47 percent
stake in Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe to Zumbani Capital, the South
African company said.  Zumbani Capital is made up of Zimbabwean investors
including the current chairman and the previous chief executive
officer of Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe, Ed Jardim, a spokesman for
 Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) , said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. Murray & Roberts Ltd. of South Africa is the
wholly owned, unlisted operating unit of Murray & Roberts
Holdings.  Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe is “heavily focused on
manufacturing and no longer fits within the existing
Construction Africa and Middle East operating platform or the
group’s Africa strategy,” Jardim said.  The Herald, a Harare-based newspaper, reported earlier
today that the stake was acquired for 1.47 U.S. cents a share,
compared with Murray & Roberts  Zimbabwe ’s last-traded price of 7
cents in a “special bargain” on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.  Regulatory approval for the transaction has been received
and Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe is expected to change its name
within the next three months, Jardim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
