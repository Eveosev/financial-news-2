European Union governments may
disregard British objections to a bank capital proposal later
this month and send a compromise deal to the European Parliament
and the European Commission for consideration, a German
government official told reporters today in Berlin.  EU finance ministers backing a compromise result after 16
hours of negotiations in Brussels today enjoyed an overwhelming
majority, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 Germany  aims to reach a consensus with the dissenting country at
a follow-up meeting of ministers on May 15, the official said,
without naming any nations.  While a decision could be taken through a majority vote if
consensus can’t be achieved, there’s sufficient backing by
member countries for  Denmark , the EU’s rotating presidency, to
start talks with the European Parliament and the commission, the
official said.  Ministers failed to reach an agreement to toughen bank
capital rules in negotiations that started yesterday in the face
of British resistance. Ministers will try to bridge differences
during the next two weeks.  Germany supports the principle of consensus-building before
resorting to formal votes, the official said. In a process known
as the  Trilogue , the European Parliament and the commission give
their inputs to and can alter positions agreed on by ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
