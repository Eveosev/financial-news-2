Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  reached an
“agreement in principle” with the staff of the North Carolina
Utilities Commission on terms for approval of its $16.7 billion
takeover of  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN) , a staff attorney said.  The companies are reviewing a written version of the
agreement, Gisele Rankin, senior staff attorney for the North
Carolina commission, said today in a telephone interview.  Duke and Progress aim to close the transaction by July 1,
although state and federal approvals are still needed. The
agreement in principle covers $650 million in customer savings
the companies have promised by coordinating power plant
operations and will assure utility customers won’t pay the costs
to comply with federal conditions, Rankin said.  Progress Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Bill Johnson ,
to become Duke’s CEO once the deal closes, told investors on a
conference call that a North Carolina settlement would come
“pretty soon.”  The agreement with staff is subject to approvals by the
North Carolina Utilities Commission and the  Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission , Rankin said.  “It is totally contingent on FERC approving everything as
filed without material change or condition,” Rankin said. “If
FERC changes a lot of stuff, it sort of blows it out of the
water.”  Progress, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, rose 1.2
percent to $54.17 at 2:27 p.m. in New York. Duke, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, rose 0.14 percent to $21.51.  To contact the reporter on this story:
