BG Group Plc (BG/)  said the start of oil and
natural-gas production from the North Sea  Jasmine field  will be
delayed to 2013, making it “a little” harder for the U.K.’s
third-largest oil company to meet a target for raising output.  “In April, the operator of the Jasmine field advised that
production startup is not now expected until 2013,” the company
said today in a statement, without giving a reason.  BG still expects to increase its output to 750,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day by the end of the year, though it became
“a little more difficult” with the delay, said Chief Executive
Officer  Frank Chapman . The company pumped 669,200 barrels a day
in the first quarter, it said today.  Jasmine, one of the U.K.’s largest discoveries since the
mid-1990s, was found in 2006 by  ConocoPhillips. (COP)  Output from the
first phase of the project was expected to begin in the fourth
quarter of 2012, the Houston-based company said in October 2010.  Peak output will be 88,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.
ConocoPhillips holds 36.5 percent of the field,  Eni SpA (ENI)  33
percent and BG 30.5 percent. Chapman said the Buzzard oil field
is producing “inline” with plans. The field was shut April 21
after a fault at one of four platforms and resumed operations on
April 25, according to  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , the operator of the deposit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
