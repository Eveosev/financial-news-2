Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) ’s loan has received
more than $2 billion in commitments from banks, according to
Wildrik De Blank, the company’s group treasurer.  The Singapore-listed commodities trader began marketing a
$1.5 billion loan to banks in general syndication in March after
hiring 17 banks to help organize the facility, according to an
e-mailed statement dated March 23.  “We’re well over $2 billion,” De Blank said at a
Euromoney Seminars’ loan conference in  Hong Kong  today. “We
brought pricing to a level we thought at least it keeps us
competitive with some of the larger players in our space, and
those players are mostly based in Europe and the U.S.”  Noble invited banks to join in syndication with commitments
of $75 million or more on a 364-day tranche of the loan for a
so-called all-in payment of 190 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate and 290 basis points more than
that rate on a three-year portion, a person familiar with the
matter said on March 23.  The company’s $1.25 billion of 6.75 percent notes due 2020
yield 7.175 percent, according to BNP Paribas SA prices on
Bloomberg.  De Blank said Noble wants to “be as diversified as we can
in terms of our funding structure.”  “We go across the spectrum in terms of the  capital markets 
and we look for alternative sources as well,” he said.
“Increasing diversity is getting important.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
