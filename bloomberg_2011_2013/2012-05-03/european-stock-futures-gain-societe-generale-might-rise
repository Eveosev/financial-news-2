European stocks were little changed as
company earnings were offset by comments from European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  who said policy makers didn’t
discuss lowering interest rates this week.  Porsche SE climbed 2.9 percent as the carmaker reported an
18 percent jump in first-quarter profit. Transocean Ltd. gained
2.5 percent as earnings topped analyst estimates. Banks dropped.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.1 percent to 257.53 at
the close in London, after earlier advancing as much as 1
percent and falling as much as 0.4 percent. The volume of shares
changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 1.2 percent lower than the
average of the last 30 days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The ECB was the main focus for many today,” said Ioan Smith, a strategist at Knight Capital Europe Ltd. in  London .
“The hope would have been for some sort of quick fix, but he
said nothing that suggested they would change their view. The
ECB rate path appears to be firmly on hold for the forseeable
future.”  The central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record low of 1 percent today as predicted by every  economist  in
a Bloomberg News survey. Stocks erased gains after Draghi,
speaking at a press conference in Barcelona, said the central
bankers did not talk about cutting rates today.  ‘Downside Risks’ Prevail  While the ECB still expects a gradual economic recovery
this year, “downside risks” prevail and the outlook has become
“more uncertain,” Draghi said.  National benchmark indexes slid in 10 of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 lost 0.1 percent, the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent and  Germany ’s DAX slid 0.2
percent.  Gains were also limited today after the U.S. Institute for
Supply Management’s index of  non-manufacturing industries  cooled
to 53.5 from 56 in March. That fell short of the  median
economist projection  of 74. Readings greater than 50 signal
expansion.  A separate release showed fewer Americans than forecast
filed  applications for unemployment benefits  last week.
Tomorrow’s Labor Department report tomorrow may show employers
added 160,000 new jobs in April, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Porsche climbing 2.9 percent to 46.99 euros after the
company, jointly owned by  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and the Porsche SE
holding company, said  first-quarter profit  jumped 18 percent as
deliveries of the revamped 911 and Panamera surged. The
preferred shares of Volkswagen added 1.8 percent to 145 euros.  Transocean Shares Gain  Transocean gained 2.5 percent to 46.85 Swiss francs after
the world’s largest offshore-rig contractor reported  first-
quarter profit  that beat analysts’ estimates as maintenance
costs rose less than some analysts had projected.  UniCredit SpA led banks lower, falling 4.7 percent to 2.70
euros.  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , which today reported earnings that
topped analyst estimates, lost 4.2 percent to 17.27 euros and
Commerzbank AG slid 3.6 percent to 1.54 euros.  Elsewhere,  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/)  jumped 4 percent to 629.5
pence.  Europe ’s biggest maker of artificial hips and knees said
 first-quarter sales  for its wound business added 5 percent to
$240 million and revenue from surgical devices rose 3 percent.  Hannover Re  added 3.8 percent to 46.94 euros, snapping four
days of losses. The world’s fourth-biggest reinsurer, said
first-quarter profit rose almost fivefold from a year earlier.  TGS Nopec Geophysical ASA climbed 6.9 percent to 175
kroner, the highest price since its initial public offering in
1997. The Norwegian surveyor of oilfields beat analysts’
projections with its first-quarter earnings.  Delhaize, HeidelbergCement Fall  Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  slumped 10 percent to 32.30 euros, its
lowest price since July 2003. The retailer reported  first-
quarter earnings  that missed analyst estimates as a decline in
same-store sales accelerated.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  fell 3.4 percent to 41.11 euros. The
world’s third-largest maker of cement reported first-quarter
operating profit that missed analyst estimates as higher energy
costs coincided with colder-than-normal temperatures in Germany.  Of the 171  Stoxx 600 companies  that have reported results
since April 10, 95 have posted quarterly earnings that beat
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
