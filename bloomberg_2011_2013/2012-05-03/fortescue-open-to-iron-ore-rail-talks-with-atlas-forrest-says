Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
Australia’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, said it’s open to
talks with  Atlas Iron Ltd. (AGO)  to co-operate on rail haulage after
the smaller rival announced a study to build its own track.  “If we’re invited to have a look at a proposal, we would
certainly be honored to receive that invitation and take it very
seriously,”  Andrew Forrest , chairman of the Perth-based
company, said today after a meeting in Sydney. “We have a
railway line in the vicinity.”  Atlas and haulage company QR National Ltd. last month
signed an initial accord to consider building the railroad in
northern Australia’s Pilbara region, which Macquarie Group Ltd.
estimates may cost $1.5 billion. Producers including Fortescue
and Atlas are boosting ore output and expanding ports and rail
to meet growing demand in  China , the biggest consumer.  Fortescue gained 0.5 percent to A$5.62 at 11:39 a.m. in
Sydney trading while Atlas fell 4.0 percent.  Fortescue, which is doubling its main line to  Port Hedland 
as part of a $8.4 billion  expansion  to nearly triple output to
155 million metric tons, may benefit from swapping rail and port
capacity with Atlas, Macquarie said in a April 27 report.  “Should they build another huge railway line when there’s
already an independent operator - by all means, that’s the
market place,” said Forrest. “But there’s certainly an
existing rail and an existing port.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
