Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe & Jack
investors will have to bide their time as a securities-law case
works its way through federal court in Philadelphia, after a
judge denied their bid to expedite document-gathering.  Three shareholders of the Philadelphia-based auto-parts
company sued in U.S. District Court, and 10 suits were filed in
the  Pennsylvania  Court of Common Pleas, challenging the fairness
of a $1 billion, $15-a-share agreement in January to sell the
company to venture capital firm Gores Group LLC.  Plaintiffs’ lawyers haven’t shown that delaying so-called
discovery “will cause them undue prejudice,” Senior District
Judge William H. Yohn Jr. wrote yesterday in an opinion.  Pep Boys fell more than 22 percent on May 1 after Los
Angeles-based Gores asked the company to delay a May 30
shareholder vote on the deal because first-quarter results were
below analyst estimates.  The vote was still scheduled. Shares fell 3 cents to $11.17
at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  Brian Zuckerman, general counsel for  Pep Boys , declined to
comment on the ruling.  The federal case is Dipple v. Pep Boys, 12-cv-1415, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporters on this story:
