France  raised 7.43 billion euros
($9.76 billion) through a debt sale today, close to the maximum
it sought. Borrowing costs fell.  France had targeted 7.5 billion euros in securities. It
sold 3.32 billion of benchmark 10-year bonds at an average yield
of 2.96 percent compared with 2.98 percent in the last auction
on April 5. Spain today sold 2.52 billion euros of bonds,
compared with a maximum target of 2.5 billion euros at an
auction in Madrid today. Yields jumped.  The French sale is last before the nationâ€™s presidential
election on May 6. President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is trailing in the
polls behind Socialist challenger Francois Hollande.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
