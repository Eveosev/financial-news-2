Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the biggest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, gained the most since October
after posting its largest profit since 2007.  Allstate  jumped  5.8 percent to $34.82 at 9:36 a.m. in New
York, leading the 24-company KBW Insurance Index. The insurer’s
shares climbed 20 percent this year through yesterday.  Net income  rose to $766 million, or $1.53 a share, from
$524 million, or 98 cents, a year earlier, as catastrophe costs
declined and policy sales increased, the Northbrook, Illinois-
based firm said yesterday in a statement. Allstate booked $259
million in disaster costs, compared with $333 million a year
earlier. Sales rose after Allstate purchased online car-
insurance seller Esurance and raised premiums for some coverage.  “We see the firm’s unique, best-in-class pricing power as
the primary driver that will drive earnings and sentiment for
this now more fairly valued, but still unloved, stock,”
analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein led by Josh Stirling wrote in a
research note today. The analysts rate the shares “outperform”
and raised their price target to $38 from $34.  Premium revenue in Allstate’s property and liability
business rose to $6.63 billion from $6.45 billion a year earlier
as the company added Esurance customers. The insurer made 7.9
cents for every premium dollar in its property and liability
coverage compared with 5.1 cents a year earlier.  Allstate booked lower catastrophe costs in the quarter, in
part, because it determined it had set aside more money than
necessary for claims in prior quarters, according to an April 19
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
