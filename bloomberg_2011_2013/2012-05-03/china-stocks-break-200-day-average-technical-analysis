Chinese stocks are showing “signs of
life” after the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  exceeded its average
level from the past 200 days for the first time in almost a
year, according to Bespoke Investment Group.  The Shanghai Composite reached 2,438.44 yesterday, topping
the 200-day  moving average  of 2,435.49 for the first time in 229
trading days. This marked the index’s third-longest streak below
the moving average since 1990, Bespoke wrote in a report
yesterday. The prolonged period below the level “clearly
illustrates how weak  China ’s market has been over the past
year,” Bespoke said.  The benchmark gauge has gained 11 percent in 2012, after
falling a combined 33 percent in the previous two years, on
speculation the central bank will ease monetary policy to boost
economic growth. The Shanghai index last broke above its 200-day
moving average on January 27, 2011.  “In general it’s a good sign to see it happen,”  Justin Walters , Bespoke’s co-founder, said in a telephone interview.
“After being down in the doldrums and underperforming the rest
of the world for so long, there are finally signs of life coming
out of China.”  Premier  Wen Jiabao  is trying to cut reliance on exports and
increase domestic consumption. He said on March 5 that policy
makers reduced their growth target to 7.5 percent from the 8
percent goal in place since 2005. Growth in China, the world’s
biggest user of copper and second-biggest consumer of oil, helps
drive earnings growth for commodity producers.  No Distinct Trend  There was no distinct directional trend in the prior
periods immediately after the Shanghai Composite climbed above
the 200-day threshold following a prolonged slump below, Walters
said.  Following the 213-day  streak  that ended in June 2002 and
the 307-day streak ending in September 2005, the index fell 5.2
and 8.2 percent, respectively, over the next three months. The
benchmark surged 26 percent in that same period following a 278-
day streak ending in March 2009, Bespoke data show.  Market conditions and investor sentiment ultimately will
determine how the index responds to rising above the 200-day
moving average, according to Walter.  “Investors in general will treat the event more as a
positive than a negative, at least based on the technicals,” he
said. “As long as the U.S. and China can continue to do
relatively well, things should hold up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
