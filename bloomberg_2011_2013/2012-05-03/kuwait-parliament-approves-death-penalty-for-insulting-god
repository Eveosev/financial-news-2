Kuwait ’s parliament approved a law
imposing the death penalty on any Muslim who insults God, his
prophets, messengers, Prophet Mohammad’s wives or the Koran, in
any form of expression, if they don’t repent.  The bill, which adds articles to Kuwait’s penal code, was
passed today by 40 lawmakers, including all Cabinet ministers
present, and rejected by five Shiite Muslims as well as one
liberal lawmaker.  “Islam is a religion of tolerance, peace and acceptance,
but that doesn’t mean it should be stepped on,” lawmaker Ali
al-Deqbasi told the house before the vote. AbdulHamid Dashti,
who voted against the bill, said the law “should be broadened
to criminalize those who insult all beliefs and faiths.”  According to the law, judges must give defendants the
option of repenting, which, if taken, reduces the sentence to at
least five years in prison and a fine of 10,000 dinars
($36,000). Non-Muslims will be sentenced to 10 years in prison
if convicted of violating the law, which will take effect after
signed by the emir and then published in the Official Gazette
within a month of parliamentary approval.  To contact the reporters on this story:
