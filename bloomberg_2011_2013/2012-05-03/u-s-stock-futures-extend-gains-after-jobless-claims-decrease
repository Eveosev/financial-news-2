U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after initial jobless claims decreased more than forecast
last week, bolstering optimism in the economy a day before the
government’s monthly employment report.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
rose 0.4 percent to 1,402.5 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York .  Jobless claims fell by 27,000 to 365,000 in the week ended
April 28, a one-month low, from a revised 392,000 the prior
period, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. The
median forecast of 46 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for 379,000 applications.  U.S. stocks fell yesterday, dragging the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  down from the highest level since 2007, as a
private report showed companies added fewer jobs than projected
and euro-region data showed unemployment rose to a 15-year high.
The  S&P 500  is up 12 percent in 2012 and is trading 1.2 percent
below an almost four-year high reached last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
