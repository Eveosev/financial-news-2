Fewer Americans than forecast filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week, easing concern
the job market was taking a turn for the worse.  Jobless claims  fell by 27,000 to 365,000 in the week ended
April 28, a one-month low, from a revised 392,000 the prior
period, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington . The
 median forecast  of 46 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for 379,000 applications.  The plunge in dismissals makes it more likely that the
surge over the past three weeks was caused by the timing of the
Easter holiday rather than a deterioration in employment.
Federal Reserve policy makers last week said that while labor-
market conditions have improved, the unemployment rate “remains
elevated,” helping explain why they stuck to a plan to hold
borrowing costs close to zero through 2014.  “The numbers allay some concern that the labor market is
deteriorating,” said  Brian Jones , a senior U.S. economist at
 Societe Generale  in  New York , who accurately projected the
decrease in claims. “The Easter argument held.”  Stock futures climbed after the report. The contract on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in June increased 0.3
percent to 1,401.8 at 8:44 a.m. in New York.  Payroll Forecast  A report tomorrow may show the U.S. added 160,000 jobs in
April, compared with a gain of 120,000 the previous month,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The jobless rate held at a three-year low of 8.2
percent, the survey showed.  The productivity of U.S. workers fell in the first quarter,
indicating businesses are reaching the limit of how much
efficiency they can wring from the workforce, another report
from the Labor Department also showed today. The  measure  of
employee output per hour declined at a 0.5 percent annual rate,
after a 1.2 percent gain in the prior three months.  Estimates for jobless claims in the Bloomberg survey ranged
from 360,000 to 400,000. The Labor Department revised the
previous week’s figure from 388,000. Last week’s plunge was the
biggest since May 2011.  A Labor Department spokesman said there was nothing unusual
in the data last week. The government often has difficulty
adjusting the figures for seasonal variations around holidays
like Easter that shift from year to year.  Average Climbs  The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure than
the weekly figures, climbed to 383,500 last week from 382,750.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
fell to 3.28 million in the week ended April 21 from 3.33
million.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
62,300 to 3.08 million in the week ended April 14.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 2.6 percent in
the week ended April 21. Thirty-six states and territories
reported a decrease in claims, while 16 reported an increase.
These data are reported with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Fed’s View  “Labor market conditions have improved in recent months;
the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated,” the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said in an April 25 statement.
“The committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over
coming quarters and then to pick up gradually. Consequently, the
committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline
gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its
dual mandate.”  Companies like  H&R Block Inc. (HRB) , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, are still cutting workers. The  Kansas City , Missouri-
based firm said in a statement last week it plans to eliminate
350 jobs and close about 200 company-owned offices as part of a
realignment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
