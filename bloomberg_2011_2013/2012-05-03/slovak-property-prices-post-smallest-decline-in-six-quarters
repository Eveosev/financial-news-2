Slovak residential property prices
fell by the least in six quarters as the euro-area countryâ€™s
economy weathers the slowdown among its richer peers, the
central bank said.  The average price for residential property declined to
1,235 euros ($1,625) per square meter (10.8 square feet) in the
first three months of 2012 from 1,236 euros in the fourth
quarter of last year, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based Narodna
Banka Slovenska  said  today on its website. Prices fell 2.3
percent on the year.  The Slovak economy will probably grow 1.2 percent this
year, the European Commission forecasts, compared with a
stagnation in the neighboring  Czech Republic  and a recession in
the euro region. Still, the average price of residential
property is 20 percent down from a peak reached in the second
quarter of 2008.  Prices varied from 620 euros a square meter in the Nitra
region of western Slovakia, to 1,658 euros in the capital,
Bratislava.  To contact the reporter on this story:
