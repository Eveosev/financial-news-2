The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of 24
commodities declined 0.3 percent to 676.86 at 5:13 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.2 percent to 1,565.084.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded little changed after sliding the most in two
weeks as worse-than-forecast employment data underscored
weakness in the global economy and U.S. crude stockpiles
increased to the highest level in 21 years.  Crude for June delivery was at $105.07 a barrel, down 15
cents, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 9:11 a.m.  London 
time. The contract yesterday slid 94 cents, the most since April
18, to $105.22. Front-month oil has risen 6.3 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures rebounded after the biggest drop in
almost two months in New York on forecasts that moderate weather
may limit demand from  power plants .  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
$7.60 to $82.38 a metric ton at 11:15 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread , a
measure of processing profit, is the narrowest since Jan. 17.  Naphtha swaps for June dropped $7.30, or 0.7 percent, to
$973.20 a ton, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. ,
a broker. Prices declined for a sixth day, the longest losing
streak since August.  Gasoil, or diesel, swaps for June decreased $1.31, or 1
percent, to $132.02 a barrel, according to PVM. Prices ended a
six-day rally, the longest stretch since October.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, the Asian marker, lost 52
cents to $17.04 a barrel, PVM data showed. The difference, also
known as the crack spread, narrowed the most since March 30.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for a third day in London on concern slowing
growth in  Europe  will strengthen the dollar and cut demand for
the metal as an alternative asset.  Bullion for immediate delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$1,644.55 an ounce by 9:32 a.m. in London. Prices reached
$1,642.75, the lowest since April 26. June-delivery futures were
0.5 percent lower at $1,645.40 on the Comex in  New York .  BASE METALS  Copper declined for a second day, extending yesterday’s
biggest fall in more than a week, after weak economic data
raised concern demand may falter.  The metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.5
percent to $8,263.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $8,279.25 at 3:46 p.m. Shanghai time. It lost
1.6 percent yesterday, the most since April 23. July-delivery
copper on the Comex dropped 0.3 percent to $3.7765 per pound.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn is poised to climb on speculation that  China , the
second-largest consumer, may boost purchases from the U.S. after
drought cut the harvest in  Argentina .  July delivery corn gained as much as 0.4 percent to $6.14 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after losing 3.6 percent
in the past two days. It traded unchanged at $6.115 a bushel as
of 2:41 p.m. Singapore time.  Wheat for July delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent to
$6.1975 a bushel, before trading at $6.1875. The grain tumbled
4.4 percent yesterday, the most in more than three months, on
speculation rain and warm weather will boost yields in the U.S.  July-delivery soybeans dropped 0.2 percent to $14.8225 a
bushel, after climbing 0.3 percent. Exporters in the U.S. sold
204,000 tons of soybeans to unknown destination for delivery in
the marketing year beginning Sept. 1, and 30,000 tons of  soybean
oil  to China for delivery in the 2011-2012 marketing year, the
USDA said yesterday.  Palm oil  declined for a third day, dropping to the lowest
level in almost six weeks, as favorable weather in the U.S. is
expected to aid soybean planting, easing concern that global
edible-oil supplies may drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
