Bank of America Corp . agreed to sell
Hearst Tower in downtown Charlotte,  North Carolina , for $250
million to  Parkway Properties Inc. (PKY)  as part of the bank’s plan to
cut costs.  Bank of America will lease back 322,000 square feet (30,000
square meters) in the 972,000-square-foot building, Parkway said
today in a statement. The tower is 94 percent leased and the
bank’s new agreement will run through March 2022, the Orlando,
Florida-based real estate company said.  Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets,
said in February it may sell all its offices as part of its
efforts to reduce expenses, sparing only its headquarters
building in Charlotte and Bank of America Tower at 1  Bryant Park 
in  Manhattan . The 46-story Hearst Tower,  Charlotte ’s fourth-
tallest building, opened in 2002, according to the property’s
website.  “It is a compelling real estate opportunity -– a trophy
building, with a stable tenant base, in a submarket with
improving fundamentals, at an attractive basis,” Jim Heistand,
Parkway’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  In March, Bank of America sold 100 Federal St. in downtown
Boston to Boston Properties Inc., the largest U.S. office real
estate investment trust, for $615 million. The bank leased back
787,000 square feet at the 1.3 million-square-foot tower.  TPG, a closely held investment firm with $49 billion under
management, is making a $200 million investment in Parkway that
will be used to finance the Hearst Tower purchase, according to
the statement. TPG agreed to buy shares of Parkway for $11.25
each, 12 percent more than the 30-day trailing average closing
price of Parkway’s stock.  Parkway fell 0.9 percent to $9.96 today in  New York . The
shares have fallen 41 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
