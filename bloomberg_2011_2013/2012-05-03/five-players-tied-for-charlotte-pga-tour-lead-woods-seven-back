Americans Ryan Moore,  Stewart Cink  and
Webb Simpson are tied for the lead heading into today’s second
round of golf’s Wells Fargo Championship at 7 under par.  Tiger Woods, making his first start on the U.S. PGA Tour
since last month’s  Masters Tournament , is six shots back after
shooting a 1-under 71.  Rickie Fowler, John Senden, D.A. Points,  Brian Davis  and
Patrick Reed are a shot back of the leaders after shooting 66 in
the first round at the Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North
Carolina.  Phil Mickelson, who will be inducted into the  World Golf
Hall of Fame  next week, tied Woods at 1 under. The 41-year-old
left-hander had four birdies, a bogey and a triple-bogey over
his final nine holes after playing the opening nine holes in 1
under.  Rory McIlroy, who along with Woods and Mickelson is playing
for the first time since the Masters, is 3 under after the first
round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
