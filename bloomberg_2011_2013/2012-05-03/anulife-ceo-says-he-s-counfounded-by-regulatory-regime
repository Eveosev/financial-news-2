  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  Chief
Executive Donald Guloien said he is “confounded” by regulation
placed on Canadian insurers.  “I am confounded by some of the onerous and difficult
constraints imposed by our regulations and accounting regime,”
Guloien said, according to speaking notes ahead of the insurer’s
annual meeting in Toronto.  “I fear that an overly conservative regulatory and
accounting regimen serves to depict Canadian life insurers as
being far weaker than our global counterparts,” Guloien said.
Guloien also said “few other companies are as well-positioned”
as Manulife to expand in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
