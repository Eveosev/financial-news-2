Premier League soccer fans in the U.K.
will be able to watch a record 154 live matches from the 2013
season.  The increase from 138 games under existing contracts forms
part of a new tender process for broadcast rights by soccer’s
richest domestic competition. The league had considered
scrapping a sale of domestic rights after a court ruled U.K.
viewers can buy decoders from European countries where games are
available cheaper.  The current three-year  agreements  are worth 1.78 billion
pounds ($2.88 billion). BSkyB Plc has the right to broadcast 115
matches each season from 2010 to 2013, while  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s
ESPN shows the remaining 23 games.   Under the new tender, 154 games will be split into seven
packages, comprising five of 26 games and two of 12 each.   “No single buyer will be allowed to acquire more than 116
matches,” the league said in a statement. “This creates a more
attractive and compelling offering for both broadcasters and
fans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
