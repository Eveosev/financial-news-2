Jered Weaver of the Los Angeles Angels
pitched the second no-hitter of the Major League Baseball season
in a 9-0 win over the  Minnesota Twins .  The 10th no-hitter in franchise history comes nine months
after Ervin Santana achieved the feat July 27 for the Angels in
a 3-1 win over the  Cleveland Indians .   Chicago White Sox right-hander Philip Humber threw a
perfect game April 22, the 21st in major league history. Roy
Halladay pitched the last perfect game in the National League,
in a 1-0 win for the Philadelphia Phillies against the Florida
Marlins on May 29, 2011. Dallas Braden achieved the feat in the
American League 20 days before Halladay in a 4-0 win for the
 Oakland Athletics  against the Tampa Bay Rays.  It’s the first no-hitter given up by the Twins since they
faced David Wells of the  New York  Yankees May 17, 1998, when
they lost 4-0.  Santana’s no-hitter was the third and final one last
season.  Texas Rangers President and Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan holds
the major league record with seven no-hitters. Ryan got four of
his no-hitters for the Angels, with his third coming against the
Twins, on Sept. 28, 1974.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
