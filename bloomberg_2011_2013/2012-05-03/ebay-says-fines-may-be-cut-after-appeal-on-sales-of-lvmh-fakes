EBay Inc. (EBAY)  said it may win a reduction
in fines after  France ’s high appeals court overturned part of a
2010 decision holding it responsible for sales of counterfeit
 LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  goods on its website.  The Cour de Cassation today referred the case back for
retrial by a Paris court of appeal. An earlier appeals court had
maintained a Paris commercial court’s finding that EBay didn’t
do enough to stop the sale of fakes, while slashing fines
imposed by the tribunal.  “We are pleased that the ability of lower courts to impose
an injunction against EBay has been lifted and that the damages
against EBay are likely to be further reduced,” the world’s
largest Internet marketplace said in an e-mailed statement.  EBay has been in a multi-year dispute with brand owners
over how vigilant it is in policing its site for fakes. The  San
Jose , California-based company already claimed victory in 2010
when the appeals court cut the fines imposed by the commercial
court in 2008 to 5.6 million euros ($7.4 million) from almost 40
million euros.  LVMH, the world’s largest maker of  luxury goods , also
called that decision a win, for maintaining the earlier finding
that EBay was liable for fakes sold between 2001 and 2006 on its
site.  Hugues Schmitt, an external spokesman for LVMH, said the
company had no comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
