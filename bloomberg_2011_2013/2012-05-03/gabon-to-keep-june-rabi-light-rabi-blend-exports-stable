Gabon will keep its exports of Rabi
Light and Rabi Blend crude oil for June unchanged from May at
three cargoes each, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Exports of Rabi Blend comprise two 800,000-barrel cargoes
and one shipment of 650,000 barrels, while the Rabi Light
consignments are for 650,000 barrels each, the plan shows.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  operates the Rabi Blend field, while
 Total SA (FP)  runs the Rabi Light project.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
