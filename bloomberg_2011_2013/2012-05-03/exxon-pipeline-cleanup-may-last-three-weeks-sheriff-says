Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s cleanup of its 22-
inch  North Line  that leaked 1,900 barrels of oil in Louisiana
April 28 is likely to take another two to three weeks, the
parish sheriff said.  “It may have been a pipe failure,” said Beauregard
“Bud” Torres, sheriff of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana.
“Some of these pipelines have been in existence as long as 50
years.”  Exxon is excavating at the point of the rupture, Torres
said. He said 70 to 100 people are at work on the cleanup near
Torbert, Louisiana, 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of  Baton
Rouge .  “Responders are making significant progress as cleanup
operations continue,” Rachael Moore, a spokeswoman for Exxon in
Fairfax, Virginia, said in an e-mail today. “We are working
cooperatively with federal, state and local regulatory
agencies.”  The pipeline carries oil from the Gulf Coast to refineries
that can process more than 700,000 barrels a day and to Sunoco
Logistics Partners LP’s Mid-Valley Pipeline, which moves crude
from Louisiana to Ohio, according to Exxon’s website.  Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK)  cut runs at its El Dorado, Arkansas,
refinery to 55,000 barrels a day, or about 69 percent of
capacity, after the pipeline was shut, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Cox said on a conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
