-- What’s at stake: Voters will decide whether to give Greece’s
two major parties, the Socialist Pasok party and the
conservative New Democracy party, enough support to form a
coalition in the 300-seat parliament. Faced with the prospect of
more budget cuts to keep international funds flowing, many
voters are backing small anti-bailout parties that promise an
end to austerity measures. Greece’s failure to meet targets
could mean a default and an exit from the euro.  Germany :
-- Regional parliament election in Schleswig-Holstein
-- About 2.24 million state residents are eligible to vote
-- Polls open: 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
-- Exit polls: 6 p.m.
-- Final results: late on May 6
-- What’s at stake:  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian
Democratic Union risks losing control of the state should the
opposition Social Democrats and the  Green Party  succeed in
forming a coalition. Should such a coalition not materialize,
the CDU and SPD could form a so-called grand coalition.  Italy:
-- Local elections on May 6 and May 7
-- About 10 million people are eligible to vote
-- Polls open: 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on May 6; 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on
May 7
-- Exit polls: about 3 p.m. on May 7
-- Final results: late on May 7
-- What’s at stake:  Democratic Party  expected to emerge as the
winner of the elections for town councils across Italy, followed
by Silvio Berlusconi’s People of Liberty Party. The  Northern
League  is projected to lose votes after an investigation into
the misuse of party funds led to the resignation of its leader,
 Umberto Bossi . The 5 Star Movement of ex-comic actor Beppe Grillo may siphon off league support and could win as much as 8
percent of the vote, polls indicate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
