Russia, the worldâ€™s largest oil
producer, will export 15 shipments of gasoil and nine of  fuel
oil  this month from the port of Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea , a
loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  Russia will export 287,400 metric tons of gasoil in May,
according to the plan. All but one of the fuel oil lots are for
35,000 tons, the data show.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
