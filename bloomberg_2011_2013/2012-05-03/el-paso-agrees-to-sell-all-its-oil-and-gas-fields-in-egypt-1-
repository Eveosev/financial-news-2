El Paso Corp. (EP) , the pipeline company
being bought by  Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) , has agreed to sell its oil
and natural-gas fields in Egypt to an unidentified buyer,
reducing its first-quarter results by about $62 million.  El Paso didn’t disclose terms of the deal, reached on April
30, according to a statement today. The transaction resulted in
a non-cash charge of about $62 million, the Houston-based
company said. Its exploration and production unit is being sold
to a group led by  Apollo Global Management (APO)  for $7.15 billion.  El Paso has an interest in two blocks in Egypt totaling
774,000 acres, the size of the state of Rhode Island. The blocks
didn’t produce oil or gas in 2011, according to its annual
report. The company sought government approval for a partner in
one of the blocks in 2011, but was delayed “due to political
unrest.” Egypt’s long-time president,  Hosni Mubarak , was forced
from office in 2011 by pro-democracy protests.  Kinder Morgan intends to keep El Paso’s gas pipelines. The
transaction is worth about $23.8 billion and is expected to
close by the end of this month. Most of El Paso’s oil and gas
production comes from onshore fields in the U.S.  Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, declined to
comment beyond the statement, according to an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
