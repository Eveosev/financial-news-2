Hong Kong stocks  retreated from a
seven-week high with  China Construction Bank (939)  Corp. leading the
decline as Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund sold $2.4 billion
of mainland lenders’ shares. Stocks also fell as unemployment in
 Europe  climbed to a 15-year high.  China  Construction Bank slid 3.1 percent on a report
Temasek Holdings Pte. sold $1.6 billion of the lender’s shares.
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that gets about 80 percent of
sales in Europe, fell 4.3 percent. New World Development Co. led
property companies down after the government sold land in one of
the city’s most exclusive areas for less than estimated.  “Temasek is not selling on dips, they are selling on rises,
so I think people will not be too bearish on this,”  Alex Wong ,
a director at Ample Capital Ltd., which oversees HK$1 billion
($129 million), said in a telephone interview. He noted that
fundamentals of the banks had not changed. “I think the
correction will not be too deep.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.3 percent to 21,249.53, snapping

hands, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Hang Seng has fallen about 2 percent from this year’s
peak on Feb. 29 as China targeted the slowest economic growth
since 2005 and on renewed concern the euro debt crisis will
