Freddie Mac (FMCC) , the mortgage-finance
company operating under U.S. conservatorship, will seek $19
million in Treasury Department aid after a first-quarter profit
of $577 million failed to offset a dividend payment owed on the
government’s nearly 80 percent stake.  The company had a net-worth deficit of $19 million at the
close of the three-month period ended March 31, reflecting total
income of $1.79 billion before accounting for the $1.81 billion
payment on Treasury’s stake, the McLean, Virginia-based company
said today in a Securities and Exchange Commission  filing .  “In the first quarter, Freddie Mac sharpened its focus on
building value for the industry, homeowners and taxpayers by
aligning its resources and internal business plans to meet the
goals and objectives laid out in our new Conservatorship
Scorecard and Strategic Plan,” Chief Executive Officer Charles
E. Haldeman Jr. said in a statement. “Today, we are executing
against that plan, working with our regulator to build a new
infrastructure for the housing finance system and establish a
path for shifting risk to private investors.”  The company and its larger rival  Fannie Mae  own or
guarantee almost half of U.S. home loans. They have been
sustained by Treasury Department aid since they were seized in
September 2008 amid losses tied to defaults and foreclosures.  Freddie Mac  reported a $619 million profit for the fourth
quarter of last year, and a full-year net loss of $5.3 billion
for 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
