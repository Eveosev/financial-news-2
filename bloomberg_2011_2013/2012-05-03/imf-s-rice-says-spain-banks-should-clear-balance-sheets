Spanish banks should clear as much as
they can off their balance sheets as the government decides how
to best address vulnerabilities in the country’s financial
industry, an  International Monetary Fund  spokesman said.  Asked whether Spanish banks should spin off their “bad
assets” into a separate company, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said
that it is first “critical to do the due diligence of these
banks’ assets before taking a final decision.”  “In the meantime banks should be urged to clear as much as
possible off their balance sheets,” Rice said at a press
briefing in  Washington .  The IMF said last week Spain may need to use more public
money to shore up its banks, and raised the possibility of
lenders offloading toxic assets into separate vehicles.  An IMF mission will go to  Greece , where the fund co-
finances a bailout package, once a new government is formed
after the May 6 elections, Rice said.  Asked about the prospects for a loan to  Hungary , Rice said
the IMF welcomed “the recent progress in Hungary’s discussions
with the European Commission, and we’re ready to start
negotiations as soon as adequate steps are taken to ensure
central bank independence, as has been discussed with the
Hungarian government.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
