Tornadoes in  Texas  and  Kansas  fueled
almost $1 billion in U.S. insurance losses from natural
disasters last month, according to Aon Plc, the worldâ€™s largest
broker of coverage.  Storms in the first week of April, including those in
northern Texas, generated at least 105,000 claims costing the
industry more than $650 million, London-based Aon said in a
 report  on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
