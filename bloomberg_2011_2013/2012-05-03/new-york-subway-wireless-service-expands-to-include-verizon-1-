Wireless service in New York’s subway
stations will be extended to  Verizon Wireless ,  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S)  and other partners of  Boingo Wireless Inc. (WIFI) , letting more
mobile-device users access the Web while waiting for the train.  The Wi-Fi service, provided by the Transit Wireless LLC
network, is being built to provide 277 subway stations with
connectivity in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens, Boingo
said today in a statement.  The announcement follows an agreement that  AT&T Inc. (T)  and T-
Mobile USA signed with closely held Transit Wireless in 2010, an
accord that lets those carriers’ customers to also make mobile
calls. Boingo’s service only ensures data connectivity. Service
will only be available in the stations, not in the tunnels.  Subway station Wi-Fi availability will gradually roll out
over the next five years, Los Angeles-based Boingo said. Access
will be free for certain customers of Boingo’s partners,
including Microsoft Corp.’s Skype, Sprint and Verizon, depending
on their service plans, spokesman Christian Gunning said in an
interview.  Boingo Wireless allows subscribers to access Wi-Fi at more
than 500,000 hotspots worldwide. Transit Wireless owns and
operates the  New York  City subway station wireless
communications network. Broadcast Australia acquired a
controlling stake in Transit Wireless in 2010.  Boingo fell 8.4 percent to $9.80 at the close in New York.
