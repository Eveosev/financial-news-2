Navies and private armed guards
protecting merchant ships against piracy should be governed by a
global convention setting legal parameters for using lethal
force and making arrests, according to the company that manages
the third-biggest vessel registry.  Following are comments on Somali piracy made today at a
luncheon in London by Clay Maitland, managing director of
Reston, Virginia-based International Registries Inc. The company
was appointed by the  Marshall Islands  to manage the  2,634 
vessels that fly the country’s flag.  “We should go after the pirates, and we should do it in
accordance with settled international law.”  A proposed Convention for the Suppression of Piracy needs
to establish “how to shoot at pirates and whether to shoot at
them and under what circumstances.  “We need a convention that says any arrested pirates can
be tried at  The Hague  in accordance with this international
agreement. Section two would state the circumstances under which
an arrested person charged with piracy can be taken into
custody, and it would be by a warship of any nation.  “In other words, we codify the law that existed in the
18th century, when the Royal Navy went out and caught pirates
and suppressed it wherever they found it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
