A letter that claimed ousted Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafi had agreed to finance French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy ’s 2007 election campaign is a fake, the head of
Libya’s National Transitional Council said.  Mustafa Abdul Jalil told reporters yesterday that
authorities determined the letter wasn’t genuine. Sarkozy said
on April 29 that the report by Mediapart was a “setup.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
