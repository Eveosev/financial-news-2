A Tunisian court today fined the
director of a private TV channel 2,400 dinars ($1,554) for
broadcasting a film deemed blasphemous.  Nessma TV’s Nabil Karoui was accused of insulting sacred
Islamic values and disturbing the public order after the station
on Oct. 7 aired an animated Iranian film, “Persepolis,” about
a girl growing up during that country’s 1979 revolution. It
includes a scene depicting God, which is forbidden in Islam.  The movie, aired a week before  Tunisia ’s parliamentary
elections, sparked outrage and violent demonstrations by
Islamists. Karoui’s house was destroyed by a mob and the
station’s offices were attacked. Prosecutors launched an
investigation after receiving complaints.  Amnesty International  said the court’s decision was a
“sign of the continuing erosion of free speech in Tunisia.”  “On a day that is meant to celebrate world press freedom,
Tunisia has shown its failure to respect the basic right of
freedom of expression,” an e-mailed statement cited Ann
Harrison, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the  Middle
East  and North Africa, as saying. “Nabil Karoui should not have
been tried to begin with, let alone found guilty for exercising
his right to peacefully express his views.”  The trial, which began in November, was twice adjourned
amid acts of violence by Salafis demanding Karoui’s imprisonment
and the closure of the station. Salafis adhere to a strict
interpretation of Islam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
