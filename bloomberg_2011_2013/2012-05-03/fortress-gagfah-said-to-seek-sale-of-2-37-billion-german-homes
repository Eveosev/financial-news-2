Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the European real estate
company majority-owned by  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , plans
to sell as many as 38,000 apartments in Dresden,  Germany , two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The homes are valued at about 1.8 billion euros ($2.37
billion) and make up about a quarter of Gagfah’s holdings,
according to company filings. Gagfah is due in May 2013 to pay
1.1 billion euros borrowed when it bought the properties,
according to one of the people.  The homes are owned by Gagfah’s Woba Dresden unit, which
bought them from Dresden’s government for 1.75 billion euros in
2006. Investment bank Leonardo & Co., a unit of  Italy ’s Gruppo
Banca Leonardo, is advising on the sale, the people said.  The plan was earlier reported by the Financial Times
Deutschland. The company declined to confirm the report.  “We are a real estate company and we sell and buy
apartments,” said Dirk Schmitt, a Gagfah spokesman.
“Everything is an option.”  Selling the entire portfolio would be difficult and Gagfah
may break it up even though it would need permission from the
city of Dresden to do so, according to one of the people. No
approval is necessary if the assets are sold to a single buyer,
the person said.  Gagfah has an additional 2.1 billion euros in debt due in
August 2013, one of the people said.  Fortress Investment Group, based in  New York , owns 61
percent of Gagfah, which has its headquarters in Luxembourg and
operates in Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
