Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , Canada’s
largest insurer, said profit surged 22 percent, topping
analysts’ estimates, on increased insurance sales and higher
gains from annuities as markets rallied.  Net income climbed to C$1.21 billion ($1.23 billion), or 62
cents a share, from C$985 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier,
the Toronto-based insurer said today in a statement. It was the
highest profit since the fourth quarter of 2010.  Manulife said insurance sales climbed on increases in  Asia 
and Canada, while a rebound in equity markets led to gains from
annuities and higher funds under management. The company posted
C$541 million in gains from stocks,  interest rates  and hedges on
variable annuities. The insurer had a record C$512 billion in
fund assets in the quarter.  “Our first quarter reflects strong markets, positive
hedging results, 35 percent higher insurance sales and stronger
underlying earnings,” Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien
said in the statement.  Excluding some items, Manulife earned 66 cents a share.
That topped the 35-cent-a-share average  estimate  of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Guloien, 55, has said Manulife plans to have 60 percent of
its underlying earnings sensitivity to equity markets offset by
hedges by the end of this year, and 75 percent by the end of
2014. In the first quarter, Manulife said 66 percent to 74
percent of that sensitivity was offset by hedges.  Second Quarter  The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 19 percent in the
quarter, while  Canada ’s benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index climbed 3.7 percent.  Manulife said second-quarter results may be lowered by as
much as C$800 million because of changes to fixed-income
reinvestment rates. The insurer may also have costs of C$250
million to C$300 million because of changes to actuarial
parameters.  Separately, Manulife named Steve Roder as chief financial
officer, replacing Michael Bell, who said in February he was
leaving the company. Roder was CFO of AIA Group Ltd. until 2010
and has been in Asia for about 20 years.  “This underscores the importance of the Asian operations
to Manulife’s longer-term growth, but will also perpetuate
speculation that it will once again become acquisitive in the
region,”  John Aiken , an analyst at  Barclays Capital , wrote
today in a note to clients.  Manulife fell 2.7 percent to C$12.98 at 4:01 p.m. in
Toronto. The shares have surged 20 percent this year, compared
with a 19 percent increase on the six-member  S&P/TSX Life &
Health Insurance Index. (STLIFE)   Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) , Canada’s second-largest insurer,
said today that first-quarter net income rose 8.7 percent to
C$451 million, or 47 cents, up from C$415 million, or 44 cents,
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
