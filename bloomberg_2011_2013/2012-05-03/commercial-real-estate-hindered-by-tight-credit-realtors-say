A “major portion” of small
commercial-property deals in the U.S. have fallen through
because of stricter lending standards, according to a National
Association of Realtors survey.  While the commercial real estate market showed signs of
recovery in 2011, credit tightened in the past year for small
businesses, the group said today in a report. Two out of three
agents helping clients buy properties for less than $2 million
said the purchases were scuttled because of a lack of capital,
according to the survey.  Small-business transactions relied heavily on regional and
local banks, and 30 percent of the purchases of properties such
as apartments, offices, warehouses, land, shopping centers and
restaurants were made with cash, according to the survey.  “This is very much a tale of two markets,”  Lawrence Yun ,
the association’s chief economist, said in the report. “There
have been notable improvements in capital for large commercial
transactions valued at $2.5 million or higher, but there remain
significant challenges for small businesses.”  More than half of respondents said lending is just as
stringent as a year ago, 23 percent said it was tighter, and 20
percent said it was easier to obtain financing.  The survey was conducted last month. A random sample of
32,459 Realtors with an interest in commercial real estate were
invited to complete the online questionnaire, and 474 responded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
