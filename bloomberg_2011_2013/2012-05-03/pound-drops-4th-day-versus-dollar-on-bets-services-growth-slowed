Bond-market measures of U.K. inflation
expectations declined as a report showed  house prices  fell and
growth in British services slowed more than economists forecast.  Sterling erased a decline against the euro after the
 European Central Bank  left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 1 percent. The gauge of  services activity  dropped to 53.3 in
April from 55.3 in March, missing the median forecast of 54.1 in
a Bloomberg survey of economists. The 20-year  break-even rate , a
gauge of inflation expectations derived from the yield
difference between nominal and index-linked bonds, fell for a
fourth-straight day  “Break-evens have contracted over the past couple of
weeks,” said  Sam Hill , a gilt strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in  London . Shorter-dated break-even rates have fallen
less than longer-term indicators, he said. “That reflects some
residual concerns about stubbornly high inflation over the rest
of 2012.”  Britain’s five-year, five-year  forward  break-even rate, a
market gauge monitored by the  Bank of England  to forecast
inflation expectations starting five years from now, fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.99 percent as of
5:03 p.m. London time, the lowest close this year.  The U.K.’s 20-year break-even rate fell two basis points to
3.06 percentage points, and reached 3.05 points, matching the
least since March 8.  Inflation ‘Too High’  The yield on  10-year gilts  was little changed at 2.04
percent after falling to 2.02 percent, the least since April 16.
It dropped to a record 1.917 percent on Jan. 18.  Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said yesterday the
economy isn’t yet “back to health” and will need the support
of low  interest rates  “for the time being.” King also said
inflation is “still too high.” Policy makers will say on May
10 whether they will extend their bond-buying program to aid the
recovery after completing the latest round of so-called
quantitative easing, the Bank of England said in a statement.  U.K. house prices fell last month as a tax break for first-
time buyers ended and the economy entered a double-dip
recession,  Nationwide Building Society  said today. Values
slipped 0.2 percent from March, the fourth decline in five
months. From a year earlier, prices fell 0.9 percent.  The pound was little changed at $1.6185 after slipping as
much as 0.3 percent to $1.6160. Sterling was also little changed
at 81.21 pence per euro, after weakening 0.3 percent to 81.43
pence. It appreciated to 81.13 yesterday, the strongest level
since June 2010.  Sterling Strength  Sterling has advanced 3.4 percent in the past three months,
the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 0.8
percent and the euro gained 0.7 percent.  Gilts outperformed German bunds today after ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said policy makers did not discuss cutting
borrowing costs today as they left the key interest rate
unchanged, a decision predicted by all 58 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Ten-year U.K. bonds yielded 43 basis points
more than German debt of the same maturity, compared with 45
basis points on April 30.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, the second-
worst performer after  Greece  among 26 sovereign indexes. U.S.
Treasuries gained 0.2 percent and German bunds returned 1.6
percent, the indexes show.  The Debt Management Office sold 1.2 billion pounds of
inflation-protected bonds due in March 2034. The sale drew bids
for 1.93 times the amount of the securities on offer, according
to data from the debt agency.  U.K. index-linked bonds lost investors 2 percent this year
while their U.S. counterparts returned 2.9 percent, according to
data compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  To contact the reporters on this story:
