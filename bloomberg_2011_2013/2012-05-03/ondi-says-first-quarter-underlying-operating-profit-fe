Mondi Group (MND) ,  Europe ’s largest maker of
office paper, predicted that second-quarter orders and prices
will rise, after reporting a drop in first-quarter profit.  “We see order improvement continuing and expect prices to
remain positive based on the current trend,” Chief Executive
Officer David Hathorn said in an interview.  Underlying operating profit fell to 120 million euros
($158 million) from 179 million euros a year earlier and 132
million euros in the quarter through Dec. 31, Johannesburg-based
Mondi said in a statement today.  The South Africa division’s underlying operating profit was
“well down” on lower average selling prices and weaker export
volumes of white-top containerboard, the company said. Aylesford
Newsprint struggled to return to profife1tability as the “very
weak” European newsprint market continued, Mondi said. The
company is looking at ways to reduce costs and is “actively
assessing alternatives for this business,” it said.  Mondi fell 1.5 percent to 70.10 rand at the close in
Johannesburg. The stock has climbed 22 percent this year,
outpacing a 7.5 percent gain in the  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share
Index. (JALSH)   To contact the reporter on this story:
