Hungary ’s budget plan announced by the
government in April improves on last year’s fiscal steps by
facing up to the prospect of “slow” growth, said Istvan Hamecz, the head of  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ’s fund management.  The government has lost its “Blitzkrieg” for growth and
is making revenue measures permanent in preparation for a
sustained slow expansion in the economy, Hamecz, a former
central bank chief economist, wrote in an article published in
 Heti Valasz  weekly today.  “It is worth welcoming the government’s realism as it
seems it finally understands the real problem, even if it can’t
yet give satisfying answers,” wrote Hamecz, the head of the
asset manager at Hungary’s largest lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
