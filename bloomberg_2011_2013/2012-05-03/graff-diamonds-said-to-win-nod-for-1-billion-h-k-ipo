Graff Diamonds Ltd.  gained approval
from  Hong Kong ’s stock exchange for a plan to raise as much as
$1 billion in an initial public offering, said two people with
knowledge of the matter.  The London-based jeweler may start gauging investor demand
in the next two weeks, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the process is private.  In seeking to list in Hong Kong, where Chinese consumers
take advantage of lower tax rates than in the country’s mainland
and splurge on  luxury goods , Graff is following the footsteps of
luxury retailer  Prada SpA. (1913)  Prada, the Italian fashion house that
raised about $2.1 billion in June, has gained 34 percent from
its IPO price.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are managing the planned offering,
the people said. Officials at Graff’s London office couldn’t
immediately be reached to comment.  Graff runs a store in the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong.
Founder and London jewelry dealer  Laurence Graff  bought a
diamond in a 2010 sale for a record auction price of 45.4
million Swiss francs ($50 million). Graff had also paid 16.4
million pounds ($27 million) for the 35.56-carat grayish-blue
Wittelsbach Diamond at Christie’s International in  London  in
December 2008, then the highest price for a gem at auction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
