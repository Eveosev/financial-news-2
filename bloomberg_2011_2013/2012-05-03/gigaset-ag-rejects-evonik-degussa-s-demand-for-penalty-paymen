Gigaset AG (GGS) , the Munich-based maker of
cordless telephones, said today it rejected “allegations and
claims” by Evonik Degussa GmbH, which has filed arbitration
proceedings against it at the German Institution of Arbitration.  Essen, Germany-based Evonik is demanding a penalty payment
of 12 million euros ($15.78 million) on the basis of a contract
entered into in 2006, Gigaset said, adding it will defend itself
in the arbitration.  Gigaset has adequate provision for risk of loss in its 2011
financial statements, the company said in a statement on the
DGAP newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
