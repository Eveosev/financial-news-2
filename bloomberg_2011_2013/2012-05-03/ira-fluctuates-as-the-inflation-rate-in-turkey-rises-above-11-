The lira fluctuated between gains and
losses after the inflation rate rose to the highest in 3 1/2
years.  The Turkish currency appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to
1.7559 per dollar, paring an earlier depreciation of 0.2
percent. It traded less than 0.1 percent weaker at 1.7618 per
dollar by 5:49 p.m. in Istanbul. The central bank is due to
publish its assessment on the latest inflation data tomorrow.  The  inflation  rate jumped to 11.1 percent in April from
10.4 percent in the previous month, the highest yearly rise
since October 2008, on account of higher food and energy costs,
according to the statistics office in Ankara. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of seven economists was 11
percent.  “The central bank may return to exceptional days in the
coming days,” Gizem Oztok Altinsac, an economist at Garanti
Investment in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed note.  Turkey ’s central bank varies its funding rate on a daily
basis, maintaining borrowing costs within a 5.75 percent to 11.5
percent interest-rate corridor introduced last year. Days when
the bank does not lend at the 5.75 percent rate are considered
“exceptional days.” The most recent round of policy tightening
began on April 11.  The bank lent one billion lira at its lowest 5.75 percent
rate at the one-week repurchase agreements auction today, the
lowest amount since April 26.  The yield on the two-year benchmark bonds fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.33 percent.  Currency forwards show the lira may slump to 1.85 per
dollar by the end of this year. Turkey’s inflation rate is the
steepest among major  emerging markets  worldwide. Its current-
account deficit is about 10 percent  of gross domestic product,
the biggest among 60 major economies tracked by the
 International Monetary Fund  as a proportion of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
