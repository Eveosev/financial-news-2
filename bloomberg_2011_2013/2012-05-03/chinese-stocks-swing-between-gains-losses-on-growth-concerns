China’s stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index to a seven-week high, on speculation the
government will take steps to avoid a deeper economic slowdown.  China  Eastern Airlines Corp. and China Southern Airlines
Co. gained at least 0.8 percent after the China Business News
said jet fuel prices fell. Bank of China Ltd. and China
Construction Bank Corp. retreated after Temasek Holdings Pte.,
Singapore’s state-owned investment company, sold $2.48 billion
of Hong Kong-traded shares in the two banks.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1.64 points, or less than
0.1 percent, to 2,440.08 after changing direction more than 30
times, closing at the highest level since March 13. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 0.3 percent to 2,691.52.  “Investors are in a dilemma,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-
based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “On one hand, there’s constant speculation about
policy easing so there’s hope looking forward. But fundamentals
for the overall economy remain weak.”  The Oriental Morning Post said China’s central bank may cut
the reserve ratio for banks as early as this week. China has
reduced  reserve requirements  for banks twice since November,
though it has kept benchmark rates on hold since July at the
highest level since 2008.  Slowing Growth  China’s non-manufacturing industries grew at a slower pace
in April, a survey indicated. A purchasing managers’  index  was
at 56.1, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing  said  in a statement today in
Beijing. That compares with 58 for March. A reading above 50
indicates an expansion.  American companies added 119,000 workers in April, the
fewest in seven months, according to data from a private survey.
The report intensified concern that Labor Department data
tomorrow may show the U.S. isn’t growing fast enough to reduce
unemployment.  The jobless rate in the euro area rose to 10.9 percent in
March, manufacturing contracted last month and unemployment in
 Germany  unexpectedly increased, reports showed.  About 12.86 billion shares changed hands in the Shanghai
Composite yesterday, or 62 percent higher than the daily average
this year. Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at 17.31. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. added 0.2 percent to 104.86 in  New York .  Bank Stake Sales  The Shanghai index has climbed 10.9 percent this year amid
speculation the government will take measures to boost the
economy. Stocks in the gauge are valued at 10.5 times estimated
earnings, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6,
according to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  China Construction slid 0.8 percent to 4.73  yuan . Bank of
China lost 0.3 percent to 3.06 yuan. Temasek is selling about
$1.2 billion of Bank of China shares at HK$3.13 to HK$3.18
apiece, a discount of as much as 4 percent to its closing price
Wednesday in  Hong Kong , according to term sheets obtained by
Bloomberg News. The firm is also selling about 1.6 billion
shares in China Construction Bank at HK$5.99 to HK$6.10 apiece,
the documents show.  Airlines  China Eastern Airlines rose 1.7 percent to 4.24 yuan. China
Southern Airlines advanced 0.8 percent to 5.02 yuan. May
domestic jet fuel prices fell to 7,932 yuan a ton, from 8,061
yuan in April, China Business News said, citing airlines.  Western Securities Co. (002673) , a brokerage, gained 67 percent in
its debut on Shenzhen’s stock exchange.  Chinese shares traded in Shanghai will rally and enter a
 bull market  as the benchmark index trades above its 200-day
moving average, according to technical analysis by Federated
Investors Inc.  The Shanghai A-Share Stock Price Index -- which tracks so-
called A shares restricted to local investors and qualified
foreigners on the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  -- may climb as much
as 15 percent by the end of the year after the gauge rose above
its 200-day average of 2,552.78 yesterday, said Audrey Kaplan, a
senior portfolio manager at Federated in New York.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
