U.K. commercial property values
declined by 0.7 percent in the first three months of 2012, 
the second consecutive quarter of decline,  Investment
Property Databank  said.  Values are 31 percent below 2007 levels, making it
difficult to refinance five-year loans that are in negative
equity and are maturing, London-based IPD said today in a
statement. The last time prices fell for two straight quarters
was in the first half of 2009.  “The U.K. has fallen back into a technical recession
largely due to a lack of business demand and a construction
slump,” Malcolm Frodsham, director of research at IPD, said in
the statement. “As property values continue to decline,
investors are unlikely to want to develop.”  The gap between prime and secondary values is the widest
since the early 1990s, the researcher said. Though prices in
central  London  rose by more than 33 percent since the quarter
ended September 2009, they are about 20 percent below levels in
the three months through June 2007. Secondary properties, which
make up large portions of U.K. lenders’ bad debts, have fallen
in value by 6.1 percent over the last six quarters. U.K. values
dropped 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2012.  Editors: Jeff St.Onge, Ross Larsen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
