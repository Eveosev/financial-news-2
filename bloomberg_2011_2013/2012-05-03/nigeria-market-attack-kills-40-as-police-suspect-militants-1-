The death toll from an attack on a
cattle market by gunmen in the northeastern Nigerian town of
Potiskum has risen to 60 people, Abdullahi Bego, a spokesman for
Yobe state governor, said today.  “Dead bodies were brought to us with bullet wounds” as
well as machete cuts and burns, Donatua Muna, the medical
director of Potiskum General Hospital, said by phone.
Yesterday’s attack left 29 people injured, Bego said.  Suspected members of the Boko Haram Islamist group opened
fire, threw explosives and robbed the cattle market, said Toyin
Gbadegeshin, a spokesman for the Yobe state police.  Authorities in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer blame Boko
Haram, which seeks to impose strict Islamic law in  Nigeria , for
a surge in attacks in the mainly Muslim north and the capital,
Abuja, in which hundreds of people have died this year.  Security forces killed one Boko Haram suspect in a gunfight
with the attackers following the raid, Gbadegeshin said. No
arrests have been made, he said.  Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin,”
claimed responsibility for April 26 attacks on the offices of
ThisDay newspaper in Abuja and the northern city of Kaduna that
killed at least eight people and injured 34.  In an 18-minute video posted on Youtube on May 1, the group
said it planned more attacks on the news media because of what
it described as biased reporting on its campaign.  To contact the reporters on this story:
