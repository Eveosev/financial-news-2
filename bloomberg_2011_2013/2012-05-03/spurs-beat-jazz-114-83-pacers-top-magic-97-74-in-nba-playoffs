Tony Parker  had 18 points and six of

the Utah Jazz 114-83 to take a two-games-to-none lead in the
National Basketball Associationâ€™s Western Conference playoffs.  Also last night, Danny Granger had 26 points to lead the
Indiana Pacers to a 97-74 win against the Magic, the worst
postseason defeat in Orlando history, and the Memphis Grizzlies
overcame the Los Angeles Clippers 105-98.  At AT&T Center in San Antonio, Kawhi Leonard contributed 17
points as the Spurs won their second straight home game in the
best-of-seven first-round series. Josh Howard and Al Jefferson
each had 10 points for the Jazz, who were held to 34 percent
shooting.  The Jazz host the Spurs in Game 3 on May 5.  At Amway Center in  Orlando , Roy Hibbert had 18 points and
10 rebounds for the Pacers, who have won the last two games to
take a 2-1 advantage in the series.  Glen Davis  had 22 points and
reserve J.J. Redick added 13 for the Magic.  The Magic host the Pacers in Game 4 on May 5.  In the third game yesterday, Rudy Gay led the Grizzlies
with 21 points, while O.J. Mayo had 20 and Mike Conley
contributed 19 at FedExForum in Memphis.  Chris Paul  led the
Clippers with 29 points, while  Blake Griffin  scored 22.  The series, which is tied at one game apiece, resumes May 5
in Los Angeles.  Tonight, the defending champion Dallas Mavericks will try
to avoid going 3-0 down against the Oklahoma City Thunder, while
the Miami Heat will look to move within one win of sweeping the
 New York  Knicks. With a defeat, New York will set an NBA record
for the most consecutive postseason losses, with 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
