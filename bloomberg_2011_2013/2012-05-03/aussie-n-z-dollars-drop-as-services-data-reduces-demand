The Australian and  New Zealand  dollars
fell versus their U.S. counterpart as data showed growth slowed
in U.S. services industries, damping demand for higher-yielding
assets before a report that may say U.S. payrolls rose in April.  The South Pacific dollars slumped as stock and raw-material
prices dropped, reducing demand for currencies of commodity-
exporting countries. The kiwi, as New Zealand’s dollar is
called, weakened against all of its 16 most-traded counterparts
after the nation’s unemployment rate unexpectedly rose.  The Aussie dollar fell 0.7 percent to $1.0264 yesterday in
 New York  and reached $1.0240, its lowest level since April 11.
It lost 0.6 percent to 82.30 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar slid 1.4 percent to 79.97 U.S. cents
and reached 79.88 cents, the weakest since Jan. 17. It fell 1.3
percent to 64.13 yen.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks declined 0.6 percent, and
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials dropped
0.9 percent.  U.S. employers added 160,000 jobs last month, after a
120,000 increase in March, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey before the Labor Department’s nonfarm
payrolls report at today.  The  Institute for Supply Management  said yesterday its  non-
manufacturing index  fell to a four-month low of 53.5 in April
from 56 in March. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was 55.3. A reading above 50 in the Tempe,
Arizona-based group’s gauge signals expansion.  New Zealand’s  jobless rate  climbed to 6.7 percent in the
first quarter from a revised 6.4 percent in the previous three
months,  Statistics New Zealand  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
