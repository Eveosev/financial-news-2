Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE) ,  Greece ’s
largest refiner, issued a tender to sell a cargo of  gasoline ,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The company is offering 30,000 metric tons for loading from
its Aspropyrgos refinery, near  Athens , from Sept. 27 to Sept.
30, said the people, declining to be identified because the
information is confidential. The tender closes tomorrow.  Hellenic Petroleum’s 100,000 barrel-a-day Elefsis refinery
exported its first fuel cargo after an upgrade at the plant was
completed at the end of August, a company official said today by
phone, declining to be identified citing policy. A shipment of
30,000 tons of gasoil was made on Sept. 10, the official said,
without saying who the buyer was or its destination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
