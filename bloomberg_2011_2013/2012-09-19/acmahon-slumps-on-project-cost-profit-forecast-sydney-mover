Macmahon Holdings Ltd. (MAH) , an
Australian engineering-services company, plunged by the most in
more than three years after cutting its profit forecast for
fiscal year 2013.  The Perth-based company slumped 39 percent to 32.5
Australian cents at the close of trading in Sydney, the biggest
fall since April 2009. It was the biggest loser among companies
in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  Full-year profit after tax will be between A$20 million
($21 million) and A$40 million, the company said in a statement
to the Australian stock exchange today. It had last month
forecast a 20 percent increase from the previous period’s net
income of A$56.1 million.  Macmahon has identified several problems at its Hope Downs
4 Rail Earthworks project in  Western Australia , which will
result in “significant additional costs” to meet its schedule,
the company said. It has also lowered its estimate of the volume
of new construction work it may win and perform in the year
ending June 30, 2013, it said.  Chief Executive Officer Nick Bowen has resigned and will be
replaced by Ross Carroll, Macmahon said in a separate statement.  Macmahon has lost 42 percent this year  compared  with an 8.9
percent gain in the benchmark index.  Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) ,
which owns 19 percent of Macmahon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, has fallen 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
