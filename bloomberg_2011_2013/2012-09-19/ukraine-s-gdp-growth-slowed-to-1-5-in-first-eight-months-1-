Ukraine’s economic growth slowed to
1.5 percent in the first eight months of the year from 2 percent
in the first seven as the  construction industry  shrank, Prime
Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  “Considering a combination of negative external and
internal factors, recession in  Europe ’s leading countries and a
decline in the commodity and capital markets, this is a positive
result,” Azarov told a weekly government meeting today in Kiev.
Construction declined by 8 percent in the eight months, Azarov
said.  Ukraine’s economy, dependent on export of steel and
chemicals, rose 2.5 percent in the first half of the year,
boosted by preparations for the Euro 2012 football championship
co-hosted with  Poland . Industrial production fell 4.7 percent
from a year earlier in August on declining machine building,
steel output and crude-oil refining, the statistics office said
on Sept. 17.  The government predicts the economy will expand 4.5 percent
next year compared with the official forecast of 3.9 percent for
2012, Finance Minister Yuriy Kolobov said on Sept. 12, citing a
draft of next year’s budget. The economy expanded 4.4 percent in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
