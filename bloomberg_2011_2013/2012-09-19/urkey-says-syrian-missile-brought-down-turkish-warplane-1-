A Syrian missile downed a Turkish
military jet in June after it exploded near the aircraft and the
pilots lost control, army prosecutors said according to the
Anatolia news agency.  The incident caused the plane to crash and occurred in
international airspace, the prosecutors said, according to the
state-run agency.  The missile exploded in the rear and to the left of the
jet, creating a “blast effect,” Anatolia said. The pilots
subsequently lost control of the plane which crashed into Syrian
waters, it said.  A forensic examination also found traces of explosive on
the wreckage of the plane, Anatolia said.  Syria  has previously said the plane entered its airspace
and was shot down by an anti-aircraft gun.  To contact the reporter on this story:
