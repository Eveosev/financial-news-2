The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.2 percent to 671.62 at 5:34 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials gained
0.4 percent to 1,638.238.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rebounded from the lowest close in more than two weeks
in New York amid speculation that  Japan ’s expanded program of
monetary easing may bolster fuel demand in the world’s third-
biggest crude user.  Oil for October delivery gained as much as 88 cents to
$96.17 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $95.98 at 9:07 a.m. London time. The
contract slid $1.33 yesterday to $95.29, the lowest close since
Aug. 30, and has dropped 4.4 percent since this month’s intraday
high of $100.42 on Sept. 14. The October contract expires
tomorrow. The more-active November future was at $96.37 a
barrel, up 75 cents.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose $1.12, or 5.6 percent,
to $21.27 a barrel at 10:17 a.m. Singapore time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread,
a measure of the profit from making the fuel, is at the widest
since June 16, 2011. Gasoil swaps for October fell 70 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $130.15 a barrel, PVM data showed.  High-sulfur fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 56
cents to $2.78 a barrel, PVM data showed. The discount is the
smallest since Aug. 30, signaling refining losses from the fuel
have declined. Fuel-oil swaps for October dropped $8, or 1.2
percent, to $673.75 a ton, according to PVM data.  BASE METALS  Copper gained for a second day in  London  after Japan’s
central bank expanded its asset-purchase program to fuel growth
in the world’s fourth-biggest consumer of the metal.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  increased an asset-purchase fund to 55
trillion yen ($697 billion), according to a statement today. The
 Federal Reserve  and the  European Central Bank  also unveiled
stimulus plans this month aimed at stoking economies. Copper
also climbed as inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange
reached the lowest level since October 2008.  Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.9 percent to
$8,392 a metric ton by 9:13 a.m. on the LME. Prices reached
$8,422, the highest level since May 2. Copper for December
delivery advanced 1 percent to $3.825 a pound on the Comex in
 New York .  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the LME rose 0.7
percent to $2,176 a ton. The fee investors pay to borrow the
lightweight metal for a day reached $40 a ton yesterday, the
highest level since Nov. 7, 2006. It was at $9 today.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold climbed to a six-month high in London on speculation
central banks’ moves to bolster growth will spur demand for the
metal as a protection of wealth.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose 0.2 percent to $1,774.57 an
ounce by 9:33 a.m. in London. Prices reached $1,779.50, the
highest since Feb. 29. December-delivery futures were up 0.4
percent at $1,777.10 on the Comex in New York.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at $34.82
an ounce after reaching $35.02 yesterday, the highest since
March 2. Palladium gained 1.2 percent to $674.45 an ounce.
Platinum was 0.6 percent higher at $1,642 an ounce. Holdings of
the metal in ETPs rose to a record 46.7 tons yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans, corn and wheat climbed on speculation the slump
in prices this week may attract importers and investors amid
declining global supplies.  November-delivery soybeans rallied as much as 1.6 percent
to $16.665 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, and were at
$16.62 at 2:39 p.m. Singapore time. Futures fell 6.1 percent in
the three days to yesterday.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to $7.4275 a
bushel in Chicago, after slipping 5.4 percent in the past two
days. Wheat for December delivery climbed 0.8 percent to $8.7025
a bushel, after losing 6.6 percent in the past two days.  Rubber gained for a third day to the highest level in more
than three months after the Bank of Japan joined moves by the
Federal Reserve last week to stimulate economic growth, raising
optimism demand will expand.  The February-delivery contract rose 1.5 percent to end at
260 yen a kilogram ($3,329 a metric ton), the highest settlement
level since May 31, on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures
pared this year’s drop to 1.3 percent.  Palm oil  gained after the steepest drop in 19 months
yesterday boosted demand as countries sought to build stockpiles
amid dwindling global oilseed supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
