Enrollment in private Medicare
plans offered by insurers led by  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  is
expected to surge 11 percent in 2013, the U.S. government said,
while premiums may increase an average of 4.7 percent.  About a quarter of Medicare’s 49 million elderly and
disabled beneficiaries are enrolled in Advantage plans, in which
insurers are paid a fixed monthly fee to provide services. Some
of the plans offer benefits not available in the traditional
Medicare program, such as discounts for gym memberships and
eyeglasses.  Enrollment has increased 28 percent since passage of the
Affordable Care Act, the U.S. health-care overhaul, said
 Kathleen Sebelius , the Health and Human Services secretary. The
law reduces payments to the plans, which cost more on average
than traditional Medicare, while also giving bonus payments to
providers the government considers high quality.  “Since the law was enacted in 2010, average premiums have
gone down, enrollment has gone up, and new benefits and lower
drug costs continue to help millions of seniors and people with
disabilities,” Sebelius said in a statement.  The premium for an average Advantage plan is projected to
be $32.59 next year, an increase of $1.47, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
