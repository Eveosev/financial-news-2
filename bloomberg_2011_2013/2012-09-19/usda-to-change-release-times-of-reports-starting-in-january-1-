The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said it will begin issuing several major statistical  reports  at
noon in  Washington  starting in January to allow for greater
market liquidity and access to the data.  The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE),
Acreage, Crop Production, Grain Stocks, Prospective Plantings
and Small Grains Summary will be released at noon rather than
the current 8:30 a.m., the USDA said today in an e-mailed
 statement . The change was made after the department received 147
comments on proposed timing changes. Livestock report times will
be unchanged.  “The shift to a noon release allows for the greatest
liquidity in the markets, provides the greatest access to the
reports during working hours in the  United States , and continues
equal access to data among all parties,” USDA Chief Economist
Joseph W. Glauber said in the statement.  The change follows expansion of trading hours at several
major exchanges. On May 20, CME Group Inc., the owner of the
Chicago Board of Trade, began offering electronic trading from 5
p.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday through Friday, the first expansion of its
Globex electronic exchange since January 2008. A week earlier,
Intercontinental Exchange Inc., or ICE, started offering grain
contracts for the first time over an electronic network that
trades 22 hours a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
