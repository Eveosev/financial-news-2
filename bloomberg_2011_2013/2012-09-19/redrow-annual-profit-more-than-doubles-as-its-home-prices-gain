Redrow Plc (RDW) , the homebuilder subject
to a takeover by Chairman  Steve Morgan , said full-year profit
more than doubled, beating analyst estimates, as it sold more
expensive homes.  Net income for the year through June rose to 30.2 million
pounds ($49.1 million) from 13.5 million pounds a year earlier,
the Flint, Wales-based company said in a statement today.
Analysts expected net income of 25.9 million pounds, according
to four estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Despite the encouraging start to the year and the recent
Government Housing and Growth announcement, the outlook for the
industry remains challenging,” Morgan said in the statement.
“Supply of mortgages, although slightly improved on last year,
remains a significant constraint, as does public confidence due
to the country’s fragile economic state.”  A group led by Morgan may offer 152 pence a share for
Redrow, it said on Aug. 31. The Redrow founder left the company
in 2000 and returned as chairman a decade later after
disagreeing with the company’s focus on lower-income homes.
Morgan, 59, declined to comment on the possible takeover in a
Sept. 13 interview.  The average selling price of Redrow homes increased 15.2
percent to 189,900 pounds. Revenue rose 5.8 percent to 478.9
million pounds. Redrow completed 2,458 homes compared with 2,626
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
