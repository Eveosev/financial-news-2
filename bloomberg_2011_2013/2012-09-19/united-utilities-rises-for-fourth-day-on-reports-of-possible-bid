United Utilities Group Plc (UU/) , the
U.K.’s biggest publicly traded water company, rose for a fourth
day in London trading on newspaper reports of a possible bid.  The Warrington-based utility climbed 2.8 percent to a one-
month high of 727 pence by the close. It’s advanced 20 percent
this year compared with a 19 percent gain by Britain’s second-
largest water company, Severn Trent Plc.  Pennon Group Plc (PNN)  has
risen 4.3 percent while the 18-member Bloomberg World Water
Index has gained 14 percent over the same period.  United Utilities spokesman Shaun Robinson declined to
comment on “City speculation” to Bloomberg News today on what
the Telegraph called “rehashed takeover” talk. The Guardian
yesterday cited speculation of a potential bid from investors
including the  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan , Abu Dhabi funds,
China Investment Corp. and KKR & Co.  The utility gained similarly on Aug. 14 on a Daily Mail
report citing breakup bid speculation and some of the same
company names.  To contact the reporter on this story:
