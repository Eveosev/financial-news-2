Mitt Romney ’s campaign borrowed $20
million to pay for television ads and other expenses until the
Republican presidential candidate was formally named his party’s
nominee in late August.  The campaign has paid back $9 million of the loan, leaving
$11 million remaining. Federal Election Commission reports filed
Sept. 20 will show a debt of $15 million, the amount outstanding
on Aug. 31, according to an aide.  The loan, first reported late yesterday by National Review
Online and confirmed by a campaign official, came as the
campaign was running low on primary funds in July.  Though the campaign was collecting general-election
contributions, campaign-finance laws prohibited spending that
money until Romney officially accepted the nomination at the
party’s national convention in Tampa on Aug. 30.  “We took advantage of the law as it exists to secure this
line of credit,” the National Review quoted an unidentified
senior Romney aide as saying. “We were able to stay competitive
in a period when we were looking at a tilted playing field.”  Four years ago, Romney loaned his campaign more than $40
million, though he has not formally used any of his personal
wealth to fund his 2012 bid, said an aide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
