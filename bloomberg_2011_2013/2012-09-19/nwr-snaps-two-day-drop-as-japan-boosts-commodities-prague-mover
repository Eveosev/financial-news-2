New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republic’s biggest producer of coking coal, snapped two days of
losses as additional stimulus from the  Bank of Japan (8301)  boosted
demand for riskier assets.  The stock climbed as much as 1.5 percent and traded 0.6
percent higher in Prague, after sliding 1.6 percent in the
previous two days. Europe’s benchmark  coal  contracts rose 0.4
percent to $99.50 a metric ton in the Netherlands.  Stocks rallied after Japan’s central bank unexpectedly
expanded its asset-buying program, following plans announced by
the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  European Central Bank  to spur
growth and contain the debt crisis. U.S. data showed home sales
in the world’s largest economy jumped to a two-year high.  “European stock exchanges have followed Asian markets
higher after an unexpected monetary-policy loosening by Japan’s
central bank,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in
Prague, wrote in an e-mail to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
