B2Gold Corp. (BTO) , a Canadian company
with assets in  Latin America  and Africa, agreed to buy  CGA
Mining Ltd. (CGA)  to gain control of the largest operating gold
project in the Philippines.  The deal is worth about C$947 million ($966 million), or
C$2.80 a share, in stock as of yesterday’s close, down from its
announced value of C$1.07 billion. CGA’s Australian-traded
shares rose 4.7 percent to A$2.67 at the close in Sydney today.  Buying Perth, Australia-based CGA will give B2Gold the
Masbate mine in the Philippines, which has total resources of
about 7.7 million ounces, according to the company’s  website .
Adding Masbate would increase B2Gold’s output by 57 percent,
making it reliant on production from the Southeast Asian nation.  “It’s a vote of confidence in the Philippines,” the
nation’s Mines and Geosciences Bureau Director Leo Jasareno said
in a phone interview today. The government has just renewed for
another five years the license for processing in the Masbate
gold mine south of  Manila , Jasareno said.  Holders of CGA will get 0.74 of a B2Gold share for each
they own, the companies said in a joint statement yesterday.  CGA rose 2.3 percent to C$2.71 at the close in Toronto
yesterday. B2Gold fell 12 percent to C$3.79, its biggest decline
since October 2008. CGA has gained 32 percent this year and
B2Gold climbed 22 percent. The  Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold
and Silver Index (XAU) , which includes 30 mining companies, has gained
7.9 percent this year.  Immediate Leverage  B2Gold is currently forecast to produce about 350,000
ounces from three mines in 2012, according to yesterday’s
statement. The Masbate mine, which began operating in 2009, is
expected to produce about 200,000 ounces of gold in the year
through June.  “CGA and its flagship Masbate mine offers B2Gold
shareholders immediate leverage to a significantly larger
combined production profile,” Clive Johnson, chief executive
officer of Vancouver-based B2Gold, said in the statement.  Gold futures, which have gained 13 percent this year,
reached a six-month high of $1.781.80 an ounce on the Comex in
New York yesterday. Gold has risen for 11 straight years,
reaching a record $1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6, 2011, in  New
York , as investors buy the metal as a store of value and a hedge
against inflation.  “B2Gold is taking advantage of a strong share price and
valuation to add a steady producing asset with a long mine life
at what appears to be an attractive purchase price,” Steven J. Green, a Toronto-based analyst at TD Securities Inc., wrote in a
note yesterday.  Gold Deals  Excluding the B2Gold purchase, there have been $2.54
billion of takeovers of gold companies valued at $200 million or
more announced this year, with an average premium of 43 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There were about $11.6
billion of deals in the same period last year, the data show.  Investment in mining in the Philippines may miss a $16
billion target by 2016 after the government stopped issuing new
mining permits in January 2011, Philip Romualdez, president of
the Chamber of Mines business group, said at a forum in Manila
yesterday. An order from President  Benigno Aquino  in July
extended that moratorium and expanded a mining ban until
Congress passes a law giving the government a bigger share in
resource contracts.  The B2Gold takeover requires 75 percent of CGA shareholders
to vote in favor.  B2Gold was  founded  in 2007 by the former management team of
Bema Gold Corp., which was sold that year to  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) 
for C$3.67 billion. The company operates in  Nicaragua , is
developing a mine in  Namibia  and has a joint-venture project
with  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  in Colombia.  CGA is being advised by BMO  Capital Markets  and Haywood
Securities Inc. and its legal counsels are Blake, Cassels &
Graydon LLP in Canada and Middletons on Australia. Genuity
Canaccord Corp. is B2Gold’s financial adviser while its legal
counsels are Lawson Lundell LLP in Canada and  Squire Sanders  in
Australia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
