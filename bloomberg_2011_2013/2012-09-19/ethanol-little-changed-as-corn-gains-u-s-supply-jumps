Ethanol futures were steady in
 Chicago  after a government report showed stockpiles climbed to
the highest level in seven weeks and as rising corn prices
signaled higher production costs.  Prices slipped after the Energy Department said  inventories 
ballooned 2 percent to 19.3 million barrels, the largest gain
since July 27. Production rose 2.2 percent to 834,000 barrels a
day, the most since April 27.  “It has a very soft kind of feel to it,” said Jerrod
Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “The surprise was
the rise in production and it flowed right into the stockpiles.
That set the market on the defensive.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 0.2 cent to
$2.282 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 3.6 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast fell 1.5
cents to $2.39 a gallon, and the additive in  New York  lost 1.5
cents to $2.36, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1.5 cents to $2.28 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel slipped 2 cents to $2.34.  Corn for December delivery advanced 16.5 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $7.565 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for October delivery sank $3.31, or 3.5 percent,
to $91.98 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have
fallen 6.9 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery tumbled 7.04 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.8286 a gallon on the Nymex. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Gasoline narrowed its  premium  to ethanol to 54.66 cents
from 61.9 yesterday, making the biofuel less attractive to blend
for refiners, which stand to pocket the difference between the
two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
