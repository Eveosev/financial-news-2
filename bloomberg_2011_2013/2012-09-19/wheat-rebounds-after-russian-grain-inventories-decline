Wheat futures rose for the first
time in three days as grain inventories declined in  Russia , the
world’s third-biggest exporter.  Russia’s Federal State Statistical Service said yesterday
that grain stockpiles as of Sept. 1 dropped 21 percent from a
year earlier. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  has forecast
that Russia’s output will slump 31 percent following dry
weather.  Importers “will have to look elsewhere for grain,” Jon Marcus, the president of Lakefront Futures & Options, LLC in
 Chicago , said by telephone. “As a whole, that’s bullish for the
wheat market.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 2.1 percent to
$8.815 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. In the
previous two days, the price plunged 6.6 percent, the most since
July 24.  Russia may discuss a duty on shipments that would take
effect at a predetermined price level starting next year, the
country’s grain union said yesterday. The nation imposed a 10-
month ban on exports in 2010 after the worst drought in more
than 50 years seared fields.  In the 12 months that ended May 31, the U.S. was the top
exporter, followed by  Australia .  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
