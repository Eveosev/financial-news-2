William Hill Plc (WMH) , a U.K. bookmaker
with more than 2,000 outlets, said it’s considering a joint
offer with GVC Holdings Plc for online gambling company
 Sportingbet Plc. (SBT)   Sportingbet soared 17 percent in  London  trading, giving it a
market value of 340 million pounds ($552 million). William Hill
would buy the Australian and “certain other” locally licensed
businesses and GVC would purchase the rest, William Hill said in
a statement today. The two companies “believe that by acting in
combination they represent a highly credible possible offeror
for the entire Sportingbet business, substantially in cash.”  William Hill and competitors such as  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  are
seeking to expand online trading as more customers use mobile
and online devices to place bets and as U.S. states such as
Nevada consider legalising online gambling. Last year, Ladbrokes
said its talks on a possible offer for Sportingbet were
“mutually terminated.”  William Hill fell 1.9 percent to 312.6 pence in London,
while GVC rose 13 percent to 196.50 pence.  Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that in 79 deals since
2004 for western European gambling stocks, buyers paid an
average premium of almost 19 percent.  William Hill and GVC, an online gambling company based on
the  Isle of Man , must announce a firm intention to make an offer
for Sportingbet, or declare an intention not to do so, by no
later than Oct. 16, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
