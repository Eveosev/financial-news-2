Newsweek/Daily Beast Co., the news
business controlled by  Barry Diller ’s  IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , named
Baba Shetty as its next chief executive officer, replacing
Stephen Colvin.  Shetty, chief strategy and media officer at Boston-based
advertising firm Hill Holliday, will start in three weeks and
report to Editor-in-Chief Tina Brown and the Newsweek/Daily
Beast board, the company said today. Colvin, who joined the
Daily Beast before its merger with Newsweek in 2011, is leaving
for Lerer Ventures, a New York investment firm.  The Daily Beast was founded in 2008 by Brown, the former
editor of Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, and Diller, a
billionaire who owns a range of media and Internet properties.
The 2011 Newsweek merger was part of an agreement with the late
 Sidney Harman , who acquired the magazine from Washington
Post Co. for $1 and the assumption of liabilities.  IAC acquired a controlling stake in Newsweek/Daily Beast
Co. in late May after Harman’s family trust stopped making
capital contributions to the joint venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
