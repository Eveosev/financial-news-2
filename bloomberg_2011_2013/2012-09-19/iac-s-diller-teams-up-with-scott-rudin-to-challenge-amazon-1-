IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI)  Chairman  Barry Diller , producer Scott Rudin and publishing executive Frances
Coady are investing in a book venture that will attempt to
challenge Amazon.com Inc.’s dominance in the industry.  The project, called Brightline, is expected to release
fiction and nonfiction titles by mid-2013, New York-based IAC
said today in a statement. Brightline will make electronic books
for mobile devices using software by Brooklyn-based Atavist,
which will exchange minority equity interests with the venture.  “Publishing will change more in the next 10 years than it
has in the last hundred,” Diller said in the statement. “We
have the resources and they have the ability, using Atavist’s
technology and digital smarts, to play a continuing and
significant role in that transformation.”  Coady, who has been a publishing executive at Picador,
Granta and Random House UK, will be president and publisher of
Brightline. Rudin, whose films include “Moonrise Kingdom,”
“Moneyball” and “Zoolander,” will be a full partner in the
venture, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
