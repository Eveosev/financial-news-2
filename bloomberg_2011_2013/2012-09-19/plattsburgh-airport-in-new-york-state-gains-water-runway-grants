Plattsburgh’s airport in upstate
 New York  has been awarded $6.55 million in grants from the
 Federal Aviation Administration  for water and wastewater
improvements, to expand the terminal and to improve runways.  About $3.4 million of the funding will go toward completing
a water and wastewater infrastructure project at the terminal
and almost $3 million to expand it, U.S. Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand said in a statement with Senator Charles E. Schumer
and Congressman Bill Owens, all New York lawmakers.  The FAA grant will help the airport “serve residents,
businesses and visitors to the Plattsburgh and Montreal region,
all while boosting the area’s economy,” Schumer said. “These
new infrastructure projects will create jobs and increase
flights that are essential for growth in the area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
