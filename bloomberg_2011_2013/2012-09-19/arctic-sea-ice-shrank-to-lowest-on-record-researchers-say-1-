Arctic sea ice on Sept. 16 shrank
to its lowest ever in a satellite record stretching back 33
years, according to the  U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center .  Sea-ice cover shrank to 3.41 million square kilometers
(1.32 million square miles), 18 percent less than the previous
record from 2007, Boulder, Colorado-based NSIDC said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The shrinking Arctic ice cap is one of the most visible
signs of  climate change , according to NSIDC Director Mark Serreze.  “While we’ve long known that, as the planet warms up,
changes would be seen first and be most pronounced in the
Arctic, few of us were prepared for how rapidly the changes
would actually occur,” Serreze said in the statement. “We are
now in uncharted territory.”  Coverage melted to 4.17 million square kilometers in
September 2007. The average annual minimum area from 1979 to
2010 was 6.29 million square kilometers.  Sea ice melts every summer and typically begins freezing
again in September. The Sept. 16 figure will probably be the low
point for this year, NSIDC said. The research agency uses five-
day averages to calculate measurements to account for day-to-day
anomalies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
