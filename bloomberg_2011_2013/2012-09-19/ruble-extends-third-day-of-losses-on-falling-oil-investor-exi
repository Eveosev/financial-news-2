The ruble weakened for a third day,
as crude oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, fell and investors
began to close long positions on the currency.  The ruble depreciated 0.8 percent to 31.2125 as of 7 p.m.
in Moscow. It lost 0.8 percent against the euro and the central
bank’s target euro-dollar basket to 40.4650 and 35.5043,
respectively.  The Russian currency strengthened as much as 0.5 percent in
intraday trading as oil advanced on bets Japan’s expanded
program of monetary easing will bolster fuel demand. Oil slid
more than 3 percent to $92.36 per barrel in New York following a
U.S. Energy Department report that showed inventories surged the
most since March and on speculation Saudi Arabia is taking
action to reduce  oil prices . Oil and gas contribute about 50
percent of Russia’s state revenue.  “The drop in oil prices is significant and the ruble is
naturally taking a cue from the oil price movements,”  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist at Moscow-based  Renaissance Capital .
Market players continue to “lock in profits on the back of the
very fast ruble appreciation we had seen recently on the back of
Fed’s QE3,” he said.  The ruble surged the most against the dollar in more than
two years on Sept. 14 after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  promised to buy $40 billion of mortgage debt a month
and hold the federal funds rate near zero “at least through
mid-2015.” Russia’s central bank also unexpectedly raised the
refinancing rate last week to 8.25 percent from 8 percent.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.6758 a
dollar in three months compared with 31.4160 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  fell two basis points to 192,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
