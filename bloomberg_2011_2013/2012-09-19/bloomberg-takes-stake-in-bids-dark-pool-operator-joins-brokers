Bloomberg LP, the parent of
 Bloomberg News , bought a stake in Bids Trading LP, the operator
of a dark pool owned by more than a dozen financial firms. The
price wasn’t disclosed.  Bids, formed in 2006 by a half-dozen brokers including
Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS
AG, runs a private venue geared toward executing block trades
away from exchanges. It created a joint venture with  NYSE
Euronext (NYX)  in 2008 to enable orders sent to their respective firms
to trade with one another.  Bloomberg LP’s new Bloomberg Pool, or BPool,  service  will
allow traders to execute against buy and sell requests on the
company’s equities platforms or in the Bids dark pool, with
orders occurring through Bids, the company said today in a
statement. Mutual funds and institutional investors can trade on
the system through the broker they choose, Bloomberg LP said.  Raymond Tierney, president and chief executive officer of
 Bloomberg Tradebook , an agency broker owned by New York-based
Bloomberg LP, will join the Bids board, the announcement said.
