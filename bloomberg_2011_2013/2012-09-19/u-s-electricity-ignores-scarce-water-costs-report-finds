Power producers in the U.S. aren’t
calculating the cost of often scarce water resources for such
energy sources as nuclear, coal, natural gas and biomass,
according to a report.  The Civil Society Institute and the Environmental Working
Group report titled “ The Hidden Costs of Electricity: Comparing
the Hidden Costs of Power Generation Fuels ” found that crop
irrigation for a biomass plant can use as much a 100,000 gallons
of water to make 1 megawatt-hour, the groups said today in a
statement. Coal and nuclear use as much as 50,000 and 60,000
gallons for the same power, respectively.  The report, prepared by Synapse Energy Economics Inc.,
contrasted that to the amount of water used by photovoltaic and
dry-cooled solar thermal power and wind power, which require
little water use to make electricity.  Government and industry are “flying blind” in planning
for continued reliance on fossil fuels, nuclear and industrial
biomass, said Grant Smith, senior energy analyst at CSI. “Each
of these is water-intensive and leads to pollution of water,”
and are “increasingly scarce and in competition for other uses
such as agriculture and other commercial uses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
