Verbund AG (VER) , Austria’s biggest
utility, is considering whether to increase its investments in
Turkish hydropower, according to a company official.  The additional investment depends on  Turkey  allowing more
attractive prices with the liberalization of electricity markets
later this year and would be carried out via its Enerjisa Enerji
Uretim AS, said the official, declining to be identified because
the person isn’t allowed to speak publicly about the plans.  Enerjisa, which is jointly owned by Vienna-based Verbund
and Istanbul-based  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , aims to have
capacity of 5,000 megawatts by 2015. Should Verbund invest more
in Turkey, it would be willing to double that amount, according
to the official.  Stories on Verbund holding talks on selling its 50 percent
of Enerjisa to EON Ruhrgas AG may have been overinterpreted,
according to the official. Reuters reported the talks Aug. 17,
citing four unidentified people close to the deal.  Verbund Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Anzengruber told
journalists in Albania this week that while there were companies
interested in Verbund’s Enerjisa stake, the company didn’t want
to sell,  Austria  Press Agency said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
