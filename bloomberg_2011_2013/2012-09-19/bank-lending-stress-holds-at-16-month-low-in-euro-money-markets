European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest in more than 16 months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight indexed swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was
15.9 basis points, or 0.159 percentage point, at 8:45 a.m. in
London, from 16.2 basis points yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The gap is the smallest since April 28, 2011.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held at
the highest in a week. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap 
was little changed at 22 basis points below Euribor, the most
expensive since Sept. 12. The one-year basis swap was 27.5 basis
points below Euribor from minus 28 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.1
percent yesterday from 0.089 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was 8.3 basis points from 8 yesterday.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday, placing 318 billion euros ($416 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 306 billion euros the
day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
