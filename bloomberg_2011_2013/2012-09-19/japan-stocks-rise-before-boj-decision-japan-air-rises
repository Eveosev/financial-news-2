Japanese  stocks  gained, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average heading for its highest close since Aug.
23, ahead of a central bank announcement today. Japan Airlines
Co. gained after emerging from bankruptcy as the world’s most
profitable carrier.  Japan Airlines rose 1.2 percent as the shares started
trading after the $8.4 billion initial public offering, with the
stock accounted for 33 percent of turnover on the Topix Index.
Nissan Motor Co. rebounded from yesterday’s losses as the
carmaker said it will resume operations in China after violent
protests shut Japanese factories.  Uniden Corp. (6815) , an electronic-
equipment maker that gets almost 60 percent of its sales in
 North America , slid 1.6 percent after the yen strengthened.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 percent to 9,176.09 as of 12:36 p.m.
in  Tokyo , with volume 3.7 percent below the 30-day average as
investors await a policy decision from the  Bank of Japan . The
broader Topix added 0.2 percent to 759.71 after falling as much
as 0.2 percent earlier.  “The market is waiting to see how the BOJ decision affects
the  currency market ,” said Yoshihisa Okamoto, who helps oversee
about $34 billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The
yen may rise if it doesn’t ease monetary policy. Investors don’t
think the anti-Japan protests are having a big impact, so many
are buying back shares that fell yesterday.”  -- With assistance from Adam Haigh in Sydney. Editors: Jim Powell, Jason Clenfield  To contact the reporter on this story:
