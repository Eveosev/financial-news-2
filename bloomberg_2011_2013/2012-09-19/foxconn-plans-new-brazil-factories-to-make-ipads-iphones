Foxconn Technology Group (2354) , maker of
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad and iPhone, will invest 1 billion reais ($494
million) to build factories near  Sao Paulo .  Foxconn will have as many as five manufacturing plants in
Itu city and will create 10,000 jobs, Simon Hsing, a spokesman
for Foxconn’s Taipei-based flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry
Co., said in the Taiwanese capital today. The new facilities,
where production will begin in 2014 and reach full capacity in
two years, will enable most aspects of iPad and iPhone assembly,
Hsing said, confirming a report by Agencia Estado.  Expanding in Brazil will help Foxconn, which  employs  more
than 1 million people globally, make devices closer to consumers
in  South America  for clients including  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  and
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  Most Apple and HP devices are made in China,
where Foxconn has the majority of its workforce.  The new plants will be located at an industrial park in
Itu, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Sao Paulo, Hsing said.
Foxconn has  operated  in Brazil since 2005, and has five plants
in Sao Paulo, including an assembly plant for Apple products in
Jundiai.  Foxconn won’t benefit from special tax incentives from the
Sao Paulo government, Hsing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
