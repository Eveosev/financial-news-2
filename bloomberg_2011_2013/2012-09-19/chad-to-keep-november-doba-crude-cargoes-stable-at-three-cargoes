Chad plans to export three cargoes
of Doba crude in November, including one lot deferred from next
month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  Shipments in October were revised down to three
consignments from four, according to a separate plan. All
cargoes are for 950,000 barrels each.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  operates the field. Loading programs are
monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators
to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
