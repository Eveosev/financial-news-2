Germany  needs to reassess plans to
expand its  power grid  that seek to accommodate increased use of
renewable generation as they are probably too large and fail to
utilize the best routes, an environmental campaign group said.  “We need grid expansion for the energy switch but we
likely need less and different routes than have been proposed to
date,” said Werner Neumann, an energy spokesman for BUND.  Germany needs as many as 8,200 kilometers (5,100 miles) of
new and upgraded lines as it carries out plans to shutter atomic
reactors by 2022 in the biggest energy-infrastructure overhaul
since World War II, the four German grid operators said in May.  Bundesnetzagentur, the federal grid regulator, needs to
question such proposals because they would also benefit coal-
fired power plants, BUND said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
