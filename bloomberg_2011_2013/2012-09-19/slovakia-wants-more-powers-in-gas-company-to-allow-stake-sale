Slovakia will allow E.ON Ruhrgas AG
and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  to sell their stake in the country’s biggest gas
company if the government gains more power over the company’s
management, premier  Robert Fico  said.  The German and French utilities are in talks with
Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS, a Czech private-equity
group, about the sale of their 49 percent stake in Slovensky
Plynarensky Priemysel AS. The Slovak government has a right to
veto the transfer or be the first buyer of the stake, which it
sold in 2002 to the two companies for $2.7 billion together with
management rights, Fico said today.  “Should the state agree with the transfer, the position of
the state will significantly strengthen,” Fico said at a press
conference in Bratislava, Slovakia.  The Cabinet also asked the  Economy Ministry  to analyze an
option involving the state buying the stake back and regaining
full control over Slovensky, which makes most of its profit from
operating a section of a pipeline transferring OAO Gazprom’s gas
to western  Europe .  The utility last year posted after-tax profit of 564
million euros ($733 million), little changed from 2010.
Slovensky said the result was affected by a 50 million-euro loss
on sales to domestic clients because of government-imposed price
caps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
