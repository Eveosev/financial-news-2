West Virginia  will receive federal
funding to expand water supplies to homes and businesses in the
Barkers Ridge and Basin areas of Wyoming County.  West Virginia Representative Nick Rahall, a Democrat whose
district includes coal-mining areas, announced $1.5 million in
funding yesterday to expand water service in the area.  “A dependable drinking water system is the wellspring of
better health for our families and for attracting new business
investments and job opportunities in our region,” Rahall said
of the funds awarded by the Appalachian Regional Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
