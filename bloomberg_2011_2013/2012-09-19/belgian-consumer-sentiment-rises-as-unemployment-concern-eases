Belgian  consumer confidence 
improved in September as concern about an increase in
unemployment subsided and the outlook for the economic situation
remained stable.  The consumer sentiment index for Belgium, the euro area’s
sixth-largest economy, increased to minus 14 from minus 16 a
month earlier, the Brussels-based National Bank of Belgium said
today in an e-mailed statement.  A sub-index gauging households’ assessment of the economy
in the coming year held at minus 11, and a gauge measuring
concerns about rising unemployment dropped to 40 from 46 in
August. A sub-index gauging households’ capacity to save in the
next 12 months rose to minus 1 from minus 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
