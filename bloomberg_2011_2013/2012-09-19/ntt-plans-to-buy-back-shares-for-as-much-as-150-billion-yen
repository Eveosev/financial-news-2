Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. ,  Japan ’s biggest fixed-line phone company, plans to buy
back up to 3.4 percent of its shares for as much as 150 billion
yen ($1.9 billion).  NTT will buy back as many as 42 million shares of common
stock from tomorrow until March 29 “to improve capital
efficiency,” the company said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today.  The shares fell 0.6 percent to 3,600 yen before the
announcement and have declined 8.5 percent this year, compared
with a 9.2 percent year-to-date gain for Japan’s benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Japan’s finance ministry  owns  32.6
percent of Tokyo-based NTT, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The phone operator repurchased 41.8 million shares for 158
billion yen in February.  The company forecasts net income of 575 billion yen for the
year ending March 31, compared with 467.7 billion yen the
previous 12-month period.  NTT’s  credit  is rated Aa2, the third-highest investment
grade, by Moody’s Investors Service and AA, also the third-
highest level, by  Standard & Poor’s . Both ratings are issued
with a stable outlook.  To contact the reporters on this story:
