Ridge Islamic Capital, a Sharia-
compliant investment bank, is seeking to expand its activities
in  Egypt  and the region as the  Islamic finance  industry is
expected to grow.  The Egyptian government is looking to raise the market
share of Islamic finance to 35 percent from 5 percent and Ridge
is positioning itself to take advantage of that by offering
investment products compliant with the principles of Islamic
law, the company told reporters in Cairo today.  “We’re targeting a $150 million fund-of-funds to be
launched by the end of this year or early next year with 20 to
30 portfolios under management across sectors in the  Middle
East , North Africa, and Gulf regions,” said Ritjana Ceveli,
managing director of asset management.  Ridge expects to add brokerage services to its current
offering of asset, wealth and fund management, she said.  “We’re identifying opportunities at three companies and
assessing their potential for acquisition,” Ceveli said in an
interview. “We hope to conclude this by early to mid next
year.”  Ridge, based in Cairo, was set up in May after acquiring El
Rashad, an Egyptian investment bank. It has 22.5 million pounds
($3.7 million) in capital and a total of 20 million pounds of
assets under management for Misr Iran Bank fund, as well as
about 100 private clients, Miguel Henriques, chief
executive officer, said in a phone interview. The Islamic
investment bank is owned by Ridge Solutions, an Angola-based
holding company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
