Kuwait is facing a delay in
developing the offshore Dorra natural-gas field as  Saudi Arabia ,
which co-owns the deposit, wants to change the delivery point of
the fuel, according to an official.  Engineering and design work were undertaken on the project
based on shipment of gas to the partners offshore at the
production site and Saudi Arabia now wants the fuel to be
delivered elsewhere, Hashim al-Rifaai, chairman and managing
director of Kuwait Gulf Oil Co., told reporters in Dubai today.  “We are still drilling, things are still going as
planned,” al-Rifaai said. If the issue isn’t resolved by the
end of the year, the project would be completed in 2015, a year
later than planned, he said.  The Kuwaitis don’t know why the Saudis want to change the
plans, al-Rifaai said. There is no financial benefit to changing
the offloading location, he said. The project would initially
produce 600 million cubic feet a day and eventually reach 1
billion, which would be shared equally between the two
countries, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
