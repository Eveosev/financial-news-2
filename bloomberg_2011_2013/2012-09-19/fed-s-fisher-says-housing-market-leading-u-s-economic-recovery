President  Richard Fisher  said the housing market is leading the
U.S. economic recovery, which he said hasn’t been assisted much
by the Fed’s purchases of bonds.  “The housing market is on the move,” Fisher said today on
 Bloomberg Radio ’s “Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays . “My
views haven’t changed. I question the efficacy of these large-
scale asset purchases.”  Fisher, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year,
opposed the Federal Open Market Committee decision last week to
expand its holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month. The Fed seeks
through a third round of quantitative easing to boost growth and
reduce 8.1 percent unemployment.  “We saw a pop in the equity market” following the move,
Fisher said. “That seems to have fizzled a little bit.”
Inflation expectations also have increased following the Fed
decision, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
