Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  will sell as
much as 90 percent of the output from its liquefied natural gas
project in  Corpus Christi , Texas, under long-term contracts.  The planned Corpus Christi site will produce 13 million to
15 million metric tons a year of LNG, Charif Souki, chief
executive officer at Houston-based Cheniere, said today in an
interview at a natural gas conference in Tokyo.  The company plans to follow the contracting model
established at its Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, Souki
said. Sixteen million tons of LNG from Sabine Pass, from a total
output of 18 million tons, will be sold on long-term contracts
of as long as 20 years, with the rest to be offered on the spot
market, he said.  “Those are the volumes that we’re not sure we can produce
year after year so these will remain in the  spot market ,” he
said. The first spot cargoes from Sabine Pass will reach the
market in late 2015 or early 2016, he said.  Cheniere’s Sabine Pass site is the first in the contiguous
U.S. to be able to export LNG. The project is expected to cost
about $5.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
