Indian stocks declined the most in
three weeks, tracking losses in Asian equities, after Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s largest ally said it was exiting the
coalition over reforms announced last week.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 0.8 percent
to 18,349.25 at the close, its steepest decline since Aug. 29.
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, retreated to a one-week low.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the
third-biggest lender by value, dropped the most in two weeks.  Singh unveiled last week the biggest policy overhaul of his
second term by ending a 14-month freeze in diesel prices to
lower the government’s fiscal deficit and allowing more foreign
investment in aviation and retail sectors. The moves pushed up
the Sensex to a 14-month high on Sept. 17. Trinamool Congress
ministers will be pulled from the federal cabinet on Sept. 21,
party leader  Mamata Banerjee  said Sept. 18, allowing a few days
that could be a window for compromise.  “There is a bit of political instability and there is
always a worry this government may not be able to complete its
full term,” Nirmal Jain, chairman of Mumbai-based brokerage
 IIFL Ltd. (IIFL) , told Bloomberg TV India today. “The markets have
turned cautious and will consolidate at current levels.”  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  slid 1.1 percent, the most
since July 23, as the Shanghai Composite Index declined to the
lowest since February 2009. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index slid 0.3 percent as euro-area services and factory output
declined to a 39-month low in September, and  China ’s
manufacturing probably contracted for an 11th month, according
to data from Markit Economics and HSBC Holdings Plc.  ‘Unwarranted Euphoria’  Reliance dropped 2.7 percent to 832.50 rupees, the lowest
close since Sept. 13, amid a change in recommendation by Kotak
Institutional Equities to “sell” from “reduce.” The broker
advised selling into the “unwarranted euphoria” that’s pushed
up the stock 10 percent this month. ICICI Bank fell 2.5 percent
to 1,022.55 rupees, the sharpest drop since Sept. 5.  Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the nation’s top supermarket
operator, fell 2.9 percent to 174.6 rupees. Budget carrier
 SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET)  decreased 3.4 percent to 36.8 rupees.  Losing the backing of Trinamool puts the government about
24 seats short of a majority in the lower house of Parliament,
though Singh’s administration has in the past won expressions of
support from other groups in the legislature. The proposal to
allow foreign investment in retailers stalled in December amid
opposition from Trinamool.  ‘Brink of Defeat’  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have threatened to
lower the nation’s credit rating as the government struggled to
implement policies to revive investment. The economy grew 5.5
percent in the June quarter, near the slowest pace in three
years. Growth could ease to 5 percent annually if the policy
paralysis persists, Singh said on Sept. 15.  “We’re going to see the investment cycle become very
difficult because of this particular development,” Raamdeo
Agrawal, joint managing director at Motilal Oswal Financial
Services Ltd. in Mumbai, told Bloomberg TV India today. “The
government is almost on the brink of getting defeated.”  Last week’s announcements drove foreign funds to invest a
net $951 million on Sept. 14 and 17, the biggest two-day net
purchases of  Indian (SENSEX)  equities in almost nine months. They bought
a net $201.1 million of shares on Sept. 18, the ninth straight
day of purchase, data from the market regulator show.  The market was closed yesterday for a public holiday.  The Sensex has climbed 19 percent this year after offshore
investors bought a net $14 billion of stocks, the most among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg outside China. The 30-stock
measure trades at 14.5 times  estimated profit , more than the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 11.2 multiple, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Indian gauge’s valuation is still
below its 2012 high of 16.2 reached in February.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  raised its June 2013 target for the Sensex
by 8 percent to 19,900 on prospects of increased foreign flows,
and Deutsche Bank AG increased its year-end forecast for the
gauge by 11 percent to 20,000, the brokerages said in notes to
clients on Sept. 17.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index fell 0.8 percent to 5,554.25 and
its September futures settled at 5,560.50. The BSE-200 Index
dropped 0.7 percent. The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
and the BSE Ltd. traded 1.2 billion shares on Sept. 18, 33
percent more than the 12-month daily average of 883 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
