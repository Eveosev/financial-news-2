Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
company, reported a natural gasdiscovery in Pakistan, a country
where reserves have been in decline.  The find was made 350 kilometers (269 miles) north of
Karachi in the Khirtar Fold Belt region. The well was drilled in
the Badhra Area B block to a depth of 2,450 meters, Eni said in
a statement today.  Eni said the size of the discovery was probably 300 billion
to 400 billion cubic feet of gas in place. Pakistan’s total gas
reserves were 27.5 trillion cubic feet at the end of 2011, down
5.5 percent from a year earlier, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  The discovery is 20 kilometers east of Eni’s Bhit gas
processing facility and the company said it has already started
discussions with the Pakistani regulator to speed up the
production from the discovery. The company produced
approximately 54,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2011
in  Pakistan , making the Rome-based explorer the country’s
largest producer.  “The drilling of Badhra North B-1 is part of Eni’s new
strategy in Pakistan which aims to refocus exploration
activities in the neighboring areas to productive fields,” the
company said.  The Badhra block is operated by Eni, with a 40 percent
stake in the project,  Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , which has 6 percent,
Kufpec Pakistan Ltd. with 34 percent and Oil &  Gas Development (OGDC) 
Company Ltd., which has 20 percent.  Premier Oil’s  shares  rose as much as 3.2 percent, to 391.4
pence. They were  trading  at 383.5 pence as of 9:56 a.m. London
time. Eni SpA’s shares were up 0.7 percent at 18.42 euros after
reaching a  high  of 18.56 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
