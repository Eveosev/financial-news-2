Rates to ship liquefied natural gas
will probably be lower than expected in the fourth quarter and
first three months of 2013, Fearnley Securities AS said, while
reiterating its recommendation to buy the shares of the
companies carrying the fuel.  The vessels will earn an average of $125,000 a day in the
fourth quarter and first three months of next year, the Oslo-
based investment bank said in an e-mailed report today, lowering
prior estimates of $150,000. Declining LNG prices in  Japan  have
narrowed the gap with costs in the Atlantic region, eliminating
the profit from transporting the fuel to  Asia , Fearnley said.  “We are still long-term positive to the LNG market,” the
bank said. Shares of  Golar LNG Ltd. (GLNG) , which has the largest
number of LNG tankers on order, will probably rise 19 percent to
$47 within 12 months, Fearnley said. The company, based in
Hamilton,  Bermuda , will report earnings per share of 54 cents in
the third quarter and 63 cents in the following three months,
the bank estimated. It made 44 cents in the second quarter.  A colder winter in North Asia would be needed to boost
shipments from the Atlantic by opening a so-called price
arbitrage, Fearnley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
