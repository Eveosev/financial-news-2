Australia ’s currency fell to its
lowest in more than a week after a gauge signaled Chinese
manufacturing may contract for an 11th month, clouding prospects
for the South Pacific nation’s resource exports.  The so-called Aussie weakened versus all of its 16 major
counterparts before data today that may show factory output and
services in the 17-nation euro region shrank.  New Zealand ’s
dollar, known as the kiwi, slid as Asian stocks declined. It
rose earlier after government figures showed the nation’s
second-quarter growth exceeded economist estimates.  “The market was probably expecting a bit more of a
bounce” in the Chinese data, said Emma Lawson, a Sydney-based
currency strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. “The Aussie
is a little bit lower. There’s just a little bit of
disappointment there.”  The Aussie lost 0.8 percent to $1.0392 as of 4:24 p.m. in
Sydney after earlier touching $1.0379, the lowest since Sept.
11. It fell to 81.08 yen, the weakest since Sept. 13, before
trading at 81.20 yen, 1.1 percent below its close in  New York .
The kiwi dropped 0.4 percent to 82.31 U.S. cents after gaining
as much as 0.4 percent. It declined 0.7 percent to 64.33 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares slid 1.3 percent, set
for its biggest one-day loss since July 23.  Chinese Manufacturing  A preliminary reading released today showed a gauge by
 Markit Economics  and HSBC Holdings Plc for manufacturing in
 China  was 47.8 this month from 47.6 in August. The index is
based on a poll of purchasing managers in the industry. China is
Australia’s largest trading partner and New Zealand’s second-
biggest export destination.  “I can see the currency moving a little lower as people
are concerned about the Chinese economy,” Matthew Lifson, a
foreign exchange trader at Cambridge Mercantile Group, said on
Bloomberg Television today. The Aussie may end the year at
$1.0150, he said.  A separate euro-zone  composite index  for manufacturing and
services was probably at 46.6 this month, little changed from
46.3 in August, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Markit will also release the figure
today. For both measures, a reading below 50 indicates
contraction.  Australia’s dollar fell 3.1 percent in the past month, the
worst performance among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. New Zealand’s dollar
lost 0.6 percent.  The so-called kiwi gained earlier against the  U.S. dollar 
and Japanese yen after  Statistics New Zealand  said in a report
 gross domestic product  rose 2.6 percent in the three months
ended June from a year earlier, the fastest pace in two years.  The GDP report “is a genuine upside surprise,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in Auckland at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,
Australia’s second-largest lender. “I think we’ll have some
reverberation throughout the day for the currency.”  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, lost 1 1/2 basis points to 2.695
percent. Australia’s 10-year yield declined 11 basis points to
3.24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
