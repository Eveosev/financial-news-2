Russia’s poultry output increased
about 16 percent to 277,000 metric tons in August compared with
a year earlier, the state statistics service said.  Meat from cattle rose 4.4 percent to 110,000 tons in the
month and pork production gained 8.9 percent to 76,900 tons, the
service, known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed statement today.
The figures include byproducts.  Production of cattle and poultry in so-called live weight,
which includes meat, bones and byproducts, advanced 8.8 percent
to 6.6 million tons in the January-through-August period
compared with a year earlier, the service said.  Cattle and poultry output was 900,000 tons in August, up
8.6 percent from a year earlier, the service said.  Cattle numbers increased 1.2 percent to 21.2 million head
by the end of August compared with a year earlier, the service
said. That number included 9.1 million cows, 2.1 percent more
than a year earlier. The hog count rose 5 percent to 19.7
million animals, while sheep and goats gained 7.6 percent to 27
million, Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
