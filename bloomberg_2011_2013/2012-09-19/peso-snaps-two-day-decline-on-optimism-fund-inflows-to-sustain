The Philippine peso snapped a two-
day decline on speculation bond-buying programs announced by the
Bank of  Japan , the  European Central Bank  and the  Federal Reserve 
will underpin demand for the nation’s assets.  The currency traded near the strongest level since April
2008 before a central bank report today that Security Bank Corp.
predicts will show a fourth month of surplus in the country’s
balance of payments. Overseas investors purchased $2.2 billion
more of local stocks than they sold this year through yesterday,
compared with $484 million a year earlier.  “The open-ended quantitative easing policies will push
liquidity into Asian currencies and there will be winners
including the peso,” said Patrick Ella, an economist in  Manila 
at Security Bank. “There’s been some occasional market pullback
but overall equity inflows have been strong.”  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 41.622 per dollar as of 4
p.m. local time, data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. The
currency may reach 41 by year-end, Ella forecast, a level not
seen since March 2008. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 15
basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 5.25 percent.  The nation may record a $1 billion balance-of-payments
surplus in August, Security Bank predicts, compared with $3.2
billion in July.  Fed Boost  The peso extended gains after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
unexpectedly eased monetary policy today by expanding its asset-
buying fund by 10 trillion yen ($126.5 billion). The Fed said
Sept. 13 it will increase its holdings of long-term securities
with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a
month, while pledging to hold  interest rates  near zero at least
through mid-2015. The European Central Bank agreed this month to
unlimited bond-buying.  Standard Chartered Plc said in research note today the U.S.
quantitative easing program is a “net positive” for inflows
for Asian currencies. The bank recommended on Sept. 14 buying
three-month non-deliverable peso forwards at 41.55, targeting an
advance to 40.25.  The yield on the 8 percent government bonds due July 2031
dropped for a second day, easing one basis point to 5.67
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The treasury
will auction 9 billion pesos ($216 million) of 2032 notes on
Sept. 25.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept its overnight rate at a
record-low 3.75 percent on Sept. 13. There is still room for the
central bank to lower the rate to 3.5 percent later this year,
Ella said, even as the government boosts spending to shore up
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
