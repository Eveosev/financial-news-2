Sugar mills in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest-producing region, will make less of
the sweetener than previously expected as yields decline, said
Plinio Nastari, head of industry researcher Datagro Ltd.  The region, which accounts for about 90 percent of the
South American country’s sugar and ethanol output, will likely
produce 31.3 million metric tons of the sweetener in the
2012-2013 crop year that started on May 1, down from a previous
forecast of 32.7 million tons, Nastari said today at an event in
Sao Paulo.  Center-South mills will produce less sweetener than
expected because the sugarcane that is being processed is not
yielding as much sucrose as expected, Nastari said. Sucrose is
the substance that is processed into sugar and ethanol.  Mills in the region will process 512.1 million tons of
sugarcane, more than the 508.7 million tons Datagro estimated
before. Ethanol output is forecast at 20.5 billion liters, more
than the 20.3 billion forecast before, Nastari said.  The region will export 22.3 million tons of sugar and 1.75
billion liters of ethanol from the current harvest in the crop
year that started in May, he said.  For all of Brazil, the sugar production outlook was cut to
35.7 million tons from 37.2 million, while the estimate for
sugarcane crushing was raised to 572.6 million tons from 570.8
million, Nastari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
