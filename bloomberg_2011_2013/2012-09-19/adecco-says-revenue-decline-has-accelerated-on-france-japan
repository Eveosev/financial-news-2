  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest
provider of temporary workers, said its sales accelerated their
decline in the first two months of the third quarter, mostly
because of the French and Japanese markets.  Revenue fell 4.5 percent on an organic basis and adjusted
for business days, the Glattbrugg, Switzerland-based company
said in a statement today. The decline was 4 percent in the
second quarter.  “Revenue developments in  Europe  remained largely unchanged
in July and August, while revenue growth in  North America 
continued its good trend and was slightly accelerating since
June,” the company said.  Adecco last month reported a 20 percent decline in second-
quarter profit and said there’s no sign of an end to the
European downturn. The company today reiterated its goal of a
margin for earnings before interest, tax and amortization
exceeding 5.5 percent in the mid-term.  Adecco is holding a presentation in Paris for investors
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
