Canadian wheat output may rise 6.9
percent in the 2012-13 season on a larger planted area, the
government said.  The harvest, including durum, may rise to 27.01 million
metric tons in the marketing year that started Aug. 1, up from
an estimated 25.26 million a year earlier, Agriculture and Agri-
Food  Canada  said in an e-mailed report yesterday. In August, the
government estimated that production this season would total
26.7 million tons. Yields are expected to be “marginally”
lower. Output includes 4.27 million tons of durum, used to make
pasta.  In western Canada, the main wheat-growing region, the
“harvest has been completed much earlier than usual” because
of early spring planting, the government said. “In eastern
Canada, corn and soybeans are also expected to be harvested
ahead of normal.”  Canada may harvest wheat on 9.35 million hectares (23.1
million acres) in the 2012-13 season, up from 8.54 million
hectares a year earlier, according to the report. Yields were
expected to average 2.89 tons per hectare, compared with 2.96
tons per hectare a year earlier, the government said.  Canola production may increase to 15.41 million tons from
14.49 million a year earlier, the agency said. Corn output was
pegged at 11.7 million tons, up from 10.69 million in the
previous season, while barley production may total 9.51 million
tons, more than the 7.76 million harvested a year earlier,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
