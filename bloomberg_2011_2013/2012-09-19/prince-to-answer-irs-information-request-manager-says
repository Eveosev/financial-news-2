The business manager for Prince Rogers Nelson, the recording artist known as Prince, said her
client will respond to a request from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service for tax information.  The manager, Debra Whelan, said in an e-mailed statement
today that until the inquiry was disclosed in the press, she was
unaware of a “routine request” from the IRS claiming Prince
failed to comply with a summons issued on behalf of French tax
authorities.  “The IRS had incorrect information for service and left
the notice at an address of record,” Whelan said in the
statement. “Now that the matter has been brought to our
attention, we will promptly respond and provide the requested
information.”  The IRS asked the musician to appear in response to a
inquiry from its French counterpart “to examine the French
income tax liability of Mr. Prince Rogers Nelson for tax years
2009 and 2010,” according to the documents filed this week in
federal court in  Minneapolis .  Prince hasn’t responded, the IRS said. The petition asks
the court to enforce the summons. A hearing on the matter is
scheduled for Oct. 18 before U.S. District Judge David S. Doty.  The French government lodged its request in July 2011 in a
letter listing several concerts it believed Prince had played in
France during the two years at question and asking for
additional documentation about the relationship between the
artist and the production and recording company Paisley Park
Enterprises Inc.  The case is U.S. v. Nelson, 12-mc-00071, U.S. District
Court, District of Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
