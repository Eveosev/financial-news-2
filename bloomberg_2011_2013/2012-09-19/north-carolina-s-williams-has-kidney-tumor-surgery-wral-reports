University of North Carolina  men’s
basketball coach  Roy Williams  is expected to resume coaching
duties prior to the start of practice next month after surgery
today to remove a tumor from his right kidney, the school said.  The 62-year-old coach, a two-time national champion and
 Basketball Hall of Fame  inductee, was in surgery for 3 1/2 hours
this morning, the school’s athletic department said in an e-
mailed statement. He is expected to be coaching when the Tar
Heels begin practice on Oct. 13.  “Our thoughts and prayers are with Coach Williams and his
family for a full recovery,” Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham
said in the statement. “We will be ready for his return as soon
as he is able to do so, but I have stressed to him that he
returns only when he has been given the medical approval and he
is ready to do that. Hopefully that will be soon and for a long,
long time to come.”  Doctors found the tumor during a physical exam this month,
according to the school. Williams may have a second procedure on
his left kidney later and “could be sidelined for a few
practices,” the school said in the release. It gave no details
on the tumor.  Williams arrived at the school in  Chapel Hill  prior to the
2003-04 season after 15 years at the University of  Kansas . He
led the Tar Heels to National Collegiate Athletic Association
championships in 2005 and 2009, and a semifinal appearance in
2008.  He is 675-169 in his coaching career, and was inducted into
the Hall of Fame in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
