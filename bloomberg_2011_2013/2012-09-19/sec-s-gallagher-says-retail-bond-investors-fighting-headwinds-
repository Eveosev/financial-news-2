The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission should scrutinize corporate bond markets to determine
if retail investors can find fair prices, said Commissioner
Daniel Gallagher.  Gallagher, a Republican on the five-member commission that
regulates securities trading, called for the agency to look at
the imbalance of information available to retail investors and
institutional traders in a speech yesterday at a financial-
markets conference hosted by  Georgetown University ’s McDonough
School of Business in Washington.  “Retail investors continue to face significant headwinds
in the bond markets,” Gallagher said. “Unlike their large
institutional counterparts, retail investors generally have less
expertise in the basics of bond trading and cannot tap into
large dealer networks for quotes in order to shop around for the
best prices available.”  Gallagher said the SEC issued a report this year on the
state of the municipal  securities market  and should consider a
similar effort with the corporate bond market, “given how large
and important that market has become.” That doesn’t necessarily
mean more regulation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
