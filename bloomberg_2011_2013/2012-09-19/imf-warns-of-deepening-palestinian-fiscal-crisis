The  International Monetary
Fund  warned today that the Palestinian economy is facing
“serious risks” and urged the government to implement a
contingency plan to cover its “financing gap.”  Donor aid has been lower than needed to finance the
Palestinian Authority’s budget, and there is a projected
financing gap of $400 million for 2012, the IMF said in a report
today. The financing difficulties in 2011 and this year have led
to a “substantial rise” in domestic payment arrears and debt
to commercial banks, it said.  “Given the high risk of continued aid shortfalls, it is
important for the PA to promptly implement a contingency plan to
cover the financing gap,” the IMF said in the 40-page report.  Hundreds of people demonstrated in West Bank cities this
month to protest economic conditions, with some demanding the
resignation of  Palestinian Authority  Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. On Sept. 11, Fayyad said his government would take steps
to cut the price of fuel and other goods and to pay the salaries
of civil servants, which had been delayed.  The IMF report was prepared before a Sept. 23 meeting of
the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, a forum that coordinates donations
to the Palestinian Authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
