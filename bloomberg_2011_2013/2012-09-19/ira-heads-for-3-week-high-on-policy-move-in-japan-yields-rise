The lira headed for the highest in
more than three weeks after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  unexpectedly
expanded its asset-purchase program and the Turkish central bank
cut overnight lending rates by less than forecast.  The lira gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.7962 per dollar
at 6:03 p.m. in Istanbul, poised for the highest since Aug. 23.
Yields on two-year benchmark bonds rose seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 7.39 percent.  Turkey’s central bank yesterday reduced its overnight rate,
the top end of its so-called interest-rate corridor, by 150
basis points to 10 percent, according to its website. The bank
held its one-week repo cost at 5.75 percent, the bottom end of
its rates band. The Bank of  Japan  lifted the size of its asset-
purchase fund by 10 trillion yen ($126 billion), seeking to
stimulate growth in the world’s third-largest economy.  “It seems that the market feared a bigger rate cut and is
happy with the 150 basis point cut,”  Murat Toprak , head of
currency strategy for Europe, the Middle East and  Africa  at
HSBC, said in e-mailed comments.  Two other factors may also be behind a stronger lira,
Toprak said, pointing to the squeezing of short lira positions
built up in the past one or two months and the BoJ’s
expansionary monetary policy move today.  One-year  interest-rate swaps  fell for the first time in
three days to 7.04 percent.  Yesterday’s cut was the first time central bank Governor
Erdem Basci has changed the range of his interest-rate corridor
since lowering the top end by 100 basis points in February.  The lira appreciated 1.4 percent this month, the second-
worst among 10 currencies tracked by Bloomberg in Europe, Africa
and the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
