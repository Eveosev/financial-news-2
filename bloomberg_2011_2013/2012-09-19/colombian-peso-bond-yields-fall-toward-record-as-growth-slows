Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields toward a record low, on speculation slowing economic
growth will keep inflation near the central bank’s target.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in July 2024 dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.54 percent, according to the central
bank. It fell to 6.50 percent on Sept. 13, the lowest closing
level since the securities were first issued in 2009.  “People aren’t very optimist on growth,” said Juan Camilo
Santana, an analyst at Cia. de Profesionales de Bolsa SA
brokerage in Bogota. “Slowing growth translates into controlled
inflation, which makes bonds in the long end of the curve
attractive.”  Colombia’s economic expansion slowed to 4.2 percent in the
second quarter from 4.7 percent in the first three months of the
year, according to the median forecast of 29 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The government is scheduled to release the figures
tomorrow.  Consumer prices rose 3.11 percent in the 12 months through
August, near the mid-point of the central bank’s 2 percent to 4
percent annual target range.  Colombia’s borrowing costs fell at the government’s last
competitive auction of inflation-linked bonds, known as TES UVR,
this year. The  Finance Ministry  sold 200 billion pesos ($111
million) of securities due in March 2021 to yield 2.9 percent,
down from 3.5 percent in the previous auction on Aug. 15.  The peso closed little changed at 1,796.68 per  U.S. dollar .
The currency has gained 7.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
