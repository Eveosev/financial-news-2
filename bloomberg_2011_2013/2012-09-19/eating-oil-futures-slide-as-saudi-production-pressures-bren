Heating oil fell to the lowest
level in almost a month as  Brent crude , a benchmark for more
than half of the world’s oil, weakened on speculation that  Saudi
Arabia  is increasing supply.  Futures slid as Brent dropped as much as 3.1 percent, which
could reduce the price of imported crude used to manufacture
products. Saudi Arabia is pumping about 10 million barrels a day
of crude and will produce more if customers demand it, a Persian
Gulf official with knowledge of the matter said yesterday.
Gasoil dropped 2.8 percent in London, reducing the incentive to
ship fuel from the U.S. to Europe.  “Heating oil has gone down as Brent is under pressure as
the Saudis feel the current price is too high and they have been
increasing production,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for October delivery fell 6.03 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.0668 a gallon at 9:56 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  Brent for November settlement declined $2.85, or 2.5
percent, to $109.18 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Gasoil for October delivery fell $27.25 to $961.25 a ton.  The ideal price of crude for OPEC is $100 a barrel and
current prices are not supported by the fundamentals, the
Persian Gulf official said, declining to be identified because
he’s not authorized to speak publicly.  “The pledge by the Saudis to keep pumping oil has been
overhanging the market,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in Washington.  Inventory Survey  The department will probably report that distillate
inventories, which include heating oil and diesel, increased 1
million barrels, according to the median estimate of nine
analysts in a survey by  Bloomberg News . Gasoline inventories
rose 1 million barrels last week, the survey showed.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that  gasoline stockpiles  rose 135,000 barrels and
 distillate supplies  fell 1.12 million barrels.  October-delivery gasoline fell 5.62 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $2.8428 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump fell 0.5 cent to $3.854 a
gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. Prices reached a 2012 high of
$3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
