Treasury 10-year yields failed to
hold above a technical barrier, indicating they may decline,
according to Scotiabank, citing trading patterns.  Yields were as high as 1.89 percent on Sept. 14, rising
through the 200-day moving average of 1.83 percent. The rate
dropped below the  bar  yesterday, a sign yields will have trouble
sustaining increases, said Ali Jalai, who trades  U.S. debt  in
Singapore at Scotiabank, a unit of  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , one of
the 21 primary dealers that underwrite the U.S. debt.  “Ten-year yields should fall from here,” Jalai said. The
rate may drop 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, by the
end of next week, he said.  U.S. 10-year  rates  increased two basis points today to 1.82
percent as of 7:24 a.m. in London, Bloomberg Bond Trader data
show. The price of the 1.625 percent note due August 2022 slid
1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 6/32.  Bonds fell today after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  increased the
amount of money it plans to pump into the economy, driving gains
in Asian stocks and sending Treasuries lower as money managers
sought higher-yielding assets.  Some investors and analysts who study charts of trading
patterns use the averages to identify levels where orders to buy
or sell may be set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
