CSA Czech Airlines won European
Union authorization to receive government restructuring aid
after it sold assets, reduced capacity and gave up landing slots
at European airports.  The European Commission said it approved a 2.5 billion-
koruna ($130 million) loan to the airline from state-owned
company Osinek SA after Czech airlines agreed to a five-year
restructuring plan that will also see it sell subsidiaries,
aircraft and other assets and secure a private  bank loan  for an
aircraft lease.  EU regulators opened a probe into the aid in 2010, saying
they were concerned that the loan was granted on preferential
terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
