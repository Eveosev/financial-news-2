New York  gasoline rose after
inventories of gasoline made to East Coast specifications fell
to the lowest level in four years and imports declined.  Stocks of  reformulated gasoline , or RBOB, in the region
dropped 1.91 million barrels to 14.1 million last week, the
lowest level since October 2008, an Energy Department report
today showed.  The premium for RBOB in New York Harbor gained 0.87 cent to
15.75 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 12:11 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery dropped 4.58 cents to $3.002 a
gallon.  Gasoline imports to the East Coast slipped 314,000 barrels
to 385,000 barrels a day, according to the Energy Department.  Irving Oil Corp. is conducting planned maintenance at its
Saint John refinery in  New Brunswick , Lesley Dickson, a company
spokeswoman, said.  The work, “within select areas of the refinery” is
expected to be completed over the next few weeks and there are
no production delays or issues with supply, Dickson said in an
e-mail.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  fell 3.25 cents to 6.25
cents a gallon.  Total gasoline inventories in the Gulf rose for the first
time in five weeks, government data showed.  Phillips 66 reported emissions at its Borger refinery in
 Texas  because of an equipment malfunction, a filing with the
Texas Commission of Environmental Quality showed.  The refinery has the capacity to process 146,000 barrels
per day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
