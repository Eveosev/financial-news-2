The Egyptian General Petroleum
Corp. is in talks with Islamic lenders about a $700 million loan
for the purchase of refined fuel, al-Borsa reported, citing
unidentified officials at the state-run petroleum authority.  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi has also pressed the
 Finance Ministry  to speed up the disbursal of $400 million owed
to a number of diesel suppliers, the newspaper reported. The
officials said the delay in releasing the funds has contributed
to the current diesel shortage in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
