Canada ’s currency declined against
the majority of its 16 most-traded peers as crude oil tumbled
for a third day amid skepticism global central banks can boost
economic growth through monetary-stimulus measures.  The currency fell after the U.S. said crude-oil stockpiles
rose 8.53 million barrels last week to 367.6 million, compared
with a gain of 1 million barrels forecast by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey, sending crude down as much as 4.2 percent. The
Canadian dollar fluctuated against its U.S. peer after Japan’s
announcement of further stimulus, following similar moves by the
Federal Reserve and ECB, suggesting the currency has peaked
after touching a 13-month high last week.  “There’s a risk-off tone today with uncertainty with
Europe, and since the Canadian dollar is a risk asset, it will
be impacted by that,” Eimear Daly, a currency market analyst at
Monex Europe Ltd. in London, said in a phone interview. “After
the announcement of further quantitative easing in the U.S. last
week, we had this massive sell-off of the Canadian dollar and
the market overextended itself -- now we’re seeing a sharp
pullback.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, was little changed at 97.45
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in  New York . One Canadian dollar
buys $1.0262.  The currency touched 96.33 on Sept. 14, the strongest since
August 2011, after the Fed announced further bond purchases to
stimulate the economy of Canada’s largest trading partner.  Crude-oil futures fell 3.7 percent to $91.76 a barrel in
New York after declines of 1.4 percent and 2.4 percent the
previous two days.  Bonds Advance  Canadian  government bonds   advanced  for a third day, the
longest streak in three weeks, with the yield on the 10-year
benchmark falling three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 1.89 percent. The 2.75 security added 27 cents to C$107.64.  The  Bank of Canada  auctioned C$1.4 billion ($1.4 billion)
of 30-year bonds yielding 2.47 percent. The bank received C$3.7
billion in bids for the 3.5 percent notes with a bid-to-cover
ratio of 2.6. Two previous sales of the same amount of the
securities this year yielded 2.41 percent in May and 2.79
percent in March. The yield on current 30-year bonds fell three
basis points to 2.46 percent.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  unexpectedly expanded its asset-purchase
fund by 10 trillion yen (C$124 billion) as it sought to counter
increasing danger of contraction in the world’s third-largest
economy. The decision to ease policy was forecast by five of 21
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  ‘Risk Appetite’  The yen advanced against most major currencies, including
the loonie.  “The broader environment remains somewhat challenging for
risk appetite,”  Shaun Osborne  and  Greg Moore , currency
strategists at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , wrote in a note to
clients.  The U.S and Canadian dollars may be forming an inverse
head-and-shoulders pattern, they wrote, which could see Canada’s
currency weaken past the 97.60-to-97.70 level to 98.90 or
parity, which it last touched on Aug. 3.  “We’re seeing a marginal unwind of the Canadian dollar
strength that had been put on following the Fed” and ECB
stimulus measures, Matthew Perrier, Toronto-based director of
foreign exchange at  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , said in a phone interview.
