Euro-area  construction output  fell
for a second month in July, led by declines from  Spain  to the
Netherlands, suggesting the industry’s slump extended into the
third quarter.  Construction in the 17-nation euro area slipped 0.3 percent
from June, when it dropped a revised 0.6 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. From a year
earlier, construction  output  declined 4.7 percent.  In Italy and Spain, the euro region’s third- and fourth-
largest economies, output dropped 2.2 percent and 2.1 percent in
the month, respectively, today’s report showed. France reported
a decrease of 0.1 percent from June, while production in the
Netherlands and  Portugal  also fell. German output rose 1.9
percent from June, when it dropped 1.3 percent.  In the 27-nation EU, output fell 0.2 percent from June,
when it slipped 1.4 percent. The statistics office had
previously reported a monthly decline of 0.5 percent for the
euro area in June. Ireland and  Greece  are not required to
provide monthly data on construction output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
