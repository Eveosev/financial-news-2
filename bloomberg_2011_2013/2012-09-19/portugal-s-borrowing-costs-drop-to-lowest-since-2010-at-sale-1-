Portugal ’s cost of borrowing
dropped to the lowest since 2010 as it sold 1.29 billion euros
($1.68 billion) of 18-month bills, the longest maturity it has
auctioned since April.  The 546-day securities were issued at an average yield of
2.967 percent, the debt management agency said. That’s the
lowest at an auction of debt maturing in more than a year since
the nation sold two-year notes in April 2010 at 1.715 percent.
The previous 18-month auction on April 4 drew a yield of 4.537
percent. Today’s sale attracted bids for 2.4 times the amount
allotted, compared with 2.6 times at the prior auction.  “The bill sale was successful and demonstrates that for now
any eventual increase in Portugal’s political risk has not
affected investors, who continue to have a lot of interest in
buying short-term  Portuguese government  debt,” Filipe Silva,
who manages the equivalent of $78 million at Banco Carregosa SA
in Oporto, northern Portugal, wrote today in an e-mailed note.  Portugal’s  two-year yield  was little changed at 5.08
percent at 3:21 p.m. in  London , and 10-year yields were at 8.65
percent. The extra yield investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-
year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds has narrowed
to 7.05 percentage points from a euro-era high of 16.48
percentage points set on Jan. 31.  Lower Yields  Portuguese yields have dropped as the government cuts
spending and raises taxes to comply with the terms of a 78
billion-euro aid plan requested from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho 
said on March 5 that if the country can’t tap bond markets by
September 2013 because of “external reasons,” it would be able
to count on further support from the IMF and EU.  The debt agency also sold 709 million euros of six-month
bills at an average yield of 1.7 percent, attracting bids for
3.1 times the amount offered. That compares with a yield of
2.292 percent at a previous auction on July 18. The 1.7 percent
yield is the lowest at a sale of six-month securities since
March 3, 2010, when the yield was 0.739 percent.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on Sept. 13
that the total indicative amount for today’s auctions would be
between 1.5 billion euros and 1.75 billion euros, less than the
2 billion euros eventually raised. No further auctions are
scheduled for this quarter.  The Portuguese government aims to regain full access to
bond markets by September 2013.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on Sept. 6 that bond
purchases may be considered for euro-area countries currently
under bailout programs, such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland,
when they regain debt-market access.  To contact the reporter on this story:
