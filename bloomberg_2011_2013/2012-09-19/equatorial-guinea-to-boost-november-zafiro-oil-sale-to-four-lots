Equatorial Guinea  will increase
exports of its Zafiro crude for November to four cargoes, two
more than October, according to a loading program obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Exxon Mobil Corp. will shut the Zafiro oil field for about
15 days in October for planned maintenance, two traders with
knowledge of the matter said on Aug. 23, declining to be
identified because the information is confidential.  The West African nation will also ship three consignments
of Ceiba grade, unchanged from October, a separate schedule
showed. All cargoes are for 1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
