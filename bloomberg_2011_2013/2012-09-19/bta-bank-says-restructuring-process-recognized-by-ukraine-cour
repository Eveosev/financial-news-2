BTA Bank (BTAS) , the Kazakh lender seeking
to overhaul its debt for a second time, said a Ukrainian court
recognized the restructuring proceedings and extended protection
over its assets.  “This recognition is a part of the bank’s current
restructuring process and the order follows successful
applications for recognition made by the BTA in the U.K. and
U.S., which were obtained on July 11 and Aug. 16,
respectively,” the Almaty-based lender said in a  statement  e-
mailed today.  State-run BTA,  Kazakhstan ’s third-largest bank by assets,
said last month that an Almaty court had prolonged a
restructuring deadline by three months to Dec. 20. BTA had been
seeking an agreement by September after failing to make a
January interest payment on dollar bonds due July 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
