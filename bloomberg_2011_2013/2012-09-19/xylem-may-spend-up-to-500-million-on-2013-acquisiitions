Xylem (XYL)  Inc., the water equipment and
service provider spun off from  ITT Corp. (ITT) , may spend $300 million
to $500 million on 2013 acquisitions to expand, or double this
year’s target, the company said.  “We’ve been able to do one small acquisition. At this
point in time, I would have like to have had more but the
pipeline is robust,” Chief Executive Officer Gretchen McClain
said. Xylem had a 2012 purchase target of $150 million to $200
million. That may reach $500 million next year, its finance
chief Michael Speetzen said today at a Boston conference.  As water and sewer systems age in developed markets like
the U.S. and  Europe , about 80 percent of budgets are directed to
critical repairs and upgrades to make systems more efficient, up
from about 70 percent, she said. The  White Plains , N.Y.-based
company gets  36 percent  of its revenue from public utilities.  Utility contracts for infrastructure upgrades are funded
via mandatory tariffs and fees, unlike municipal capital
expenditure budgets that can be delayed and are more
discretionary. U.S. tariffs for water and sewer services are
rising about 8 percent annually, and Europe even more, she said.  Xylem in July agreed to acquire closely held MJK Automation
A/S, a maker of flow and level sensors, for $12.3 million. Its
shares rose 0.9 percent to $25.93 at 1:05 p.m. in  New York  Stock
Exchange trading, almost unchanged for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
