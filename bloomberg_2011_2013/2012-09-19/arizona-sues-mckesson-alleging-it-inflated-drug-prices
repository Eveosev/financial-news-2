McKesson Corp. (MCK) , the largest U.S.
drug distributor, was accused by Arizona in a lawsuit of
artificially inflating prices for 400 medicines including
Allegra, Celebrex, Lipitor and Flonase.  Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne said in an e-mail that
the practice cost consumers millions of dollars. In a complaint
that Horne said was filed Sept. 14 in state court, Arizona said
McKesson raised the spread between published average drug
wholesale prices and actual acquisition costs to increase its
pharmacy clients’ profits. Those costs were passed along to
third-party payors and consumers, Horne said.  The state seeks fines of $10,000 per violation of  consumer
protection laws  and restitution. The filing couldn’t be
independently confirmed in court records.  Kris Fortner, a spokesman for San Francisco-based McKesson,
didn’t immediately respond to a voice-mail message seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  In July, McKesson reached a $151 million settlement with
states over claims it caused Medicaid programs to pay too much
for  prescription drugs .  The case is Arizona v. McKesson, Maricopa County Superior
Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
