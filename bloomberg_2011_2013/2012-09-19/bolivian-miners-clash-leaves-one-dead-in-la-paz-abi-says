Protests by Bolivian miners left
one person dead and seven wounded in the capital yesterday,
state news agency  ABI  reported.  About 250 workers from a mining cooperative threw sticks of
dynamite and smashed windows at the offices of rival
organization Union Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers in  La
Paz , ABI said. The two groups are fighting for control over the
Colquiri tin and zinc mine that was nationalized in June.  Clashes between cooperative and state miners broke out two
weeks ago after workers at the state mining company  Corp. Minera
de Bolivia  called for a takeover of the entire property formerly
controlled by  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , according to ABI.  Minister for the Presidency Juan Ramon Quintana called for
a 48-hour truce while the government brokers talks between the
two factions, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
