Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  rose
the most in a week in Lisbon trading as investors took advantage
of the recent decline in the shares of  Portugal ’s second-biggest
publicly traded lender.  The bank climbed as much as 10 percent to 6.6 euro cents,
the most since Sept. 11, and traded 5 percent higher at 6.3
cents at 8:58 a.m. in the Portuguese capital. The stock fell 19
percent in the past week.  “Investors are taking advantage of a recent decline in
Banco Comercial shares,” said Jose  Novo, a trader at Orey
iTrade in Lisbon. “The fact that the bank’s capital increase is
expected to be fully subscribed and that European shares are
trading higher today also helps.”  Banco Comercial is carrying out a 500 million-euro ($653
million) rights offer that’s part of a capitalization plan
announced in June. The subscription period ends on Sept. 28.  Chief Executive Officer Nuno Amado said on July 27 the bank
was confident the capital increase would be fully subscribed by
shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
