State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan , or
Socar, and its partners in the planned Trans-Anatolia Pipeline
will decide their stakes in the project this year, establishing
the hierarchy of companies that will build the link.  “It will definitely be signed before the end of this
year,” Vitaliy Baylarbayov, Socar’s deputy vice president for
marketing and investment, said today in Baku. The company, which
shares the project with Turkish partners, has said it plans to
bring  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Total SA (FP)  into the venture.  Azerbaijan and Turkey signed an agreement in June to build
the $7 billion Trans-Anatolia Pipeline, or Tanap, which will
ship natural gas from the Shah Deniz field in the  Caspian Sea  to
Turkey’s European border. Construction will start by the end of
next year and be completed in 2017, Socar said last week.  The Azeri company may reduce its 80 percent stake by
bringing in BP, which is leading development of Shah Deniz, as
well as Statoil and Total. Turkish state pipeline company Boru
Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas, and energy producer
Turkiye Petrolleri AO hold the remaining 20 percent.  At the Turkish border, Tanap will connect either with the
proposed Nabucco line or the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline to take gas
into Europe. The BP-led group developing Shah Deniz is set to
choose between the two links by May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
