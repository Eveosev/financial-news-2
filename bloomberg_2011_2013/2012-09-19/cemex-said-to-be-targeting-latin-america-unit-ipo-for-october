Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, told investors in Bogota today it plans to
carry out the initial public offering of its Central and South
America unit as soon as next month, according to three people
who attended the presentations.  The company said the listing of Cemex Latam Holdings SA in
 Colombia  may take place in about five weeks, according to the
people, who asked not to be identified because the meetings were
private.  Monterrey, Mexico-based Cemex may seek to raise about $1
billion by listing the unit, a person familiar with the matter
who asked not to be identified because the process is private
said earlier this month.  Jorge Perez , a Cemex spokesman, declined to comment today
on the timing of the share sale. The company said last month
that it planned to sell a minority stake in its Central and
South American businesses. Cemex must make a $1 billion payment
to banks next year under a proposed new refinancing agreement.  Cemex hired Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  to lead the sale in Colombia, according to the
three people who asked not to be identified because the
arrangement is private. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Banco
Santander SA are also involved in the sale, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
