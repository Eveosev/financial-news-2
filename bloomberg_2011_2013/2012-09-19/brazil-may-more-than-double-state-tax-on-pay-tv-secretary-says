Brazil ’s state governments will
decide next week whether to more than double a  sales tax  on pay-
TV services from companies such as  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  and  DirecTV (DTV) 
as officials seek revenues from a growing market.  The so-called ICMS tax for cable and satellite TV may be
increased to 25 percent from 10 percent in a meeting scheduled
for Sept. 28, said Claudio Trinchao Santos, the coordinator of
Confaz, the board that brings together state finance
secretaries. The rate increase, which has already been
recommended by Confaz’s technical board, would bring it to the
same level charged for telephone services, he said.  Brazilian pay-TV subscriptions will jump to 17 million by
the end of the year from 12.7 million in 2011, according to
estimates by the country’s telecommunications regulator. By
2018, Anatel, as the regulator is known, expects 35 million
subscribers.  America Movil , based in Mexico City, held about 55 percent
of Brazil’s pay-TV market at the end of last year through its
Net Servicos and Embratel units, according to Anatel. El
Segundo, California-based DirecTV’s Sky service had about 30
percent of the market.  States are considering the increase in part to prevent
telephone companies such as  Oi SA (OIBR4)  and  Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4)  from
arguing that they should pay only a 10 percent tax when they
sell a combination of services that includes voice, Internet and
pay-TV, said Trinchao, who is the finance secretary for the
state of Maranhao.  To contact the reporter on this story:
