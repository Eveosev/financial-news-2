President  Barack Obama  will meet
with Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi this afternoon
at the White House.  They will meet privately about 5 p.m., White House press
secretary Jay Carney said.  Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate who spent 15 years under house
arrest for opposing the military regime in her country, last
visited the U.S. in the late 1980s. She also will be honored at
a ceremony today awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal at
the U.S. Capitol. Lawmakers awarded her the medal, Congressâ€™
highest civilian honor, in absentia in 2008 while she was a
political prisoner in Myanmar, also known as Burma.  She met yesterday with Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton .  To contact the reporter on this story:
