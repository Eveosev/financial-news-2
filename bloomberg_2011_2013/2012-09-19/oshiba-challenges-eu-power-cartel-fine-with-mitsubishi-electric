Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. appealed a fine levied for the second time by
European Union regulators in a price-fixing probe over power-
generation equipment.  The companies filed appeals on Sept. 12 at the EU General
Court, the 27-nation bloc’s second-highest tribunal. The appeals
seek to overturn a June 27 decision by the EU’s  antitrust 
regulator to fine Mitsubishi Electric 74.8 million euros ($97.4
million) and Toshiba 56.8 million euros for agreeing with rivals
to set prices for gas-insulated switchgear, which power
companies buy to control electrical flow. The two companies were
also jointly fined 4.7 million euros.  The Luxembourg-based court’s press office said today that
Toshiba had filed its appeal. Mitsubishi and Toshiba separately
also confirmed the appeals.  The fines are lower than the original 2007 penalties when
Mitsubishi Electric was fined 118.6 million euros and Toshiba
was fined 90.9 million euros. The  EU General Court  last year
ruled the European Commission had punished the two Tokyo-based
companies more harshly than European competitors in the
electrical-equipment cartel. The decision forced EU officials to
recalculate the fines.  The cases are: T-404/12 Pending Case, Toshiba Corporation
v. Commission (T-404/12), T-409/12 Pending Case,  Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. (6503)  v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
