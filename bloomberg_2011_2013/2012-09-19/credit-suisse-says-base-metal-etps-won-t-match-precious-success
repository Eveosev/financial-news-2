Industrial metals probably won’t
match the success of precious metals in physically-backed
exchange-traded products, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Credit Suisse has no plans to start an aluminum-backed ETP,
said Kamal Naqvi, head of commodities sales in  Europe ,  Middle
East  and Africa, for Credit Suisse in London.  “There is no need for this outlet for holding surplus
metal as long as aluminum-financing interest remains high and
there is no clear solution for solving the potential premium
risk for the metal provider,” Naqvi said in London today.  “Base metals ETPs are unlikely to be as successful as
precious metal products,’’ said Naqvi. “This is because base
metals can go into backwardation and if they do then an investor
receives a better return by owning the futures and rolling the
contract, rather than the fixed cost of owning an ETP. Commodity
ETPs work best when the underlying commodity is always in
contango and where physical storage is easy and cheap.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
