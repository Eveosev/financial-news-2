Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , the
second-largest U.S. coal producer, may have its credit ratings
lowered by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services after the company
said it will close eight mines and cut production.  S&P put Alpha on Creditwatch with negative implications,
meaning it will review the ratings and possibly lower them,
according to a statement today. The Bristol, Virginia-based
company is currently rated BB-, three levels below investment
grade.  Alpha said yesterday it will reduce annual production by 16
million tons, about 16 percent of 2011 output, and eliminate
1,200 jobs through early 2013. The company is among producers
that have cut or plan to cut output this year after some power
stations switched to using natural gas, and prices for
metallurgical, or coking, coal used to make steel dropped.  “Many fixed-income investors take the current spot price
and extrapolate that into the future,” David Beard, a New
Orleans-based analyst at Iberia Capital Partners LLC, said in an
e-mail today. “The mathematics is such that if coking coal
prices stayed at current spot levels and Alpha did not cut
 capital expenditures , they would burn through most of their cash
in three years.”  Alpha dropped 3.2 percent to $7.63 at the close in  New
York . The shares have declined 63 percent this year.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  is the largest U.S. coal producer by
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
