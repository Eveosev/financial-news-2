Most North American oil grades
weakened in the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Midcontinent and  Canada 
after inventories rose the most in more than five months.  U.S. oil stockpiles gained 8.53 million barrels last week,
the most since March 30, to 367.6 million, the Energy Department
reported, as producers restored output in the  Gulf of Mexico 
after Hurricane Isaac and imports rose. Analysts polled by
Bloomberg expected an increase of 1 million.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
lost 85 cents a barrel to $17.50 at 2:02 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
added 45 cents to $19.75 a barrel.  Poseidon’s  premium  narrowed $2.45 to $8.55. Mars Blend
decreased $2.20 to $9.55 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green
Canyon lost $1 to a premium of $8.50.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened $1.80 to $18 above WTI.  Bakken’s premium lost 50 cents to $5 a barrel. Syncrude’s
premium to WTI narrowed 50 cents to $13.75 a barrel.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened 50 cents to $7.75
a barrel below the U.S. benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
