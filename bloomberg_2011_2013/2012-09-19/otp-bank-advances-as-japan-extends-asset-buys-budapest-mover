OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, advanced after the Bank of  Japan  decided to extend its
asset purchase program.  OTP  advanced  0.3 percent to 3,992 forint by 12:02 p.m. in
Budapest, reducing this week’s loss to 2.4 percent. The BUX
stock  index  rose 0.3 percent to 18,935.57, heading for the
highest close this week. Mol Nyrt., the country’s biggest
refiner, rose 0.3 percent after the country’s largest refiner
opened order books for the sale of a dollar-denominated
corporate bond.  Commodities advanced for the first time in three days and
the yen weakened after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly boosted
its asset-purchase program. European shares were little changed,
while gold climbed to a six-month high and  Spain ’s bonds
rallied.  “The extended bond purchase program announced this morning
by the  Bank of Japan  may bring about only temporary optimism on
markets,” Budapest-based traders at Commerzbank AG, led by
Peter Karsai, wrote in a note today.  The BOJ’s board enlarged the central bank’s easing program,
in which it buys mainly government debt, by 10 trillion yen
($126 billion) to 55 trillion yen in a unanimous decision,
according to a statement. The board left unchanged a separate
facility that extends credit to banks at 25 trillion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
