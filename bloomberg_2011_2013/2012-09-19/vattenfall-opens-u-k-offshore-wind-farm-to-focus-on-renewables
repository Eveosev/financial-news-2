Vattenfall AB, the Nordic region’s
biggest utility, opened a 500 million-pound ($812 million) wind
farm off U.K. shores and detailed plans to reorganize its
business with a focus on wind and nuclear power.  The Ormonde site will generate 150 megawatts of power from
30 turbines off Cumbria in northern  England , Vattenfall said
today in a statement. A third of its investment went to British
businesses, the Stockholm-based company said.  Vattenfall said separately it will create a division for
nuclear power to give it “the special focus it requires.” The
company will also merge two divisions to focus on renewables.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
