London police arrested three people
today in their investigation into bribery by U.K. journalists,
bringing the total arrests in the probe to 50.  The  Metropolitan Police Service  arrested a 39-year-old
officer in the Wiltshire police force on suspicion of misconduct
in a public office, the MPS said in a statement. Two
journalists, a 51-year-old man and a 32-year-old man, were also
arrested at home at about 6 a.m. today.  News Corp. (NWSA) , which owns the Times and Sun newspapers in the
U.K., provided evidence to police as part of an investigation
into reporters’ activities that followed from the discovery of
widespread phone hacking at the now defunct News of the World
tabloid. Police also have ongoing investigations into computer
and phone hacking by journalists in News Corp.’s News
International papers and competitors.  The arrests “relate to suspected payments to a public
official and suspected disclosure of confidential information by
a police officer,” the police said in the statement.  The News of the World usually paid 750 pounds ($1,200) for
a “page lead” scoop and 1,000 pounds for tips, Matt Nixson, an
ex-features editor at the Sun, said in court papers. Nixson, who
hasn’t been arrested, has sued for wrongful termination after he
was fired for allegedly approving a payment to a prison officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
