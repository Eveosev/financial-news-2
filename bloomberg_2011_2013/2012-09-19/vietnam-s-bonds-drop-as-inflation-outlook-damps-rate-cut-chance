Vietnam ’s government bonds fell,
pushing the three-year yield to the highest level in almost two
months, on speculation inflation will quicken and leave less
room for an interest-rate cut. The dong weakened.  Consumer prices will rise 1.5 percent in September from
August, Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corp. forecast in a report
released yesterday. Prices rose 0.63 percent last month from
July, according to official data. The central bank has cut its
key refinance rate five times this year to 10 percent from 15
percent to spur economic growth.  Rising prices make it “harder to impose another interest-
rate cut over the coming months and therefore limits monetary-
policy options,” analyst Christopher Blank at Ho Chi Minh City
Securities in the Vietnamese financial hub wrote in the report.  The yield on the three-year notes rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 9.76 percent, the highest level since
July 24, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,875 per dollar as of 3:22
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set the currency’s reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
dong is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
