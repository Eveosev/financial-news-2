Russia , the world’s third-biggest
wheat exporter last year, is keeping its grain export forecast
for this season at 10 million to 14 million metric tons,
Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov said.  Total production is estimated at 72 million to 73 million
tons, Fedorov told Parliament today. That’s narrowed down from a
70 million to 75 million ton forecast made on Sept. 6.  “Taking into account nearly 20 million tons of carryover
stocks, these crop volumes will let us secure domestic
consumption and form the export potential,” Fedorov said.  Farmers have harvested 63 million tons of grain from 76
percent of the planted area, he said. That compares with 77
million tons a year earlier.  Winter grain sowing is targeted on 16.8 million hectares
(41.5 million acres) for the 2013-14 crop, Fedorov said. Farmers
have planted 7.3 million hectares so far, or about 300,000
hectares more than at the same time last year, he said.  Russia harvested 94.2 million tons of grains, and shipped a
record 27.2 million tons last year, according to Agriculture
Ministry data.  Russia’s wheat exports are expected to fall to 8 million
tons this season from 21.6 million tons in 2011-12, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . That would make the country
the fifth largest shipper after the U.S.,  Australia ,  Canada  and
the European Union in 2012-13, according to the USDA estimates.  Wheat for December delivery rose 2.1 percent to $8.8175 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 11:37 a.m. London time.
It’s advanced 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
