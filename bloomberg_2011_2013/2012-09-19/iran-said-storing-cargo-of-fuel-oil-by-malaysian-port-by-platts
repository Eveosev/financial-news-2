A supertanker owned by Tehran-based
NITC transferred a cargo of  fuel oil  to a floating storage unit
moored at the Malaysian port of Tanjung Pelepas this week,
Platts said.  The Pioneer unloaded 270,000 metric tons of fuel oil that
was taken on by the Hercules, a very large crude carrier
converted for floating storage, the McGraw-Hill Cos. news
service reported, citing ship-tracking data and people it didnâ€™t
identify. Storing cargoes outside  Iran  helps the country free up
its tankers for deliveries or storage use, according to the
 article  published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
