The Czech lower house of Parliament
moved a bill that includes tax increases to the second reading
as six ruling-coalition lawmakers seek changes to the proposal,
the  CTK  newswire reported.  Lawmakers can propose amendments to the legislation in the
second reading before the chamber votes on the bill.  Six legislators from Premier Petr Necasâ€™s  Civic Democratic
Party  joined the opposition on Sept. 5 and voted against the
bill that included the tax increases. Necas, who said the plan
is needed for cutting the  budget deficit  next year, submitted
the same bill to Parliament again and linked its approval to a
vote of confidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
