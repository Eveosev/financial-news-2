Police used tear gas and stun
grenades to disperse a crowd near mines owned by  Anglo American
Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s largest producer of the metal, after
a six-week illegal strike at Lonmin Plc’s Marikana mine.  “A group of people were gathered illegally at Sondela
informal settlement and were dispersed by South African Police
Service,” the Johannesburg-based company said in an e-mailed
response to a query today.  Illegal strikes and violent protests over pay disrupted
work at the world’s largest platinum producers in the past
month, leaving 45 people dead. Platinum surged as much as 21
percent. The protests occurred in the Rustenburg region, about
170 kilometers (106 miles) northwest of Johahnesburg, an area
that taps the world’s largest platinum reserves.  Police arrested 19 people for an illegal gathering and
public violence, Dennis Adriao, a spokesman for SAPS, said by
mobile phone.  Anglo American Platinum fell 0.7 percent to 451.76 rand as
of 12:47 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
