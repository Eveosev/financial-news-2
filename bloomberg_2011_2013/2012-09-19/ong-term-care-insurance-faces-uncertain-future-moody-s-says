Long-term care insurance has an
uncertain future as it may be difficult for firms to profit from
the product, Moody’s Investors Service said today.  “Key credit considerations for the sector are the relative
newness of long-term care insurance and the long-tailed and
complex product structure, which make it difficult to price the
product profitably,” Laura Bazer, a vice president at Moody’s,
said today in a statement.  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  has said it’s raising prices for
the coverage, while the largest U.S. life insurers, led by
 MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , are retreating from
selling long-term care coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
