Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ended a
trade recommendation to buy the euro against the dollar, after
the 17-nation currency rallied following  European Central Bank 
measures to stem the sovereign debt crisis.  “With much of the expected developments now past us, our
initial target of $1.30 reached and a period of further
consolidation possible, we consider it prudent to close our
recommendation for a potential gain of about 7 percent,”
Goldman Sachs foreign-exchange analysts led by London-based
Thomas Stolper wrote today in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
