Spanish and Italian bonds are more
attractive than U.S., German and French securities with European
leaders likely to prevent the region’s sovereign-debt crisis
from worsening, according to Brandywine Global Investment
Management’s  Stephen Smith .  “We are overweight Italy and Spain,” Smith, lead
portfolio manager in Philadelphia at Brandywine, which oversees
$40 billion of debt, said at an investor round-table discussion
in  New York  hosted by American Beacon Advisors.  Brandywine sees European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi ’s comments on Aug. 2 that “the euro is irreversible” as
a turning point in the crisis that started in 2009 in Greece,
Portugal and Ireland and spread to Spain and Italy.  Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields have fallen since
Draghi’s pledge, with Spain’s 10-year yield dropping 147 basis
points, or 1.47 percentage points, to 5.69 percent, and
comparable Italian debt sliding 140 basis points to 4.92
percent. At the same time, yields on German bunds and Treasuries
have risen from close to record lows.  European policy makers agreed Sept. 6 on an unlimited bond-
purchase program aimed at regaining control of  interest rates  in
the euro area and fighting speculation of a breakup of the
single currency. The purchases will be fully sterilized, meaning
that the overall impact on the  money supply  will be neutral.  “It’s been rough,” Smith said, “but, for policy makers,
self-preservation will win out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
