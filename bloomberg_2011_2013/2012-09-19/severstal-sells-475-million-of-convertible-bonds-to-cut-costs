OAO Severstal, Russian billionaire
Alexey Mordashov’s steelmaker, said it sold $475 million of
convertible bonds to cut borrowing costs and fund its business.  Severstal issued five-year notes with a three-year  put
option  at a yield of 2 percent, it said in a statement. The
bonds may be converted into Severstal’s global depositary
receipts at a price of $19.08, 45 percent higher than the stock
traded today.  The Cherepovets, Russia-based company has $5.5 billion of
debt outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and
pays interest of 5 percent on its existing fixed-rate dollar
bonds due in 2017. Chief Financial Officer Alexei Kulichenko
said last month the company’s waiting for a “good window” to
sell local currency bonds under its 80 billion-ruble ($2.5
billion) program.  The convertible securities “allow the company to reduce
borrowing costs giving the ability for bondholders to swap bonds
for shares at a fixed price in the future,” said Andrey Kulakov, an analyst at UralSib Capital in Moscow.  Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG managed the sale.  “Using this instrument allows us to significantly reduce
debt costs and effectively use treasury stock from the company’s
balance sheet,” according to an e-mailed statement from
Severstal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
