Electrolux AB (ELUXB) , the world’s second-
largest appliance maker, fell the most in four months in
Stockholm trading after U.S. shipments of refrigerators,
freezers and washers rose less than expected last month.  The Swedish manufacturer of Frigidaire appliances declined
as much as 8.1 kronor, or 4.7 percent, to 166 kronor, and was
trading at 167.50 kronor as of 10:40 a.m. local time, valuing
the Stockholm-based company at 51.8 billion kronor ($7.9
billion.)  August deliveries of major home appliances rose 0.8 percent
from a year earlier in  North America  as measured by the key
AHAM-6 indicator, according to the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers. The figure covers shipments of washers, dryers,
dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers and cooking appliances.
 Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  had estimated shipments to rise 6 percent after an
increase of 1.1 percent in July.  Electrolux, whose biggest competitor is  Benton Harbor ,
Michigan-based  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) , has  gained  53 percent this year
after pushing through price increases in North America and
Europe, making it the best-performing stock in the period on the
 OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMX) , which is up 12 percent.  Electrolux Chief Executive Officer Keith McLoughlin
yesterday reiterated July forecasts that Europe’s wider
appliance market may shrink by as much as 2 percent this year
and that demand in North America is set to be somewhere between
unchanged and 2 percent growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
