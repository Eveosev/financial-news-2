Output from the BP Plc-led Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli field in the Caspian, the largest Azeri oil
deposit, is falling because of maintenance and safety measures,
Trend said, citing Industry and Energy Minister Natiq Aliyev.  The field, also known as ACG, is “quite young,” and so
lower production can’t be attributed to natural declines, Aliyev
said in the Azeri capital of Baku, according to the private news
service.  ACG production plunged 12 percent in the first half of 2012
from a year earlier, according to data on BP’s website. The
field produced 35.4 million metric tons of oil last year, or
77.6 percent of  Azerbaijan ’s total output.  Aliyev said Azerbaijan doesn’t need to produce larger
volumes and plans to keep output at no less than 40 million tons
of oil a year.  The third-largest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union 
pumped 45.6 million tons of oil last year, a decline of 10.2
percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
