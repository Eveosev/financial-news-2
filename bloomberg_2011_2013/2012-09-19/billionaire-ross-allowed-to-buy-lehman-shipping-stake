Billionaire Wilbur Ross won a
judge’s approval to buy shares in a shipping company held by
 Lehman Brothers Inc ., a spokesman for the defunct brokerage’s
trustee said.  WL Ross & Co. offered about $110 million for the 34 percent
stake in gas-tanker company  Navigator Holdings Ltd. (NVIGF)  Hedge fund
Elliott Management Corp., a creditor of the brokerage, objected
that Ross’s company, which already owns Navigator shares, would
gain a controlling stake without paying a premium for control.
Ross answered yesterday in a bankruptcy court filing that it
bought most of its Navigator shares last year for the same $25
each that Lehman will receive.  James Giddens, the trustee liquidating the Lehman
brokerage, “is pleased with the court’s approval of the sale,”
Jake Sargent, a Giddens spokesman, said in an e-mail today.
“The sale maximizes the value of LBI’s shares in Navigator for
the benefit of customers and other creditors.”  The Lehman brokerage is liquidating separately from its
parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which is now out of
bankruptcy.  The Lehman brokerage liquidation is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
parent’s case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings  Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
