FLSmidth & Co. A/S (FLS)  rose the most in
five days in Copenhagen trading after JPMorgan Cazenove said
 Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , a client of Europe’s largest maker of cement
production plants, will succeed in expanding in new markets.  FLSmidth advanced as much as 1.7 percent, the most since
Sept. 14. The stock rose 1.3 percent to 357.40 kroner at 9:54
a.m. local time compared with a 0.4 percent advance in the
 Copenhagen 20 Index. (KFX)   JPMorgan said it sees “a longer run for emerging market
cement” and raised its recommendation on the shares of Jona,
Switzerland-based Holcim to overweight from neutral, according
to a note published today. Copenhagen-based FLSmidth, which has
supplied production plants to Holcim, generated 16 percent of
its first-half revenue from its cement unit.  In a note dated yesterday, JPMorgan said it continues to
prefer FLSmidth over Helsinki-based Metso Oyj in the mining
equipment industry, repeating an overweight  recommendation  on
the Danish company’s share. FLSmidth’s mining division, which
makes conveyor belts and crushing equipment, generates more than
half of the engineering company’s revenue.  Holcim  shares  rose as much as 2.2 percent in Zurich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
