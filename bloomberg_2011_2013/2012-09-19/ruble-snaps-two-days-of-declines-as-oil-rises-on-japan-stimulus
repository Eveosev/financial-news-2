The ruble climbed against the
dollar for the first time in two days as crude oil,  Russia ’s
main export earner, advanced on bets  Japan ’s expanded program of
monetary easing will bolster fuel demand.  The ruble added as much as 0.5 percent and traded up 0.1
percent at 30.9066 against the dollar by 11:32 a.m. in Moscow.
The Russian currency slid the most since Aug. 30 against the
greenback yesterday. The ruble was 0.1 percent stronger versus
the euro at 40.3952, leaving it up 0.1 percent versus the
central bank’s target euro-dollar basket.  Oil added 0.8 percent in New York to $96.02 per barrel,
paring two days of declines, after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it
will boost its asset-purchase fund. Urals crude, Russia’s main
export blend, jumped 1.1 percent to $111.50 a barrel. Oil and
gas contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue.  Investors pared bets on the currency weakening with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 31.3679 versus the
dollar in three months compared with 31.4160 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  fell six basis points to 188,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell
seven basis points to 7.55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
