Russia  overtook  Saudi Arabia  as
world’s largest crude producer in July, according to the Joint
Organization Data Initiative.  Saudi Arabia’s production fell to 9.8 million barrels a day
that month from 10.1 million barrels in June when output was at
the highest in more than three decades, according to government
statistics posted on JODI’s  website  today. Exports dropped 7
percent on the month.  Russia pumped 9.92 million barrels a day of crude in July,
up by 20,000 barrels from June, according to JODI, whose
calculations are based on figures in metric tons submitted by
the nation’s government to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum. JODI’s data exclude natural-gas liquids.  Russia pegged its crude and condensate production for July
at 10.32 million barrels a day, according to its Energy
Ministry.  JODI is supervised by the Riyadh-based  International Energy
Forum  and compiles data provided by member governments. The IEF,
a group of nations accounting for more than 90 percent of global
oil and natural-gas supply and demand, was established as a
forum for producing and consuming countries to discuss  energy
security . The U.S.,  China  and the European Union are among the
IEF’s members, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
