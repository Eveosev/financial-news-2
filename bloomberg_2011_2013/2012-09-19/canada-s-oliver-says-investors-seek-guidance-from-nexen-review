Canadian Natural Resources Minister
Joe Oliver said he’s aware foreign investors are monitoring his
government’s review of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s $15.1 billion proposed
takeover of Calgary-based  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  for guidance on future
investments.  Oliver, in an interview with  Bloomberg News  in Tokyo, said
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has pledged a policy “framework”
to explain the government’s decision regarding the Nexen bid and
future transactions.  “There are some prospective buyers who are looking at the
decision and, in particular, the framework that the prime
minster said would accompany or be published closely with” the
Nexen decision, Oliver said Sept. 18. “They want to get some
guidance as to whether whatever prospective investment they’d be
making would be welcome.”  Oliver said Canada doesn’t have enough money domestically
to finance all the natural resource projects planned over the
next decade, which he said the government values at C$650
billion ($667 billion).  “The Asia Pacific market is potentially an important part
of that and we welcome investment from Asia Pacific countries,”
Oliver said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
