CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest
provider of  prescription drugs  in the U.S., plans to buy back as
much as $6 billion in shares.  The repurchase authorization is effective immediately and
will take place over multiple years, the Woonsocket, Rhode
Island-based company said today in a statement.  CVS plans to repurchase $3 billion to $4 billion annually
in shares over the next several years, Chief Financial Officer
David Denton told analysts Sept. 5. The retailer has gained
customers after Walgreen Co. last year ended a contract to sell
prescriptions through employee-benefits manager Express Scripts
Holding Co.  While Walgreen and Express Scripts have renewed their
contract, CVS said last month it expects to retain at least half
of those customers.  CVS also said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 16.25
cents on Nov. 2 to holders of record as of Oct. 22.  The stock rose 0.7 percent to $47.71 at the close in  New
York . The shares have risen 34 percent in 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
