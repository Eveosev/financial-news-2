Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  told
a group of engineering cadets at a Chinese military academy on
the outskirts of Beijing that the U.S. strategy in the Asia-
Pacific region wasn’t made to alarm  China .  While there has been talk of suspicion and lack of trust
between the two militaries, there are “areas of common security
interests,” Panetta told the cadets. There is “potential for
us to work together in defense of those common interests.”  Invoking U.S. President  Richard Nixon ’s visit to Beijing 40
years ago that paved the way for diplomatic relations with
China, Panetta said military ties must be set in the context of
the broader relations between the two countries. “One day it
will be your responsibility to help carry the U.S-China
relationship forward,” Panetta said in prepared remarks.  Panetta’s visit to the Engineering Academy of PLA Armored
Forces, a training school for armored officers, is the first by
a top U.S. defense official to such a school, Pentagon spokesman
 George Little  said.  Despite budget cuts in the U.S., the Pentagon was
committing more military resources to the region because of
rising threats, Panetta said, citing the case of  North Korea .  The U.S. was beefing up missile defense capabilities in the
region because of North Korea’s ballistic missiles, which
constitute “a direct threat to the security of Asia and the
U.S.,” Panetta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
