Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos met today with Venezuelan presidential candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, saying his government took a neutral position
in the neighboring country’s election.  Santos called on Venezuelans to vote “massively and
peacefully” in the election scheduled for Oct. 7 after the
meeting with Capriles at the presidential palace in Bogota,
according to a statement posted on the presidency’s  web site .  Santos recognized Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s
cooperation on security and support for the dialogue with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia , or FARC, to forge a
peace accord, the president said in his statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
