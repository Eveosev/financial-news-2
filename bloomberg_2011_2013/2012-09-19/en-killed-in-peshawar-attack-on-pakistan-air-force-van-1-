Ten people were killed and 27 were
injured in a bomb attack that targeted a van of the  Pakistan   Air
Force  in the northwestern city of  Peshawar .  “The air force van was passing through the area when a
bomb planted in a parked car was remotely detonated,” Muhammad
Javed Marwat, the district coordination officer, said by phone.
No members of the air force are among those killed according to
initial reports, he said.  Today’s assault comes a month after militants stormed
Pakistan’s main air force base at Kamra, near the capital
Islamabad, on Aug. 16, triggering a firefight that lasted more
than two hours and killed eight militants.  Taliban guerrillas, who are opposed to the country’s
alliance with the U.S., in May 2011 attacked a naval air base in
Karachi and killed 10 security force members in a 16-hour gun
battle that damaged two P-3C Orion aircraft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
