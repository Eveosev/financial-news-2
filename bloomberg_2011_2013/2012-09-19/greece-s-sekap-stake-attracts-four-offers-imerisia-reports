Ilias Papadopoulos SA is one of
four companies that have made non-binding offers to buy the
Greek state’s 50.4 percent stake in tobacco company Sekap SA,
Imerisia reported.  The bidders will be given more information on Sekap before
being asked to submit binding offers, the newspaper said,
without citing anyone. The chosen bidder will have to have to
increase Sekap’s share capital by 20 million euros ($26 million)
and commit to an investment plan of as much as 10 million euros,
Imerisia said.  State-owned  Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA owned the Sekap
stake until  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  bought the lender in July as part of
a bank restructuring; Sekap was among units that Piraeus didn’t
take.  To contact the reporter on this story:
