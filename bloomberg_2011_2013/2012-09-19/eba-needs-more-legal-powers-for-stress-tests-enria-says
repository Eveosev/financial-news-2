The European Banking Authority
needs more legal powers for stress tests to ensure that bank
data are correct, Andrea Enria, chairman of the EBA, told
lawmakers during a European Parliament hearing in Brussels.  Enria said the agency suffered “some negative impact”
when  Dexia SA (DEXB)  and Bankia group passed stress tests only to
subsequently need additional capital.  “Going forward we need to make sure that if we are given
the responsibility to conduct stress tests, we are given also
the legal tools to make sure indeed that the results are
actually reliable,” Enria said.  Eight banks failed the London-based EBA’s last round of
stress tests in July 2011 with a combined capital shortfall of
2.5 billion euros ($3.2 billion), leading to criticisms from
analysts that the exercise wasn’t sufficiently rigorous. Franco-
Belgian lender Dexia passed, only to collapse two months later.  “We need to be in a position to go to the banks” and
“make sure that the data the banks gives us is reliable,” he
said. “Unfortunately this is not the case at the moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
