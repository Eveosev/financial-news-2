Julius Berger Nigeria Plc (JBERGER) , the
country’s largest construction company by market value, gained
for the first time in seven days after it was shortlisted among
companies to buy state-owned power utilities.  The stock gained 4.7 percent to to 28.80 naira at the close
in Lagos, its first rise since Sept. 10. The shares have fallen
8.9 percent this year, compared with a 23 percent rise in the
Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  Julius Berger, a unit of  Germany ’s  Bilfinger Berger AG (GBF) , and
seven other companies were cleared to seek stakes in five  power
plants  while 19 companies are vying for 10 distribution
companies, Abuja-based Bureau of Public Enterprises, Nigeria’s
privatization agency, said today in e-mailed statement.  “In a fair competition we expect Julius Berger to win one
of the plants because of their track record,” Raheem Mohammed,
chief operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd.,
said by phone today. “This will impact positively on their
stock.”  Nigeria , Africa’s top oil producer, is selling majority
stakes in 17 power generation and distribution companies spun
out of the former state utility, Power Holding Company of
Nigeria, as it seeks private investment to curb power shortages.
Manitoba Hydro Electric Board of Canada signed a contract on
