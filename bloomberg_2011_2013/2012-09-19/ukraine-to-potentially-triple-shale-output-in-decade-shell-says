Ukraine could potentially double or
even triple natural-gas production in a decade after it starts
shale extraction, according to  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   Shell, which won a license in May to start commercial
production at the Yuzivska field in eastern Ukraine, has
submitted a draft product-sharing agreement to the Ukrainian
government, said Graham Tiley, its country chairman.  Europe ’s biggest energy producer is waiting for initial
test results to assess how fast the deposit can be tapped, Tiley
said in an interview last week.  “We need to see how fast the project will go and what the
level of investments will be,” Tiley said. The minimal level of
investment required at the exploration phase is $200 million, he
said.  Ukraine plans to extract 21 billion cubic meters of natural
gas domestically this year, Energy and Coal Minister  Yuriy Boyko 
said in January. The country is seeking alternatives to Russian
gas imports, which meet 70 percent of its energy needs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
