South Africa  beat Zimbabwe by 10
wickets to advance to the next stage of cricket’s ICC World
Twenty20 competition. The result also sends host Sri Lanka
through and eliminates Zimbabwe.  Man of the match  Jacques Kallis  took 4-15 last night in
Hambantota as Zimbabwe ended on 93-8 after being put in to bat.  Craig Ervine, with 37 runs, and Stuart Matsikenyeri, on 11,
were the only Zimbabwe batsmen to reach double figures in the
Group C game. Morne Morkel took 2-16 and Dale Steyn 1-9, while
wicketkeeper-captain AB de Villiers took four catches.  South Africa finished on 94-0 in 12.4 overs, Richard Levi
scoring 50 and Hashim Amla 32.  “I backed our pace bowlers to do well on this track and
Dale and Morne set the trend for us to follow,”  De Villiers 
said at the post-match presentation. “We’ve improved a lot in
these conditions and we’ve got a balanced bowling attack, so we
can’t wait to take on what comes at us.”  Sri Lanka and South Africa have two points each in Group C,
while Zimbabwe finishes with none. South Africa and Sri Lanka
meet in Hambantota on Sept. 22 in the final group match.  Today, defending champion England plays its first game in
Group A against Afghanistan in Colombo, while  Bangladesh  and New
Zealand meet in Group D in Pallekele.  The top two in each of the four groups go through to a
Super Eight stage, from which the top two teams in each pool
advance to the semifinals. The final is in  Colombo  on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
