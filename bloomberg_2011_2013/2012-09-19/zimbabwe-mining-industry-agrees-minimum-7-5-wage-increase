Zimbabwe’s National Employment
Council for the  Mining Industry , comprising the Mineworkers
Union of Zimbabwe and the Chamber of Mines, has agreed to a 7.5
percent wage increase for most miners.  The minimum wage for gold miners will rise to $197.53 a
month, up from $183.75. Diamond and platinum mine workers will
see their pay climb to $212.21 from $197.40, according to a
document handed to reporters by the chamber.  John Chikombero, the chief executive officer of the Harare-
based chamber, didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed questions.  Zimbabwe has the world’s second-largest deposits of
platinum and ferrochrome, after neighboring South Africa. The
country also produces gold, coal, diamonds, nickel and copper.  Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM) , Metallon Corp.,  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  and
Hwange Colliery Co. are among mining companies operating in
Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
