Intel Corp. (INTC)  Executive Vice
President  Sean Maloney , once seen as a candidate to lead the
company, will retire in January.  Maloney, 56, who suffered a stroke in 2010, will leave
after 30 years at the world’s largest chipmaker, the Santa
Clara, California-based company said in a statement today. Intel
does not plan to replace him in his current position of chairman
of Intel China.  Credited by Chief Executive Officer  Paul Otellini  with
being among the first to identify the importance of Asia to the
technology market, the London-born Maloney led the company’s
growth efforts in the region.  “Sean is a well-known visionary for Intel and the
computing industry,” said Otellini, in the statement. “He
leaves a major mark on Intel and the industry.”  Maloney was one of two executive vice presidents running
Intel’s main chip business, reporting directly to Otellini,
until his stroke. He went on medical leave for several months
from March 2010 after losing his ability to speak. He has since
has regained much of his speech.  In previous positions at Intel, Maloney ran sales in Asia
and the company as a whole. He started at Intel in Europe and
went on to become a technical assistant to  Andy Grove , then
Intel’s CEO, as part of the program the company uses to identify
and train future leaders.  “I worked on three continents and saw the world as a
representative of Intel,” Maloney said in the statement. “I
look forward to my retirement and spending more time with my
family.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
