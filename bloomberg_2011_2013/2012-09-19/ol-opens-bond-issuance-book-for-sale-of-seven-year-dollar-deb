Hungarian refiner  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  started
taking orders for a seven-year dollar-denominated benchmark
bond, said a person familiar with the offering, who asked not to
be identified because terms aren’t set.  Mol, which hired  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  as
book runners, is offering to pay “low to mid” 500 basis points
over the seven-year swap, the person said.  The yield on Mol’s 2017 euro-denominated notes fell 14
basis points to 6.214 percent by 2:48 p.m. in Budapest, the
lowest since June 2011. Mol  shares  gained 0.4 percent to 18,520
forint at the same time, rising for a second day.  European stocks and commodities advanced, snapping two days
of declines, and the yen weakened after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
unexpectedly boosted its asset-purchase program. Gold climbed to
a six-month high and Spain’s bonds rallied.  Hungarian companies including Mol will increasingly turn to
the bond market as local banks struggle to obtain funding and
extend credit, Zsolt Hernadi, Mol’s chairman told a conference
last year.  Corporate credit conditions will tighten further this year
as banks’ willingness to lend declines on the “unfavorable”
economic outlook, the central bank said in its quarterly lending
survey on Aug. 29, two weeks after data showed Hungary’s
recession deepened further in the second quarter.  Mol is rated BB+ at Standard & Poor’s with a stable outlook
and BBB- with a stable outlook at  Fitch Ratings .  To contact the reporters on this story:
