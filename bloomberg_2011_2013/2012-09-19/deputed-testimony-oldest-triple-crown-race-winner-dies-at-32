(Corrects spelling of horse’s name throughout.)  Deputed Testamony, the oldest
surviving winner of a Triple Crown thoroughbred horse race, died
yesterday at the age of 32.  “Up until a few days ago his health was fine, but grazing
him last night I could tell he was telling me it was time,”
said Billy Boniface, manager of the Bonita Farm in Darlington,
 Maryland .  Deputed Testamony skipped the  Kentucky Derby  and won the
Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore on May 21,
1983, as a 14-1 long shot. The stallion went on to finish in
sixth place in the Belmont Stakes, the final race in the Triple
Crown series.  In his last race the following year, he ran one minute,
40.40 seconds in the City of Baltimore Handicap at Pimlico on
Preakness Day, a track record for 1 1/16th mile that still
stands. He was retired to stud after injuring himself during the
race and ended his career as a stallion after 19 years.  Deputed Testamony, the last Maryland-bred winner of the
Preakness, won 11 of his 20 races and finished second in three,
earning $674,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
