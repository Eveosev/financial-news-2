Australia selected prop Paddy Ryan
and winger Nick Cummins as the only uncapped players in its
touring squad for the final two rounds of the southern
hemisphere’s inaugural Rugby Championship.  The pair, who have trained with the Wallabies throughout
the tournament without being required on match day, were
included today in a 28-man roster for the Sept. 29 game against
South Africa in Pretoria and the Test against Argentina in
Rosario seven days later.  The previously injured trio of hooker  Stephen Moore , lock
Sitaleki Timani and winger Dominic Shipperley were included and
all three are expected to be available to take on the Springboks,
the team said in an e-mailed statement.  Fly-half Quade Cooper was last night ruled out of the
remainder of the tournament because he requires surgery to clean
up chipped cartilage in his right knee.  Australia is second in the championship standings after
rallying for wins the previous two weekends. Tournament leader
New Zealand will secure the title by winning either of its final
two matches in Argentina or South Africa.  BACKS: Nick Phipps, Brett Sheehan, Ben Tapuai, Anthony
