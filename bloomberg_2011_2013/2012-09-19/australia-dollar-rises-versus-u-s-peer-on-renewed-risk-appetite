The Australian dollar advanced
versus its U.S. peer as the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s unexpected monetary
stimulus expansion boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie gained against the majority of its 16 most-
traded counterparts after Japanese policy makers added 10
trillion yen ($128 billion) in stimulus, following measures by
the  Federal Reserve  and  European Central Bank  this month. New
Zealand’s currency declined versus most peers as the nation’s
annual current-account deficit widened to the most in three
years amid rising fuel imports and improved profit for foreign-
owned banks.  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.0480 in
New York yesterday after earlier falling as much as 0.4 percent
to $1.0418. It declined 0.3 percent to 82.13 yen after rising
0.6 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, declined 0.1
percent versus the greenback to 82.67 U.S. cents after rising as
much as 0.3 percent. The kiwi decreased 0.6 percent to 64.81
yen.  The Japanese central bank’s decision to enlarge its asset-
purchase fund to 55 billion yen was forecast by five of 21
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The bank kept its
benchmark interest rate between zero and 0.1 percent.  The kiwi has strengthened 3.7 percent this year, the
biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation currencies on the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie has fallen
0.4 percent and the greenback is down 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
