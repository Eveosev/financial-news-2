structural challenges that have not been resolved. They exist
everywhere.”  European stocks climbed after  Japan ’s central bank

announcement caused VW’s stock to surge as short sellers raced
to buy shares borrowed in bets that VW would fall.  Inditex rose 3.7 percent to 95.31 euros after the owner of
the Zara and Massimo Dutti chains reported a 32 percent jump in

chip industry will slow down.  A Samsung spokesman said the company, which is the world’s
largest seller of mobile phones and televisions, has yet to make
a decision on its investment plans for next year.  Zodiac Aerospace (ZC)  dropped 2.7 percent to 79.75 euros, its
