The U.S.  Supreme Court  refused to
postpone  Texas ’s congressional elections, rejecting calls from a
Hispanic civil-rights group that said the district lines
illegally discriminate against racial minorities.  The rebuff of the League of United Latin American Citizens
leaves intact an interim map that a three-judge panel in  San
Antonio  put in place for this year’s Nov. 6 election. The map is
designed to govern while a separate case goes forward to
determine the district lines for future years.  In that separate case, a three-judge panel in  Washington 
ruled last month that a congressional map drawn by the
Republican-controlled Texas legislature violates the U.S. Voting
Rights Act by reducing the power of minority groups. The panel
also threw out the voting lines for the state legislature.  The Washington court’s ruling prompted LULAC, as the
Hispanic-rights group is known, to ask the Supreme Court to
order changes to the interim congressional map as well. The  high
court  today rejected that bid.  In January, the Supreme Court unanimously threw out earlier
versions of the interim maps for both federal and state races.
The San Antonio court then put in place maps that hewed more
closely to the ones drawn by the legislature. The state used the
new interim maps for the May 29 primary.  The case acted on today is League of United Latin American
Citizens v. Perry, 12A234.  To contact the reporter on this story:
