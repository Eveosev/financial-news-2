German two-year notes erased a
decline before the nation sells 5 billion euros of the
securities at an auction.  The two-year rate was little changed at 0.07 percent as of
9:59 a.m. London time, after earlier rising as much as two basis
points to 0.10 percent.  German 10-year bunds were also little changed at 1.63
percent, after rising as much as four basis points to 1.67
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
