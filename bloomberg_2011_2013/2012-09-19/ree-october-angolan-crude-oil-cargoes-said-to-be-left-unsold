Three Angolan crude cargoes for
loading in October remain unsold, according to three traders who
participate in the market.  The grades that have yet to find buyers are a Girassol for
loading on Oct. 31 to Nov. 1, a Palanca for Oct. 30 to Oct. 31
and a Cabinda that was deferred by one day to load on Nov. 1 to
Nov. 2, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential.  It was unusual for so many cargoes to still be available at
this time of the month, the traders said.  Angola plans to export 56 lots totaling 1.74 million
barrels a day of crude in October, compared with 51 shipments
this month, according to a shipping program obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
