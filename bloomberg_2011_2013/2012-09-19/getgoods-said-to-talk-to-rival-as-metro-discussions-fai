Getgoods.de AG (GGO)  is in talks to be
bought by a competitor after negotiations for the online
retailer to be acquired by  Metro AG (MEO) ’s Media-Saturn consumer-
electronics chain failed, two people familiar with the
discussions said.  Getgoods.de, a Frankfurt-based seller of goods including
mobile phones, computers, televisions and toys, is valued at 60
million euros ($77 million) to 100 million euros, according to
the people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The company is in advanced talks with another investor
in the industry, the people said. Negotiations with Media-Saturn
halted because the companies couldn’t agree on Getgoods.de’s
valuation, the people said.  A spokesman at Dusseldorf, Germany-based Metro declined to
comment. Getgoods.de Chief Executive Officer Markus Rockstaedt- Mies declined to comment when contacted by phone.  Getgoods.de is selling a 7.75 percent five-year bond with
quarterly coupon payments to raise as much as 30 million euros
to finance growth. The company, which first sold  stock  in 2011
and  changed  its name from Duebag a year ago, wants to expand its
product line, strengthen its brands and increase margins,
Rockstaedt-Mies said in a statement on Sept. 18. Getgoods.de has
about 200 employees.  Getgoods.de shares rose 5.8 percent to 2.90 euros in
 Frankfurt , the largest gain since July 6.  Metro Chief Executive Officer Olaf Koch, who took his post
in January, is seeking to increase revenue at Media-Saturn by
boosting online sales. Metro acquired Web retailer Redcoon GmbH
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
