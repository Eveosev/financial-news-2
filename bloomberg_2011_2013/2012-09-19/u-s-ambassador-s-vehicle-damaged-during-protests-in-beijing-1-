China  expressed “regret” over an
incident in which demonstrators in Beijing caused minor damage
to the official vehicle of U.S. Ambassador  Gary Locke  on Sept.
18, a State Department spokeswoman said.  Locke was unharmed and Chinese police stationed outside of
the embassy cleared the demonstrators from the scene after they
surrounded the vehicle, State Department spokeswoman  Victoria
Nuland  said at a press briefing in Washington yesterday.  The car was a “target of opportunity” for a group of
about 50 protesters who were chanting slogans against Japanese
control of disputed islands, Nuland said. The U.S. embassy in
Beijing is near the Japanese mission, she said.  Hundreds of Chinese demonstrators have protested outside of
the Japanese embassy in Beijing since Sept. 15, expressing anger
over Japan’s claims to the islands in the  East China Sea .
Demonstrations against Japan have also taken place in cities
across China, including Shanghai, Tianjin and Chengdu. The
islands are called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.  Chinese authorities are investigating the incident and take
seriously the protection of diplomats in China, Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Hong Lei told reporters yesterday.  Locke was in the car at the time and the ambassador’s
official Cadillac limousine was flying the U.S. flag, a U.S.
official said earlier, speaking on condition of anonymity
because he wasn’t authorized to comment publicly on the matter.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
