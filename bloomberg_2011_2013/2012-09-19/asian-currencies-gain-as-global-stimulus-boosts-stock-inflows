approaching a four-month high, as global stimulus measures
boosted inflows into emerging-market stocks.  The Bank of  Japan  increased its asset-purchase fund to 55

statement released in Tokyo today, less than a week after the
 Federal Reserve  announced a third round of quantitative easing.

program this month to reduce  interest rates  for struggling euro-
area nations. Foreign funds pumped $700 million into Indonesian,
Taiwanese and South Korean shares yesterday, exchange data show.  “The open-ended quantitative easing policies will push
liquidity into Asian currencies,” said Patrick Ella, an
economist at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “There’s been some
occasional market pullback, but overall equity inflows have been
strong.”  The  Philippine peso  closed 0.3 percent stronger at 41.622
per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. South
Korea’s won and Thailand’s baht also rose 0.3 percent to
1,114.70 and 30.78, respectively. China’s  yuan  climbed 0.14
percent to 6.3098.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies outside of Japan, advanced
0.2 percent to 116.85 today, extending its gain this month to
1.2 percent. The gauge reached 117.02 on Sept. 17, the highest
level since May 2. The MCSI Asia Pacific Index of shares snapped
a two-day drop, rising 0.5 percent.  Negative Rates  The peso halted a two-day decline and traded near the
strongest level since 2008 ahead of a central bank report today

balance of payments in August, according to Security Bank Corp.
Standard Chartered Plc said in research note today the U.S.
quantitative easing program is a “net positive” for inflows
for Asian currencies.  The won reversed earlier losses and approached a six-month
high after the  Bank of Japan  announcement. The Kospi index of
stocks rose for a second day.  BoJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the monetary authority
will abandon minimum yields for 1.8 trillion yen of monthly
government-bond purchases conducted separately from the stimulus
fund, opening the door to the potential for negative rates.  “With shares gaining on the BOJ announcement, sentiment in
the  currency market  also improved, supporting the won,” said
Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency analyst at Woori Futures
Inc. “Japan’s easing measures triggered cross trades of selling
the yen and buying the won.”  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to
NT$29.405 versus its U.S. counterpart and Malaysia’s ringgit
strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.0575. Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.4
