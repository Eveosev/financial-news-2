Qatar Petroleum , the Persian Gulf
country’s state-run energy company, plans to finance $10 billion
to $13 billion worth of projects in 2014, the head of project
finance said.  The projects may include two petrochemical plants and an
aromatics complex, Meshaal Al-Mahmoud told reporters at a
conference in the Qatari capital Doha.  “As part of the finance plan, we would approach the bank
market,  capital market , Islamic” and export credit agencies, he
said. “These figures will be more scrutinized as we go forward.
We are still at an early stage today.”  Qatar Petroleum plans to spend as much as $25 billion over
the next five years on projects, Al-Mahmoud said. These include
a planned $6.4 billion petrochemical plant done in partnership
with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and a $5.5 billion plant in
partnership with Qatar Petrochemical Co, a unit of  Industries
Qatar (IQCD)  QSC.  The aromatics plant would be built in the industrial city
of Ras Laffan and is in the early stages of being planned, he
said. A partner hasn’t been chosen.  No “major” projects will need financing this year or next
year, Al-Mahmoud said.  Qatar, the world’s biggest liquefied natural-gas producer,
is diversifying away from exports of the chilled fuel into using
gas for industrial enterprises and domestic power generation.
Last year, Qatar Petroleum completed financing arrangements for
the Barzan domestic natural-gas project with a $7.2 billion
syndicated loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
