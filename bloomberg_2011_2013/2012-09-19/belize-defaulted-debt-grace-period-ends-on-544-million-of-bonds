A 30-day grace period for Belize to
make a payment on $544 million of defaulted bonds ends today
with the Central American country’s government and creditors
still trying to reach an accord.  “While the grace period ends, we do not believe this will
interrupt negotiations,” Mark Espat, the government’s chief
negotiator in the debt talks, said in an e-mail message. “The
government’s view is that a fair and timely resolution is only
possible through transparent and good faith negotiations.”  Belize, which has a population of 333,000 people, missed a
$23 million interest payment Aug. 20 after Prime Minister Dean Barrow won re-election this year on promises to restructure
borrowings. The government is holding talks with a creditor
group that holds more than $300 million of debt.  Belize’s bonds due in 2029 fell 0.48 cent to 34.56 cents,
according to Bloomberg data, after trading just above 35 cents
since the middle of August.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  and Citigroup Inc. say the government’s
 three proposals  to restructure debt presented Aug. 8 give the
securities a net present value of about 20 cents, the least
among 16 sovereign debt restructurings since 1998.  AJ Mediratta, a partner at Greylock Capital Management in
 New York  who is leading the investors group, declined to comment
on the committee’s negotiations with the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
