Grupo ACP Inversiones y Desarrollo,
the Peruvian microfinance lender with operations in 10 Latin
American countries, plans to become the biggest provider of
small-business loans in  Mexico  once it converts its Forjadores
de Negocios SA unit into a bank.  ACP, which owns Mibanco,  Peru ’s fifth-largest bank, aims to
begin operations as Banco Forjadores in the first quarter of
next year and expects it to have “millions” of customers in
the medium term, the Lima-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. It received Mexican regulatory approval to
establish the bank yesterday.  The Mexican unit lends to female entrepreneurs and will now
start offering microfinance loans to all Mexicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
