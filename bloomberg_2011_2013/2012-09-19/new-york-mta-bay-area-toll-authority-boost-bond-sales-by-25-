Issuers from  New York  to the San
Francisco Bay Area boosted the size of their municipal-bond
deals by about 25 percent before the biggest wave of state and
local government sales in three months.  The  Metropolitan Transportation Authority , operator of  New
York City ’s mass-transit system, increased the size of its deal
to $1.28 billion from $1 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The portion of the sale maturing in 10 years was
priced to yield 2.73 percent, the data show.  Standard & Poor’s 
rates the bonds A, sixth-highest.  The Oakland-based Bay Area Toll Authority, which oversees
seven bridges, sold about $903 million, up 26 percent from the
planned $716.5 million, Bloomberg data show. The 10-year debt,
with an S&P rating of AA, third-highest, was priced to yield 2.2
percent, the data show.  The $3.7 trillion tax-free market is set for increased
issuance after the two transit-agency deals, which are poised to
be the biggest of the week. States and cities have $14 billion
of sales scheduled in the next 30 days, the most in three
months, Bloomberg  data  show.  The yield on top-rated municipal debt maturing in 10 years
was unchanged at 1.78 percent at 2 p.m. in New York, according
to a Bloomberg Valuation  index .  Interest rates  fell as low as
1.63 percent in July, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
