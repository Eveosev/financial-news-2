J.C. Penney Co. Chief Executive
Officer  Ron Johnson  said its new shops are doing better than the
rest of the store as the retailer turns locations into a
collection of branded boutiques.  J.C. Penney will eventually have 100 shops in stores and
change 25 of them every year, Johnson said today during an
investor presentation. He said the Plano, Texas-based retailer
will compete with the “fast fashion” of  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) 
and Century 21.  Johnson,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s former retail chief, compared the new
layouts to iPhone applications and said several designers are
interested in having shops. Implementing the new layout is
central to Johnson’s plan to turn around the fourth-largest U.S.
department store company, which saw  sales  slide 20 percent in
the first quarter.  It is “way too early to draw conclusions” about the new
layout, Johnson said, adding that women’s shops are “off the
charts.”  J.C. Penney  rose  0.1 percent to $29.09 at the close in  New
York . The shares have dropped 17 percent this year.  “I like the story, but you are talking 2014 before the
concept is in place enough for it to really figure,” Noel Hebert, chief investment officer of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-
based Concannon Wealth Management LLC, said today in an e-mail.
“Right now, your store-within-a-store brands/boutiques are
doing well, but are not large enough to move the needle.''  Last month, the retailer added Levi Strauss & Co. denim
bars and five other mini-shops in 683 stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
