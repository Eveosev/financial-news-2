Acciona SA (ANA) , a renewable energy and
water provider, rose in Madrid trading today after winning
wastewater treatment contracts in Mexico City and Costa Rica.  The Alcobendas, Spain-based company, which has sewage and
wind projects in Mexico, a water treatment contract in Medellin,
 Colombia , two treatment facilities in Peru and wastewater and
turbine supply agreements in Brazil, valued the contract to
build and maintain the El Caracol wastewater plant for 23 years
at 764 million Mexican pesos ($60 million).  El Caracol’s treated water will be used to irrigate 6,000
hectares (14,800 acres) of crops in the municipalities of
Texcoco and Atenco in the Mexico City metropolitan area and aid
in restoring at least 2,000 hectares of a former lake at
Texcoco, the company said yesterday in a statement.  Acciona Aguas on Sept. 13 said it will construct and
operate the biggest wastewater treatment plant in  Costa Rica , a
$45 million project to serve at least 1 million people in the
capital, San Jose. The company also plans to build a
desalination plant for the  mining industry  in Chile’s Atacama.  Acciona shares climbed 4.8 percent to 47.03 euros by the
close of trading in Madrid, their highest since July 4 and
trimming losses this year to almost 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
