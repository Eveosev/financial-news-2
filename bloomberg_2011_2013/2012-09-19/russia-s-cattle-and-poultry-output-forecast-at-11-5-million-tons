Russia’s cattle and poultry output
is expected to be 11.5 million metric tons in 2012, Agriculture
Minister Nikolai Fedorov said.  That’s 535,000 tons more than in 2011, Fedorov said in
parliament today. The figures are based on live-weight
measurements, which include skin, byproducts and bones.  Cattle and poultry production rose by about 9 percent to
6.6 million tons in the first eight months this year, he said.
Poultry rose 15 percent and pork advanced 7.4 percent in the
period, he said without giving absolute numbers for the output.  Milk production rose 2.4 percent to 22.7 million tons in
the first eight months compared with a year earlier. It’s
expected to advance to 32.1 million tons for the full year,
which would be 600,000 tons more than in 2011, Fedorov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
