Jilin Qifeng Chemical Fiber Co. is
in talks with an undisclosed seller over the possible
acquisition of assets related to “utilities generation and
transmission” and water treatment, the company said today.  Qifeng Chemical in the Hong Kong stock exchange filing said
it hasn’t entered into any legally binding agreements. The
statement came after the stock gained 14 percent, the most in 10
months, to close at 40 Hong Kong cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
