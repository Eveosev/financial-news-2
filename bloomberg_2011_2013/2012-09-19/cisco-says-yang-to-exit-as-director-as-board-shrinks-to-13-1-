Cisco (CSCO)  Systems Inc., the world’s
biggest maker of computer-networking equipment, said  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) 
co-founder  Jerry Yang  will retire from its board, reducing the
number of directors to 13.  Yang, who left Yahoo’s board in January, is resigning to
“more fully pursue new personal and business interests,” San
Jose, California-based Cisco said today in a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The 43-year-old Web pioneer joined the board in 2000 near
the height of the Internet and telecommunications bubble, when
both Cisco and Yahoo were worth several times what they are
today. Yang presided over slumping sales at Yahoo as users and
advertisers gravitated to sites including Google Inc. and
Facebook Inc. Growth has slowed at Cisco in the past two years
amid increased competition and turmoil in Europe.  Yang won’t be replaced after the annual shareholders
meeting on Nov. 15, Cisco said.  Cisco  rose  0.4 percent to $19.12 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 5.8 percent in 2012 after dropping in four
of the previous five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
