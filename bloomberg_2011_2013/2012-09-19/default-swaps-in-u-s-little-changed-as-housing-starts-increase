A gauge of corporate credit risk
was little changed as new housing construction in the U.S. rose
in August.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on company debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, declined 0.3 basis point to a mid-price of
85.1 basis points at 8:45 a.m. in  New York , according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The measure fell as the Commerce Department reported that
builders began construction on new homes at a 750,000 annual
rate, up from a revised 733,000 rate in July and less than the
median estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Bank
of Japan (8301)  unexpectedly boosted its asset-purchase program,
following measures announced by the  Federal Reserve  and European
Central bank to spur growth.  The swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, reached an 18-
month low of 83 basis points last week following the Federal
Reserveâ€™s announcement of a third round of bond buying. The
contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet
its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis
point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
