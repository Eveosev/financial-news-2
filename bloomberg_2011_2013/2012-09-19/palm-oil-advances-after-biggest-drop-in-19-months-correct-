(Corrects contract move in second paragraph.)  Palm oil  gained after the steepest
drop in 19 months yesterday boosted demand as countries sought
to build stockpiles amid dwindling global oilseed supplies.  The December-delivery contract advanced as much as 1
percent to 2,889 ringgit ($946) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and was at 2,877 ringgit at the midday
break. Futures closed 4.2 percent lower yesterday, the steepest
drop for the most-active contract since Feb. 23, 2011.  Palm oil consumption may increase through the next quarter
as world supplies are ample while production of competing seed
oils declines, Oil World said.  India , China and the European
Union may boost imports of palm oil as world output increases
3.1 million tons or 3.2 million tons in the year beginning Oct.
1, the Hamburg-based researcher said in a report yesterday.  “Demand is coming in because of the current low prices,”
Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by
phone from Singapore. “It’s attractive to stockpile” for
countries like India and Pakistan, he said.  Palm oil has traded at “extremely wide price discounts”
to other vegetable oils because stockpiles have increased in
parts of  Southeast Asia , Oil World said. Palm oil’s  discount  to
 soybean oil  was at $290.84 a ton today, compared with a five-
year average of $167.60, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Malaysian exports rose 12.2 percent to 680,112 tons in the
first 15 days of September from the same period in August,
surveyor Intertek said Sept. 15. Shipments gained 12.3 percent
to 660,955 tons, said Societe Generale de Surveillance.  November-delivery soybeans advanced 1.5 percent to $16.6475
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for December
climbed 0.7 percent to 55.69 cents a pound.  January-delivery palm oil gained 0.9 percent to 7,814 yuan
($1,238) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil for
delivery in the same month rose 0.6 percent to 9,882  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
