OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s largest oil
company, is seeking about $15 billion of loans from non-Russian
banks to fund the acquisition of  BP Plc (BP/) ’s half of  TNK-BP (TNBP) ,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal.  The state-run firm has approached lenders to discuss the
terms of the financing, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The deal is
expected to include a bridge loan and five-year term portions,
the people said.  Russian banks may also provide more than $5 billion of
additional funding to support the deal, one of the people said.
The total amount of debt Rosneft takes will depend on how much
its  capital structure  can support while maintaining an
 investment-grade credit rating , the person said. The company has
a BBB- grade from  Standard & Poor’s , a BBB score from Fitch
Ratings, and a Baa1 rating from Moody’s Investors Service.  BP said in June it’s considering a sale of its half of TNK-
BP, the company’s Russian venture with a consortium of
billionaires that is the country’s third-biggest oil and gas
producer. AAR, which represents the interests of BP’s partners
in the venture, and Rosneft have said they’re interested in
buying shares.  Rosneft’s Moscow press office declined to comment when
reached by telephone. Debtwire reported earlier on the
financing.  Bridge financings usually mature in one year and are often
used as backstops to bond offerings or longer-dated bank debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
