Brazil ’s Congress is poised to
weaken President  Dilma Rousseff ’s plan to limit deforestation
for a second time.  Lower house lawmakers decided yesterday to reduce the area
of protected zones that border rivers in mid-sized and large
properties. The bill, which is a decree from Rousseff, now goes
to a vote in the Senate, Lower House Speaker Marco Maia said in
Brasilia.  In May, Rousseff vetoed 12 items from a bill approved by
Congress to replace the country’s 1965 forest legislation. The
rejected articles reduced the area that farmers are required to
preserve. Instead of the vetoed rules, Rousseff signed a decree
that withdraws fines charged for illegal deforestation as long
as farmers agree to replant the area.  Congress has until Oct 8 to vote on the presidential decree
in both chambers or it will be voided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
