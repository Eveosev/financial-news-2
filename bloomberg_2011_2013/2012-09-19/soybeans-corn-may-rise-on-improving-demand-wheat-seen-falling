What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 3 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that a September slump in prices will spur increased
demand and reduce sales by farmers, Jacquie Voeks, a senior
market adviser for West Bend, Wisconsin-based Stewart Peterson
Group, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher after a government report today showed grain-based
ethanol  production  last week jumped 2.2 percent to the highest
since the end of June, Voeks said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that the highest prices ever for this time of the
year will spur increased U.S. planting of winter varieties and
slow demand, Voeks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
