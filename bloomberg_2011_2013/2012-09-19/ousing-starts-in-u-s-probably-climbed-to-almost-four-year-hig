New-home  construction  in the U.S. probably rose in August to the highest level in almost four years, showing residential real estate is sustaining a recovery even as the broader economy sputters, economists said before a report today.  Builders broke ground on 767,000 houses at an annual rate, up from 746,000 in July and the most since October 2008, according to the  median estimate  of 85 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Another report may show sales of existing homes advanced for a second month.  Builders such as  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV)  are gaining confidence as record-low  mortgage rates , lower prices and rising rents make buying a house more attractive. At the same time, unemployment, stagnant wages and tight credit remain obstacles to further strengthening in the industry that helped precipitate the recession.  “We expect housing to be a bright spot,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in  New York . Nonetheless, “there’s still foreclosures, there’s still delinquencies, people are still cutting on mortgage debt.”  The starts data are due from the Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 740,000 to 800,000.  Building permits , a proxy for future construction, may have declined 1.9 percent to a 796,000 annual rate after reaching a four-year high in July, according to the survey median.  At 10 a.m., the National Association of Realtors may report  sales  of previously owned homes climbed 2 percent to a 4.56 million annual rate in August from 4.47 million the prior month, the survey median showed.  Gaining Confidence  Construction company leaders are becoming more optimistic. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index of builder  confidence  climbed in September to the highest level in more than six years, the Washington-based group said yesterday.  Investors have adjusted accordingly. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Homebuilder Index (S15HOME)  has increased 77 percent this year through yesterday, outpacing a 16 percent gain for the broader  S&P 500 (SPX)  Index.  Borrowing costs and home prices remain favorable. The average rate on a  30-year fixed  mortgage held at 3.55 percent in the week ended Sept. 13, near a record-low of 3.49 reported July 26 in data dating to 1971, according to McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac . The  median price  of a new house was down 2.5 percent in July from the same time last year, according to figures from the Commerce Department.  Sales Improving  Demand is improving as a result. Sales of new homes  rebounded  in July to a two-year high, Commerce Department figures showed Aug. 23.  Red Bank , New Jersey-based Hovnanian Enterprises is among builders trying to keep up.  “Our communities are selling out more quickly and literally caught us without being able to replenish as fast as we’d like,” Ara K. Hovnanian, the company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said on a Sept. 6 earnings call. “We continue to look for new land opportunities throughout all of our markets.”  Another reason for the boost in sales may be that rents are climbing. The cost of leasing a primary residence was up 2.6 percent in the year ended August, exceeding the 1.7 percent gain in average hourly wages during the same period, according to data from the Labor Department.  Rising rents may also appeal to investors, said BNP Paribas’s Shulyatyeva. “People can buy very cheap houses, rents are on the rise -- they can get a good yield out of it,” she said.  Fed Aid  The industry may be further helped by the  Federal Reserve ’s plan for open-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called housing “one of the missing pistons in the engine” last week as he announced the third round of quantitative easing, meant to boost growth and reduce unemployment.  “Our mortgage-backed securities purchases ought to drive down mortgage rates and put downward pressure on mortgage rates and create more demand for homes and more refinancing,” he said.
