Iranian oil minister Rostam Qasemi
said his nation’s oil exports are rising after being affected by
a European embargo that started in July, the  Associated Press 
reported.  Iran  has “no problem” selling its crude, Qasemi was
quoted as saying in an address to the parliament in Tehran
today. The country’s oil exports are increasing and with this
“the way has been paved for more currency income,” he said,
according to AP, which cited a report by the state-run Mehr news
agency. Qasemi provided no figures, based on the report.  Iran has found ways to bypass some of the restrictions on
Iranian oil by providing insurance to tankers carrying the
country’s crude to Asian customers, Qasemi told lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
