Japanese  stocks  rose, sending the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  to the highest close since May 2, after
the  Bank of Japan  unexpectedly expanded its easing program to
keep the rising yen from undermining a recovery, following
stimulus measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve last week.  Ricoh Co., an office-equipment maker that gets more than 45
percent of its sales from the Americas and Europe, jumped 4.8
percent after the yen weakened.  Japan  Airlines Co. rose 1.1
percent after the carrier’s shares were relisted, with the stock
accounting for as much as 33 percent of turnover on the Topix
Index. Nissan Motor Co. rebounded after the carmaker said it
will reopen factories shut amid violent protests in  China .  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.2 percent to 9,232.21 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , with volume 37 percent above the 30-day average.
The broader Topix gained 0.9 percent to 764.80 after falling as
much as 0.2 percent earlier. Almost three shares advanced for
each that fell.  “The timing of the BOJ’s monetary easing was a surprise as
we had expected it to act at the end of October,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which manages the equivalent of $23 billion.
“We’re seeing an increase in bank lending, so the additional
liquidity from the BOJ will find its way into the real
economy.”  The central bank increased its asset-purchase fund to 55
trillion yen ($697 billion) from 45 trillion yen, according to a
statement released in Tokyo today. The Bank of Japan last
expanded the fund on Feb. 14, driving the Nikkei 225 to another
five-month high.  Five of 21 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  predicted
today’s BOJ easing while 11 expected action by October. The
latest move follows the Fed’s announcement last week that it
will buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities each month
until the U.S. labor market recovers.  BOJ Action  “The BOJ seems to have gone above and beyond because
stocks were firm and the yen didn’t strengthen much after the
U.S. move last week,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at
Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the
equivalent of about 5 trillion yen ($64 billion). “It came out
when the yen started shifting to a downtrend and stocks are
playing catch-up. The BOJ’s action will bolster that trend and
have a good impact because Japanese stocks are still low, unlike
U.S. equities.”  The yen erased gains against the dollar and euro after the
central bank decision. The Japanese currency fell as low as to
79.22 against the dollar, while losing as much as 0.8 percent to
103.63 per euro.  Ricoh jumped 4.8 percent to 716 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronic-components maker that earns almost a third of its
revenue in the U.S. and  Europe , climbed 2.2 percent to 6,920 yen.  China Protests  Automakers have been among the hardest hit Japanese
companies in China as violent protests there escalate, spurred
by a territorial dispute over islands claimed by both nations.
At risk is bilateral trade in goods ranging from rice to
tractors that has tripled in the past decade to more than $340
billion.  Japan’s three biggest carmakers -- Toyota Motor Corp.,
Nissan and Honda Motor Co. -- have halted production at Chinese
plants amid attacks on their dealerships in the eastern Chinese
port city of Qingdao.  Nissan gained 3.7 percent to 727 yen after falling 5
percent yesterday. Shares rebounded after the carmaker said it
will reopen two factories shut since Sept. 17. Toyota rose 1.9
percent to 3,255 yen, while Honda gained 2.7 percent to 2,674
yen.  Shipping lines gained the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups. The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of shipping
costs for commodities, jumped 5.1 percent yesterday, its biggest
gain since August 2011.  Nippon Yusen K.K., the nation’s biggest shipper, climbed 6
percent to 159 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. jumped 6.9 percent
to 217 yen. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. soared 12 percent to 114
yen.  JAL Climbs  Japan Airlines rose 1.1 percent to 3,830 yen after its $8.4
billion IPO. The carrier was relisted following a trip through
bankruptcy and a turnaround that shed more than a third of its
workers, canceled routes and retired older planes.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.3 percent today. Most stocks
on the gauge fell yesterday as delivery service FedEx Corp.
slumped and concern grew that European leaders will struggle to
resolve the region’s debt crisis.  -- with assistance from Yoshiaki Nohara in Tokyo.  Editors:  Jim Powell , Jason Clenfield  To contact the reporter on this story:
