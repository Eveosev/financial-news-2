Serbia  started talks with  China â€™s
CRBC International Co. on developing a 110-kilometer (176-mile)
road in the central part of the Balkan country,  Tanjug   news
agency  reported, citing Minister for Regional Development Verica Kalanovic.  The  company  will probably get the contract for the Pojate-
Preljina highway as Serbia also expects an 18-year loan for the
project from the  Export-Import Bank of China  with a low and
fixed interest rate, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
