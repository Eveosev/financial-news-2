Lanxess AG (LXS) , the German chemical
maker poised to join  Germany ’s benchmark DAX index, said it will
reach its mid-term profit goal one year earlier than planned as
new plants in Singapore, the U.S. and  China  boost revenue.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization
and one-time items may reach 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion) by
2014, the Leverkusen-based company said today in an e-mailed
 statement . Lanxess, which had set that profit goal for 2015,
also said it expects to lift earnings to 1.8 billion euros by
2018.  Lanxess is accelerating growth by expanding in faster
growing markets, building synthetic rubber factories in
Singapore and China as well as buying Brazilian rubber maker
Petroflex. The company, spun off from  Bayer AG (BAYN)  in 2005 as a
hodge podge of unprofitable units, has transformed itself by
selling lower-margin commodity operations such as materials for
paper, fibers and styrene plastics.  “We have transformed Lanxess into a growth company,”
Chief Executive Officer Axel Heitmann said in today’s statement.
“We will stick to our proven dual-track strategy of organic and
external growth.”  The chemical today reiterated this year’s goal for
operating profit to grow 5 percent to 10 percent from 1.15
billion euros in 2011.  Lanxess said earlier this month it will build a 235
million-euro plant for ethylene propylene diene monomer, or
EPDM, used in car wiper blades and door sealants in Changzhou
Yangtze Riverside Industrial Park. The investment comes on top
of butyl and butadiene factories in  Singapore  scheduled to start
production in 2013 and 2015 respectively.  The shares rose as much as 2.17 euros, or 3.3 percent, to
68.90 euros in  Frankfurt . They have gained 70 percent this year
for a market value of 5.6 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
