Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. phone company, reached tentative agreements
with unions representing 43,000 members, ending 15 months of
negotiations over new labor contracts.  A three-year accord with the  Communications Workers of
America  preserves a ban on layoffs of workers hired before 2003
and restrictions on the New York-based company’s ability to
reassign workers far from their homes, the union said today in
an e-mailed statement. In a separate statement, Verizon said it
also reached a three-year pact with the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, without providing details.  The agreements settle a dispute that led to a two-week
strike after the previous contracts expired in August 2011.
Workers took that action, the largest since 73,000 General
Motors Co. workers striked for two days in 2007, because of
disagreements over benefits, work flexibility and  job security .  “We believe this is a fair and balanced agreement that is
good for our employees as well as for the future of the wireline
business,” said Marc Reed, Verizon’s chief administrative
officer, in the company’s statement. “It provides competitive
wages, valuable benefits and affordable quality health care
while giving the company new flexibility to better serve
customers and become more efficient.”  The agreement will take about a month for members to
ratify, the Communications Workers of America said.  Verizon, which has 188,200  employees , rose 0.8 percent to
$45.27 at the  New York  close. The shares have gained 13 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
