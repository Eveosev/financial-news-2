Greek ferry services from the
country’s main port of Piraeus will stop on Sept. 26, when the
seamen’s union takes part in a 24-hour general strike.  The  Pan-Hellenic Seamen’s Federation  said in an e-mailed
statement today that the strike is aimed at restoring labor and
social security rights affected by government austerity measures
and at achieving a collective bargaining agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
