The Czech central bank doesn’t need
to use unconventional tools to ease monetary policy as it
wouldn’t reflect the healthy fundamentals of the domestic
economy,  Reuters  reported, citing Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl.  The country needs to find a way of encouraging households
and companies to spend and borrow more, Reuters cited Hampl as
saying in an interview. Hampl isn’t sure whether interest rates
should be reduced further and he couldn’t say how he will vote
at the next policy meeting on Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
