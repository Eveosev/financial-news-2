Slovenia must enact a planned
banking overhaul and other measures to win back the confidence
of the financial markets and lower its borrowing costs, Prime
Minister  Janez Jansa  said.  Borrowing costs of between 6 percent and 7 percent since
last September are “too high,” making it more difficult to
finance the budget and state debt, said Jansa today in Ravne na
Koroskem, in northern Slovenia. It’s also fueling speculation
that the government may seek financial aid from abroad, he said.  “All these trends will deteriorate further until we
accomplish what should have been accomplished a long time ago,”
Jansa said.  Lawmakers in the euro region nation will be debating and
passing measures to help re-capitalize ailing banks and overhaul
the labor market and the pension system because they are
“crucial” for Slovenia to emerge from a “dangerous
situation” Jansa said.  Slovenia ’s borrowing costs on the benchmark 2021 bond
surpassed the 7 percent mark last month, adding to concern that
the country may be the next in line to ask for an international
assistance package.  Rating companies Moody’s Investors Service, Standard &
Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have lowered Slovenia’s credit score
with a negative outlook because of the government’s need to prop
up the ailing financial industry.  The notes maturing in January 2021 rallied today, with the
yield dropping 22 basis points to 6.36 percent at 4:07 p.m. in
Ljubljana, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
