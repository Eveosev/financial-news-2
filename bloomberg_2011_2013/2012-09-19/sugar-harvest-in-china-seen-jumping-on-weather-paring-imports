China , the biggest sugar importer,
may harvest its second-largest crop after favorable weather
spurred farmers to increase planting, potentially cutting
overseas purchases and widening a global surplus. Prices fell.  Production may climb 19 percent to 13.7 million metric tons
in the season starting October, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts and traders. Output
totaled 11.5 million tons this season, according to the China
Sugar Association. The crop reached a record 14.8 million tons
in 2007-2008, data from the association show.  Futures slumped to a two-year low in  New York  this month as
dry weather helped accelerate cane crushing in  Brazil , the
world’s biggest producer, and a rebound in monsoon rains
improved crop prospects in  India , the second-largest grower.
Sugar is the third-worst performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials this year amid forecasts for a third
consecutive global surplus, helping cap world food costs. The
price reached a record in February 2011.  “The record-high prices last year fueled an expansion in
acreage in China,” said Cheng Bo, general manager of the sugar
department at PKU Founder Commodities Group Co. in Beijing.
“The crops in Guangxi will have good sugar content amid
favorable weather.” Guangxi is the country’s main cane grower.  The area under the cane crop rose about 12 percent this
year in China, Xiu Ziyang, an analyst at Citic Securities
Futures Co., said on Sept. 17. Cane crushing usually starts in
November and lasts till the end of March.  Government Intervention  China may not need to import sugar if the country produces
between 13.5 million tons and 14 million tons in 2012-2013,
according to  Jonathan Kingsman , chief executive officer of
researcher and broker Kingsman SA. The Lausanne, Switzerland-
based company estimates output at a “conservative” 12.75
million tons and consumption at 14 million tons.  Imports may continue if the government sought to stockpile
the surplus and boost domestic prices above global rates,
Kingsman said. The country’s imports may fall to 1.95 million
tons in the year beginning Oct. 1 from 3.3 million tons in 2011-
2012, the  International Sugar Organization , or ISO, in London
estimates. The 2011-2012 net imports would exceed purchases by
the U.S. by 25,000 tons, making China the world’s biggest
importer, according to ISO data.  The global surplus next season will be 13 percent bigger
than initially estimated, with a positive outlook for crops in
China and  Russia , Rabobank International said Sept. 11. Supplies
will be 5.2 million tons more than demand, compared with a
previous forecast of 4.6 million tons, it said. That follows an
estimated surplus of 8.4 million tons in 2011-2012.  Import Quota  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped as much as 0.6 percent
to 20.04 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York before
trading at 20.10 cents at 3:42 p.m. Singapore time. The price
reached 18.81 cents on Sept. 6, the lowest intraday level for
the most-active contract since August 2010. Futures rose to a
record 36.08 cents on Feb. 2, 2011.  China usually allocates 1.94 million tons of import quota
under the  World Trade Organization ’s framework. Purchases this
year will exceed that quota and may reach 3.5 million tons as
premiums in the local market have allowed the refiners to bring
in more shipments even after paying a 50 percent duty, said Sun
Ye, trader at Shanghai Tangzhishen Investment Co.  White sugar for January delivery in Zhengzhou dropped 1
percent to close at 5,389  yuan  ($854) a ton, extending this
year’s loss for the most-active contract to 9.1 percent. The
cost of production for cane sugar in China is about 6,400 yuan a
ton, based on a cane price at 500 yuan a ton, said Wang Jianfeng,
an analyst at Nanhua Futures.  China will soon introduce policies to prevent prices from
falling further, Liu Xiaonan, deputy head of the economy and
trade division of the National Development and Reform Commission,
the top economic-planning agency, said on Sept. 6 in Zhengzhou.  “What the government can do is through stockpiling and
imports control,” Liu said. “Our principle is not to disrupt
the market but to ensure a smooth operation.”  The government will stockpile 500,000 tons of refined sugar
from Sept. 20 at a base price of 6,200 yuan a ton, the
commission said Sept. 18.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
