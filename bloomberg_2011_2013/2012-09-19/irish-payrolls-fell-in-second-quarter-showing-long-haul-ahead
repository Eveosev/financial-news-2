Irish payrolls declined in the
second quarter, with economists saying the country faces a
“long haul” to reducing unemployment.  Employment fell by 33,400, or 1.8 percent, to 1.79 million
people from a year ago, the  Central Statistics Office  in Cork
said today. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of people
in work fell 0.8 percent from the first quarter, with the
jobless rate holding at 14.8 percent.  “There is no easy fix,”  Alan McQuaid , chief economist at
Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin, said in a note today. “With the
global economy in a slowdown phase, the labor market is expected
to remain under pressure for some time to come. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that emigration is playing a big part in
keeping down the numbers unemployed.”  Unemployment in Ireland, once dubbed Europe’s “ Celtic
Tiger ,” has tripled since 2008 as the ending of a decade-long
property boom was exacerbated by the global financial crisis,
prompting banks, builders and restaurants to cut jobs. Danske
Bank A/S eliminated 100 jobs in Ireland this year and said this
month it will review its operations in the country.  “Falling domestic demand, fiscal consolidation and banking
sector restructuring is taking its toll and will continue to do
so,”  Dermot O’Leary , chief economist at Dublin-based  Goodbody
Stockbrokers , said in an e-mailed note. “It will be a long haul
back to full employment.”  Unemployment rose 1.3 percent, to 308,500 in the second
quarter from a year ago. The number of people in the  labor force 
fell by 1.4 percent to 2.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
