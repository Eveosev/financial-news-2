Four  Texas  voters who were told
they’d be purged from voter-registration lists as deceased sued
the secretary of state, seeking to block the removal of
presumed-dead voters from Texas’s election rosters.  The voters asked a Travis County judge today to stop the
state from striking about 77,000 people from the electoral
rolls, arguing the plan violates the Texas election code and the
U.S. Voting Rights Act. Under the act, any changes to Texas’s
election rules must be approved by the U.S. Justice Department
or a special three-judge panel.  “There is no statutory authority for this purge,” civil
rights lawyer David Richards said in a phone interview while
waiting for the judge to rule. “There was no pre-clearance of
this and it is a clear change of procedure.”  Richards said the judge agreed to an immediate hearing on
the request for the injunction.  The case is Moore v. Morton, D-1-6N-12-002923, District
Court, Travis County, Texas (Austin).
