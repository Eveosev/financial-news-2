Fighting between Syrian rebels and
government forces spread to the Turkish border, where three
Turks suffered shrapnel wounds, CNN-Turk reported, citing
residents and officials.  A mother and her year-old child were among those wounded
last night in the border town of Akcakale, the state-run
Anatolia agency said today. CNN-Turk said clashes broke out when
Syrian forces attempted to seize a customs building near the
border with  Turkey .  “Gunfire crackled throughout the night with bullets flying
over us,” Yasin Akbas, a resident of Akcakale, told CNN-Turk.  Turkish authorities warned residents to be careful and shut
down schools in the area for the day, CNN-Turk said.  “Bullets have hit some houses and the hospital,” Mayor
Abdulhakim Ayhan of Akcakale told CNN-Turk. “We are warning
citizens not to go outside or onto rooftops.”  CNN-Turk, broadcasting live from the border area, showed
children in the streets of Akcakale while some Syrian forces
ducked on top of the customs building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
