Angola ’s constitutional court
rejected a complaint from the main opposition party over the
Aug. 31 election that re-elected the incumbent party.  The court said the opposition group’s claim had no impact
on the final result of the election, in which the governing
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola party won 175 of
220 seats and the right to extend President Jose Eduardo dos Santos’s 33-year rule by five years. The ruling was disclosed in
a statement on the court’s website.  The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
argued that the group should have more than the 32 parliamentary
seats it won because of improper voter registration and lack of
poll monitors. The opposition party was formerly a rebel group
that laid down its arms in 2002 after a 27-year war.  The Aug. 31 vote also allows the MPLA to install  Manuel Vicente , former head of the state-oil company Sonangol, as vice-
president. The court dismissed claims by two other parties
yesterday.  Angola pumps about 1.8 million barrels a day, second to
 Nigeria  on the continent, from offshore wells operated by
Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp, Total SA and BP Plc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
