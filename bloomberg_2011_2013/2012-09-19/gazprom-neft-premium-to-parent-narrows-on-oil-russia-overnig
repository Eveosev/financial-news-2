OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY) , the oil unit of
Russia’s natural gas export monopoly, fell in  New York  to trade
at the smallest premium to its parent company in six weeks after
crude slumped the most since July.  American depositary receipts of Russia’s fifth biggest oil
producer lost 3.5 percent to $24.56 yesterday, sending
valuations to 5.08 times estimated earnings. The company traded
at a 58 percent premium to  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the smallest since Aug.
8. The oil producer was the biggest decliner yesterday on the
 Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index. (RUS14BN)  The gauge of the most traded
Russian companies in New York dropped 1.7 percent to 100.67.
Futures on the RTS index rose 0.2 percent to 151,370.  Oil, which together with natural gas accounted for half of
 Russia ’s 2011 budget revenue, sank 3.5 percent yesterday, the
most since July 23, as  crude inventories  rose to 367.6 million
barrels. Gazprom, the world’s largest natural gas producer,
links its prices to oil and refined products with a time lag, a
method that dates back to the 1970s, when the fuels were more
commonly used in power generation.  “Gazprom Neft reacts to a drop in the oil price
immediately and the reaction is much stronger than Gazprom’s,”
Igor Nuzhdin, an analyst at OAO Nomos Bank, said by phone from
Moscow yesterday. “The sharp decline in the oil price pushed
Russian equities down. Gazprom enjoys a time lag.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell 2.1 percent
to $29.71. The RTS Volatility Index dropped 1.4 percent to
31.83.  ‘Signal for Further Growth’  The  Moscow shares  of  Gazprom Neft  retreated 2.1 percent to
152.73 rubles, or $4.90 yesterday. One ADR is equal to five
ordinary shares.  Gazprom fell 2.7 percent to $10.52 in New York, sending
valuations to 3.22 times estimated earnings. Gazprom, controlled
by the government, fell 1.9 percent to 164.61 rubles, or $5.28,
on the Micex. One Gazprom ADR is equal to two ordinary shares.  RTS stock-index futures gained before today’s release of
European and U.S. purchasing managers’ indexes, and a similar
gauge of Chinese factory output by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics.                    “Investors hope for good PMI data from  China  to  Europe  and
the U.S.,” Nomos’s Nuzhdin said yesterday. “They hope to see a
signal for further growth, a catalyst for stronger commodities
and energy prices, which would help Russian equities gain.”  U.S. Manufacturing  Markit Economics is scheduled to release a preliminary
 index  of U.S. manufacturing for September at 8:58 a.m. in New
York today. The  index  was at 51.5 this month, according to the
median estimate of 13 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . A
reading above 50 indicates growth.  A euro-zone  composite index  for manufacturing and services
industries was probably at 46.6 this month, compared with the
August reading of 46.3, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The release is scheduled
for 4 a.m. New York time today.  A separate  gauge  by Markit and HSBC for manufacturing in
China, which is based on a poll of purchasing managers in the
industry, was at 47.6 last month.  Crude Falls  Oil tumbled to a six-week low after the U.S. Energy
Department said yesterday supplies rose  8.53 million barrels 
last week, more than eight times what was projected in a
Bloomberg survey. Imports arrived at the highest rate since
January and output increased.  Crude oil for October delivery dropped to $91.98 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Aug. 3. It was the biggest retreat since July
23. Futures are down 6.9 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement fell 3.4 percent to
$108.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe. Brent,
a benchmark for more than half of the world’s oil, including
Russia’s main export blend called Urals, has risen from $89.23
on June 21, which was the lowest settlement since December 2010.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, lost 3.3 percent
to $106.65 per barrel yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
