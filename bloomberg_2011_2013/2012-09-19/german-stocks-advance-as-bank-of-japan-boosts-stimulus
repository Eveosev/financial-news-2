German stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as construction of new U.S. homes increased
and the  Bank of Japan  boosted its asset-purchase target.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  climbed 2 percent as Boersen-Zeitung said
the bank may cut jobs.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  gained 1.5 percent.
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  increased 1.6 percent as Asahi Shimbun reported
that the carmaker aims to sell 110,000 vehicles a year in  Japan 
by 2018.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  gained 0.6 percent to 7,390.76 at the close
of trading in  Frankfurt . The equity benchmark has  rallied 24
percent  from this year’s low on June 5 as European Central Bank
policy makers approved a bond-buying program and the Fed started
a third round of asset purchases. The broader HDAX Index added
0.5 percent today.  “The housing market in the U.S. is finally in a recovery
mode, with better numbers coming in over the last five months,”
said Ion-Marc Valahu, co-founder and  fund manager  at Clairinvest
in Geneva. “We still have bank and insurers leading the up move
as investors are moving away from the defensive sector.”  In the U.S., new housing construction climbed 2.3 percent
to a 750,000 annual rate in August from a revised 733,000 pace
in July, according to Commerce Department figures. Separate data
showed sales of  existing homes  rose more than forecast in August
to a 4.82 million annual rate, the highest in two years.  BOJ Stimulus  The Bank of Japan unexpectedly expanded its asset-purchase
fund by 10 trillion yen ($126 billion), seeking to counter an
increasing danger of contraction in the world’s third-largest
economy. The BOJ’s program, in which it buys mainly  government
bonds , was enlarged to 55 trillion yen in a unanimous decision
by the board, the bank said today. A separate fund that extends
credit to banks was held at 25 trillion yen.  The number of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
today was 14 percent greater than the 30-day average, according
to Bloomberg data.  Commerzbank added 2 percent to 1.62 euros. Germany’s
second-biggest bank may cut jobs, according to a Boersen-Zeitung
report, which cited unidentified people in the financial
industry. The newspaper said a spokesman for Commerzbank
declined to comment. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank,
gained 1.5 percent to 32.90 euros.  Volkswagen,  Europe ’s biggest carmaker, climbed 1.6 percent
to 150.50 euros. The company plans to sell 110,000 vehicles a
year in Japan by 2018, more than double its 2011 sales of 50,000
units, according to a report in Asahi Shimbun.  Evotec AG (EVT) , which offers drug research, development and
manufacturing services, advanced 6.9 percent to 2.67 euros, the
biggest gain in two months. The company won a 10-year, 60
million-euro ($78 million) contract, from the National Institute
of Health to run a small molecule repository.  To contact the reporter on this story:
