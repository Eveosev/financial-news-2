Taiwan ’s 10-year sovereign bonds
advanced for a second day as the island’s bleak export outlook
encouraged investors to favor the safety of government debt. The
local currency strengthened.  Bonds extended their rally after the Ministry of Finance
sold NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion) of 10-year notes at 1.187
percent, lower than the 1.20 percent estimated by traders in a
Bloomberg survey. The central bank will keep its  benchmark 
 interest rate  at 1.875 percent tomorrow for a fifth quarter,
according to 17 of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One
forecast a 12.5 basis point reduction, while another predicted a
25 basis point cut.  “The auction result shows demand for bonds is really big,
especially from banks,” said Alex Lai, a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Grand Cathay Securities Corp. “There’s a big
chance the central bank will not move tomorrow.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent notes due September
2022 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.191
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the
biggest decline for benchmark 10-year notes in two weeks.  Official data due tomorrow will show export orders dropped
1.9 percent in August from a year earlier, following a 4.4
percent decline in July, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Taiwan cut its full-year
overseas sales estimate last month to a 1.72 percent contraction
from a 0.07 percent expansion.  Grim Outlook  Consumer prices rose 3.42 percent in August from a year
earlier, the most in four years, official data show. Farm losses
from a typhoon last month were NT$279 million, according to the
Council of Agriculture.  The grim export outlook and inflationary risks will force
the monetary authority to stay put, economists at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , led by Hong Kong-based Liu Li-
Gang, wrote in a report released yesterday.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
increased its asset-purchase fund to 55 trillion yen ($697
billion) from 45 trillion yen, according to a statement released
in  Tokyo  today.  The currency advanced 0.2 percent to NT$29.405 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month non-
deliverable forwards added 0.2 percent to NT$29.32 against the
greenback, a 0.3 percent premium to the spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  overnight money-market rate  held at 0.386 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center
shows.  -- Editors: Amit Prakash, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
