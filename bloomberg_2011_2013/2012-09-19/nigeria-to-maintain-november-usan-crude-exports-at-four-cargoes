Nigeria , Africaâ€™s largest oil
producer, plans to export four cargoes of Usan crude oil in
November, unchanged from October, according to a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The country will ship 3.8 million barrels of the grade, or
126,667 barrels a day, in November, the schedule showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
