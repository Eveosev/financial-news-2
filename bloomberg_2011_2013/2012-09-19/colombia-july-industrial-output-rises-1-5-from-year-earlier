Colombia’s industrial production
rose 1.5 percent in July from a year earlier, the government’s
statistics agency said on its website today.  Economists had forecast an increase of 2.3 percent,
according to the median estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The central bank cited weak industrial output growth in its
decision to cut  interest rates  a quarter point last month,
according to the minutes of the August policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
