(Corrects Oliveira’s title in first paragraph.)  Brazil ’s government will create a
commission to study tax cuts on food staples, Dyogo Oliveira,
deputy executive secretary of the  Finance Ministry , said
yesterday.  The commission will define the range of foods to which the
tax cuts will be applied, Oliveira said to reporters in
Brasilia. The study will be completed by Dec. 31, he said.  The government’s veto of tax cuts on food staples passed by
Congress was for technical reasons, Oliveira said. Such tax cuts
will occur after the measures are more specifically defined, he
said.  Editor: Harry Maurer  To contact the reporter on this story:
