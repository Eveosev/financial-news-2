OAO  Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,  VimpelCom
Ltd. (VIP) , OAO MegaFon and OAO  Rostelecom (RKMD)  may set up a joint venture
with state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to acquire
the operatorsâ€™ mobile telecommunications towers,  Vedomosti 
reported, citing an unidentified person close to Rostelecom.  The operators would transfer to the new company about 700
towers and another 14,800 would be bought for $1 billion with
RDIF backing; the fund would have 85 percent of the venture,
with the remainder distributed among the operators, the
