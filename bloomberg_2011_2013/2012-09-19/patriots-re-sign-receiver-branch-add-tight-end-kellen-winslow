The  New England Patriots  re-signed
wide receiver Deion Branch, the Most Valuable Player of their
most recent  Super Bowl  win in 2005, and added tight end Kellen Winslow after an ankle injury to  Aaron Hernandez .  Branch, 33, was one of the Patriots’ final roster cuts on
Aug. 31 before the National Football League season. He started
15 games for New England last season and caught 51 passes for
702 yards and five touchdowns.  An 11-year NFL veteran, Branch was a second-round draft
pick of the Patriots in 2002 and won two Super Bowl titles over
six seasons in New England. He played for the Seattle Seahawks
from 2006 to 2010.  “Deion has just been a great player here for a long time,
so it’s always great to see him back,” Patriots quarterback  Tom Brady  said at a news conference. “There’s just a lot of
stability. He’s that kind of player: dependable, consistent. So,
we’ll see what kind of role he plays.”  Winslow, 29, is a seven-year veteran. He joins the Patriots
three days after Hernandez sprained his right ankle, an injury
that may sideline him for several weeks. Winslow, who was
released by the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 1, played with the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers last season and had 75 receptions for 763
yards and two touchdowns.  The Patriots also re-signed linebacker Niko Koutouvides,
who played in 11 games for the team last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
