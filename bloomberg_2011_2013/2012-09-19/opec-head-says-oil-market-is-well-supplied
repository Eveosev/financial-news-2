The global oil market is well
supplied, OPEC’s spare production capacity is at “comfortable
levels” and commercial oil inventories “remain healthy,” OPEC
Secretary-General Abdalla Salem El-Badri said.  “There is no shortage of oil anywhere in the world. And
this is expected to continue,” El-Badri said today in a speech
at the European Mineral Resources Conference in Leoben, Austria,
according to a transcript on OPEC’s website.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries comprises
Algeria, Angola,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The
group plans to meet next on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
