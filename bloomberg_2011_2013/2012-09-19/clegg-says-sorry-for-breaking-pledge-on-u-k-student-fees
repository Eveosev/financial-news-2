U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  apologized for breaking his word by going back on a pre-
election promise not to increase university tuition fees.  In a  political advertisement  to be broadcast on Sept. 24,
Clegg said his Liberal Democrat Party had been wrong to make the
promise when its only chance of being in government was in a
coalition with either the Conservatives or the  Labour Party ,
both of which were committed to raising fees.  “It was a pledge made with the best of intentions, but we
shouldn’t have made a promise we weren’t absolutely sure we
could deliver,” Clegg said. “There’s no easy way to say this:
we made a pledge, we didn’t stick to it --- and for that I am
sorry.”  He added: “I will never again make a pledge unless as a
party we are absolutely clear about how we can keep it. I accept
that won’t be enough for everyone. But I owe it to you to be up
front about it. And I don’t believe it should cast a shadow over
everything else the Liberal Democrats are achieving in
government.”  The move comes as Liberal Democrat activists prepare to
gather in Brighton,  England  for their annual conference next
week.  The party has seen its  support  fall to about 10 percent
from 23 percent at the May 2010 general election. The vote to
triple tuition fees in England and  Wales  to 9,000 pounds
($14,600) a year split Liberal Democrat lawmakers and led to
violent protests in  London .  Clegg continues to defend the decision to raise fees,
saying it was fair and necessary to help tackle the  budget
deficit .  To contact the reporter on this story:
