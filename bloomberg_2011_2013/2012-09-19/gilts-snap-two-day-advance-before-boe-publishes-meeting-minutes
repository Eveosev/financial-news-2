U.K. 10-year gilts snapped a two-
day advance before the  Bank of England  publishes minutes on its
decision to leave  interest rates  on hold and keep its asset
purchase target at 375 billion pounds ($610 billion).  The pound strengthened against most of 16 major peers
tracked by Bloomberg. Sterling approached the strongest in over
four months versus the dollar. The U.K. Debt Management Office
is scheduled to auction 4.5 billion pounds of gilts due 2017
tomorrow.  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.89 percent at 8:19 a.m. in  London  after
rising to 1.99 percent on Sept. 17, the highest since May 10.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.14, or 1.40
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,626) face amount, to 98.705.  Gilts returned 2.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
2.2 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 1.5 percent.  The pound rose 0.1 percent to $1.6261 after climbing to
$1.6271. It advanced to $1.6273 on Sept. 17, the highest level
since April 30. Sterling was little changed at 80.32 pence per
euro.  The pound has appreciated 0.9 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 3 percent and
the euro rose 3.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
