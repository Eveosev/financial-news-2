Liquefied natural gas prices for
near-term delivery to northeast  Asia  fell for a third week to
their lowest in more than a year amid low demand for the fuel,
World Gas Intelligence said.  Prices for cargoes delivered in the next four to eight
weeks declined 5 cents to $12.75 a million British thermal
units, according to WGI’s own assessment of the market, made on
Sept. 17 and published today. That’s the lowest since May 9,
2011, WGI data show.  Southwest Europe LNG prices were unchanged at $10.10 a
million Btu, according to WGI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
