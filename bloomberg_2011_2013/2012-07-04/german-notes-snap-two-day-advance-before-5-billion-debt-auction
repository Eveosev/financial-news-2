German government bonds rose after a
survey of  purchasing managers  showed the nation’s  service
industries  unexpectedly shrank last month, spurring demand for
the region’s safest assets.  Five-year notes advanced for a third day as bidding
increased at a 3.3 billion-euro ($4.15 billion) auction of the
securities. Italian 10-year bonds fell for the first time in
five days after the  budget deficit  rose to the highest level in
three years amid a deepening recession. The  European Central
Bank  will cut  interest rates  at a policy meeting tomorrow,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “There’s a risk-off feel in the air today and that’s
supporting bunds,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . “Expectations of
ECB action tomorrow and anxiety about the weaker PMI data have
underpinned the safe-haven bid.”  Germany ’s five-year  yield  fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 0.49 percent at 4:27 p.m. London time after
dropping to 0.48 percent, the least since June 19. The 0.5
percent note due in April 2017 gained 0.325, or 3.25 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.065. The 10-year yield declined
eight basis points to 1.46 percent.  A gauge of German service industries slid to 49.9 in June,
below a previous estimate of 50.3, London-based Markit Economics
said. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. A composite
index for euro-area services and manufacturing industries rose
to 46.4 from May, Markit said, above an estimate of 46 published
on June 21.  German Auction  Investors bid for 2.7 times the amount of German five-year
notes allotted, up from 1.56 at the prior sale on June 6, and
the second highest since May 2004. The securities were sold at
an average yield of 0.52 percent, versus 0.41 percent in June.  The extra yield, or  spread , investors demand to hold 30-
year bunds instead of five-year notes expanded to 182 basis
points, the most since Sept. 9. The spread reached 188 basis
points on Sept. 5, the widest since June 2010.  ECB policy makers will cut their benchmark rate by 25 basis
points to a record 0.75 percent tomorrow, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 63 economists. Five
predict a reduction of 50 basis points and 11 foresee no change.  Italian Bonds  Italian  10-year bonds  dropped after the national statistics
institute said the  budget deficit  increased to 8 percent of
gross domestic product in the three months through March, from 7
percent a year earlier.  “The budget deficit numbers weren’t very pretty,” Merrill
Lynch’s Wraith said. “They serve as another reminder that the
contortions the periphery are going through aren’t obviously
bearing fruit. It’s becoming harder rather than easier to
continue down the path of fiscal constraints.”  Italian 10-year yields climbed 15 basis points to 5.78
percent after dropping to 5.59 percent, the lowest since June 7.  Spanish  government securities  also declined, with the 10-
year yield rising 16 basis points to 6.41 percent.  Greek 10-year bonds gained as International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said she wasn’t in the mood
to revisit the terms of the nation’s financial bailout.  The yield on the nation’s 2 percent security due in
February 2023 dropped eight basis points to 26.05 percent,
leaving the price at 17.61 percent of face value. The yield
climbed 40 basis points yesterday.  ‘Renegotiation Mood’  “I am not in a negotiation or renegotiation mood at all,”
Lagarde said in an interview on CNBC television yesterday, as
officials from the IMF, ECB and the European Commission began a
visit to  Greece  today to assess progress in implementing the
terms of the second international bailout.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras put together a
coalition government after the June 17 elections with pledges to
renegotiate parts of the 130 billion-euro second bailout from
the European Union and the IMF.  Irish securities due in October 2020 declined before the
country sells 500 million euros of three-month bills tomorrow in
its return to financial markets for the first time in almost two
years. The yield on the 5 percent bond maturing in October 2020
increased four basis points to 6.27 percent.  Treasury 10-year futures expiring in September gained 0.2
percent to 133 29/32. Trading in Treasuries is shut worldwide
today due to the July 4 holiday in the U.S.  German  government bonds  have returned 2.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
debt gained 10 percent, and Spanish securities lost 2.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
