The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  dropped 3.5 basis points
to 170 basis points as of 10:13 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The index has traded between 211 basis points
and 128 basis points this year, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 166 as of 8:14
a.m. in Singapore, Standard Chartered Plc prices show. The gauge
is on track for its seventh-consecutive day of decline and its
lowest close since May 3, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan  index  decreased 3 basis points to
169 basis points as of 9:14 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The measure is set for the lowest close since April
13, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
