Texas  International Terminals, which
unloads about 1 million barrels of oil a month, cleaned up a
200-barrel spill of Cima Energy Ltd. crude from a rail car,
according to a company official.  “It didn’t take very long, we had men out there
immediately,” said Matt Haidinyak, director of marine traffic
at the terminal in Galveston, Texas. “It didn’t slow us down at
all.”  Previous renters of the rail car didn’t close a belly
valve, which caused the spill yesterday, Haidinyak said in a
telephone interview.  The incident at 2:45 p.m. local time was reported to the
National Response Center. U.S. companies must notify the center
if they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
