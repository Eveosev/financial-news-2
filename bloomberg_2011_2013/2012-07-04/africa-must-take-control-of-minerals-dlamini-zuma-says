South Africa’s Home Affairs Minister
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is bidding to lead the African
Union, urged African countries to take charge of their mineral
wealth to ensure their citizens derive greater benefit.  “We need to take control of our  mineral resources ,”
Dlamini-Zuma said in a speech to the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association in Johannesburg yesterday. “At the moment, the
company doing the extraction or beneficiation gets the
resources, while the country and its people receive very
little.”  Her comments follow a debate within South Africa’s ruling
 African National Congress  over whether to nationalize mines or
increase taxes on the industry. The party will make a final
decision on mining policy at its national conference in
December.  Africa has about 12 percent of the world’s known  oil 
reserves and 40 percent of its gold, resources that should be
utilized to attract more investment to the world’s poorest
continent, Dlamini-Zuma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
