(Corrects to say gold trading in London in final
paragraph.)  Canadian stocks rose for a sixth day
led by financial shares after the Competition Bureau approved a
proposed bid for the Toronto Stock Exchange by a group of
Canadian banks. Consumer shares advanced as U.S. car sales rose
more than analysts expected last month.  TMX Group Inc., owner of Canada’s main equity and
derivatives exchanges, rose 3.2 percent, the biggest gain in
more than two months.  The three largest banks,  Royal Bank of Canada , Toronto-
Dominion Bank, and Bank of  Nova Scotia , gained as bank stocks
led advances.  Magna International Inc. (MG) , North America’s largest
auto-parts supplier, rose 5.9 percent, its biggest gain in two
months.  Suncor Energy (SU)  rose 1.2 percent as energy stocks rallied.  The S&P/TSX rose 68.86 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,917.19
at 12:14 p.m. in Toronto. On the gauge, 158 members rose and 78
fell. The benchmark index rose the most yesterday since January.  “Auto news continues to show strength as consumers in the
U.S. continue to spend. When people are buying big-ticket items
such as cars and trucks, it shows they still feel confident
spending,” said Anil Tahiliani, who manages the portfolio that
holds Magna stock at Calgary-based McLean & Partners Wealth
Management, which runs C$900 million ($888 million).  The Competition Bureau in Ottawa said that it doesn’t
intend to challenge the acquisition of TMX Group.  General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC
reported better than predicted gains from the year-earlier
period in which they dominated the U.S. market because of
vehicle shortages at Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.
caused by Japan’s tsunami.  Banks Gain  Royal Bank rose 1.6 percent to C$53.94 and Toronto-Dominion
continued a six-day gain, adding 0.8 percent to C$80.35.
Scotiabank rose 1.1 percent to C$53.89.  Magna rose 5.6 percent to C$42.24.  Linamar Corp. (LNR) , the
Aurora, Ontario-based manufacturer of automotive parts, gained
for the second day, moving up 2.8 percent to C$20.67.  Encana dropped 1 percent to C$20.44 as crude dropped from a
one-month high.  Trican Well Service Ltd. (TCW)  slumped 9.8 percent to
C$11.02, its biggest decline since September, as it forecast a
loss in the second quarter. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the
third-largest  oil company  in Canada, added 0.5 percent to
C$28.56.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  dropped 1 percent as the metal declined
