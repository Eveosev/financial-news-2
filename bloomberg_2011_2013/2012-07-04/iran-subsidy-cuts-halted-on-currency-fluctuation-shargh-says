Iran ’s decision to shelve a plan to
further increase energy prices this year is due to fluctuations
in the  currency market ,  Shargh  reported, citing Economy Minister
Shamseddin Hosseini.  The effects of currency fluctuation have become “more
serious,” Hosseini said. That’s led the government to hold off
on more increases “for the time being,” the newspaper cited
him as saying.  The halt doesn’t mean Iran won’t follow through with the
five-year program to gradually remove food and energy subsidies
that began in December 2010, Hosseini said, according to the
Tehran-based daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
