Japan  cut purchases of spot
liquefied-natural-gas cargoes by 27 percent in May from a month
earlier as prices soared to near a record amid the closing of
domestic nuclear  power plants .  Supplies for immediate and short-term delivery from the
Atlantic Ocean area dropped to 847,624 metric tons in May from
1.16 million tons in April, according to calculations by
Bloomberg based on  data  from the Ministry of Finance. Prices of
spot LNG climbed to about $920 a ton, or $18.93 per million
British thermal units, 16 percent higher than last year’s
average. The fuel reached a record $25 in 2008.  Japan shut all 50 of its nuclear reactors for safety tests
after last year’s earthquake and tsunami, halting atomic power
generation for the first time in more than four decades. The
country is restarting two units this month. Total LNG purchases
in May rose 16.8 percent from a year earlier.  “Spot cargoes will start to moderate in the second half as
Japan re-starts some of its nuclear facilities,” said  Neil Beveridge , an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., in  Hong
Kong  in an e-mail on June 29.  Prices of LNG  delivered  into Japan including spot and term
supplies declined by 0.6 percent from April to 70,916 yen ($889)
a ton in May, equivalent to about to $18.30 per million Btu, as
 oil prices  declined, according to the data.  The Japan Crude Cocktail, a basket of prices for oil
imported into the country used to calculate LNG prices, fell to
$124.56 a barrel in May from $126.96 in April, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. gas futures was at $2.909 per
million Btu today and U.K. supplies were at $8.85 yesterday.  Nigerian Supplies  Spot and short-term supplies of LNG rose by about half from
a year earlier while average costs at 73,424 yen a ton increased
36 percent, according to calculations based on the data.  Supplies from  Nigeria  fell 31 percent in May to 291,855
tons from a month earlier, and shipments from  Equatorial Guinea 
declined by half to 129,490 tons, according to customs data.  Japan may reduce purchases of spot cargoes in July,
according to initial estimates from ship-tracking data. The
country may bring in at least six vessels carrying fuel from the
Atlantic Ocean region and Yemen, down from nine a year earlier,
according to the data from  IHS Inc. (IHS)  and the Ministry of Finance.
Short-term imports reached a record 1.18 million tons in
February.  Utilities increased thermal power output by 34 percent in
May to compensate for the drop in nuclear generation, according
to data released June 13 by the Federation of Electric Power
Companies of Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
