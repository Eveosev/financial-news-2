Foie gras producers in the U.S. and
Canada, joined by a restaurant group, sued California to block
enforcement of the nation’s first state law banning sales of
duck liver.  The complaint, filed yesterday in federal court in  Los
Angeles , seeks to stop a law passed in 2004 that went into
effect July 1. Animal-rights advocates say force-feeding ducks
and geese with a tube inserted in the esophagus to fatten their
livers is cruel.  The ban on foie gras, the French name of the delicacy, was
signed into law by then-Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Enforcement was postponed for almost eight years to allow
producers to find an alternative to force-feeding. No substitute
method has come to light.  The law bans force-feeding of ducks or geese to make foie
gras and forbids selling foie gras produced that way. Violators
can be fined as much as $1,000 a day.  Nicholas Pacilio, a spokesman for California Attorney
General  Kamala Harris , declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Association des Eleveurs de Canards et d’Oies du
Quebec v. Kamala Harris, 12-5735, U.S. District Court, Central
District of California (Los Angeles.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
