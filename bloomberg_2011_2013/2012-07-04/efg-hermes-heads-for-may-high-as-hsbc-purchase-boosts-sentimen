EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO) , the biggest
publicly traded Arab investment bank, rose to the highest level
in almost seven weeks after HSBC Holdings Plc’s Middle East unit
bought more than a 5 percent stake.  Shares of the Cairo-based firm advanced 3.3 percent to
11.29 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the
highest level since May 17. That values the company at 5.4
billion pounds ($892 million). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated 1.4 percent.  HSBC Bank Middle East Dubai bought about 32.25 million
shares at an average of 10.15 Egyptian pounds on June 28 from
Dubai Financial Group LLC. The stake was valued at $54 million
on the day of the transaction.  The deal “is boosting sentiment for sure,” said Wafik Dawood, director of the institutional sales desk at Cairo-based
Mega Investments Securities. “It is a reminder that the company
remains solid and trading on cheap multiples.”  EFG-Hermes is waiting for approval from  Egypt ’s regulator
to proceed with the formation of a joint investment bank with
Doha-based QInvest LLC after shareholders approved the
transaction on June 2.  The stock has gained 13 percent this year compared with a
36 percent advance for the benchmark gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
