Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
plan to cut the budget was criticized by a pharmaceutical lobby,
which said reductions in health spending may prompt drug
producers to withhold new prescriptions from hospitals.  “These drugs may not arrive in Italy, and this would be a
great shame,” Massimo Scaccaborozzi, chief executive officer of
an Italian subsidiary of  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and president of
Farmindustria, said today at a conference in Rome. “But it’s
not for revenge. It’s because economic sustainability is lacking
for us, who have invested in research, to make these drugs
available.”  Monti’s government is talking with business leaders, unions
and municipal officials this week before announcing the results
of an expense review. Monti is seeking cuts to  government
spending , which accounted for  more than half  of gross domestic
product last year, to avoid tax increases.  “We understand it’s a difficult time for our country, and
we understand we’re part of public spending,” said
Scaccaborozzi of Cologno Monzese, Italy-based Janssen-Cilag SpA.
“But it can’t always be just us to pay a disproportionate
amount of the costs.”  Farmindustria, a branch of broader business lobby
Confindustria, has about 200 member companies, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
