The Bank of Mauritius said it is
considering a probe into bank charges after an increasing number
of complaints from customers.  The country’s central bank is “proposing to investigate
the terms and conditions of contracts, including fees,
commission and charges,” it said in a  statement  published on
its website today.  There is “growing evidence” from the “increasing number
and range of complaints” that consumers either don’t understand
the “full implications” of contracts or don’t have the
“correct information at the time they enter into these
contracts or may not be receiving a fair deal,” the Port Louis-
based lender said.  The central bank’s planned investigation comes a day after
three top officials at Barclays Plc in London, including Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  resigned after regulators fined
the bank a record 290 million pounds ($452 million) for
attempting to rig the London interbank rate for profit.  Mauritius’s banking industry comprises 20 licensed lenders,
including  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB)  and  State Bank of Mauritius
Ltd. (SBM) , the country’s biggest lenders by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
