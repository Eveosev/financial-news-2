Oscar Pistorius , the amputee track
athlete known as the  Blade Runner , was added to the South
African squad for the London Olympics.  Pistorius will be part of the country’s 4x400 relay team
with Willem de Beer, Ofentse Mogawane and Shaun de Jager,
according to a statement from the South African Sports
Confederation. The team won silver at the IAAF World Athletics
Championships in Daegu,  South Korea  last year.  The 25-year-old runs with J-shaped carbon-fiber blades.
Last month he failed to qualify for the 400 meters for the
games, which start July 27.  He ran a time of 45.52 seconds at the African track
championships in  Benin . He needed to run a time of 45.30 for a
second time in international competition to meet the criteria
for the Olympics after reaching the standard in March.  Pistorius was born without fibulas and had both legs
amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. In 2008 the
Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2008 overturned a ban on him
by the International Association of Athletics Federations, track
and field’s ruling body, which said the blades gave him an
advantage.  Pistorius has qualified to defend his Paralympics titles in
the 100, 200 and 400 meters.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
