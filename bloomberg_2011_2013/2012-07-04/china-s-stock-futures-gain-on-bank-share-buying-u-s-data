Chinese stocks  fell for the first
time in four days as concern that construction activity is
faltering dragged industrial companies lower, overshadowing a
rally by energy producers.  Taiyuan Heavy Industry Co. (600169)  fell to the lowest level in 3
1/2 years after saying it will post a first-half loss. Sichuan
Hongda Co. plunged 9.2 percent after the government ordered it
to halt building a plant that drew protests.  China  Shenhua
Energy Co. advanced 1.3 percent after oil jumped more than 4
percent in New York yesterday.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 1.88 points, or 0.1
percent, to 2,227.31 at the close. The CSI 300 Index slipped 0.2
percent to 2,464.92. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
1.3 percent at the close in New York.  “There’s a lack of liquidity in the market on concerns
about the economy,” said Cao Xuefeng, an analyst at Huaxi
Securities Co. in Chengdu. “In the near term, any gains will be
limited and trading is likely to be range-bound.”  The Shanghai gauge is little changed this month after
plunging 6.2 percent in June as signs the economic slowdown is
deepening overshadowed an interest-rate cut on June 8. The
gauge, which has risen 1.3 percent this year,  trades  at 9.7
times estimated profit, compared with the average of 17.5 since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2006.  Taiyuan dropped 8.1 percent to 3.18  yuan , the lowest close
since Jan. 5, 2009. The company said it probably lost about 90
million yuan in the first half of the year because of falling
demand and prices.  Services Industries  Sany Heavy, the nation’s biggest machinery maker, fell 4.1
percent to 12.85 yuan, the lowest close since March 30.  China’s services industries expanded in June at the slowest
pace in 10 months as growth in new business weakened, a private
survey showed.  The purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to 52.3 in June from a
19-month high of 54.7 in May, the companies said today. That’s
the largest decline since August. The result contradicts an
official report yesterday showing an acceleration in non-
manufacturing industries last month in the world’s second-
biggest economy.  Sichuan Hongda, a zinc producer, plunged 9.2 percent to
7.27 yuan, the lowest close since Feb. 3, 2009, after the
company said it received an order from Shifang government to
halt construction of its molybdenum and copper project. The
plant was the site of clashes between police and demonstrators
who argued the project would pollute the environment.  Coal Producers  Shenhua Energy, the nation’s largest coal producer,
advanced 1.3 percent to 22.39 yuan. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., the
fourth-largest, gained 0.6 percent to 19.40 yuan, the highest
close since June 26.  Oil climbed 4.7 percent in  New York  yesterday as Iran said
sanctions threaten the Persian Gulf country’s national security.  China may see a “moderate” expansion in bank lending this
year, the Xinhua News Agency cited a report from the China
Banking Association as saying. New lending this year will be 8
trillion yuan ($1.26 trillion) to 8.5 trillion yuan, compared
with 7.47 trillion yuan in 2011, Xinhua cited the report as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
