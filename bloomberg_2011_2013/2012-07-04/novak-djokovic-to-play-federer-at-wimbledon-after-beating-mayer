Top seed Novak Djokovic defeated
Germany’s Florian Mayer to reach the Wimbledon semifinals, where
he’ll take on six-time champion  Roger Federer .  The Serb won 6-4, 6-1, 6-4. He’s trying to be the first man
to retain the title at the All England Club since Federer did in
2007.  Earlier, the 30-year-old Swiss player beat Russia’s Mikhail
Youzhny, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2. Federer hasn’t lost to the 30-year-old
Russian in 14 matches. Federer’s victory was watched by Prince
William and his wife, Kate, on Centre Court.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
