Milling wheat futures in Paris fell
as  Chicago  grain markets remain closed today for U.S.
 Independence Day , discouraging investor buying after the grain
gained in 10 of the previous 12 sessions.  Wheat in the French capital has risen 16 percent since June
15, following gains for U.S. corn and wheat on concern a drought
in the Midwest will damage crops there. Corn in Chicago jumped
33 percent in the period, while wheat added 28 percent.  “The leader of the rally is U.S. corn, and that’s
closed,” Sebastien Poncelet, an analyst at Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel, said by phone. “We’re not buying without the
Chicago market.”  November-delivery milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe was
down 0.1 percent at 235.75 euros ($296.05) a metric ton by 3:10
p.m. in Paris. The contract earlier fell as much as 0.3 percent,
after having risen 0.6 percent to 237.50 euros, the highest
price since the contract started trading in March 2011.  “The market is taking a breather after the recent rally,”
Nick Higgins, an analyst at Rabobank International in  London ,
said in an online message. “The EU wheat balance sheet isn’t as
bullish as others in the grain complex.”  Hot, dry weather in the Midwest will persist into next
week, Telvent DTN meteorologist Joel Burgio wrote in a report
yesterday. The condition of the corn crop fell for a fourth
straight week as of July 1, with 48 percent rated good or
excellent, the worst for that date since 1988, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  reported on July 2.  Corn for November delivery was unchanged at 214.75 euros a
ton in Paris, while rapeseed for delivery the same month was
stable at 489.75 euros a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
