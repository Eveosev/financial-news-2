Bankia SA (BKIA)  Chief Executive Officer
Francisco Verdu, hired by the lender ahead of its initial public
offering a year ago, resigned, the bank said.  Verdu, 57, will resign with immediate effect, the Valencia,
Spain-based bank said in a statement sent by email today.  Verdu, a former vice-chairman and former CEO of Banca
March, a family-owned Spanish lender, joined Bankia in May 2011
before the bank raised more than 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion)
with a sale of shares that have since lost three quarters of
their value. The government completed the nationalization of
Bankia’s parent last week after the group sought 19 billion
euros of state aid to repair a balance sheet holed by losses
linked to real estate.  Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, the former second-in-command at
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  who took over as Bankia’s
chairman in May, had kept Verdu in his CEO post even as he
cleared out management at Bankia and its unlisted parent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
