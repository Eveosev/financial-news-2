Animal-borne diseases are responsible
for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million deaths a
year, according to a study by the International Livestock
Research Institute.  Gastrointestinal illnesses, mostly due to contaminated
food, are the biggest killer, causing 2.33 billion sick cases
and 1.5 million deaths, according to the study, which was funded
by the U.K.’s  Department for International Development .  Rising demand for livestock products is expected to
increase the spread of human-animal infectious diseases,
according to Delia Grace, a veterinary epidemiologist with the
livestock institute who led the study. Researchers reviewed more
than 1,000 studies and assessed the result of 56 animal-borne
diseases, according to the report.  “From cyst-causing tapeworms to avian flu, zoonoses
present a major threat to human and animal health,” Grace was
cited as saying in an e-mailed statement, using a scientific
name for diseases transmittable from animals to humans.  Leptospirosis, or swamp fever, was considered the second-
most important disease in terms of impact of human health and
livestock impact, followed by cysticercosis, also known as pork
worm, based on the study.  India  has the greatest disease burden from animal-borne
illnesses in terms of deaths and affected lives, followed by
 Nigeria , the  Democratic Republic  of the Congo and China,
according to the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
