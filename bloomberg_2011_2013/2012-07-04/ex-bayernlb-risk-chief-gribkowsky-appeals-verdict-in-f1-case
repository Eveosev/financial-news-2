Former Bayerische Landesbank Chief
Risk Officer Gerhard Gribkowsky appealed a verdict sentencing
him to more than eight years in prison over charges he accepted
bribes to facilitate the sale of the bank’s stake in Formula One
racing.  The 54-year-old’s lawyers filed the appeal yesterday,
Daniel Amelung, Gribkowsky’s lawyer, said today by phone.
Lawyers are also examining options to allow him to be released
during the appeal on bail after spending the last 1 1/2 years in
custody, Amelung said.  Gribkowsky, on trial for accepting bribes, breach of trust
and  tax evasion , told a Munich court last month that the
indictment against him was “in most parts” correct. In
exchange for his confession, the judges informally agreed
Gribkowsky would get a prison term ranging from seven years and
ten months to nine years.  The Federal Court of Justice, in the German city of
Karlsruhe, probably won’t reach a verdict until next year,
Amelung said. German news agency Dapd reported the appeal
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
