Free-agent guard  Jason Terry , a
former National Basketball Association Sixth Man of the Year,
has verbally agreed to a contract with the Boston Celtics,
according to ESPN.  Terry, 34, agreed to a three-year deal worth $5 million
annually,  ESPN reported  today citing unidentified people
familiar with the negotiations. The  Dallas Mavericks , for whom
Terry has played the past eight seasons, have an opportunity to
match the offer.  Terry averaged 15.1 points and 3.6 assists per game last
season. He ranks fourth on the NBA’s all-time list of 3-pointers
made with 1,788, and in 2009 was named Sixth Man of the Year,
awarded annually to the league’s best non-starter.  No contracts can be formally finished or announced until
July 11. Once Terry signs, the Mavericks have three days to
match the offer or allow him to leave. The Celtics also remain
interested in keeping free-agent  Ray Allen , who holds the NBA
record with 2,718 3-pointers made, ESPN said.  -- Editor: Bob Bensch.  To contact the reporters on this story:
