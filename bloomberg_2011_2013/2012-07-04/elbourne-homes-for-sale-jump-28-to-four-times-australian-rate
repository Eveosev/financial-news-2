Homes for sale in  Melbourne  surged 28
percent in June from a year ago, more than four times the
increase across the country’s eight state capitals, even as
prices slid 6.6 percent from a year earlier.  Dwellings offered for sale in Melbourne, the capital of
Victoria state, climbed to 55,293, Sydney-based  SQM Research Pty. 
said in an e-mailed statement. Properties listed for sale in the
nation’s capital cities climbed 6.4 percent in June from a year
earlier, the statement showed.  “The Melbourne result is a real concern as the supply of
listings has reached a new high in that city,” SQM Managing
Director Louis Christopher said in the release.  Home prices  in Melbourne had the biggest decline among
major Australian cities, which saw an average drop of 3.6
percent in June from a year ago, according to figures from
Brisbane-based researcher RP Data. The drop comes despite a 9.7
percent jump in the city’s population in 2011 from 2006,
compared with an Australia-wide increase of 2.5 percent,
according to  Census data .  Melbourne  home prices  are expected to drop about A$10,000
($10,200) to an average of A$560,000 by the end of 2012, Paul Braddick, head of property research at  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , said in a report in April.  Prices ‘Vulnerable’  “Melbourne home prices appear vulnerable given a softening
Victorian economy, rising rental vacancies and a healthy supply
pipeline,” Braddick said in the report. “Construction in
Victoria has continued to outperform other states.”  Home listings climbed 6.1 percent in Melbourne from May,
compared with a 1.7 percent increase nationally. The city had a
rental vacancy rate of 3.1 percent in May, the highest among
major Australian cities and an increase from 2.4 percent a year
earlier, SQM said in a release last month.  Rents in Melbourne surged 50 percent and mortgage payments
climbed 35 percent in the five years to 2011, according to the
census.  Permits granted to build or renovate homes soared 27.3
percent in May from the prior month after the central bank cut
 interest rates , a government report this week showed. The number
of homes approved in Victoria climbed 31.8 percent from April,
the biggest increase among all states, Australian Bureau of
Statistics figures showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
