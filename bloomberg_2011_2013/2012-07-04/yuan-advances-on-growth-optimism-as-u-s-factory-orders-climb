The yuan strengthened after data
showed U.S. factory orders rose for the first time in three
months, easing concern that global growth is losing traction.  Orders placed  with factories in the world’s largest economy
rose 0.7 percent in May, following a revised 0.7 percent drop in
April, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The People’s Bank
of China raised the yuan’s  reference rate  by 0.09 percent to
6.3121 per dollar. The  European Central Bank  will cut its
benchmark  interest rate  tomorrow, according to 51 of 62
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  “Investors are expecting better data from the U.S. and
China, with global central banks on track with easing
measures,” said Tommy Ong, the Hong Kong-based senior vice-
president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd.
“A brighter global growth outlook is favorable for the Chinese
currency. The  yuan  could resume appreciation later this year.”  The yuan gained 0.07 percent to close at 6.3477 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the daily  reference rate . One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, decreased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 1.63 percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.08
percent to 6.3469 per dollar. The offshore rate has strengthened
0.21 percent this week after China’s Ministry of Finance
auctioned 17.5 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) of Dim Sum bonds and
started selling 5.5 billion yuan of two-year notes to
individuals in  Hong Kong  last week. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards rose 0.08 percent to 6.4008, a 0.8 percent discount to
the onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
