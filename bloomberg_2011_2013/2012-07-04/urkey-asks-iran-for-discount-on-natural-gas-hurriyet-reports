Turkey has requested a discount on
gas it imports from Iran,  Hurriyet newspaper  said, citing Energy
Minister  Taner Yildiz .  Turkey imports 16 percent to 20 percent of its natural gas
from Iran, which is its most expensive source of imported gas,

is unacceptable, so Turkey has requested a discount, he was
