Deron Williams agreed to return to
the Brooklyn Nets, ESPN reported, giving the team an All-Star
point guard ahead of its move to a new arena and possible
pursuit of Orlando Magic center  Dwight Howard .  Williams, 28, agreed to a five-year contract worth $98
million, the broadcaster said. The 6-foot-3, 210-pound guard has
finished in the  National Basketball Association ’s top five
assist leaders in each of the past six seasons.  Williams indicated his decision to stay with Brooklyn on
his Twitter account. A post that said “Made a very difficult
decision today” included a photo of the Nets logo.  Brooklyn two days ago agreed on a trade with the Atlanta
Hawks for All-Star guard  Joe Johnson . Brooklyn also has been
linked with a move for Howard, a six-time All-Star and three-
time Defensive Player of the Year who led the Magic to the NBA
Finals in 2009. Howard has expressed interest in playing with
the Nets, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The Nets haven’t
made the playoffs since 2007.  The Nets declined to confirm the deal since players can’t
be signed until July 11, said team spokesman Gary Sussman in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
