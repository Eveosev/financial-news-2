British American Tobacco Kenya Ltd. (BATK) ,
the country’s biggest cigarette manufacturer, rallied to a
record on speculation that first-half earnings will increase.  The  shares  jumped 1.6 percent to 380 shillings by 10:45
a.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the highest since at least 1997
and boosting gains this year to 55 percent.  BAT Kenya plans to increase capital expenditure 9.1 percent
this year to boost production, Finance Director Philip Lopokoiyit said Feb. 27. Full-year profit surged 75 percent to
3.09 billion shillings ($37 million) as sales climbed 49
percent, the company said Feb. 23.  “We should expect half-year earnings soon and generally it
will be a strong performance, an improvement from last year,”
Kuria Kamau, research analyst at Nairobi-based Old Mutual
Securities Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  Semi-processed tobacco will “continue to generate strong
revenue growth” on “impressive export revenue,” Old Mutual
said yesterday in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
