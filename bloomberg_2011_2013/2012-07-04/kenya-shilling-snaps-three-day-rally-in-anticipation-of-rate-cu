Kenya ’s shilling snapped a three day
rally as businesses sought to accumulate dollars at favorable
levels on anticipation of a rate cut tomorrow, taking advantage
of the currency’s gain since May 30.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy weakened less
than 0.1 percent to 83.97 per dollar by 2:03 p.m. in Nairobi.
The shilling has strengthened 3.2 percent since May 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There has been decent dollar demand from businesses
taking advantage of the recent gains as they seek to accumulate
in anticipation a rate cut may increase pressure on the
shillings,” Jeremiah Kendagor, the head of trading at Nairobi-
based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said by phone today.  The monetary policy committee, which raised the benchmark
 interest rate  to a record 18 percent last year to rein in
inflation and support the shilling, meets tomorrow, according to
the bank’s  website . Eight out of twelve economists in a
Bloomberg survey expect a rate cut ranging from a half
percentage point to one percentage point.  Inflation slowed to a 15-month low in June, declining for
the seventh straight month to 10.1 percent from 12.2 percent in
May, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed
statement June 29. It is down from a peak of nearly 20 percent
in November.  Kenya accepted 6.5 billion shillings ($77 million) in
 repurchase agreements  maturing in seven days at a weighted
average rate of 16.362 percent, a central bank official, who
asked not to be named in line with policy, said. The bank also
accepted 1.3 billion shillings in 28-day deposits at 16.392
percent, using its open market operations to reduce the total
 money supply .  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a third day, the longest
losing streak since June 7, depreciating 0.3 percent to 1,584
per dollar.  Uganda ’s shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 2,472.50
per dollar, reversing an earlier decline of as much as 0.7
percent, the most since May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
