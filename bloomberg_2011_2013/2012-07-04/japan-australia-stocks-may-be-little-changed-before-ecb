Japanese and Australian stocks may
open little changed after service-industry reports in Germany
and the U.K. missed estimates amid speculation the  European
Central Bank  and the Bank of England will ease monetary policy.  Shares of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker that
gets 31 percent of its revenue in Europe, may be active in
Tokyo.  Inpex Corp. (1662) , Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, may be active
after oil slid from the highest price in a month. Aquarius
Platinum Ltd., the fourth-largest producer of the metal, may be
active in Sydney after saying output will decline as it
conserves cash amid falling prices.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  weren’t traded
in Chicago yesterday with U.S. equity markets closed for a
holiday. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed today in
Wellington. Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were
little changed today as investors await a U.S. jobs report
tomorrow.  “The market is likely to be in a gridlock,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , Tokyo-based executive officer at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co., which oversees about 40 billion yen
($501 million). “You want to wait and see how the ECB meeting
and the U.S. jobs data will come out. It’s not easy to buy or
sell.”  A U.K.  gauge of services activity  based on a survey of
purchasing managers fell to 51.3 in June from 53.3 in May,
Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply said. The median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg
survey called for a reading of 52.9. A measure above 50
indicates expansion. A German services Purchasing Managers Index
dropped to 49.9 last month from 51.8 in May, according to a
separate report from Markit.  Interest Rates  ECB officials are expected to lower their benchmark rate by
a quarter point to a record-low 0.75 percent today, according to

according to another Bloomberg news survey.  U.S. employers increased payrolls by 90,000 workers in June
after a 69,000 gain in May, according to the median forecast of
59 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of Labor
Department figures due tomorrow.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 4.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 9.3 percent advance by the
S&P 500 and a 5.2 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for August delivery dropped 61 cents, or 0.7
