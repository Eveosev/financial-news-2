More than 100,000 Chinese-born
orphans and children with physical disabilities have been
adopted by overseas parents in the past 30 years, the Xinhua
News Agency reported today.  Overseas adoption is an important channel through which to
find homes for orphaned and disabled children, Minister of Civil
Affairs Li Liguo said at a ceremony held for 130 U.S. families
and 200 adopted children who came back to  China  to “seek their
roots,” according to Xinhua.  The students will visit the cities of Beijing, Xi’an,
Chengdu and Guilin with their parents during a 10-day visit
financed by China’s government in an effort to encourage more
adopted children to return to China, said Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
