Spain  in the first quarter registered
its first negative savings rate since the series began in 2000,
the National Statistics Institute said.  The rate declined 3.3 percentage points from a year earlier
to minus 0.6 percent of disposable income, Madrid-based INE said
on its website.  The rate was a positive 10.8 percent over the last four
quarters, compared with 11.5 percent in the same period a year
earlier, INE said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
