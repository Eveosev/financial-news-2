European  retail sales  unexpectedly
increased in May as gains from  France  to Ireland and  Portugal 
helped offset decreasing demand in  Germany .  Sales advanced 0.6 from April, when they slipped 1.4
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast sales to remain unchanged,
the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.
From a year earlier,  sales  fell 1.7 percent.  Europe’s economy probably failed to grow in the second
quarter as budget cuts eroded  consumer spending  just as
companies stepped up job cuts and global demand faltered. Euro-
area  unemployment  jumped to a record high in May, economic
confidence slumped to the lowest in more than 2 1/12 years last
month and services industries contracted in June.  In France, the euro area’s second-largest economy after
Germany, retail sales rose 1.2 percent in May from the previous
month, when they dropped 2.1 percent, today’s report showed. In
Spain and Ireland, sales advanced 1.2 percent and 1.7 percent in
the month, respectively. Portugal reported a gain of 2.9
percent. German retail sales fell 0.3 percent from April.  The statistics office didn’t report data for Greece and
Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
