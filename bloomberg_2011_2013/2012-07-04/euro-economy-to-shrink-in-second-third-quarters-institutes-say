The euro-area economy will contract
in the second and third quarters of this year, three economic
research institutes predicted.  The economy of the 17-nation currency area shrank 0.2
percent in the second quarter and will contract 0.1 percent in
the third before posting 0.1 percent growth in the final three
months of the year, the Ifo, Insee and Istat institutes said
today in an e-mailed statement. The European Commission
forecasts the economy will contract 0.3 percent overall this
year.  “Unfavorable labor-market conditions and impacts of fiscal
consolidation will continue to dampen household disposable
income,” the institutes said. At the same time, “global demand
is projected to improve moderately and net exports will be the
main driving force of the mild recovery over the forecast
horizon.”  The institutes said inflation is expected to slow to 2
percent by September, reflecting diminishing pressures from
global commodity prices and weak internal demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
