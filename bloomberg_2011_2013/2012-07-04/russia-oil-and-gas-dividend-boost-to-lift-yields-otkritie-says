The 2012  dividend yield  on Russian
oil and gas companies will rise as OAO Gazprom, OAO Transneft
and OAO Rosneft increase their payouts, Otkritie Capital said.  The energy industry’s average dividend yield will climb 190
basis points from 6.3 percent now, Otkritie analysts wrote in an
e-mailed research note today. Crude rose to a one-month high
yesterday, touching as much as $88.04 a barrel. MSCI Inc.’s
 Russia  Energy Index slumped 18 percent last quarter.  “A combination of strong  oil prices  and lackluster share
price performance means that the Russian oil and gas sector
currently trades at an attractive average 2012 dividend yield,”
analysts led by Alexander Burgansky wrote. “This could
potentially grow to 8.2 percent as a result of possible
favorable policy changes at Gazprom, Rosneft and Transneft.”  Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas export monopoly, and
Transneft, Russia’s oil-pipeline operator, may start calculating
dividends based on international reporting standards, boosting
their dividend yields to 9 percent and 22 percent, respectively,
Otkritie said. Rosneft’s plan to distribute additional 2011
dividends will lift the stock’s 2012 dividend yield to 7
percent, according to Otkritie.  Gazprom and Transneft trade at a dividend yield of 5.68
percent and 1.49 percent, respectively, Bloomberg data show.
Rosneft’s yield is 1.6 percent. The MSCI  Russia Energy Index (MXRU0EN) 
currently has a 4.41 percent dividend yield.  Gazprom fell 0.7 percent to 157.97 rubles, the biggest
intraday drop since June 28, by 12:33 p.m. in Moscow. Rosneft
declined 0.9 percent to 209.53 rubles and Transneft preferred
shares retreated 1.2 percent to 47,699 rubles. The Micex Index
fell as much as 0.8 percent before trading little changed at
1,436.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
