Peru ’s central bank cut the reserve
requirement for trade finance as it seeks to avert a reduction
in the availability of credit to exporters.  The central bank cut the reserve ratio for trade finance in
dollars to 20 percent from 65 percent, it said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Outstanding loans for foreign trade operations contracted
14 percent to 8.58 billion soles ($3.2 billion) in May from a
year ago, after declining 11 percent in April, the central bank
said June 22. Growth in trade finance slowed to 3.8 percent last
year from 41 percent in 2010 as the global economy cooled,
according to the central bank’s website. The segment accounted
for 9 percent of total lending to companies last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
