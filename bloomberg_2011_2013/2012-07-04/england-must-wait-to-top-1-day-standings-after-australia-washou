Today’s third one-day cricket
international between  England  and Australia at Edgbaston in
Birmingham was abandoned because of rain, ending the host’s
chance of topping the 50-over rankings.  England, which leads the series 2-0, needed a 5-0 sweep to
replace Australia atop the International Cricket Council one-day
standings. It’s already No. 1 in elite five-day Tests and
Twenty20 internationals, and could have been the first country
to hold the top spot in all three formats at the same time.  Today’s match was abandoned at about 6:15 p.m. local time
after several inspections during the day. No play was possible.  The next match is on July 7 at Durham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
