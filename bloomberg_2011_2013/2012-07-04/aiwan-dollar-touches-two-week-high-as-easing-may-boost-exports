Taiwan’s dollar rose to the strongest
level in almost two weeks on speculation developed economies
will ease monetary policy, improving the island’s export outlook.
 Government bonds  declined.  The European Central Bank will cut its benchmark interest
rate tomorrow, according to 50 of 62 forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey. Taiwan’s  overseas sales  rose in June for the first time
since February, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before official data due July 9. The  Taiex
index (TWSE)  of shares reached the highest level in almost two months.  “Stocks have been at a relatively high level, supporting
risk-taking,” said George Pu, a bond trader at Sinopac
Securities Corp. in Taipei. “Yields may have a little room to
go up in the short run.”  The  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.1 percent to NT$29.866 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.760, the strongest level since June 21. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, dropped 10 basis points to 3.8 percent.  Further monetary-policy easing may be needed by the  Federal
Reserve  if the U.S. economy deteriorates, International Monetary
Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said yesterday.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
1.232 percent, compared with 1.227 percent yesterday, according
to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending
rate  was little changed at 0.507 percent, according to a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
