China will ban officials from
consuming shark fin at government expense within three years,
part of an ongoing effort to reduce corruption ahead of this
year’s once in a decade leadership transition.  The ban, reported by the state-run  CNTV  on its website,
comes after Premier  Wen Jiabao  in March called for an end to
using public funds to purchase cigarettes and “high-end”
alcohol. The latest move puts restrictions on a delicacy that
conservationists blame for reducing the global shark population.  Chinese officials spent 408.5 billion  yuan  ($64 billion) on
vehicle-related expenditures, 200 billion yuan on meals, and
another 300 billion yuan on going abroad in 2004,  China Central
Television  said on its  website , citing the central Communist
Party newspaper Study Times. The 200 billion yuan on meals is
enough to build another Three Gorges Dam, it said.  A widening wealth gap and the ouster of Politburo member Bo Xilai in an alleged graft and murder scandal has fueled public
outrage over official malfeasance. Wen in March said the regime
risks its existence unless it addresses corruption.  Shark populations around the world are in rapid decline
because of the demand for fins in  Asia , according to the World
Wildlife Fund, which  estimates  that more than 73 million sharks
are killed each year, primarily for their fins.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
