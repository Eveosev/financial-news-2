Iran  charged two Azeri nationals with
espionage after detaining them in May, Iranian state-run Press
TV said.  Azerbaijan ’s National Security Ministry allegedly sent
Farid Huseynov and Sahriyar Hacizada to northwestern Iran to
recruit dissidents and promote separatism,  Press TV  said on its
website, citing an unidentified Iranian official. The agents
also allegedly obtained confidential information and images of
“strategic locations and facilities,” the TV channel said.  Azerbaijan filed several protests with Iran last month,
demanding the whereabouts of the men and the reason for their
detention. Both Huseynov and Hacizada are known as poets in
Azerbaijan.  Relations between the two nations have deteriorated since
the National Security Ministry in February and March said it had
foiled attempts by Iran-backed groups to carry out terrorist
attacks against Israeli and Western targets. Iran responded by
accusing Azerbaijan of working with  Israel ’s Mossad intelligence
agency in operations against Iran.  A newspaper editor and human rights activist arrested last
month has been charged with spying for Iran, the Azeri
Prosecutor’s Office and  Interior Ministry  said today in a joint
statement. Hilal Mammadov, a member of the ethnic Talysh
minority that speaks a language close to Farsi, was arrested on
drug charges on June 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
