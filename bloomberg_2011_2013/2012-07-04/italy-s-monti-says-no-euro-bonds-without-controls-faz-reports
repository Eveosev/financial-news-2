Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said his country isn’t demanding the introduction of common euro
bonds without an increase in European budget control,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  “We need a partial mutualization of debt, but also more
central control of national budgets,” Monti is quoted by the
newspaper as saying. “Without proper control it would be
irresponsible to burden others with a share of your own debt.”  Monti added that Italy “isn’t calling for a rescue and
isn’t calling for euro bonds,” FAZ reported. “Italy is doing
everything necessary for an increase in growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
