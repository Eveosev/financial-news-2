Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  and
 Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. (1326) , units of  Formosa Plastics
Group , posted unexpected second-quarter losses after a drop in
oil and chemical prices drove down their inventory values.  Formosa Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil
refiner, reported a pretax loss of NT$15.6 billion ($523
million) for the three months ended June 30, the parent company
said in a statement today. The average of eight analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was a profit of NT$2.32 billion.
Formosa Chemicals posted a pretax loss of NT$6.14 billion,
compared with a profit of NT$4.8 billion that analysts expected.  A decline in  oil prices  cut the value of stockpiles held by
Formosa Petrochemical, which imports all its crude needs. Crude
oil in  New York  dropped 18 percent between April and June on
concern demand would be hurt by the global economic slowdown and
Europe’s debt crisis.  “A big reason for Formosa’s worse earnings was losses from
inventories,” said Danny Ho, a Taipei-based analyst at Yuanta
Securities Investment Consulting Co., who has a hold rating on
Formosa Petrochemical. “Earnings probably bottomed in the
second quarter as the company won’t have stockpile losses in the
third quarter.”  Plastics processor  Nan Ya (1303)  Plastics Corp. reported a loss of
NT$2.72 billion. The average of seven analyst estimates was a
pretax profit of NT$4.09 billion.  Polyvinyl chloride maker  Formosa Plastics Corp. (1301)  posted a
pretax profit of NT$270 million in the second quarter, less than
the NT$5.55 billion average of three analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Formosa Petrochemical halted its No. 2 and No. 3 naphtha
crackers on June 20 because of a  power failure . The incident
affected 42 of the group’s 66 plants at Mailiao, Formosa
Chemicals President Hong Fu-yuan said June 21.  Formosa Petrochemical plans to start the No. 3 naphtha
cracker on July 6, Tsao Mihn, president of the company, said in
a briefing in Taipei today. The No. 2 cracker resumed production
June 29, he said.  To contact the reporter on the story:
