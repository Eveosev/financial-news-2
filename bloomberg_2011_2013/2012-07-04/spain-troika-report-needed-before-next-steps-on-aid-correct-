(Corrects second paragraph to clarify the meeting is in
scheduled for July.)  Euro-area governments deciding on aid
to  Spain ’s banks need the report of the so-called troika group
of officials before taking the next steps, German Finance
Ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus said.  There is no indication yet that euro-area finance ministers
will be able to make a decision on the Spanish bailout at their
next meeting on July 9 and 10, Kotthaus told reporters in Berlin
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
