Joey Chestnut ate 68 hot dogs in 10
minutes, tying his own record, to win the Nathan’s Famous Hot
Dog Eating Contest in Coney Island,  Brooklyn , for the sixth
consecutive time.  Chestnut, 28, won $10,000 and the bejeweled mustard-yellow
belt. Nicknamed “Jaws”, the California native averaged 6.8
dogs per minute, and finished his 67th and 68th dogs as time
expired.  For the second year in a row, men and women competed
separately. The top female finisher was defending champion Sonya
Thomas with 45 hot dogs consumed.  “I feel good, it was a great win,” Chestnut said in a
televised interview after the victory. “I wanted to give them a
new record. I’m looking forward to next year already.”  The contest, first held in 1972, is hosted annually on July
4 at  Nathan’s Famous Corp. (NATH) ’s original restaurant in Coney Island
in the Brooklyn borough of  New York  City. Competitors must eat
as many hot dogs, including buns, as they can in the allotted
time.  Chestnut has held the event record since eating 68 in 2009.  Tim Janus was second today with 52 hot dogs, followed by
Patrick Bertoletti with 51.  Nathan’s donates 100,000 hot dogs to the  Food Bank for New
York City  each year to coincide with the event. A crowd of
40,000 was expected for the event, according to organizers.  -- Editors: Peter-Joseph Hegarty, Bob Bensch  To contact the reporters on this story:
