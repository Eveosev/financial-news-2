South Korea ’s won rose to its
strongest level in two months as U.S. data beat estimates,
easing concern the global economy is faltering. Government bonds
advanced.  Asian stocks rallied after factory orders rose for the
first time in three months in the world’s biggest economy. The
 European Central Bank  will cut its benchmark  interest rate  by at
least a quarter of a percentage point at its July 5 meeting,
according to 51 of 62 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. The  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  rose for a second day as overseas investors bought more of
the nation’s shares than they sold for a third day.  “Investors were selling the dollar as stocks gained
following positive data out of U.S.,” said Lee Jin Ill, a
currency trader for Hana Bank in  Seoul . “South Korea’s
importers were buying the greenback as the won strengthened to
near 1,130, which limited the currency’s gains.”  The won strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,135.70 per dollar at
the close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,132.79 earlier, the strongest since May 4. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, advanced 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, to 7.31 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 slid one basis point to 3.39 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. Three-year debt futures rose 0.04 to 104.79 and the
one-year interest-rate swap was little changed at 3.35 percent.  “Demand for bonds was strong as the  finance ministry 
bought back 1.5 trillion won of government bonds today, so
investors were buying bonds to fill their holdings,” said Huh
Kwan, a Seoul-based bond trader at Korea Investment & Securities
Co. ’’Overseas investors were buying ten-year bond futures, so
it seems they are betting for a curve-flattener.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
