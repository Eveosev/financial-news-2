French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said today that natural gas prices won’t rise faster
than the rate of inflation.  “It is out of the question to increase natural gas prices
more than inflation,” Ayrault said in an interview on the
television channel TF1. “There may be some technical and legal
issues, but I don’t want more money to be taken away from the
purchasing power of middle- and working-class people,” he said.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA,  France ’s biggest natural gas distributor,
requested last month that the national energy regulator
increase regulated consumer tariffs by about 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
