Five Turkish banks had their foreign
currency debt raised to investment grade at Moody’s Investors
Service.  The ratings for  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) ,  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) ,
 Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS,  Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi (VAKBN)  AS and  Yapi &
Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK)  were raised two levels to Baa2, Moody’s said in
an e-mailed statement today from Frankfurt.  The upgrade of Turkey’s sovereign rating to Ba1, one level
below investment grade, on June 20 “had credit-positive effects
on ratings of various banks,” Moody’s analysts Arif Bekiroglu
and Carola Schuler said in the statement.  Yields on $500 million of 2016 bonds issued by Turkiye Is
Bankasi AS, the country’s biggest bank by assets, dropped two
basis points to 4.56 percent at 12:35 p.m. in Istanbul. Yields
on state-run Vakifbank’s $500 million of 2017 bonds fell two
basis points to 5.17 percent.  Finansbank AS, the Turkish unit of National Bank of Greece
SA, and the Export Credit Bank of  Turkey  were rated Ba1, one
level below investment grade, Moody’s said.  Moody’s increased the long-term foreign currency deposit
ratings of 14 Turkish banks by one level to Ba2, according to
the statement. It also lowered the so-called stand alone credit
assessment on 11 Turkish banks to Ba1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
