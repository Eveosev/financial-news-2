The commander of United Nations
observers in Syria said that the government of President Bashar al-Assad has renewed its commitment to  Kofi Annan ’s cease-fire
plan.  Major-General Robert Mood, a Norwegian, told reporters in
Damascus that the mission will resume its operations, suspended
more than two weeks ago, immediately after conditions allow
monitors to do their work.  “We are reviewing this on a daily basis,” Mood said,
according to an e-mailed video sent by his office.  Mood suspended the mission’s activities on June 16 after
increasing violence made it impossible for the observers to
monitor the cessation of violence and support implementation of
Annan’s plan. The UN has 291 unarmed military observers and 89
civilian monitors in Syria.  Mood said he met Deputy Foreign Minister Fayssal Mekdad
today and “received from the government a very clear commitment
on the six-point plan.”  “The urgency of stopping the violence is maybe the most
important issue for everyone involved,” Mood said. “There is
this feeling that it’s too much talk in nice hotels, in nice
meetings and too little action to move forward and stop the
violence.”  Syria ’s government is fighting a growing insurrection in
which more than 10,000 people have died, according to UN
estimates. At least 18 people were killed today, the Local
Coordination Committees in Syria said in an e-mail. Authorities
have portrayed the unrest as a conspiracy and the protesters as
radical Islamists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
