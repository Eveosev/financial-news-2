The euro remained lower against most
of its 16 major peers before German data forecast to show
factory orders dropped, adding to signs  Europe ’s debt crisis
curbed demand from the region.  The  European Central Bank  will probably reduce borrowing
costs at a policy meeting today to stimulate the euro-area’s
flagging economy, according to a Bloomberg News poll. The pound
maintained a three-day slide on speculation the  Bank of England 
will extend its so-called quantitative easing program today.  “The euro is under pressure and will stay under
pressure,” said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford
Capital, a currency risk management company. “Germany is a huge
market and if that market does slow down, it can only undermine
global growth and confidence going forward.”  The euro traded at 100.11 yen as of 9:22 a.m. in  Tokyo 
after falling 0.5 percent to 100.07 yesterday. It was little
changed at $1.2528 following a 0.6 percent decline. The  dollar 
bought 79.91 yen from 79.88. The pound was at $1.5591 after
retreating 0.8 percent in the past three days to $1.5589.  U.S. financial markets were shut yesterday for the
Independence Day holiday.  Factory orders  in  Germany , the euro zone’s biggest economy,
probably declined 6 percent in May from a year ago, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before
today’s figure. They fell 3.8 percent in April.  Spain’s Debt  Spain  is scheduled to auction 3-, 4- and 10-year bonds
today. The nation’s benchmark 10-year  yield  jumped 16 basis
points yesterday, the most since June 26, to 6.41 percent. That
compared with a euro-era high of 7.29 percent reached June 18.  The country last month sought  loans  of as much as 100
billion euros ($125 billion) from the European Financial
Stability Facility to recapitalize its banks battered by the
collapse of the property boom in 2008.  “The Spanish auction will be taken up internally from the
banks,” said Rochford’s Mumford. “It’s not a sustainable
situation. It’s just taking up more debt financed by insolvent
banks.”  The ECB is likely to cut its  main refinancing rate  by a
quarter-percentage point from a record low of 1 percent, a
separate Bloomberg poll of economists shows.  Options traders have cut bearish bets on the euro. The one-
month risk-reversal rate showed a 0.94 percentage point premium
yesterday in favor of euro puts relative to calls, the least
since April 3. The decline in the premium signals a relative
decrease in the demand for options that profit if the euro falls
against the dollar. Calls grant the right to buy the currency.  Reports from Markit Economics showed this week that U.K.
manufacturing and construction shrank in June with growth of
services activity slowing, adding to the case for the BOE to
increase stimulus. The central bank will probably raise its
target for bond purchases by 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) to
375 billion pounds, according to 30 of 41 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
