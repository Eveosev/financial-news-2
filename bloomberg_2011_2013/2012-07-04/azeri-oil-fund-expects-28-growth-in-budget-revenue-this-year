The State Oil Fund of  Azerbaijan ,
known as  Sofaz , expects a 28 percent increase in budget revenue
this year after crude prices exceeded government forecasts.  Projected 2012 revenue was boosted to $13.7 billion from
$10.7 billion by a presidential decree, Sofaz said today in an
e-mailed statement. It didn’t specify its oil price forecasts.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 45.6 million
metric tons of oil and 25.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas
last year. Sofaz had assets of $32.4 billion as of April 1,
according to a report on the fund’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
