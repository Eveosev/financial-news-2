Phoenix Coyotes  forward Brett MacLean
was hospitalized following “a cardiac emergency” on the ice in
Owen Sound, Ontario, the National Hockey League team said.  MacLean, 23, received cardiopulmonary resuscitation before
being taken by ambulance to the hospital in Owen Sound on July 2.
He was then flown to Knight University Hospital’s cardiac
intensive care unit in London, Ontario.  “Our thoughts and prayers are with Brett and his family,”
Phoenix general manager Don Maloney said on the team’s website.
“We request that everyone please respect their privacy at this
time.”  Fabrice Muamba of English Premier League soccer club Bolton
Wanderers was hospitalized for a month after his heart stopped
for more than an hour during an F.A. Cup quarterfinal on March
17. Piermario Morosini, a 25-year-old midfielder on loan at the
Italian soccer club Livorno from Udinese, died April 14 after
suffering a cardiac arrest during a match against Pescara.  The 32nd pick in the 2007 draft, MacLean has two goals and
three assists in 18 career NHL games with Phoenix and the
Winnipeg Jets.  MacLean played most of last season with the Portland
Pirates, the Coyotes’ American Hockey League affiliate, where
the  London  native had 25 goals and 23 assists in 63 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
