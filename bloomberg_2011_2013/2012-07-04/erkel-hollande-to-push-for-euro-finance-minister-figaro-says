German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
doesn’t support naming a euro-area finance minister, said
Steffen Seibert, her chief spokesman, denying a report in  Le
Figaro  that Germany and  France  are discussing creating the post.  The French newspaper’s report is “freely fabricated” and
doesn’t reflect German policy, Seibert said in a text message
today when asked about the article.  Le Figaro, citing French and German officials it didn’t
identify, said the leaders of the euro area’s two largest
economies will address the new position at a meeting on July 8
in Reims, eastern France. A future finance minister would head
meetings of euro-region counterparts, replacing Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who will stay in that position
until year-end, the newspaper reported today.  The “Super Mr. Euro,” as the officials called it,
according to Le Figaro, would also sit at the Group of 20
meetings and have a level of responsibility similar to the
European Central Bank president, Le Figaro reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
