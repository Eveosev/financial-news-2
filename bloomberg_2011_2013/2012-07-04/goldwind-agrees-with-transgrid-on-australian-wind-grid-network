Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co.,  China â€™s second-biggest maker of wind turbines,
entered into an agreement with TransGrid for its 182.5-megawatt
Gullen Range Wind Farm to the Australia grid.  The wind farm in New South Wales Southern Tablelands, which
contains 73 sets of 2.5-megawatt turbines from Goldwind, will be
connected to the Australian grid, the Chinese company said in an
e-mailed statement. Construction of the project is expected to
begin in October, with completion scheduled for late 2013.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
