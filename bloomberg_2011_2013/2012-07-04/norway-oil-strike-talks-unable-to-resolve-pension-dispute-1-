A strike by oil workers in Norway,
 Europe ’s second-largest oil and natural-gas producer, goes into
an 11th day tomorrow after mediation failed to resolve a dispute
over pensions.  “It was clear there was no basis to continue the talks,”
the  SAFE labor union , one of three representing striking oil
platform workers, said in a statement on its website. “The
strike continues.”  The dispute, the first industrywide strike by energy
workers since 2004, began June 24 and is disrupting as much as
250,000 barrels of crude production a day, according to  Statoil
ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest energy company. The Nordic nation produced
1.63 million barrels of oil a day in May, according to the
latest data from the  Norwegian Petroleum Directorate .  “After a four-hour-long meeting, the conflict is now even
more entrenched than before,” the  Norwegian Oil Industry
Association , which represents employers, said in a statement.
“Unreasonable demands for early retirement mean that we cannot
agree.”  The industrial action, which involves about 710 people, has
led to the closing of fields including Statoil’s Veslefrikk,
Brage, Oseberg South and Oseberg East. The dispute is costing
 Norway  about 15 percent of its crude production and 7 percent of
its gas output daily, the industry group said June 27.  Workers from the industry’s three main unions, Industry
Energy, SAFE and Lederne, are protesting plans to increase the
age at which they receive a company pension beyond the current
62 years, according to Leif Sande, president of Industry Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
