Ukraine farmers reaped more than 3
million metric tons of grains to date and are expected to
harvest between 46 million and 47 million tons this year, Prime
Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  “There will be enough grain to meet domestic needs, to
guarantee stable prices for bread and export grains without any
restrictions,” Azarov said today at a weekly government meeting
in the capital Kiev.  Ukraine had a record harvest of 56.7 million tons last year
due to favorable weather conditions and it exported 22.5 million
tons in the marketing year that ended July 1, according to the
country’s Agrarian Confederation.  Farmers in Ukraine harvested 39.3 million tons two years
ago, which prompted the government to impose export quotas from
July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 to avoid domestic shortages.  To contact the reporters on this story:
