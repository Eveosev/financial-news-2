People fleeing war in  Sudan  are
facing “critical” levels of disease and malnourishment and the
 United Nations  is short of funds to help them, UN High
Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said today.  The UN said 217,000 people have fled fighting between the
government and rebels in Sudan’s  Blue Nile  and Southern Kordofan
states. Ethiopia is hosting 36,000, while the rest are in South
Sudan where heavy rains have flooded camps and blocked movement.  “We are contending with a situation in which many newly
arriving refugees are already dangerously malnourished, the
threat from water-borne disease is high, large refugee
populations are in locations that are clearly dangerous, and
flooded roads block access and the possibility of relocating
people elsewhere,” Guterres said in an e-mailed statement.  The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said it has received $45.9
million of the $219 million it needs this year to respond to the
crisis. The agency said it is particularly worried about an
outbreak of disease in Yida camp in  South Sudan ’s Unity state,
which houses 59,000 people and is receiving as many as 1,000 new
arrivals a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
