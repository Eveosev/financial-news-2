Ireland’s chances of returning to the
 bond market  before its aid program runs out at the end of next
year improved after European leaders agreed to let bailout funds
recapitalize banks directly,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “There is a better chance for Ireland now to return to the
market,” Gergely Kiss, a director in Fitch’s Sovereign Rating
Group in  London , said in a phone interview today. “What we saw
at the end of last week isn’t a panacea, but it is an
encouraging sign.”  The planned sale of 500 million euros ($626 million) in
three-month securities by Ireland’s debt agency tomorrow will be
a “very important indicator” of  market sentiment , Kiss said.
He added that last week’s European Union summit may also have
positive secondary effects for Ireland in terms of funding.  “This could kick in a virtuous cycle for Ireland where you
have more market confidence which is reflected in lower yields,
more robust refinancing costs, and that makes the whole debt
burden more bearable for Ireland,” he said. Fitch said in a
statement last week that sharing bank recapitalization costs
“could materially enhance the sovereign credit profile” of
Ireland, together with Spain and Cyprus.  Fitch has a BBB+ rating with a negative outlook on Ireland.
The ratings company doesn’t see “any further capital pressure
for the financial sector” in Ireland after last year’s bank
stress tests.  To contact the reporters on this story:
