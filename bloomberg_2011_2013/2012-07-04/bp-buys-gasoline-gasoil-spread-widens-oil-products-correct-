seller. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a shipment of jet fuel for
delivery to  France .  Naphtha fell as Gunvor Group Ltd. and Shell sold. Greenergy
International Ltd. bought a gasoline cargo for U.K. delivery.  Light Products  Trafigura Beheer BV and Vitol bought cargoes of naphtha,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Platts pricing window. The shipments changed hands at $790 and
$793 a metric ton, down from $809 yesterday.  Naphtha’s crack, or discount to Brent, widened to $11.49 a
barrel as of 2:29 p.m. local time from $10.79 yesterday,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in
London.  Morgan Stanley sold the 10,000-ton cargo of gasoline for
delivery to the Tees, U.K., the survey showed. The trade was
carried out at $988 a ton. That compares with a deal to  Italy  on
July 2 at $918 a ton.  Gasoline barges for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp hub traded from $975 to $984 a metric ton, according to
a survey of both the Platts window and the Argus Bulletin Board.
That compares with deals from $954 to $960 yesterday.  BP Plc (BP/)  bought the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
to make finished fuel, for a third day. Gunvor sold for a second
day on the barge market, where trades are typically for lots of

at $11.62 a barrel, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Vitol sold cargoes of diesel to Mercuria Energy Trading SA,

the survey of Platts showed. The trades to France were at $3.50

$26 premium to gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Those compare with a June 27 trade to  Le Havre  at a
$1.50 premium to benchmark prices.  Eni SpA bought a 30,000-ton shipment from Repsol YPF SA for

to Le Havre, France, the survey showed. It was partly priced at
parity to benchmark prices and at a premium of $56 to July
gasoil. That compares with a June 27 deal at $2 more than the
benchmark and $58 more than gasoil futures.  Morgan Stanley bought two barges of the  aviation fuel  from
BP at $59 more than July gasoil, little changed from earlier
trades, according to the survey.  Barges of heating oil traded at a $3 discount to gasoil

between the two contracts to $6.25, the most since May 10.  Gasoil’s  crack  rose to $17.25 a barrel from $16.94
yesterday.  Brent crude  dropped 0.9 percent to $99.77 a barrel.  Refineries  Statoil ASA will cut 70 jobs by the end of the year from
