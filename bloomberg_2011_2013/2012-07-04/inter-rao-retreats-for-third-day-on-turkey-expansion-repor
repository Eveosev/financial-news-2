OAO Inter RAO UES (IRAO)  fell for a third
day after Kommersant reported Russia’s state-controlled power
generator and exporter may acquire Turkish energy assets.  Inter RAO dropped 0.6 percent to 2.77 kopeks by the close
in Moscow, the most since June 22.  The utility set up the Inter Rao  Turkey  Enerji Holding unit
to research the Turkish market,  Kommersant  reported. The
business may acquire local energy assets, the newspaper said.  “Foreign expansion is one of the risks that we see for
Inter RAO’s investment case,” VTB Capital analysts led by
Mikhail Rasstrigin said in an e-mailed research note. “While
the impact from potential acquisitions in Turkey would depend on
the parameters of the deals, at this stage the news increases
the general risk profile of Inter RAO and therefore might be
negative.”  The company said on June 25 it will put its plans to expand
overseas on hold while domestic regulation is being changed and
utilities’ market values decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
