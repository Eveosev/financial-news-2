Germany â€™s states plan to abolish a
rule that grants certain tax privileges to domestic
corporations,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing a document
prepared for a meeting of state leaders in the upper house of
parliament on July 6.  The changes would force German corporations to pay tax on
dividends and  capital gains  in shareholdings of less than 10
percent, the newspaper cited the document as saying.  The upper house, the Bundesrat, is responding to a European
Court of Justice ruling establishing that German legislation
discriminates against foreign corporations, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
