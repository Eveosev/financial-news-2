Mexico ’s peso bond yields fell to a
record low on speculation global policy makers will coordinate
efforts to bolster economic growth, supporting higher-yielding
assets.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.39
percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bonds’ price increased 0.38 centavo to 141.74
centavos per peso. The peso was little changed at 13.3337 per
U.S. dollar.  Demand for emerging-market debt picked up as speculation
mounted the European Central Bank will cut  interest rates  to a
record low tomorrow to spur economic growth. A gauge of German
services fell to 49.9 in June, less than the earlier reading of
50.3, according to London-based Markit Economics, with a figure
below 50 indicating contraction. Other reports showed euro-area
services and manufacturing output declined for a fifth month.  “You can assume that investors are anticipating more
liquidity,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
in Mexico City, said by telephone from Mexico City. The bonds
“are responding to that, above all on the long end” of the
yield curve, he said.  U.S. markets were closed today for the Fourth of July
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
