Oasmia Pharmaceutical AB (OASM) , a Swedish
maker of veterinary drugs, rose the most in over three years in
Stockholm after the company said it had received Minor Use
designation in the U.S. for its Doxophos Dog cancer treatment.  The designation, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Center for Veterinary Medicine, is for lymphoma, a cancer where
white blood cells are turned into tumors, the Uppsala-Sweden
based company said in a statement today.  The stock rose as much as  26 percent to 9.35 kronor  and was
trading up 4.1 percent to 7.7 kronor at 1:35 p.m. in the Swedish
capital, valuing the company at 464 million kronor ($67
million.)  The classification allows for a seven-year market
exclusivity when registered and eligibility for conditional
market authorization, Oasmia said. The company would face no
generic competition for the approved use of the drug for that
time, it said. Oasmia will be eligible to request conditional
approval to sell the drug before collecting all necessary
efficacy data, but after proving the treatment is safe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
