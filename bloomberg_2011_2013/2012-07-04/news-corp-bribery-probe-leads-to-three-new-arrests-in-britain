News Corp. (NWSA) ’s tabloid bribery scandal
in Britain led to the arrests today of a prison officer and two
other people for alleged corruption,  London  police said. More
than three dozen people have been detained in the probe.  A 46-year-old male prison worker was arrested at his home
in London, a 50-year-old woman was detained in Kent and a 37-
year-old man was arrested at his home in Surrey, the
 Metropolitan Police Service  said in a statement today. All three
are in custody and weren’t identified.  The probe, known as Operation Elveden, is running parallel
to investigations into phone hacking and computer hacking by
reporters and editors at News Corp.’s now-defunct News of the
World tabloid and the Sun newspaper, Britain’s best-selling
daily title. The bribery arrests have focused on the Sun.  More than 50 people have been arrested in probes that are
underway as New York-based News Corp. plans to split the company
into separate entertainment and publishing arms. Rebekah Brooks,
the former chief executive officer of News Corp.’s U.K. unit,
was charged in May with perverting the course of justice in the
phone-hacking case. She denies the claims.  Daisy Dunlop , a spokeswoman for News Corp.’s U.K. unit,
couldn’t be immediately reached to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
