The Istanbul-based patriarch of the
Greek Orthodox church is seeking a sponsor to fund restoration
of an abandoned orphanage after  Greece ’s economic crisis
precluded support from the Greek government,  Aksam  reported.  The 19th-century building on the island of Buyukada outside
Istanbul is one of the largest wooden buildings in the world and
the patriarchate has been planning to convert it into a
religious studies and interfaith dialogue center, according to
the newspaper. The cost would be about $50 million, it said.  The patriarchate won the deed to the building in a case
against Turkey at the  European Court  of  Human Rights  that
concluded in 2010, Aksam said.  The economic crisis in Greece has precluded support from
the country’s government and officials from the patriarchate
confirmed to Aksam that they were in search of sponsors, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
