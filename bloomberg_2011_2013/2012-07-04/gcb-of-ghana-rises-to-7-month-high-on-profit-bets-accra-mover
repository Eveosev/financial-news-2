Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) , the West
African nation’s lender with the most branches, rose to the
highest in more than seven months on speculation that first-half
profit increased.  The stock gained 1.5 percent to 2 cedis as of 1:49 p.m. in
the capital, Accra, the highest since Nov. 17.  Net income increased 18 percent in the first quarter to
23.4 million cedis ($12.1 million), the lender known as GCB said
on May 30. Net interest income in the three months through March
rose to 58.4 million cedis from 54.3 million cedis a year
earlier. The bank had curbed lending in 2011 to ease impairment
charges, resulting in a 64 percent drop in profit to 18 million
cedis.  “We think the bank’s after tax profit grew 20 percent in
the first half from a year earlier,” Xorlali Torsu, a stock
trader at Accra-based Databank Financial Services Ltd., said by
phone today. “Looking at their first-quarter results I don’t
expect them to do a lot of risky lending, however, I’d expect
fees and commission income as well as investments in government
treasury bills to support earnings significantly.”  This year’s first-half results are expected within the next
two weeks, Torsu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
