Electricity Supply Corp. of Malawi,
the southern African nationâ€™s sole supplier of power, will
increase power cuts as demand continues to grow during the
winter.  Consumers should use energy saving bulbs and curb the use
of electrical appliances to reduce the impact of load shedding,
Escom said in a statement published in the Daily Times today.  Malawi has power-generation capacity of 286.8 megawatts
compared with demand of 300 megawatts, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
