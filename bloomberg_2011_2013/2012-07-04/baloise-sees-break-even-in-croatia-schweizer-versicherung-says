Baloise Holding AG (BALN)  expects to break-
even in Croatia this year,  Schweizer Versicherung  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Martin Strobel.  “The outlook is very good,” Strobel told the Zurich-based
magazine.  Baloise, Switzerland’s third-biggest insurer, was forced to
cut the valuation of Osiguranje Zagreb in March, after acquiring
the Croatian company in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
