Banks in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, which includes the  United Arab Emirates ,
will continue to recover from the 2008 credit crisis as loan
loss provisions decline at most lenders,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Since 2008, “despite slower balance sheet growth, most GCC
banks have maintained healthy earnings generation before
provisioning,” the ratings agency said in a report released in
Dubai today. “Even though pockets of risk persist, asset
quality continues to improve” and banks do not need to
provision as much to cover loan losses, according to the report.  Non-performing assets of the 26 GCC banks S&P rates jumped
to $18.7 billion in December 2011 from $5.9 billion in 2007 due
to a decline in property prices and a fall in share prices in
the region, according to the report. The reported NPA to gross
loans ratio peaked in Saudi Arabia, Oman and  Kuwait  in 2009 and
in Qatar and Bahrain in 2010, according to the report.  Lending is likely to grow by 10 percent in  Saudi Arabia 
this year, by 4 percent to 5 percent in the U.A.E. and
decelerate in Qatar from last year’s 28 percent, Timucin Engin,
a credit analyst at S&P told reporters in Dubai today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
