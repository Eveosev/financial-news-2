Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  lost its
appeal of a $20.5 million arbitration award to creditors of
Bayou Group LLC whose hedge funds -- for which Goldman served as
broker -- turned out to be Ponzi schemes.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Manhattan today affirmed a
lower court’s decision not to vacate the 2010 award by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in favor of Bayou
Group’s unsecured creditors.  The creditors sued Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing LP in
2008 for its role as the prime broker and clearing broker for
Bayou’s hedge funds. They said the Goldman Sachs unit aided a
$400 million fraud at Stamford, Connecticut-based Bayou, which
filed for bankruptcy in May 2006. Bayou co-founder Samuel Israel
pleaded guilty to directing the scheme and is serving a 22-year
prison term.  In a November 2010 ruling, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
in Manhattan said New York-based Goldman Sachs failed to show
that the arbitration panel had “manifestly disregarded the
law” in granting the award.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the ruling.  The case is Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing v. the
Official Unsecured Creditors’ Committee of Bayou Group, 11-2446,
U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
