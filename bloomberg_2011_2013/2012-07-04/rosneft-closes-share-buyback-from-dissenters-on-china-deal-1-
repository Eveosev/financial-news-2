OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s state-run oil
producer, bought back about 3 percent of its shares from
investors who opposed changes to an oil supply deal with  China .  Rosneft purchased 322 million shares, according to a
regulatory filing from the Moscow-based company today. That is
the amount tendered by investors, according to a statement on
Rosneft’s website on May 31.  Shareholders agreed in April to give China a discount of
$1.50 a barrel under a deal signed in 2009 to supply 300,000
barrels of oil a day to Russia’s Asian neighbor for 20 years.
China agreed to grant Rosneft and OAO Transneft, the state-run
pipeline operator, $25 billion in loans, to help fund field
developments and construction of export links.  The 3 percent stake is valued at 68.3 billion rubles ($2.1
billion), based on a price of 212 rubles a share that Rosneft’s
board set May 30. Rosneft has no plans to cancel the shares, the
company said at the time. Rosneft shares fell 0.6 percent to
210.25 rubles by 4:04 p.m. in Moscow as  oil prices  declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
