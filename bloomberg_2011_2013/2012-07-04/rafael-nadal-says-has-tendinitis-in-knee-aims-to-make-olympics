Rafael Nadal , the 11-time Grand Slam
tennis champion, said heâ€™s suffering from tendinitis in one of
his knees and doctors have told him to rest for two weeks.  Nadal, who lost to world No. 100 Lukas Rosol in the second
round at Wimbledon last week, said in a statement he is aiming
to recover for the London Olympics. He cancelled a July 14
