Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  rose the most in five months after the company’s largest
shareholder, Time Warner Inc., raised its stake to 49.9 percent.  The Bermuda-based operator of television channels in
central and eastern  Europe , known as CME, gained 9 percent to
109.85 koruna in Prague, the steepest rally since Feb. 3.  CME issued about 875,000 Class A shares to Time Warner for
$90.8 million, exercising a  put option  under an agreement dated
April 30, the company said in a statement late yesterday. The
funds will be used to repay a part of its debt, CME said. Time
Warner previously provided a $300 million loan to CME.  Time Warner obtained the additional shares for a price 50
percent higher than the current market price, J&T Banka AS said
in a research note dated today.  “Taking into account another stake increase by the major
shareholder and the purchase of shares high above the market
price, we consider the news strongly positive,” J&T Banka said.
“We expect a positive market reaction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
