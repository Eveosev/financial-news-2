Palm-oil  inventories in  Malaysia , the
second-biggest supplier, were probably little changed in June
from a 13-month low as production advanced, potentially easing
concern that global cooking-oil supplies would decline.  Stockpiles were at 1.77 million metric tons, compared with
1.76 million in May, the lowest level since April 2011, the
median in a Bloomberg survey of three plantation companies and
three analysts showed. Production gained 8.7 percent to 1.5
million tons, the highest in seven months, from 1.38 million
tons in May. That’s 14 percent lower than 1.75 million tons in
June 2011. Exports rose 5 percent to 1.47 million tons. The
Malaysian Palm Oil Board will release the data on July 10.  Higher supplies may curb an 11 percent rally in palm-oil
prices from an eight-month low in June. That may help lower
global food prices and costs for users such as  Nestle SA (NESN) , the
largest food company, while potentially reducing profits at
producers including  Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  Prices gained as soybeans,
crushed to make soybean oil, rallied after a drought parched
crops in the U.S., the top grower. Similar conditions cut
harvests in Brazil and  Argentina  that rank second and third.  “The increase in production is expected, but overall, the
year-on-year decline would keep people on their toes,” Ivy Ng,
an analyst with  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) , said by phone in Kuala
Lumpur. Inventories are little changed “because our exports are
not as strong as some people were expecting” them to be before
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, she said. Slower growth in
 China , the world’s biggest cooking-oil user, and the debt crisis
in  Europe  has raised concern that demand may decline, she said.  Ramadan Shipments  Shipments typically rise before Ramadan when consumption of
staples climbs as followers break daylong fasts with communal
meals. Ramadan starts in the third week of July this year.
Exports from Malaysia gained 4.9 percent to 1.45 million tons
last month, surveyor Intertek said June 30. Sales were 1.4
million tons in May, according to Malaysian Palm Oil Board data.  Palm oil for September delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent
to 3,150 ringgit ($996) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, before trading at 3,139 ringgit at 5:06 p.m. Futures
reached 2,838 ringgit on June 14, the lowest level since October
2011. Soybeans for November surged 2.6 percent on July 3 to
settle at $14.7475 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
taking this year’s gain for the most-active contract to 22
percent.  Soybean oil ’s  premium  over palm advanced to $213.38 a ton
on June 29, the highest level since October and compared with
this year’s low of $56.04 in March, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. December-delivery soybean oil climbed 1.6 percent
to settle at 53.88 cents per pound in Chicago on July 3.  Global Supplies  Global oilseed output may jump 8.4 percent to 471.9 million
tons in the year that will begin Sept. 1 as South American
soybean harvests recover from the previous year’s drought,
researcher Oil World said June 26. Reserves may drop to 54.7
million tons on Aug. 31, before rising the following year to
61.7 million tons, it said. The dry weather in the U.S. may hurt
developing soybeans, especially if it persists until August,
when plants enter the pod-setting and filling stages, it said.  Demand in  India , the biggest importer of palm oil, as well
as in China and the  Middle East  may pick up in the third quarter
as stockpiles are drawn down,  Abah Ofon , an analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc, wrote in a report June 26, citing palm oil as
among his top picks for that quarter.  Shipments from  Indonesia , the world’s largest palm-oil
producer, probably gained 9.5 percent to 1.5 million tons in
June from 1.37 million tons in May, a Bloomberg survey published
last week showed. Output and stockpiles were little changed at
2.1 million tons and 1.85 million tons, respectively, it showed.  First Half  Malaysia’s production for the first six months was 8.7
percent lower at 7.84 million tons from 8.59 million tons in the
same 2011 period, the survey showed. Output dropped 17 percent
in April from a year ago and plunged 21 percent in May, data
from the board shows.  Malaysia’s output may decline as much as 900,000 tons from
January to July from a year earlier,  Dorab Mistry , director at
Godrej International Ltd., said June 7. A rebound is unlikely
before August at the earliest, he said. Production may recover
in the second half, to reach 19 million tons this year as
harvesting peaks in the coming months, Choo Yuen May, director-
general of the nation’s palm oil board, said June 7. Output was
a record 18.9 million tons in 2011, according to the board.  “Global crude palm oil production reached its peak in the
second quarter of 2011 and is not expected to repeat that
similar feat this year,” Willy Gunawan and Agus Pramono,
analysts at PT Indo Premier Securities, wrote in a report dated
July 3. “The unusually high palm oil production in Malaysia
would have exhausted the oil-palm trees in 2011.” Indonesia’s
yields are expected to be little changed this year, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
