Scientists seeking to explain the
origins of matter  discovered  a particle that may support a
decades-old theory of physics, bringing people closer to
understanding unseen parts of the universe.  The observed particle is the heaviest boson ever found,
said Joe Incandela, spokesman for one of the experiments at
CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, at a
seminar yesterday at its Geneva headquarters. Scientists stopped
short of claiming they have found the elusive  Higgs boson , a
theoretical particle that could explain where mass comes from.  “As a layman, I think I would say ‘we have it,’” said
Rolf-Dieter Heuer, director of CERN, at a press conference in
Geneva. It will take at least three to four years of research to
fully understand the properties of the observed particle, Heuer
said.  The announcement brings humankind closer to answering a
millennia-old question that the ancient Greeks wrestled with:
what is matter made of? The particle is a key to the  Standard
Model , a theory explaining how the universe is built, and its
existence would help scientists gain a better understanding of
how galaxies hold together. It also could open a door to
exploring other parts of physics such as superparticles or dark
matter that telescopes can’t detect.  ‘Sings and Dances’  The new boson “sings and dances like” the theoretical
particle, said Pauline Gagnon, a researcher on the Atlas set of
experiments in Geneva, in an interview in  Melbourne , where she
was attending the bi-annual  International Conference on High
Energy Physics . “There is no doubt it comes from a different
signal, different channels, with different experiments. We just
need in the next few months with more data to ascertain exactly
what are the properties of this particle to see if it is exactly
the Standard Model Higgs boson or some variation of it."  Particle physics is the study of the elemental building
blocks that make up matter. These particles, with names such as
quark, fermion, lepton and boson, can’t be subdivided. They
exist and interact within several unseen ‘‘fields’’ that
permeate the universe.  The field that generates mass for objects is named for U.K.
physicist Peter Higgs, who in the 1960s was one of the first
scientists to outline a working theory on how elemental
particles achieve mass. Higgs was one of four of the theorists
attending yesterday’s meeting in Geneva. He wiped a tear from
his eye as the findings were presented.  Champagne for Higgs  ‘‘For me, it’s really an incredible thing that it’s
happened in my lifetime,” Higgs said in Geneva. In a statement,
he said he would be “asking my family to put some champagne in
the fridge.”  Higgs wrote that some particles -- such as photons, the
basic unit of light -- don’t interact with the Higgs field, and
thus don’t achieve mass. Most others do.  To put it another way, if the Higgs field were a Hollywood
party, a photon would be the unknown actor who hurries through
without gaining a bit of interest from others in the room. Other
particles would be more like  Angelina Jolie , drawing crowds of
hangers-on as they move through the party.  It gets increasingly harder to stop such a cluster from
moving forward and more difficult to get it moving again once
it’s stopped, meeting one definition of mass.  Scientists are trying to prove the existence of the Higgs
field by displaying a physical effect for the Higgs boson, a
particle that lives for less than a trillionth of a second and
is an excitation, or force, within the Higgs field.  Digging Deeper  Providing indirect evidence that the Higgs field exists
will allow scientists to dig even deeper into the secrets of our
existence, said Mark Wise, a professor of physics at  California
Institute of Technology .  “In some sense, this is the beginning,” Wise said of
finding the boson. “Because we want to know all its
properties.”  The data presented yesterday are the latest from the $10.5
billion Large Hadron Collider, a 27-kilometer (17-mile)
circumference particle accelerator buried on the border of
France and  Switzerland . CERN has 10,000 scientists working on
the project, in which billions of subatomic particles are hurled
at each other at velocities approaching the speed of light.  The collider will provide more data later this year, giving
scientists a more complete picture of the observed new particle.
Researchers will try to determine whether it is a Higgs boson,
the particle predicted by the Standard Model.  Like Columbus  “Very few physicists would privately argue that this is
not a Higgs particle,” said Themis Bowcock, head of particle
physics at the  University of Liverpool , in a statement. “For
physicists, this is the equivalent of Columbus discovering
America.”  A more exotic version of the Higgs particle could help
scientists understand the 96 percent of the universe that
remains obscure, since observable matter only represents 4
percent of the total, CERN said.  To declare the boson is discovered, physicists use the
statistical standard of “five sigma,” meaning that there
should only be a 1 in 3.4 million chance that a sighting would
be due to chance. The observations of the new particle have a
five-sigma level of significance, Incandela said.  “The implications are very significant and it is precisely
for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our
studies and cross-checks,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
