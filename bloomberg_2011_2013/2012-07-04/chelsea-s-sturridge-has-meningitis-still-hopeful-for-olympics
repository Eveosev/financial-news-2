Chelsea striker  Daniel Sturridge  is
in the hospital with viral meningitis but remains hopeful he can
play for Britain in the London Olympics.  Sturridge, 22, fell ill over the weekend and was taken to
St. Mary’s Hospital in London, according to Blues manager
Roberto Di Matteo.  “I spoke to him and he feels better,” Di Matteo said on
the club’s  website . “We are going to follow his situation and
hopefully he gets well as soon as possible and will be able to
join the Olympic team.”  Sturridge, who scored 11 goals for the Blues last season,
was included in manager  Stuart Pearce ’s 18-man Olympic squad two
days ago.  “Thankfully I am starting to feel a lot better and I am
optimistic about being able to make the Olympics,” Sturridge
said on Chelsea’s website.  Britain plays it first Olympic match July 26 against
Senegal at Old Trafford in Manchester.  To contact the reporter on this story:
