Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS) ,  South Africa ’s
largest food company, said it reached agreement in principle to
buy a 63.4 percent stake in  Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU)  of Nigeria
from Dangote Industries Ltd.  The food producers have submitted the proposed deal to
Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission for approval,
according to a joint statement to JSE Ltd., the operator of
South Africa’s bourse, where Tiger Brands is listed.  Tiger, based in Johannesburg, will release full details
after receiving the go-ahead from the SEC, the companies said.  Dangote Flour Mills is listed on the Nigerian Stock
Exchange, with 73.4 percent of the stock held by Dangote
Industries Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Dangote Industries is closely held by Nigerian billionaire  Aliko Dangote , who is also president of the West African nation’s
Lagos-based bourse.  Tiger Brands wants to expand into Africa to increase
revenue from its operations outside South Africa to 30 percent
of total sales over the next five to 10 years as the home market
slows, Chief Executive Officer Peter Matlare said on May 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
