Peru’s sol dropped for the first time
in four days on concern the  European debt crisis  is slowing
global growth, curbing demand for emerging-market assets.  The sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.6455 per dollar at the close,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The central bank
didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot market  today.  Germany’s government bonds rose on demand for a refuge as a
survey of purchasing managers showed the nation’s services
industries unexpectedly shrank last month. Another report
indicated growth of services in the U.K. was the slowest in
eight months.  The reports may have prompted some “profit taking after
three days of gains in the sol,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head
trader at Banco Santander in Lima.  The yield on the 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond due in
August 2020 increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 4.99 percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
bond’s price fell 0.11 centimo to 118.71 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
