Spain  plans to raise as much as 30
billion euros ($37.7 billion) from the privatization of state
assets,  Europa Press  reported, citing unidentified government
officials.  Assets to be sold include Aena Desarrollo Internacional SA,
Renfe Operadora SC and the hotel chain Paradores de Turismo de
Espana SC, Europa Press said. Revenue from the sales will be
used to reduce debt, not deficit, the news service said.  The plan will probably be approved before August, Europa
Press reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
