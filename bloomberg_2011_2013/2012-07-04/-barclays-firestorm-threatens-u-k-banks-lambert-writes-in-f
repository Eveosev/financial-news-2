A lengthy public inquiry into the
behavior of U.K. banks in the wake of the “Barclays firestorm”
would pose substantial risk “in this period of systemic
fragility,”  Richard Lambert  wrote in the Financial Times.  The banking system is under threat from the crisis in the
euro region, from questions over part of the banks’ loan
portfolios, especially in commercial real estate, wrote Lambert,
the chancellor of the University of Warwick and a former
director-general of the  Confederation of British Industry .  If controls have to be tighter following the Libor scandal,
“so be it: that is the argument for a short, sharp inquiry,”
wrote Lambert, who was a member of the Bank of England Monetary
Policy Committee from 2003 to 2009.  Returning to “square one” would be “a serious mistake,”
Lambert wrote, adding that “the economy cannot recover in the
absence of a stable banking system: nothing can be more urgent
than that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
