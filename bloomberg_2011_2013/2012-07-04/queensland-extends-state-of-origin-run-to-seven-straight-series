Cooper Cronk’s late field goal gave
Queensland a 21-20 win over New South Wales and a record-
extending seventh straight State of Origin rugby league series
victory.  Cronk connected from 40 meters (44 yards) in the 75th
minute last night at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium. The kick
followed a converted try from New South Wales’s Josh Morris five
minutes earlier that tied the score 20-20.  “I can’t put it into words,” Cronk said in a televised
interview. “This is why you play football.”  The Maroons have won 15 of the 21 matches since starting
their unprecedented run of success in 2006 and hold a 17-12 lead
in  Australia ’s annual interstate series. New South Wales forced
the deciding game with a 16-12 victory in Sydney last month
after Queensland’s 18-10 win in the Melbourne opener.  “I’m just so happy for Queensland,” Maroons prop Petero
Civoniceva, who’ll retire at season’s end after 33 Origin games,
said in a televised interview. “There’s a lot of spirit in this
team and it was on show tonight.”  Johnathan Thurston scored a try and kicked eight points for
Queensland, which was without injured Australia full-back Billy Slater for the final game. Darius Boyd and Justin Hodges also
touched down for the Maroons.  Brett Morris and Brett Stewart also touched down for the
Blues and Todd Carney booted eight points.  “It’s very disappointing to get so close,” Carney said in
a televised interview. “We worked so hard as a group and it’s
just so shattering.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
