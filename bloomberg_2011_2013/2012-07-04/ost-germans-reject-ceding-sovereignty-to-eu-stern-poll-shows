Almost six out of ten Germans reject
ceding budgetary sovereignty to European Union institutions and
almost three quarters don’t want the EU to transform into a
U.S.-style United States of  Europe ,  Stern  magazine said, citing
a poll it commissioned.  A directly elected EU president was rejected by 63 percent
of Germans while 59 percent said the Bundestag, the lower house
of parliament, should keep its budgetary rights and 74 percent
said the EU shouldn’t become a federal state, Stern said in an
e-mailed statement.  Seventy-three percent of Germans reject joint euro-region
government bond sales and 69 percent said more transfers of
power to European institutions require prior referendums, Stern
said.  Research company Forsa surveyed 1,004 people on June 27-28,
Stern said. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
