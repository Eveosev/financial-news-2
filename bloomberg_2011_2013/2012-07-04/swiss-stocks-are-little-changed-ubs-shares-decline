Swiss stocks  were little changed
after the Swiss Market Index reached the highest level in more
than two months yesterday, while investors awaited tomorrow’s
central-bank policy meetings.  The  SMI (SMI)  slipped 0.1 percent to 6,190.97 at 3:53 p.m. in
Zurich. The gauge has  rallied 4.4 percent this year  as the
 European Central Bank  disbursed 1 trillion euros ($1.26
trillion) to financial companies and the region’s leaders opened
the door to directly recapitalizing lenders using the European
Stability Mechanism. The Swiss Performance Index added less than
0.1 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
