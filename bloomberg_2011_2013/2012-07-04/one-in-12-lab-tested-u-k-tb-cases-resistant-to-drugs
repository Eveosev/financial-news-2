Drug resistance occurred in 8.4
percent of tuberculosis cases, or one in 12, that were confirmed
in laboratory tests in the U.K. last year, according to
 statistics  released today by the  Health Protection Agency .  The number of TB cases that didn’t respond to one of the
four main antibiotics used to treat the infection jumped 26
percent to 431 in 2011 from 342 in 2010, the London-based agency
said. Total cases of TB rose 6.6 percent to 8,963 in 2011 from
8,410 in 2010, according to HPA. Of these, 5,127 TB cases were
confirmed in tests on laboratory cultures.  “The increase in drug-resistant cases remains a concern
and a challenge to our efforts to control TB in the U.K.,”
 Ibrahim Abubakar , head of TB surveillance at the HPA, said in an
e-mailed statement. “Failing to complete treatment is one of
the key causes of drug resistance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
