Artur Mas, president of the Spanish
region of Catalan, said the area’s planned third round of budget
cuts worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) is necessary to
avoid “total collapse.”  Speaking to the region’s lawmakers, the leader of the
region that contributes the most to  Spain ’s economy, said
Catalonia is paying 2 billion euros more a year in interest
compared with two years ago, according to an e-mailed statement
released by his office today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
