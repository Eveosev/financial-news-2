Czech retail sales declined for a
third month in May, confirming fading consumer demand that
pushed the central bank to cut  interest rates  to a record low
last week.  Retail sales  eased 2.1 percent from a year ago, compared
with a 4.1 percent decline in April, the Prague-based Czech
Statistics Office said in a statement on its website today. The
reading was better than the median forecast of a 3.5 percent
drop in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.  The central bank cut the benchmark interest rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 0.5 percent last week as
government measures to cut the  budget deficit  curtail domestic
demand and will further depress household spending next year.  The economy, where exports account for about 80 percent of
output, shrank 0.8 percent in the first quarter from the
previous three months, after a 0.2 percent contraction in the
final quarter last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
