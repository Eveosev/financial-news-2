Slovenia won’t become the sixth euro
region nation to seek financial assistance, Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  said in an interview with a local radio station.  “Such a danger was eliminated when we adopted and enacted
the legislation to balance public finances,” Jansa told
Maribor, Slovenia-based Radio City. “The only unknown is the
banks, but even with banks, I don’t see a reason for Slovenia to
plead for help.”  Due diligence at Slovenian lenders has yet to be completed,
Jansa said. He cited a decision by European Union leaders at a
summit last month that enables aid to banks without burdening
the government “if the situation demanded it,” he said,
according to the Slovenian radio station.  Economists from London to Warsaw have said Slovenia is on
course to follow Greece, Ireland,  Portugal ,  Spain  and Cyprus in
seeking a bailout for its ailing banking industry. The
government in May adopted austerity measures worth about 800
million euros ($1 billion) to cut the  budget deficit , which
advanced to 6.4 percent of total output at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
