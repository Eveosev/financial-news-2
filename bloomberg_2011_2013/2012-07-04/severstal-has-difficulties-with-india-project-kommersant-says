Russian steelmaker OAO Severstal has
“serious difficulties” in implementing a joint venture with
India’s  NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) , billionaire owner and Chief Executive Officer
 Alexey Mordashov  told Kommersant.  Severstal wants to take control of the venture, while the
Indian side opposes this, Mordashov told  Kommersant , and
property rights and access to water have yet to be determined,
he said. The steel mill in Karnataka will have a capacity of 2
million to 5 million metric tons a year.  Severstal has no plans to cut planned 2012 capital spending
of about $1.67 billion in response to a recent price decline in
the steel market, Mordashov said in the interview. The company
expects steel consumption in  China  to grow in line with gross
domestic product, while the debt crisis in Europe threatens the
global market, he was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
