Skokie officials approved an almost 5
percent water rate increase, increasing the average water bill
for residents of the Illinois town by $1.73 a month, the  Chicago
Tribune  reported.  The rate increase that was unanimously approved by town
officials reflects in part a rise in the cost of Lake Michigan
water that Skokie buys from nearby Evanston, the newspaper said.
The rate hike is due to begin with Augustâ€™s water bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
