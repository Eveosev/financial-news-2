The koruna depreciated after data
showed that Czech retail sales declined for a third month in May
and services and manufacturing output shrank in June for a fifth
month in the euro area.  The Czech currency retreated 0.2 percent to 25.529 per euro
by 12:14 p.m. in Prague. The governmentâ€™s 10-year  bonds  gained,
cutting yields six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
2.974 percent, according to generic prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  Retail sales eased 2.1 percent from a year ago, compared
with a 4.1 percent decline in April, the Prague-based Czech
Statistics Office said in a statement on its website today. A
composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
17-nation euro area rose to 46.4, London-based Markit Economics
said today. A reading below the 50 level indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
