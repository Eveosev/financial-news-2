A tropical depression with 35 mile
(55 kilometers) per hour winds formed today in the Pacific south
of the Mexican resort of Manzanillo, the National Hurricane
Center said. The system 450 miles off shore may intensify into a
tropical storm later in the day as it moves west-northwest at 15
mph though itâ€™s no threat to land, the Miami-based forecaster
said in an 8 a.m. Pacific time advisory. Models show the storm
may be a hurricane within three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
