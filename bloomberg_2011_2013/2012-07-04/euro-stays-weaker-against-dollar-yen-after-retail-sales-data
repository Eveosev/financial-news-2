The euro stayed weaker against the
dollar and the yen after a report showed European retail sales
unexpectedly increased in May.  The 17-nation shared currency was 0.2 percent lower at
$1.2586 as of 10:03 a.m. London time. It also declined 0.2
percent to 100.44 yen.  Sales advanced 0.6 from April, when they slipped 1.4
percent, the European Unionâ€™s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast sales to remain unchanged,
the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.
From a year earlier, sales fell 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
