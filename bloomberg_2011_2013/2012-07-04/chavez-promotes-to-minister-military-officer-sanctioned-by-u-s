Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
named a former military intelligence officer sanctioned by the
U.S. for helping traffic drugs as a deputy interior minister,
the second such appointment this year.  Hugo Carvajal, who in 2008 had his U.S. assets frozen after
the U.S. Treasury Department said he assisted narcotics
trafficking by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia , will
become head of the interior ministry’s criminal investigation
system. Carvajal was director of Venezuela’s Military
Intelligence Directorate until December 2011.  In January, Chavez named General Henry Rangel Silva as
defense minister. Rangel, who in a 2010 interview with Caracas-
based Ultimas Noticias said the armed forces are “married” to
Chavez’s revolution, is also accused by the Treasury Department
of aiding the FARC, as the Colombian rebel group is known, to
smuggle cocaine.  Chavez last month also promoted Carlos Alcala Cordones to
Commander General of the Army. Alcala Cordones is the brother of
General Cliver Alcala Cordones, who the Treasury Department in
2011 alleged provided training and weapons to the FARC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
