Scottish Premier League clubs voted
to reject the reformed Rangers soccer club’s application to stay
in the top division.  “At today’s General Meeting, SPL clubs today voted
overwhelmingly to reject the application from Rangers newco to
join the SPL,” the league said today in an e-mailed statement.  The 54-time Scottish soccer champion went into liquidation
last month after the U.K. tax authorities rejected a proposal to
repay creditors only a fraction of the club’s debts as part of a
plan to exit administration.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
