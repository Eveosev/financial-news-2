Sudan awarded nine contracts with 17
international companies that will invest $500 million to explore
for oil in the African nation, state-run SUNA news agency
reported.  Sudanese Oil Minister Awad Ahmed al-Jaz signed the
agreements with companies from Brazil, Australia, Canada,  Hong
Kong , France and Nigeria. The deal covers oil eight blocks
taking up more than 40% of the nation’s land area, the Khartoum-
based agency said late yesterday, citing al-Jaz.  The blocks are forecast to start production in six months
to five years, SUNA said.  The Sudanese economy has been suffering since  South Sudan 
assumed control of three-quarters of the former unified state’s
oil production of almost 490,000 barrels a day when it became
independent a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
