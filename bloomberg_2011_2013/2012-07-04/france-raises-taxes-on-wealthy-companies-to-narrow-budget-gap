France ’s two-week-old Socialist
government unveiled 7.2 billion euros ($9 billion) of tax
increases to meet deficit-reduction goals and avoid bond-market
punishment.  The 2012 measures, approved at a Cabinet meeting today,
presage even larger tax increases and spending cuts next year in
an economy that’s barely expanding.  The largest new levy will be a one-time surcharge on
wealthy individuals’ assets to raise 2.3 billion euros. Another
898 million euros will be reaped by ending a  payroll-tax 
holiday. Other steps include surcharges for oil and financial
companies, each raising an additional 550 million euros, and a
levy on dividends and stock options.  “We face an extremely difficult financial and economic
situation,” Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said at a press
conference today in Paris. “The wealthiest households, the big
companies, will be asked to contribute. In 2012 and 2013, the
effort will be particularly large.”  France’s national auditor said July 2 that the government
needs between 6 billion euros and 10 billion euros in savings
this year to meet its 2012 target of a deficit equal to 4.5
percent of economic output. For next year, it needs to find 33
billion euros in savings to achieve its aim of 3 percent.
President  Francois Hollande  has delayed the goal of a balanced
budget to 2017 from the 2016 target set by previous president
 Nicolas Sarkozy .  Reverses Sarkozy  France pays 2.55 percent to borrow for 10 years, compared
with 6.21 percent for  Spain  and 5.71 percent for  Italy . The
spread between French and German bond yields rose 5 basis point
to 106 basis points after the measures were unveiled. It’s still
down from more than 140 points in mid-May. The benchmark CAC 40
index was 0.7 percent lower at 3,247 as of 1:12 p.m. in Paris.  Today’s mid-year corrective budget reverses measures pushed
through by Sarkozy. Sarkozy had cut wealth taxes, saying it
would encourage wealthy French to stay home, and eliminated the
payroll tax on overtime hours to boost purchasing power and
circumvent the 35-hour work week.  Hollande has said the 2013 budget will restore the pre-
Sarkozy wealth tax rates on people with assets of more than 1.3
million euros. A one-time contribution is being imposed this
year ahead of an overhaul of the levy.  French companies with 250 million euros or more in revenue
will be asked to pay a portion of their corporate taxes early.
Companies will pay a 30 percent tax on  stock options , up from 14
percent. Executives receiving the options will be levied at 10
percent, from 8 percent now.  Spending Freeze  Another Sarkozy measure being rolled back is that French
residents abroad will be tested on their means before sending
their children for free to French state schools.  Among the measures that will be in the 2013 budget will be
a 75 percent tax rate for income of more than 1 million euros.  The government has signaled that spending cuts are also
coming. For its 2013-2015 budget, it plans to reduce the number
of civil-service jobs by 2.5 percent annually and reduce
operating costs -- including car fleets -- by 10 percent next
year, Le Figaro reported last month.  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has issued orders to all
ministries except education and justice to cut spending by 2.5
percent immediately.  Hollande cut salaries for himself and for ministers by a
third at his first cabinet meeting, fulfilling an election
promise. French ministers will now be paid 9,940 euros a month
instead of the 14,200 euros under the previous president.  Expanding Economy  Moscovici said that that taxes as a percentage of economic
output will rise to 46.5 percent in 2016 and 2017 from 43.9
percent last year.  Government spending  will be 56.2 percent of
output this year, before declining every year to 53.4 percent in
2017. Government debt is estimated peak at 90.6 percent of the
economy next year, declining to 79.6 percent in 2017.  The government’s budget is counting on the economy
expanding 0.3 percent this year, 1.2 percent in 2013, and 2 to
2.5 percent annually from 2014 to 2017.  To contact the reporters on this story:
