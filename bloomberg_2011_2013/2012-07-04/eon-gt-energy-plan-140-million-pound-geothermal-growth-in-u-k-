GT Energy , an Irish geothermal power
developer, plans a 140 million-pound ($219 million) expansion
across Britain in partnership with EON AGâ€™s U.K. unit.  The companies will build five 7-megawatt plants to provide
heat to homes and businesses, Padraig Hanly, managing director
of Dublin-based GT Energy, said today by e-mail after signing a
memorandum of understanding with EON. The first, in northwest
 England , is scheduled to start operating in 2014.  The partners are tapping into growing demand for clean
energy as the government promotes heat and power generation that
curbs emissions while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The
U.K. last year opened an 860 million-pound Renewable Heat
Incentive program, subsidizing output from sources such as
geothermal and solar thermal generators and biomass boilers.  Britain has a target to get 15 percent of its energy and 12
percent of its heat from renewable sources by 2020. Heating and
hot water account for 47 percent of U.K. energy demand and 46
percent of carbon dioxide output, according to the government.
Geothermal projects can help cut emissions by using energy from
hot springs or underground steam fields to produce electricity.  GT Energy was unable to comment immediately on financing
for the planned facilities.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
