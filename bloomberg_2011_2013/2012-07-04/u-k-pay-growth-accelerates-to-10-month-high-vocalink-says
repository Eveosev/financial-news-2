Take-home pay growth at Britain’s
largest publicly traded companies reached a 10-month high in the
second quarter, VocaLink Ltd. said.  Incomes after tax and other deductions climbed 2.7 percent
from a year earlier, compared with 2.3 percent in the three
months through May, the group said in a statement in  London 
today. Wage growth at manufacturers accelerated to 4.5 percent
from 3.9 percent.  Pay growth for public workers slowed to 0.5 percent from
0.6 percent, leaving the gap with private workers at a record.  “This month’s data goes to show the growing disparity that
exists between private and public-sector wage growth,” said
VocaLink Chief Executive Officer David Yates. “What we are
witnessing now is the full impact of public-sector wage freezes
and private-sector stimulus.”  VocaLink, which processes 90 percent of British salaries
paid directly to bank accounts, uses salary-payment data from
more than 200 members of the FTSE 350 Index and more than 600
government-related organizations for the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
