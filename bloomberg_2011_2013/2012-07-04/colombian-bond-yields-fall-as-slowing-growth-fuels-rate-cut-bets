Colombia ’s peso bonds gained, pushing
benchmark yields to a record low, on speculation slowing growth
will ease inflation and lead the central bank to cut borrowing
costs this year.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
6.95 percent, according to the central bank. That is the lowest
level on a closing basis since the securities were first sold in
2009. The price rose 0.182 centavo to 124.343 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s central bank on June 29 held the overnight
lending rate for a fourth straight month at 5.25 percent as
growth cooled and prices for the country’s commodities exports
dropped. Government reports in June showed industrial output and
retail sales unexpectedly fell in April and the economy expanded
4.7 percent in the first quarter, its slowest pace since 2010.  “People have been cutting their inflation forecasts as the
economy decelerates,” said Cristian Duarte, an analyst at
Global Securities brokerage in Bogota. “The idea Banco de la
Republica will cut rates is taking force given the bad numbers
we’ve seen in the last few weeks.”  Annual inflation slowed to 3.32 percent in June from 3.44
percent in May, according to the median estimate of 22
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The national statistics agency
is slated to release figures tomorrow. The central bank targets
annual inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent.  The peso advanced for a fourth day, gaining 0.1 percent to
1,767.14 per dollar. It has rallied 9.7 percent this year, the
best performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
