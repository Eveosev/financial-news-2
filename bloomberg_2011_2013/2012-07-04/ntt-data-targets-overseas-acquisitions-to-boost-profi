NTT Data Corp. (9613) ,  Japan ’s second-
largest computer services provider, intends to buy more
companies abroad to help reach its target of averaging 10
percent annual profit growth over the next four years.  “There’s no doubt that acquisition is a very important
strategy,” President Toshio Iwamoto said July 2 in an
interview, without identifying any prospective purchases.
“Overseas will be important, as we can expand our coverage.”  Buying companies outside Japan is also part of the
company’s plan to boost sales by between 200 billion yen ($2.5
billion) and 300 billion yen over four years, Iwamoto said July
2 in  Tokyo . NTT Data, a unit of  Nippon Telegraph & Telephone
Corp. (9432) , has announced plans to  acquire  21 companies in the past
three years including Boston-based Keane International Inc. and
 Italy ’s Value Team SpA, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Tokyo-based computer services provider is also trying
to cut costs by automating more programming tasks, Iwamoto said.  The target to raise profit 10 percent a year is derived
from NTT Data’s goal to raise earnings per share to 20,000 yen
in the year ending March 2016 from 10,854 yen last fiscal year,
he said.  Earnings per share  have fallen 4.2 percent on average
over the past five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Earnings per share will probably rise about 25 percent to
13,547 yen in the year ending March 31, 2013, according to the
company’s own  forecast .  Itelligence AG (ILH) , majority owned by NTT Data, yesterday
announced the acquisition of London-based Blueprint Management
Systems Ltd. NTT Data won’t disclose the value of the
transaction, spokesman Takanori Iwauchi said by phone.  NTT Data fell 0.2 percent to 243,200 yen at the close in
Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
