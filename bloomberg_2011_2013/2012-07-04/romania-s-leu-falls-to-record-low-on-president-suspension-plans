Romania ’s leu declined to the lowest
level in more than two weeks after ruling coalition plans to
suspend the president deepened the country’s political turmoil.  Romania’s currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent and
traded 0.5 percent lower at 4.4765 per euro at 3:04 p.m. in
Bucharest, the fourth day of declines to the weakest intraday
level since June 18. The country’s central bank has a managed
floating policy for the leu, and set a record-low fixing rate of
4.4715 leu per euro today.  The ruling Social Liberal Union seeks to suspend President
Traian Basescu and will file documents needed to start the
required parliamentary procedures today, Liberal lawmaker Eugen
Nicolaescu told Realitatea television station, without
specifying the reasons behind the suspension attempt.  The leu’s sudden drop “could be because of the threatened
actions to remove President Basescu,”  Daniel Hewitt , a London-
based analyst at Barclays Plc said in e-mailed comments. “The
circumstances will keep pressure on the leu.”  The leu has fallen 3.3 percent this year, the second-worst
performance among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Romania’s Finance Minister Florin Georgescu declined to
comment on the factors pushing the leu lower, adding that he
doesn’t have the means needed to “quantify the impact of
political developments on economic parameters.”  “The government is strictly dealing with keeping the
country’s financial stability,” Georgescu said today at a press
conference in Bucharest after a government meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
