Hungary’s three-year government bond
yields fell for a second day as Bank of America Corp. said the
central bank may cut the European Union’s highest benchmark rate
by two percentage points by 2013.  The gains in the benchmark notes maturing in 2015 lowered
yields two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.502
percent. The forint was little changed at 284.94 per euro by
11:53 a.m. in Budapest.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank may reduce its 7 percent benchmark
rate by 50 basis points this year and another 150 basis points
in 2013 after lowering its economic growth projections, Mai Doan, a London-based economist at the bank, wrote in a research
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
