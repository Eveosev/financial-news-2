Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
largest bank, has a “low” chance of facing successful
litigation after it was fined for seeking to manipulate Libor
rates, said analysts at Espirito Santo Investment Bank.  “The probability of any litigation being successful
against Barclays appears to be quite low, meaning that ultimate
damages against the banks, and Barclays in particular might not
be very material,” wrote analysts led by Andrew Lim in a note
to clients today. The comments follow an analyst call yesterday
with Barclays Finance Director Chris Lucas.  Barclays was hit by a record 290 million-pound ($455
million) fine last week for rigging the London interbank offered
rate, a benchmark for more than $360 trillion of securities. It
led to the resignation of the top three executives at the bank
including Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond . Lucas said
yesterday “the burden of proof would be very high” for civil
litigants on the analyst call.  Lucas also said the London-based bank had not “suffered
any deposit flight as a result of recent events and that risk
spreads in the debt markets had not indicated any increased
distress for the bank,” Lim said. “In this respect the
Barclays franchise appears unaffected, which is a positive,”
Lim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
