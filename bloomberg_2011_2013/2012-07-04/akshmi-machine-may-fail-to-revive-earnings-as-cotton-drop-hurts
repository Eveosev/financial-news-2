Lakshmi Machine Works Ltd. (LMW) , an Indian
maker of equipment used to make textiles, may fail to bolster
its profit this year after a slide in cotton prices forced
customers to postpone purchases.  Profit in the year ending March 31 may be about 1.4 billion
rupees ($25.6 million), the same as last year, Finance Director
R. Rajendran said in a telephone interview yesterday from the
southern city of Coimbatore, where the company is based. Group
profit fell 9.4 percent last year from the previous period.  The slump in the price of cotton reduced the value of
stocks at Indian textile makers, leading to a slowdown in the
industry last year, according to the country’s Ministry of
Textiles. Cotton has fallen 38 percent in the past year on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York  on slowing demand in  China  and an
increase in global supplies.  “It will take some time for our customers to recoup their
losses of the past year, after which they will start placing new
orders,” Rajendran said.  Lakshmi Machine rose 3.6 percent to 1,690 rupees as of 2:14
p.m. in Mumbai. The shares have climbed 14 percent this year,
compared with a 13 percent gain in the BSE India  Sensitive
Index. (SENSEX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
