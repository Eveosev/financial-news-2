Spain  had its fourth-hottest June
since 1960, while less rain fell than usual in the month, the
 Agriculture Ministry ’s weather service reported.  Temperatures were an average 22.7 degrees Celsius (72.9
degrees Fahrenheit) last month, 2.6 degrees above normal, the
ministry wrote in a  report  on its website today. Only 2003, 2004
and 2005 were warmer in the past 52 years, according to the
ministry. Rainfall in June was 20 millimeters (0.8 inch) on
average compared with 36 millimeters normally.  June was “extremely warm,” with temperatures in parts of
central and southern Spain exceeding 40 degrees Celsius, the
ministry said. In Cordoba in Andalusia, the temperature peaked
at 44.1 degrees Celsius on June 26, the report showed.  Hot and dry June weather follows below-normal precipitation
in May, a wetter-than usual April and the driest December-to-
February period since at least 1947, according to ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
