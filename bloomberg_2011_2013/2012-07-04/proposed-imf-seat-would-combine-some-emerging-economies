Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg are considering forming a constituent group in the
council of the  International Monetary Fund  in combination with
several emerging economies, according to an e-mailed statement
from the office of Belgian Finance Minister Steven Vanackere.  The new group would include, in addition to the three
Benelux countries, Ukraine, Israel, Romania, Bulgaria, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Macedonia
and Montenegro, according to the statement.  The move follows a decision made by the IMF at the end of
2010 for developed countries on the council to give up some of
their  voting rights  in favor of emerging economies and countries
in the process of development, according to the statement.  “The countries concerned hope to have the new constituent
in place by the end of the year,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
