World champion cyclist  Mark Cavendish 
crashed with about a mile left of stage four of the Tour de
France. Andre Greipel won the stage.  Greipel, who rides for the Lotto-Belisol team, sprinted to
victory at the end of the 133-mile ride between Abbeville and
Rouen. Team Sky’s Cavendish was among about eight riders to fall
near the front of the peloton  “Pretty serious but I think he’s OK: cut up, bruised,”
Team Sky sports director Sean Yates told Eurosport. “Every
sprint is dangerous.”  Cavendish crossed the finishing line with his rainbow
jersey ripped on the left shoulder. Last year he became the
first Briton in 46 years to win the men’s cycling road race
world title.  Switzerland’s  Fabian Cancellara  maintained the race-leading
yellow jersey. He has a seven-second lead over Bradley Wiggins
and Sylvain Chavanel. Defending champion  Cadel Evans  is 10
seconds further back.  The  20-stage race  continues tomorrow with a 122-mile ride
on flat terrain between Rouen and Saint-Quentin.  To contact the reporters on this story:
