The ruble weakened as oil,  Russia ’s
main export earner, slid from the highest level in a month.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 32.2374 per
dollar by 10:05 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble was little changed at
40.5975 per euro and weakened 0.2 percent to 35.9954 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude oil fell 0.7 percent to $87.05 a barrel in  New York .
The  International Monetary Fund  said further monetary policy
easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve may be needed as the
organization reduced its growth estimate for the world’s biggest
economy.  Investors reduced bets on the currency gaining, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.7291 per dollar in
three months, compared with investor expectations of 32.6590 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
