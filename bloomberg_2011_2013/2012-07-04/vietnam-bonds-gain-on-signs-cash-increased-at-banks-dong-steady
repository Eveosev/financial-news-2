Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose for
the first time in three days as the central bank lent funds at a
lower rate at its daily money-market auction, signaling the
amount of cash in the financial system increased. The dong was
steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam’s repurchase rate declined to 8
percent at today’s auction from 8.5 percent on July 2, according
to an e-mail from the monetary authority. The  overnight
interbank deposit rate  fell 76 basis points to 4.71 percent
today, declining for the first time this week, according to data
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  “ Interest rates  dropped at open-market operation auctions
today as well as in the  interbank market , showing that some
banks have surplus cash,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of the
fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial Joint-
Stock Bank in Hanoi. More cash may spur bond purchases, he said.  Three-year  yields  fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 9.66 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,890 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
