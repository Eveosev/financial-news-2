The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose for a fourth day, gaining 0.4 percent to close at 916.30 in
Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   advanced
for the first time in three days, up 9 percent to 109.85 koruna,
the biggest jump since Feb. 3. Time Warner Inc., the
broadcaster’s biggest shareholder, boosted its stake to 49.9
percent.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the Czech Republic’s largest power
producer, added 1.1 percent to 692.2 koruna. A Lidove Noviny
report that said the cost of expanding the company’s Temelin
nuclear power station may exceed $10 billion drove shares 1.8
percent lower yesterday. That pushed the stock’s relative-
strength index to 29, below the 30 level that indicates to some
technical analysts a security may rise. The RSI rose to 35
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
