Asian  stocks  rose for a sixth day,
with the regional benchmark index recording its longest winning
streak this year, as U.S. factory orders topped estimates and
commodities climbed to a two-month high amid speculation central
banks will act to boost economic growth.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  jumped 2.1 percent to lead gains among
commodity stocks as a surge in raw-materials prices boosted the
earnings outlook at the world’s largest mining company.  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , a Japanese maker of construction equipment that gets 23
percent of sales in the U.S., rose 2 percent.  Real Nutriceutical
Group Ltd. (2010)  soared 19 percent after billionaire  Li Ka-shing 
increased his stake in the provider of health products.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 0.4 percent to 119.20
as of 5:20 p.m. in Tokyo. Five stocks rose for every three that
fell. The gauge climbed to its highest level since May 10 after
euro-zone leaders last week agreed to relax conditions for
rescuing lenders, easing concern about the region’s debt crisis.
The six-day advance is the longest run of gains since December.  “There is some room for the rally to last for the next
couple of weeks,” Kelvin Tay, Singapore-based chief investment
officer for the southern Asia-Pacific region at the wealth
management unit of UBS AG, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. UBS
manages about $1.5 trillion globally. “Sentiment has turned
positive. The priority has shifted toward growth from inflation.
The hands of the central banks are not so tied and they can look
at perhaps easing monetary policy as they try to help stimulate
economies.”  U.S. Growth  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent

 Federal Reserve  if the situation deteriorates. The U.S. economy
will grow 2 percent this year, the IMF said in a statement
yesterday, cutting its previous 2.1 percent estimate.  Interest Rates  The  European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  announce
