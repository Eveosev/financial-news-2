The Bank of Zambia postponed a
currency revaluation it planned to implement this month, Zambia
Reports  said , citing a central bank spokesman.  The bank delayed revaluing the kwacha because of
unspecified technicalities, Kanguya Mayondi said, according to
the news website based in Lusaka, the southern African country’s
capital. The government of the continent’s biggest copper
producer decided to revalue after the national inflation rate
surged as high as 188 percent in 1993, diminishing the kwacha’s
purchasing power, the bank said in a presentation on its
website.  The  Times of Zambia  reported June 30 that the central bank
will meet this week with  Germany ’s Giesecke & Devrient GmbH and
South African Mint Co., the companies selected to produce new
banknotes and coins. The revaluation, approved by the government
on January 23, would remove three zeros from the currency. One
 U.S. dollar  currently equals 5,038 kwacha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
