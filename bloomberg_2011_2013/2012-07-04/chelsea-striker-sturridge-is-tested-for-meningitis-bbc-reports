Chelsea striker  Daniel Sturridge , who
was this week named in Great Britain’s Olympic soccer squad, has
been tested for suspected meningitis, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported.  Sturridge, 22, had tests at St Mary’s Hospital in London
after being taken ill over the weekend, the BBC reported. It’s
not yet known how serious the illness is and Chelsea manager
Roberto Di Matteo will give details at a news conference today,
the BBC added.  Team GB manager  Stuart Pearce , who included Sturridge in
his 18-man squad for the London games two days ago, may need to
call up a replacement for Sturridge, the BBC said. Tottenham
winger Gareth Bale already pulled out because of a back injury.  Team GB is scheduled to play its first match July 26
against  Senegal  at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
