Peru’s government is preparing
legislation that seeks to double pay for the armed forces within
five years, Defense Minister Alberto Otarola said.  The increases would be spread out over four or five years
and will add a total 6 billion soles ($2.25 billion) to the
ministry’s budget, Otarola said in an e-mailed statement today.  The bill, which seeks to correct a “historic distortion”
in compensation for the armed forces, will be sent to Congress
by May, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
