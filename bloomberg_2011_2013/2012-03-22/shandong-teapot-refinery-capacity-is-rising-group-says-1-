Privately owned refineries in
Shandong province may import about 10 million tons of  fuel oil 
annually in the next two to three years, about the same as now,
according to a trade association.  Total capacity for Shandong teapot refineries is about 90
million tons a year and is rising by 6 million to 7 million tons
annually, Yu Yuhua, vice secretary general of the Shandong Fuel
Oil Association, said today in an interview. About a third of
the total capacity is operating because of high crude and fuel
oil costs, he said.  No teapot refineries with capacity of less than 2 million
tons a year has been shut under a government rule, he said.  A Chinese government drive to curb pollution and improve
 energy efficiency  will shut private refineries, known as teapots,
that process fuel oil into lighter products. Refineries with a
capacity of less than 2 million tons a year will be shut by the
end of 2013, the National Development and Reform Commission,
the nation’s top economic planner, said April 26.  That would “theoretically” cut 80 percent of the total 130
million-ton capacity of the refineries, Zhu Jiasheng, an analyst
with C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based commodity researcher, said in
December. Some processors will expand to avoid closure, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
