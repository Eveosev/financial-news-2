The Czech government approved
naming Prague international airport after former President
 Vaclav Havel , the poet dissident who became the face of the
Velvet Revolution.  The renaming, which was agreed by his widow Dagmar and
family, will be carried out on Oct. 5, his birthday, almost 10
months after he died of a long illness, the government said on
its website yesterday. The total costs associated with the
change will amount to 4 million koruna ($212,940).  The move to change the  Czech Republic â€™s main airport to
Prague Airport - Vaclav Havel, was the idea of Fero Fenic, a
film producer and acquaintance of Havel. The idea was widely
supported, though some opposed it. His former secretary,
Vladimir Hanzel, noted that the former president hated flying
and suggested a public institution such as a university would be
a better venue to honor Havel.  Havel was president for almost 13 years, first as head of
 Czechoslovakia  and then the Czech Republic after the peaceful
split of the country with Slovakia in 1993. He became an
international symbol for his opposition to totalitarian regimes
in the former Soviet bloc and for his role in the 1989 Velvet
Revolution in then-Czechoslovakia.  He died on Dec. 18, at the age of 75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
