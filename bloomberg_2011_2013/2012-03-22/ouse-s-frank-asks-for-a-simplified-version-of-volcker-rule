U.S. Representative  Barney Frank 
urged regulators to complete work on a simplified version of the
Volcker rule ban of proprietary trading before Sept. 3 and to
issue guidance clarifying what compliance will be required if
the agencies don’t complete the measure by July 21.  Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-wrote the
regulatory overhaul that created the Volcker rule, made the
comments in a statement today. He called for the simpler rule to
be finished by the U.S. Labor Day holiday, which is Sept. 3 this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
