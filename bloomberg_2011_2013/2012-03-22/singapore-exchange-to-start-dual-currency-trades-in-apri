Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX)  will allow
securities, including stocks and exchange-traded funds, to be
listed in dual currencies starting next month.  Companies and ETF providers will be able to choose a
combination from among the currencies of  Singapore ,  Hong Kong ,
 Australia  and the U.S, SGX spokeswoman Loh Wei Ling told
Bloomberg News via e-mail today. Investors will be able to buy
and sell the security in either currency, with all units held in
the same depository pool, the exchange said.  Dual-currency listings mean investors will no longer have
to use brokers’ foreign exchange rate at the time of settlement,
according to the SGX website. The risk is that price disparities
could arise for a security if there is a large imbalance between
transactions in different currencies, it said.  “We think it’s an excellent idea,” Luke Randell, managing
director for Citi Global Markets in Asia Pacific told Bloomberg
today by e-mail. “It will open up global equity markets without
the  currency risk .”  Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT)  will be the first company to
list on the bourse in two currencies, according to the
statement. The port operator’s stock will trade in U.S. and
Singapore dollars starting April 2, it said.  “This is a start and we will explore offering other
currencies when it’s appropriate or if the need arises,” the
exchange’s Loh said.  Corporate actions including  dividends  will be given in the
primary currency of the listing, according to the exchange’s
website. The company will also have the option of changing the
primary currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
