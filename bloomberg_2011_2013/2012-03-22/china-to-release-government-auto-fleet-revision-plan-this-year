China  intends to release a plan to
reorganize its automobile fleet this year, according to a 
statement  posted on the central government’s website today.  China also plans to announce proposals to “reform” the
cars used by the Communist Party’s central agencies this year at
an “appropriate time,” the State Council said in a notice.  Members of China’s legislature have called on the
government to reduce its official auto fleet to cut costs and
avoid abusing public resources. China last month excluded
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi and other foreign models from a preliminary
list of this year’s government purchases, potentially locking
them out of the world’s biggest vehicle market.  China operated a fleet of at least at least 5.2 million
vehicles as of November 2007, according to Ministry of
Supervision estimates, more than the total number of cars sold
in  Japan  last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
