Muenchener Hypothekenbank eG will
draw on its reserves to avoid posting a deficit this year as
losses from Greek bonds mount,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
unidentified people close to the company.  The lender has had to write down 60 percent of the 108
million euros ($143 million) of Greek state debt it holds,
Handelsblatt reported. The firm will book the losses in 2012,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
