Vitol Group bought a cargo of
naphtha for delivery into northwest  Europe . At least 24,000
metric tons traded on the gasoline barge market.  Gasoil for April fell to its lowest price in two weeks on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Light Products  Trafigura Beheer BV sold naphtha for a second day, selling
a 12,500-ton cargo to Vitol, a survey of brokers and traders
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. The deal was
carried out at $1,046 a ton, less than yesterday’s trade at
$1,058.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent increased 17 cents to $5.79 a
barrel, PVM data show. That’s the widest since March 13.  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  for immediate delivery in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp area traded from $1,000 to $1,112 a ton, according to a
survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with yesterday’s range of $1,106 to $1,125
a ton.  Morgan Stanley was the main buyer for a second day with at
least 16,000 tons. Cargill Inc. and Trafigura also purchased
barge lots, mostly of about 1,000 tons.  Total SA sold the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
to make finished motor fuel, for a second day.  The front-month gasoline  crack  fell to $13.25 a barrel as
of 5:24 p.m. in  London , down from $13.59 yesterday, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and
refined-products broker.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for April delivery declined for a third day, falling
1.4 percent to $1,012 a ton on the ICE exchange as of 5:25 p.m.
London time. That’s the lowest since March 7.  The May contract traded at $1,012.50 a ton, leaving that
contract’s premium to April futures unchanged at 50 cents.  Barges (HEATAAAA)  of heating oil were unchanged, trading at a discount
of $4 a ton to April futures, the survey showed. Vitol sold
4,000 tons of the product to Mercuria Energy Trading SA.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
dropped to $13.61 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. London time. That’s down
from $13.74 yesterday.  Brent crude  decreased 1.1 percent to
$122.79 a barrel.  Diesel barges  were little changed with deals at premiums of
$16.50 to $17 a ton to April gasoil, the survey showed.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded lower at $691 to $694.50 a ton,
the survey of Platts showed. That’s down from yesterday’s deals
at $697 to $701.  Refineries  Galp Energia SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s biggest oil company, said
its two refineries haven’t been affected by strikes against
austerity measures.  “Both of our refineries are operating normally,” Pedro
Marques Pereira, a company spokesman, said today by phone from
Lisbon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
