The  Denver Broncos  said they have
agreed to trade quarterback  Tim Tebow  and a seventh-round pick
in this yearâ€™s NFL Draft to the  New York Jets  for fourth- and
sixth-round picks in the draft.  The trade stalled for several hours this afternoon as the
Broncos and Jets negotiated who will pay a $5 million advance on
his salary, ESPN reported, citing an unidentified league source.  The trade was finalized after the Jets agreed to pay half
the amount, ESPN said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
