The  Internal Revenue Service  in
2011 audited 29.93 percent of taxpayers who reported more than
$10 million of income, according to  statistics released today .  That’s up from an audit rate of 18.38 percent in 2010 and
10.60 percent in 2009 for a group that consists of 0.01 percent
of taxpayers. Overall, the agency’s rate of audits for
individual taxpayers stayed constant at 1.11 percent.  Joe Perry, partner-in-charge of tax services at the
accounting firm Marcum LLP in  New York , said he has seen a ten-
fold increase in clients being audited, including at least five
under the more intense scrutiny of a new IRS task force that is
targeting high net-worth taxpayers.  “Those are very time consuming and costly,” said Perry,
who represents several clients with incomes exceeding $10
million. “It’s worse than a root canal.”  The IRS statistics cover audits conducted in fiscal year
2011, which generally corresponds to returns filed during 2010.  For U.S. taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes between $5
million and $10 million, the audit rate rose to 20.75 percent
from 11.55 percent. People making between $200,000 and $500,000
were audited at a 2.66 percent rate.  Quicker to Audit  The IRS is quicker to audit individual returns than in the
past, sometimes contacting people within months of their return
being filed, Perry said.  In some cases, the IRS requires taxpayers to produce and
prove every item on their return including such things as their
children’s Social Security numbers. Perry said the firm has also
seen an increase in so-called correspondence audits, where the
IRS will send a letter asking a taxpayer to verify a specific
item on the return such as charitable deductions.  In 2009, the IRS created a special unit to examine the tax
returns of high-wealth individuals.  “We will take a unified look at the entire web of business
entities controlled by a high-wealth individual, which will
enable us to better assess the risk such arrangements pose to
tax compliance and the integrity of our tax system,” IRS
Commissioner  Douglas Shulman  said in a December 2009  speech .
“We want to better understand the entire economic picture of
the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual and to
assess the tax compliance of that overall enterprise.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
