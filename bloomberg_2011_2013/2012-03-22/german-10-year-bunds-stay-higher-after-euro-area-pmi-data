German 10-year bunds stayed higher
after a report showed euro-area services and manufacturing
output contracted more than economists forecast in March.  The 10-year bund yield was six basis points lower at 1.92
percent as of 9:14 a.m. London time.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries dropped to 48.7 from 49.3 in
February, London-based Markit Economics said in an initial
estimate today. Economists forecast a gain to 49.6, according to
the median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
