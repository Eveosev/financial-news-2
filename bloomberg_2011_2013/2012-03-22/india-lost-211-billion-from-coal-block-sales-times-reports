India  lost 10.7 trillion rupees
($211 billion) by allotting coal blocks instead of auctioning
them to private and state-run companies, the Times of India
reported, citing a report by the government’s chief auditor.  About 100 companies gained “undue benefits” from the
government’s policy, the  newspaper  said, quoting from a draft
copy of the report. The Comptroller and Auditor General is
expected to submit the report to parliament in the current
session, the Times of India said.  B.S. Chauhan, a spokesman at the CAG’s office in  New Delhi ,
said he could not comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
