Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest
oil-pipeline operator, purchased a 50-megawatt solar farm in
Nevada from  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  to help offset  carbon emissions 
from the electricity it consumes.  The Silver State North project, about 40 miles (64
kilometers) south of Las Vegas on federal land, will be
completed in May and First Solar expects to record revenue from
the sale in the second quarter, the companies said today in a
statement. They didn’t give a price.  The acquisition marks Enbridge’s first move in the U.S.
solar market and will help it meet a goal of generating as much
energy from renewable sources as its operations consume. The
project will produce enough power for about 9,000 Nevada homes
and will displace about 42,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a
year, the equivalent of 8,000 cars, according to the statement.  Output from the 600-acre solar farm will be sold to Las
Vegas-based  NV Energy Inc. (NVE)  under a 25-year power purchase
agreement that was approved by Nevada regulators in 2010.  First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona,  rose  2.4 percent to
$26.95 at 10:12 a.m. in New York. Calgary-based Enbridge rose
0.5 percent to C$37.42 in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
