Amar’e Stoudemire scored 21 points
for the  New York Knicks  in their fifth straight victory, 82-79
over the Atlantic Division-leading Philadelphia 76ers.  Jeremy Lin went 10-for-10 from the free-throw line,
including eight in the final minute, and had 18 points for the
Knicks, who pulled within three games of the 76ers in the five-
team Atlantic Division of the  National Basketball Association .  The Knicks are 5-0 since interim coach Mike Woodson took
over after the resignation of  Mike D’Antoni . The Knicks had lost
six games in a row when D’Antoni stepped down.  “I learned that our guys are not going to buckle,”
Woodson told reporters. “They’re going to continue to stay
strong and keep pushing. I honestly believe they think that they
can win every game now.”  New York held a 19-11 lead after one quarter, and ended the
first half with a 43-35 advantage at Wells Fargo Center in
Philadelphia.  Jrue Holiday had 16 points and Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams
and Jodie Meeks each had 13 points for the 76ers.  The Knicks are in the eighth and final playoff spot in the
Eastern Conference, 15 games behind the  Chicago Bulls .  To contact the reporter on this story:
