The Philippine peso touched a one-
week low after an outflow of funds from the local equities
market. Bonds gained.  Foreign investors sold $263 million more local shares than
they bought this week through yesterday, paring this year’s net
purchases to $389 million, according to exchange data. The
Philippine Stock Exchange Index has retreated 2 percent since
reaching a record closing level of 5,145.89 points on March 16.  “There were noticeable equity outflows,” said Radhika Rao,
an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “Expectations are
the  stock index  has reached the optimum level, adding to
downward pressure on the peso.”  The peso was little changed at 43.045 per dollar at the
close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 43.125 earlier, the weakest level since March 15. The
peso’s one-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-
rate swings used to price options, rose to 6.3 percent from 6.1
percent yesterday.  The yield on the 6.375 percent bond due January 2022
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.43
percent, prices from Tradition Financial Services showed.  The government reported yesterday the  budget deficit  in
January narrowed to 15.9 billion pesos ($369 million) from 101.5
billion pesos in December.  “The deficit data was positive because it shows the
government has kept up with spending efforts to support
growth,” Rao said. “But if we continue to see weak revenues in
the first quarter, then there might be some concerns.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
