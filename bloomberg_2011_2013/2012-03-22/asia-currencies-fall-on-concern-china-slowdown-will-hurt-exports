Asian currencies weakened as a
private report signaled  China ’s manufacturing will shrink for a
fifth straight month, clouding the region’s export outlook.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index (ADXY)  erased earlier
gains after HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics reported a
preliminary reading of 48.1, a four-month low, for factory
output in the world’s second-largest economy in March. A number
below 50 indicates contraction.  Thailand  left  interest rates 
unchanged yesterday as costlier oil boosts the risk of faster
inflation.  Taiwan  may also  hold  borrowing costs today, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  “The market is worried about the slowdown in the Chinese
economy,” said Irene Cheung, a currency strategist in Singapore
at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “We still have  oil
prices  at levels which could mean imported inflation can be a
threat to the economy.”  India’s rupee slumped 0.6 percent to 50.9613 per dollar as
of 1:40 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.4 percent to 9,182, Malaysia’s
ringgit fell 0.2 percent to 3.0820 and Thailand’s baht slid 0.1
percent to 30.79.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most
active currencies excluding the yen, was unchanged from
yesterday. The gauge’s 60-day historical  volatility  fell to 3.48
percent from 3.49 percent yesterday.  Inflation Concern  The rupiah snapped a two-day gain after global funds cut
holdings of the nation’s bonds on concern a government plan to
raise fuel prices will stoke inflation.  Overseas investors sold 2.6 trillion rupiah ($283 million)
more local debt than they bought this month as the government
proposed revising its inflation target for 2012 to 7 percent
from 5.3 percent, according to a document presented to
parliament on March 7. Crude oil prices have climbed 7.8 percent
this year to $106.54 per a barrel in  New York .  “The rupiah will still tend to weaken as we are seeing a
lot of orders from banks to buy the dollar,” said Dave Hartono,
a Jakarta-based currency trader at PT Bank ICBC Indonesia.
“They are waiting to see how inflation will play out.”  The won touched a one-week low after a U.S. report showed
sales of previously-owned houses unexpectedly fell in the
world’s biggest economy, sapping demand for riskier assets. The
currency closed little changed at 1,129.58 per dollar.  Purchases (ETSLMOM)  of existing homes dropped 0.9 percent to a 4.59
million annual rate, compared with the median forecast for an
increase to 4.61 million in a Bloomberg News survey, figures
showed yesterday. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told
Congress yesterday that higher energy prices may weaken the  U.S.
economy  and that  Europe ’s financial and economic situation
“remains difficult.”  Malaysia Growth Forecast  Malaysia ’s ringgit traded near a two-month low as the
central bank forecast slower economic growth. Gross domestic
product may expand 4 percent to 5 percent in 2012, the central
bank said yesterday. That is less than the finance ministry’s 5
percent to 6 percent forecast in October, and a 5.1 percent pace
in 2011.  “The lower GDP target raises the possibility of a rate
cut,” said Akira Banno, a treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “This will make the
ringgit less attractive to investors.”  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso and Taiwan’s dollar were
little changed at 43.045 and NT$29.574, respectively. China’s
yuan climbed 0.25 percent to 6.3070.  To contact the reporters on this story:
