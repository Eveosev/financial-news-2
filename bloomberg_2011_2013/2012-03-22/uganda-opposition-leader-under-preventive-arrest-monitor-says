Uganda ’s main opposition leader,
 Kizza Besigye , is under “preventive arrest” at his home after
police charged him for participating in a demonstration in which
a policeman died, the Daily Monitor reported.  Besigye’s confinement is aimed at preventing him from
taking part in public demonstrations, the Kampala-based
newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  A policeman died after being hit by a stone when Besigye’s
supporters threw objects at the police in the capital, the
newspaper said. Clashes erupted after security forces blocked
their procession for more than 40 minutes, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
