U.S. stocks retreated, trimming the
longest monthly rally since September 2009 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, as manufacturing contracted in  China  and
Europe and  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  tumbled amid a disappointing forecast.  FedEx sank 3.5 percent after the world’s largest cargo
airline predicted slower growth in coming quarters. The Dow
Jones Transportation Average, which is considered a proxy for
economic growth, slumped 2.1 percent. Commodity shares had the
biggest losses in the S&P 500 among 10 groups as  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  dropped at least 2.3 percent.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  fell 2.2 percent to pace  declines  in financial shares.  The S&P 500 declined 0.7 percent to 1,392.78 at 4 p.m. New
York time, slumping 1.2 percent in three days. The gauge has
risen 2 percent in March, on pace for a fourth monthly rally.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 78.48 points, or 0.6
percent, to 13,046.14. The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  slid 1 percent to
821.44. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, almost in line with the three-month average.  “We are watching China closely,” said  Scott Armiger , a
portfolio manager at Christiana Trust in Greenville, Delaware,
which has $11 billion in client assets. “There are still a lot
of questions about the pace of economic growth,” he said.
“It’s not unusual to have a pullback in the market after a
strong run. We’ve made a lot of money in less than six months.”  Equities joined a global slump today as a Chinese
manufacturing index indicated a worse contraction this month.
Euro-area services and manufacturing output contracted more than
economists forecast. Stocks fell even after data showed that
jobless claims dropped to the lowest level in four years,
reinforcing signs the U.S. labor market is picking up.  2012 Rally  Today’s decline  trimmed  this year’s gain in the  S&P 500  to
11 percent. The benchmark gauge is up 27 percent from its
October 2011 low amid economic and corporate data that exceeded
projections. Financial and technology shares have soared at
least 33 percent during that period.  “There’s enough of a reason there after the sharp run-up
in stocks for the market to pull back or go sideways in the
short term,” said  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage about $125
billion at Guggenheim Investments, in Irvington, New York.
“Most people recognize that China growth has slowed. It’s a
question of: is it going to be a sharp or a mild slowdown?”  Companies most dependent on economic growth had the biggest
declines among 10 groups in the S&P 500 today, as gauges of
commodity, financial and industrial shares  retreated  at least
1.1 percent. The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index dropped 1.9
percent. A measure of 11 homebuilders in S&P indexes slumped 1.7
percent.  FedEx Forecast  FedEx tumbled 3.5 percent to $92.50. It forecast a profit
range for its current fiscal quarter whose low end trailed
analysts’ estimates amid slowing express-shipment demand.  The company is responding to a drop in express shipments
and “below-trend” growth by parking an unspecified number of
planes in the desert, reducing flight hours and reviewing
domestic capacity. The range of goods delivered by FedEx and
 United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  makes them economic barometers.  Energy and raw material shares retreated as the S&P GSCI
gauge of commodities declined 1.1 percent amid concern about
slower demand. Alcoa retreated 2.5 percent, the most in the Dow,
to $10.01. Chevron slumped 2.4 percent to $105.35. Among
industrial companies,  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  dropped 2.4 percent to
$106.43.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  lost 1.6 percent as all of its 24
companies declined. Bank of America slipped 2.2 percent to
$9.60.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  retreated 2.4 percent to $36.90.  Discover, Dish  Discover Financial Services (DFS)  added 2.7 percent to $32.49.
The payments network company said fiscal first-quarter  profit 
rose 36 percent to a record as consumers spent more on credit
cards.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  rose 1.7 percent to $32.90. The second-
largest U.S. satellite-TV provider has its share-price estimate
increased to $41 from $35 at Deutsche Bank AG. U.S. regulators
began removing barriers to the company’s proposed mobile high-
speed data network, voting 3-0 yesterday to begin recasting
rules that reserve the company’s recently acquired airwaves for
satellite use.  Bats Global Markets Inc. (BATS) , founded by a high-frequency
trader and nurtured by the world’s top securities firms into the
third-largest U.S. stock exchange operator, will seek more than
$100 million for its owners today. It plans to sell 6.3 million
shares between $16 and $18 apiece after the close of trading.  Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG
and Citigroup are pricing the shares at about 16.9 times
estimated 2013 earnings, according to  Diego Perfumo , an analyst
at hedge fund adviser Equity Research Desk.  13 Employees  Started in 2005 with 13 employees,  Bats (BATS)  was steered to
prominence by brokers and traders trying to hold down fees as
the  New York  Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market bought their
biggest electronic rivals. Now, with its venues accounting for
11 percent of U.S. share volume, the Lenexa, Kansas-based
company is seeking a valuation that is higher than its biggest
competitors, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Naysayers would have said these guys were just a
disruptive influence and Bats was created to beat up on the
traditional exchanges,”  Larry Tabb , chief executive officer of
research firm Tabb Group LLC in New York, said in a phone
interview yesterday. “The IPO makes the case that Bats is a
legitimate exchange just like NYSE and Nasdaq.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
