Treasuries gained for a third day
in the longest winning streak in almost a month after reports
showed euro-region output contracted and China’s manufacturing
weakened, boosting the refuge appeal of  government bonds .  The U.S. drew a record low negative yield at an auction of
$13 billion of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
Nominal  10-year notes  briefly pared gains after initial claims
for  unemployment benefits  dropped last week to a four-year low.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said low inflation
gives the central bank flexibility on interest rates.  “People are comfortable with dipping back into
Treasuries,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “Our economy is not just based on
how we do internally. We are still tied in to the rest of the
world. The weak economic news throughout the world brought in
good buying.”  Yields on 10-year notes dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.28 percent at 5:09 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They touched 2.24
percent, the lowest since March 14. The price of the 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 increased 5/32, or $1.56
per $1,000 face amount, to 97 17/32.  Ten-year yields have climbed about 30 basis points this
month.  Thirty-year bond  yields decreased two basis points today
to 3.36 percent.  Volume Declines  Volume declined to the lowest since March 12. About $259
billion of Treasuries changed hands through ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker, as of 5:01 p.m., compared
with $288 billion yesterday. The average daily volume over the
past year is $268 billion.  Volatility dropped from the highest level this year. Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures price
swings based on options, fell to 87.1 basis points, after
climbing March 20 to 93.3 basis points, the most since Dec. 29.  The TIPS auction drew a yield of negative 0.089 percent,
the second 10-year inflation-note offering in a row at which it
was less than zero. Investors still submitted offers for 2.81
times the amount being sold, exceeding the average bid-to-cover
ratio of 2.74 at the past 10 auctions. Indirect bidders, a class
of investors that includes foreign central banks, bought 40.4
percent of the notes, versus an average of 41.6 percent at the
past 10 sales.  ‘Real-Return Certainty’  “TIPS offer real-return certainty,” said Chirag Mirani,
strategist in  New York  at Barclays Plc, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “Considering the longer-term
U.S. fiscal situation, investors should want a greater real-
return certainty compared with previous times.”  While buyers of TIPS are paid interest, the principal on
the bonds rises with the  consumer price index , a feature not
found in the rest of the Treasury market.  The  yield gap  between nominal 10-year notes and comparable
TIPS shrank for a second day. It fell to 2.38 percentage points
after touching a seven-month high of 2.45 percentage points on
March 20. The figure indicates the annual rise in consumer
prices investors expect over the next decade. The average over
the past year is 2.19 percentage points.  Determining the right time to raise  interest rates  is
“challenging,” Bernanke said today in response to questions
after a lecture at George  Washington  University in Washington.
With low inflation, the Fed can keep rates at record low levels
without fear of creating a wage-price spiral, he said.  A  measure  of traders’ inflation expectations that the
central bank uses to help determine monetary policy rose on
March 19 to 2.78 percent from its 2012 low of 2.37 percent
reached March 5. The five-year, five-year forward break-even
rate, which projects what the pace of price increases may be
starting in 2017, was above the 10-year average of 2.76 percent.  Jobless Claims  Labor Department data showed initial  jobless claims 
decreased to 348,000 in the week ended March 17, the fewest
since February 2008, from a revised 353,000 the previous week.  Treasuries rose earlier as a preliminary index of  China 
manufacturing from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell
to 48.1 for March from 49.6 in the previous month. Readings
below 50 indicate a contraction.  “Domestically, we’ve seen our data continue to improve,”
said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government
and agency debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income
broker and dealer for institutional investors. “I don’t think
there’s any reason for us to break out of this range, 2.10
percent to 2.40 percent.”  Note Auctions  The Treasury said it will auction $99 billion in notes next
week: $35 billion of two-year securities on March 27, the same
amount of five-year debt on the following day and $29 billion of
seven-year notes on March 29. The amounts are the same as the
last time the government sold the securities, in February.  The Fed bought $2.01 billion of Treasuries today due from
August 2022 to May 2030 as part of its plan to replace $400
billion in shorter-term debt in its holdings with longer-term
maturities by the end of June to boost the economy.  Treasuries rose earlier after London-based Markit Economics
said in an initial estimate that a euro-area composite index
based on a survey of purchasing managers in services and
manufacturing dropped to 48.7 this month. A Bloomberg News poll
forecast a gain to 49.6.  The MSCI World Index of stocks slid 0.6 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.7 percent.  Risk-Off ‘Resurgence’  “There’s a resurgence of the risk-off trade,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in New York at the primary
dealer Jefferies Group Inc.  While U.S. 10-year note yields climbed on March 20 to 2.40
percent, the highest level since Oct. 28, they’re still below
the 3.87 percent average over the past decade. They will rise to
2.54 percent by year-end, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of banks and securities companies, with the
most recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  Rates will have a hard time rising further than current
levels because of expected fiscal tightening in the U.S., a lack
of risk-free alternatives and the likelihood the Fed won’t
change monetary policy soon given the uncertainty on economic
growth, strategists at Barclays led by Larry Kantor, head of
research in New York, said in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
