Angola LNG, the  Chevron Corp (CVX) .-led
liquefied natural gas plant in the southern African state, won’t
load its first cargo until May, World Gas Intelligence said,
without saying where it got the information.  Angola LNG has approached spot buyers for the chilled fuel
in  Asia  but isn’t believed to have secured any long-term sales
agreements for its gas, WGI reported.  Laurentino Silva, a spokesman for Angola LNG, didn’t return
e-mails or phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
