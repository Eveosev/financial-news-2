Jean-Claude Trichet , the former
president of the  European Central Bank , said today that “I
don’t regret anything” about his management of the European
financial crisis.  “We took all our decisions carefully,” Trichet said
during a question-and-answer session after a speech at Harvard
University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “They were not in a
textbook. We were incorporating a lot of decisions and
judgments. They had to be taken, from time to time, very
rapidly.”  Trichet retired from his role as president of the
Frankfurt-based central bank last year. He was succeeded by Bank
of Italy Governor Mario Draghi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
