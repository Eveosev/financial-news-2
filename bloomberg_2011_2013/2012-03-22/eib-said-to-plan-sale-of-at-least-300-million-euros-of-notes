The  European Investment Bank  will
sell at least 300 million euros of January 2022 floating-rate
notes today, according to a banker involved in the transaction.  EIB hired Banca Akros,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , DZ Bank AG, JP
Morgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Bank International Plc to manage
the issue, the banker said.  The notes may be priced to yield 50 basis points over
Euribor, said the banker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
