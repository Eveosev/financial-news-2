The European Union said it will sue
 Hungary  over a tax the government imposes on telecommunications
operators.  The European Commission, the EU regulator in Brussels, said
it will take the case to the  European Court  of Justice because
Hungary “continues to impose a specific tax on the turnover of
telecoms operators in violation of EU rules,” according to a
statement today. “The commission considers this tax illegal
because EU telecoms rules allow sector-specific charges only to
cover the specific costs of regulating the sector and not to
generate additional revenue for the central budget.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
