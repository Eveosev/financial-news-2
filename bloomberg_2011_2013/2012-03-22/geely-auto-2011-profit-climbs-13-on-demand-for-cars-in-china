Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175) ,
whose parent owns Volvo cars, posted a 13 percent gain in 2011
profit on Chinese demand for new vehicles.  Net income rose to 1.54 billion yuan ($244 million), or
0.19 yuan a share, from 1.37 billion yuan, or 0.17 yuan, a year
earlier, Geely said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That beat the 1.47 billion yuan average of 21
 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  China  has stepped up efforts to help Geely and other local
automakers facing increased competition from foreign rivals such
as  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)  The industry regulator
has included 19 Geely models on its list of cars that government
agencies can buy, shutting out overseas producers.  The market share of local-brand cars, excluding minivans,
multipurpose vehicles and SUVs, fell 1.78 percentage points to
29.11 percent last year, according to the  China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers .  Geely’s vehicle sales rose 1 percent to 421,611 units in
2011, lagging behind the 5.2 percent gain of the passenger-car
market in the country. The company is targeting a 9 percent
increase in sales to 460,000 units this year, it said in
January.  Geely’s parent,  Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. (GEELZ) , signed a
memorandum of understanding this month with its unit Volvo Cars
to transfer vehicle technology to establish a new brand and
enhance competitiveness.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
