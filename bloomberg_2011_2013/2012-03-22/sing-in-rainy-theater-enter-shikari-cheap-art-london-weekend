British band Enter Shikari is
playing in  London  before crossing the Atlantic for a shot at
success in the U.S.  The quartet has built up a U.K. following with its blend of
hardcore and metal music. It embarks on a 30-date North American
tour next month. If the hype is to be believed, Friday’s show is
a last chance to hear the hit-makers behind “Sssnakepit” before
they go stadium-sized.  HMV Hammersmith Apollo, 45 Queen Caroline Street, W6 9QH.

as possible Friday -- or at least as far as the  Royal Albert
Hall . The Philharmonia Orchestra under Esa-Pekka Salonen is
playing the last in a three-concert cycle of Beethoven works
with Lang Lang. The “King Stephen” Overture, Symphony No. 4 and
“Emperor” Piano Concerto are on the program.  Royal Albert Hall,  Kensington Gore , SW7 2AP. Information:
+44-845-401-5045;  http://www.royalalberthall.com .  Saturday  You can plot the end of the  Cold War  in a sequence of
embroideries hanging in Tate Modern.  The Italian conceptual artist Alighiero Boetti spent time
in  Afghanistan  in the 1970s, where he set up a hotel-commune and
had local craftswomen embroider flag-marked maps of the world.
The maps were later continued in  Pakistan . Studying them, you
can chart the collapse of the  Soviet Union .  Boetti, a follower of Duchamp and a precursor to the now-
crowded conceptual-art posse, also created a lamp in 1967 that
lights up randomly for 11 seconds every year. The lamp is in the
show, though chances of you seeing it light up are next to nil.  “Alighiero Boetti: Game Plan” is at Tate Modern through
May 27. Information:  http://www.tate.org.uk  or +44-20-7887-8888.  Tsuru, behind Tate Modern, is a small sushi bar whose hot
dishes include katsu curry and prawn tempura. The chicken is
free range and the yellow-fin tuna line caught. Information:

five rows of “Singin’ in the Rain.”  As the title track is performed at the Palace Theatre, the
stage is flooded with thousands of gallons of water. The actor-
dancer in the Gene Kelly role (Adam Cooper, a former Royal
Ballet principal) evenly distributes the wetness by blissfully
kicking water at the audience.  In director Jonathan Church’s fun staging, the action takes
place on a studio film lot. At the Palace Theatre, 109-113
Shaftesbury Avenue, W1D 8AY. Information: +44-844-412-4656 or
 http://www.singinintherain.co.uk .  Quo Vadis, a few minutes’ walk from the Palace Theatre, is
one of London’s oldest restaurants and also one of the most
popular under new chef Jeremy Lee. The all-day theater set menu
is 17.50 pounds for two courses and 20 pounds for three. It’s
wise to book ahead. Information:  http://www.quovadissoho.co.uk/ 
or +44-20-7437-9585.  Sunday  The U.K.’s top graphic artists get to show their work in a
grand 18th-century setting.  At  Somerset House ’s contemporary graphic-art fair, you can
pick up a print for as little as 10 pounds ($16). One highlight
this year: a pop-up graphic zoo, with prints of just about every
animal available from the Nelly Duff booth.  “Pick Me Up: Contemporary Graphic Art Fair” runs through
April 1. Information:  http://www.somersethouse.org.uk  or
