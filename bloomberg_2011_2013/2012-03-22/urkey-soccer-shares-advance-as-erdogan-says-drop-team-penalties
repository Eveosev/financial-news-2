Shares of Istanbul’s three leading
soccer clubs rose after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said
individuals, and not teams, should be punished amid allegations
of match-fixing.  Besiktas Futbol Yatirimlari Sanayi & Ticaret AS (BJKAS)  gained 1.8
percent to 6.84 liras at the close, its biggest jump in four
weeks.  Fenerbahce Sportif Hizmetler Sanayi & Ticaret AS (FENER)  jumped
9.8 percent to 52.80 liras to its highest level in seven months.
 Galatasaray Sportif Sinai & Ticari Yatirimlar AS (GSRAY)  surged 18
percent to 230 liras, the most in almost four years.  “We have to identify the difference between individuals
and legal entities,” Erdogan told a meeting of the European
soccer body UEFA in Istanbul. “If a legal entity is punished
for the crime of an individual, millions of people would be
punished,” he said, referring to fans.  Turkish champion Fenerbahce was banned from the Champions
League this season after club president  Aziz Yildirim  was
arrested on charges of fixing games. Executives, coaches,
players, journalists and former officials have been jailed as
part of a police probe into alleged match-fixing in more than a
dozen games last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
