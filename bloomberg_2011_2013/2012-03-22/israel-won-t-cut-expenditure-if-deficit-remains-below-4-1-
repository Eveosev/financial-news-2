Israel ’s deficit is likely to be
around 3 percent to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product this
year and next and the government won’t cut spending as long as
it remains below 4 percent, the finance minister said today.  “If the deficit is between 3 and 4 percent, we will make
no changes in the expenditure level,” Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said in an interview at a Bloomberg Link Sovereign Debt
Conference in Frankfurt today. “If it will be much beyond, of
course we will have to make an adjustment.”  Slowing growth is expected to reduce tax receipts this
year, bringing the  budget deficit  to 3.3 percent of GDP compared
with a planned 2 percent ceiling, according to a Bank of Israel
forecast. The  International Monetary Fund  said in a February
report that a return to the planned 1.5 percent deficit in 2013
would be “unduly contractionary.”  Israel’s economy expanded an annualized 3.2 percent in the
fourth quarter, the slowest pace since 2009, as exports dropped
an annualized 7 percent. More than 40 percent of Israel’s GDP is
from sales abroad, with the U.S. and  Europe  the two largest
markets. The Bank of Israel is forecasting 3.2 percent growth
this year, after an expansion of 4.7 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
