Movie box-office revenue in the
U.S. and  Canada  fell 3.8 percent last year to $10.2 billion, the
first drop since 2005, as Hollywood failed to match the 2010
success of  James Cameron ’s “Avatar.”  Worldwide sales rose 3.2 percent to $32.6 billion, with all
regions outside the U.S. and Canada expanding, the  Motion
Picture Association of America  said today in a report. China
increased 35 percent to $2 billion, making that country second-
largest internationally after  Japan , at $2.3 billion.  “These numbers underscore the impact of movies on the
global economy and the vitality of the film-watching experience
around the world,”  Chris Dodd , chairman and chief executive of
the Washington-based association, said in a statement.  This year is shaping up as a growth year, with U.S. sales
up almost 14 percent, John Fithian, president of the  National
Association of Theatre Owners , said in the statement.  Last year’s drop was led by a decline in revenue from 3-D
films, which fell 18 percent to $1.8 billion, accounting for all
of the shortfall. The drop wasn’t surprising given the outsize
performance of the film “Avatar,” the MPAA said.  “Avatar,” released in December 2009, went on to collect a
record $2.78 billion in worldwide tickets sales, according to
Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher.  Although more than two-thirds of U.S. and Canada residents
attended a movie last year, half of industry sales came from the
10 percent of the population Hollywood studios call frequent
moviegoers. Attendance also fell 4 percent, to 1.28 billion
tickets sold. The average price rose 0.5 percent to $7.93 from
$7.89 a year earlier.  The total number of feature films released increased 7.2
percent to 610 last year, while those from association members,
the six major studios and their subsidiaries, was unchanged at
141, the MPAA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
