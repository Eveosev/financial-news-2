BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and  Societe Generale (GLE) 
SA, France’s largest banks, are considering appealing 500,000-
euro ($658,000) fines issued by the Autorite des Marches
Financiers for violating market-testing procedures before a bond
sale.  The banks were fined by the AMF, France’s financial markets
regulator, for breaking rules on how to conduct market polls to
ensure against  insider trading  ahead of January 2009 bond
issuances, according to yesterday’s  decision .  “The incident resulted from a one-off insufficient
administrative process which has no consequence for clients, the
bank or corporate bond markets,” BNP Paribas said in a
statement e-mailed by Paris-based spokeswoman Julia Boyce.  Societe Generale is considering “options” following the
AMF decision, the Paris-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement.  BNP Paribas has strengthened “administrative process” to
prevent such an incident from recurring, Boyce said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
