At least four people, including two
suspected Islamist militants, were killed in separate incidents
in northeastern  Nigeria  over the past two days, the military
said.  Suspected Boko Haram members shot dead two people yesterday
in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, Hassan Mohammed, a
spokesman for the military  task force  in charge of security in
the region, said by phone from Maiduguri. The military killed
two suspected Boko Haram members after they opened fire on a
patrol vehicle on March 20, he said.  “There was no casualty on the side of the Joint Task
Force,” Mohammed said.  Authorities in  Africa ’s top oil producer blame Boko Haram,
which draws inspiration from Afghanistan’s Taliban movement, for
a surge of violence in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja, the
capital, in which more than 1,000 people have died since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
