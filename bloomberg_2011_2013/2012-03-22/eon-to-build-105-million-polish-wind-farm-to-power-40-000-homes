EON AG (EON) ,  Germany ’s largest utility,
will build an 80 million-euro ($105 million) wind farm in  Poland 
to generate enough power for 40,000 homes a year.  EON is planning the 55-megawatt Wysoka wind farm about 100
kilometers (62 miles) south of Szczecin near the German border,
the Dusseldorf-based company said today in a statement.  EON is among companies including EDP Renovaveis SA and RWE
AG developing projects in Poland. CEZ AS, the  Czech Republic ’s
largest power producer, bought Polish developer Eco-Wind with a
project capacity of 800 megawatts last year. The nation could
install as much as 13 gigawatts of wind by 2020 according to the
Polish Wind Energy Association, and offers incentives to wind
power producers through its green certificate program.  EON will install turbines made by  Nordex SE (NDX1)  in two phases
at the Wysoka site with commissioning of the project planned for
late next year, according to the statement. EON already as four
wind parks totaling almost 100 megawatts installed in the
“strategically important” Polish market, the company said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
