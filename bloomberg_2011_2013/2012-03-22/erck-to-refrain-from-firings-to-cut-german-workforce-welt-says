Merck KGaA (MRK)  won’t use mass firings
to reduce its workforce of 11,000 employees in  Germany  as part
of a cost-saving plan, Die Welt  reported , citing a document from
a meeting of workers and management.  The strategy for the Darmstadt, Germany-based drugmaker’s
employees outside its home country remains unclear, the Berlin-
based newspaper said.  Merck’s global workforce totaled almost 40,700 employees at
the end of 2011, according to the company’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
