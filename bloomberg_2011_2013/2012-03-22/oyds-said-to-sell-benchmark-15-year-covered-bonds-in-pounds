Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  plans to
sell benchmark-size 15-year covered bonds in pounds, according
to a banker involved in the transaction.  The securities may be priced to yield about 195 basis
points more than U.K. government debt, the banker said. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  will manage the sale
with Lloyds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
