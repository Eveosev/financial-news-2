The 30-stock Micex index dropped
for a sixth day, falling 1.3 percent to 1,532.05 as of 6:03 p.m.
in Moscow. The dollar-denominated  RTS  lost 1.8 percent to
1,656.7.  The following are among the most active equities in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  (GAZP RX) sank 2 percent to 181.67 rubles,
dropping for a fifth day and poised for its worst losing streak
since Nov. 24. Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said she will
oppose a request by the country’s gas exporter for an increase
in domestic prices for the fuel by about 26 percent this fall.  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  (SBER RX) fell 2 percent to 96.27 rubles, its
sharpest intraday drop since March 15 as the ruble slid for a

Russians to withdraw and convert ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main
source of funding.  OAO Surgutneftegas (SNGSP)  (SNGSP RX), the country’s fourth-largest
oil producer, led declines on the Micex as its preferred shares
