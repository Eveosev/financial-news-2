Ethanol futures fell a fourth day
in  Chicago  as supply of the biofuel outpaced demand.  Prices extended the longest streak of losses this year a
day after the Energy Department said ethanol  supply  rose 3
percent to a record 22.7 million barrels last week. Production
of conventional gasoline  mixed  with the biofuel fell 0.6 percent
to 5.11 million barrels, the report showed.  “The feeling in the market is that there’s a lot of
ethanol to be sold,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “There is a ton of inventory out there.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 0.3 cent to
$2.283 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have risen
3.6 percent this year.  Production (DOETFETH)  rose to 893,000 barrels a day last week from
892,000, the Energy Department said. That’s equal to about 13.7
billion gallons of the fuel on an annualized basis.  Ethanol is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and meet
federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
