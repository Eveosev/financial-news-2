Asian  stocks  rose after  Japan 
posted an unexpected trade surplus and as a survey that showed
 China ’s manufacturing may contract this month stoked speculation
the government may introduce more measures to bolster growth.  First Tractor Co., a Chinese maker of farm equipment,
jumped 7.6 percent in  Hong Kong  after the mainland’s central
bank cut reserve requirements to more branches of Agricultural
Bank of China Ltd.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Asia’s No.1
consumer-electronics maker that counts China as its biggest
market, gained 1.3 percent in Seoul. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s
second-largest carmaker, added 1.7 percent in  Tokyo .  “I don’t see a hard landing happening in China this year
because of the policy offsets that can be put in place,” said
 Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the
Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment Group, which manages
about $150 billion. “China’s housing sector remains a key
concern. The anecdotes coming out of the housing market suggest
the weakness is quite pronounced.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent to 126.64 as
of 8:39 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge pared initial gains of as much
0.8 percent after a purchasing managers’ survey by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics showed Chinese manufacturing contracted
for a fifth straight month, the longest period since the global
financial crisis.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.4 percent after
swinging between gains and losses. The government reported an
unexpected trade surplus for February and higher-than-expected
exports, adding to evidence of a rebound in the world’s third-
biggest economy. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.5
percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index slipped 0.1 percent.  China Manufacturing  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 0.2 percent, having swung
between losses of as much as 0.3 percent and gains of as much as
0.6 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.1
percent.  China’s manufacturing index indicated a worse contraction
this month, bolstering the case for Premier Wen Jiabao to add
measures to sustain growth even as he prolongs a campaign to
cool property prices. The preliminary 48.1 reading in a
purchasing managers’ index from HSBC and Markit Economics today
is the lowest since November and compares with a final 49.6 in
February. A result below 50 indicates a contraction.  “Growth momentum could slow down further amid a
combination of sluggish export new orders and softening domestic
demand, and this calls for further easing steps,” said Qu Hongbin, Hong Kong-based chief economist for China at HSBC.  Rural Lending  China’s central bank move to bolster rural lending by
cutting the reserve requirements for an additional 379 branches
of  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) , the nation’s third-biggest
lender by market value. The move expands a trial that previously
lowered requirements for 563 branches in eight provinces and
means a total of 23 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) has been freed
up, the People’s Bank of China said yesterday.  First Tractor climbed 7.6 percent to HK$7.93 in Hong Kong.
 China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) , the nation’s first privately owned
bank, advanced 1 percent HK$7.21. Samsung Electronics gained 1.3
percent to 1.258 million won in Seoul.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent
today. The gauge slid 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday on
concern the best first quarter since 1998 has outpaced economic
prospects. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told
Congress that higher energy prices may weaken the  U.S. economy 
by sapping  consumer spending .  Exporters Advance  Exporters gained as sales of previously owned U.S. houses
held in February near an almost two-year high, adding to
evidence the market that triggered the recession is firming. A
report yesterday showed purchases of previously owned homes
dropped 0.9 percent to a 4.59 million annual rate from a revised
4.63 million pace in January.  Honda Motor increased 1.7 percent to 3,275 yen in Tokyo.
Nintendo Co., the maker of Wii game consoles, climbed 3.4
percent to 13,020 yen.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the building
materials supplier that counts the U.S. as its biggest market,
added 1.2 percent to A$7.71.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 11 percent this year
through yesterday as signs the U.S. economy is improving boosted
confidence in the outlook for Asia’s exporters. The rally
boosted the value of stocks on the gauge to 14.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Pegatron Jumps  Pegatron Corp. (4938)  jumped 7 percent to NT$45.40, the most on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, as brokerages from Yuanta Financial
Holding Co. to Nomura Holdings Inc. raised their stock estimates
after the company posted fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Of the 612 companies on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  that
 reported net income  since Jan. 9, 56 percent missed analysts’
estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Agricultural Bank of China slipped 1.1 percent to HK$3.52,
erasing gains of as much as 2 percent, before the release of its
full-year results. After market close, the lender said 2011
profit rose 29 percent to 121.9 billion yuan. That fell short of
the 129.6 billion-yuan average estimate of 20 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
