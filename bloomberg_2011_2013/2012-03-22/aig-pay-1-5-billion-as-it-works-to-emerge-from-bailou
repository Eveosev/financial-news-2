American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
paid the U.S. Treasury Department $1.5 billion to retire
obligations related to its 2008 taxpayer bailout and simplify
the government’s ties to the insurer.  AIG, which sold more than $50 billion in assets after its
2008 rescue, has now repaid the Treasury’s preferred-equity
investment, the department said today in a statement. That
leaves the government with a 70 percent  stake  in the insurer’s
common stock. The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  is still owed
about $9 billion from buying mortgage-linked assets.  “It’s going to reduce the complexity of the balance sheet,
both with the relationship with the government as well as reduce
the complexity of the company in general,” Paul Newsome, an
analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in a phone
interview before today’s announcement. “That’s important if
you’re an investor and it’s important if you’re a taxpayer.”  The payment eliminated Treasury’s preferred shares in a
facility created in December 2009 to reduce AIG’s debt to the
 Federal Reserve . Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 67,
is seeking to replace government funds by attracting private
investors as a rebounding economy and  climbing stock markets 
help companies unwind their bailouts.  Investors rewarded the New York-based firm with its lowest
borrowing costs in more than four years when it issued $2
billion in  debt  this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
