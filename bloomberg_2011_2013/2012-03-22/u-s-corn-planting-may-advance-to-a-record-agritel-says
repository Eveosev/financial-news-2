Corn planting in the U.S. may climb
to a record of more than 95 million acres, according to Michel Portier, the head of Paris-based farm adviser Agritel.  Unusually warm weather in the Midwest may tempt farmers to
start planting corn more than three weeks ahead of schedule,
Portier wrote today in an e-mailed comment.  Early planting could be considered favorable for the crops
because it generally results in earlier and bigger harvests,
according to Portier. The downside is the risk of late frosts
that may damage corn, he said.  “In the case of late freezing in the month of April or
May, which is not uncommon, the over-developed plant then could
suffer from major damage,” Portier wrote.  A “satisfactory” harvest on the increased planted area
may double U.S. corn stockpiles at the end of the 2012-13
season, according to Agritel’s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
