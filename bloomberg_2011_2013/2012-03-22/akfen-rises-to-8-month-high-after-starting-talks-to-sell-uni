Akfen Holding AS (AKFEN) , a Turkish group
active in construction, energy and tourism, jumped to the
highest level in almost eight months after saying it started
talks to sell a stake in its hydropower unit.  Akfen rose 5.1 percent to 10.32 liras at the close in
Istanbul, erasing earlier losses and reaching the strongest
level since July.  The company started talks with Aquila Hydropower Invest
Investitions GmbH & Co. to sell a stake in Akfenhes Yatirimlari
& Enerji Uretim AS after the German company made a bid, Akfen
said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
