The government of Ontario said
today that it will reduce premium rates for solar and wind power
in a two-year review of a program with 4.6 gigawatts of
contracts.  Canada’s most populous province will cut rates for feed-in
tariffs, or FITs, for solar power by 20 percent and 15 percent
for wind and annually review prices each November for the
following year, it said in  statement . Prices for hydropower,
biogas, biomass and landfill gas will remain unchanged.  The  review  will improve the viability of the program,
Ontario said. The province says it’s on track to attract $27
billion in private investment and reach 10.7 gigawatts of non-
hydro renewable energy capacity by 2015. Ontario will also
streamline regulatory approvals for new projects, including
projects now moving through the environmental approval process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
