Pozen Inc. (POZN) , a developer of migraine
treatments, rose the most in four months after the company’s
drug to prevent  heart disease  in patients at risk of aspirin-
associated gastric ulcers met the goals of two studies.  Pozen climbed 8.8 percent to $5.22 at the close of New York
trading, the biggest jump since Nov. 30. The drug developed by
Pozen, based in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , is a combination of
omeprazole, which is used to treat ulcers and acid reflux, and
delayed-release aspirin.  The medicine, known as PA32540, revealed significant
reduction in gastric ulcers in patients compared with those who
used 325 milligrams of aspirin over six months, Pozen said in a
statement today. The results from the late-stage studies will
enable the company to apply for U.S. regulatory approval in the
third quarter as planned, the company said.  Pozen is “encouraged by the strength of the data,” Chief
Executive Officer John Plachetka said in the statement. The
results will help with the progress of “partnership
discussions,” he said.  The trials also showed a reduction in lesions on the lining
of the stomach and that side effects were consistent with those
known to exist with aspirin and omeprazole, Pozen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
