Amadou Toumani Toure, the leader of
 Mali  who the army claims to have ousted, left the presidential
palace in Bamako, the capital, and sought refuge in the U.S.
Embassy in the city, according to La Lettre du Continent.  Toure left the palace in the night, the Paris-based
publication said on its website, without saying how it got the
information. No one answered the phone at the U.S. Embassy in
Bamako.  Bamako-based Journal du Mali said Toure had been taken to a
military camp, without saying how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
