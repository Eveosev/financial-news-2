China ’s government will undertake
more policy easing and growth of 8 percent is likely for the
nation’s economy, according to Andrew Garthwaite, global equity
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.  “For now we go with the consensus view that China will
ease and growth will end up somewhere around 8 percent,”
Garthwaite told reporters in Hong Kong today, without giving a
specific timeline.  Garthwaite said he is underweight Chinese mining stocks and
favors luxury brands such as Swatch Group AG, Nike Inc. and
 Adidas AG. (ADS)   Premier Wen Jiabao announced at the beginning of a national
lawmakers’ congress on March 5 an economic growth target of 7.5
