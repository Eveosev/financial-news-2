Beltone Financial Holding (BTFH)  advanced
to the highest in more than a month after the Egyptian
investment bank said Compass Capital will own 51 percent of its
brokerage business through an investment fund.  The shares rose 2.9 percent to 13.7 Egyptian pounds, poised
for the highest close since Feb. 8, at 1:37 p.m. in Cairo. The
share have risen 4.1 percent this week. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  fell 0.5 percent.  Beltone, which had announced plans to sell its brokerage,
said the value of the agreement with Compass, an Egyptian
 investment company , is 45 million pounds ($7.5 million.) The
deal is subject to regulatory approval, it said in an e-mailed
statement after the market closed yesterday. The brokerage
“will remain under the umbrella of Beltone Financial Holding,”
it said.  Beltone was ranked fourth by traded value in  Egypt  last
year, according to data on the Egyptian Exchange website. The
EGX 30 Index, which tumbled 49 percent in 2011 after the
country’s popular uprising, has gained 41 percent this year,
making it the world’s second-best performer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
