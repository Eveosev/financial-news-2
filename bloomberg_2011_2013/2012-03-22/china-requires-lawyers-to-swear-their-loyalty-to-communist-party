China’s  Ministry of Justice  ordered
lawyers who have just obtained or renewed a legal license to
take an oath declaring their support for the leadership of the
ruling Chinese Communist Party.  The ministry said lawyers are required to take such an oath
within three months of receiving their certificates, according
to a  statement  posted on the ministry’s website yesterday.  Lawyers are also ordered to “strive for the cause of
socialism,” according to the oath. The move takes place amid a
push by the party to maintain its control across different
sections of society.  The party needs to “resolutely oppose all erroneous
political tendencies contrary to the party’s basic line,” Vice
President  Xi Jinping  said in a March 1 speech.  The oath “fully reflects the new requirements from the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council,” the ministry said in
the statement, without elaborating.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
