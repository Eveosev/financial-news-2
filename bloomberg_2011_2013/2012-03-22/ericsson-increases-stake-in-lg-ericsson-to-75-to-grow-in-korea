Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest
maker of wireless networks, increased its stake in a venture
with  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  to 75 percent to expand its presence in
 South Korea .  Ericsson boosted its share in Seoul-based LG-Ericsson from
50 percent, the Stockholm-based manufacturer said in a statement
today, without disclosing financial details. Ericsson bought
 Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ) ’s share of  LG-Nortel Co. (LGJVZ)  in 2010 for $242
million in cash.  Ericsson had “basically no market share” in the mobile
industry in South Korea,  Asia ’s third-largest market for
wireless investments, before entering the partnership, Chief
Executive Officer Hans Vestberg said last year. The Swedish
company entered in time to gain contracts for so-called fourth-
generation networks with all three major Korean operators,
including the LG U+ brand controlled by Seoul-based partner LG.  “Korea is one of the top telecom markets globally so it’s
a good market to be in,” said Haakan Wranne, a Stockholm-based
analyst at Swedbank Markets. “It makes sense that they would
strengthen their position, and now they will give back a little
less in minorities to LG.”  Ericsson rose 0.5 percent to 67.5 kronor as of 10:20 a.m.
in  Stockholm . The additional stake will probably add less than 1
percent to earnings per share, Wranne said.  “We are very happy with the investment and our position in
the Korean market, and that’s the rationale for increasing the
stake,” Tobias Gyhlenius, an Ericsson spokesman, said by
telephone. He declined to discuss the purchase price.  The carrying value of Ericsson’s 50 percent stake in the
partnership was 1.94 billion kronor ($289.9 million) at the end
of 2011, according to the Swedish company’s  annual report .  The venture, which has 1,300 employees, sells Ericsson
products and services in South Korea. About 700 of them work on
research and development of third-generation and fourth-
generation wireless technology, Gyhlenius said.  Revenue for LG-Ericsson was about $1.3 billion in 2008 as
third-generation network buildouts peaked, and between $600
million and $650 million in 2009, Ericsson said in 2010. The
Swedish company doesn’t report separate figures for consolidated
businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
