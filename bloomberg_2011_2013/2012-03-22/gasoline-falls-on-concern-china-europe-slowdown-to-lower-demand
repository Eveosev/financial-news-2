Gasoline fell as U.S. fuel demand
declined and manufacturing slowed in  Europe  and  China  this
month, raising concern that global consumption may drop.  Futures sank after the Energy Department reported yesterday
that  total fuel use  over the past four weeks was 5.7 percent
below a year earlier. A gauge of European services and
manufacturing slipped more than forecast. A preliminary measure
of Chinese manufacturing was the lowest in four months,
according HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  “Now, we’re seeing signs China is starting to slow,
there’s uncertainty in Europe and we’re still not seeing an
uptick in fuel demand,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for April delivery fell 5.5 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $3.3021 a gallon at 9:43 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the third consecutive decline. Futures have surged 23
percent this year, the best performance in the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI index of 24 commodities.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries fell to 48.7 from 49.3 in February,
London-based Markit Economics said in an initial estimate today.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The preliminary 48.1 reading in a purchasing managers’
index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today is the
lowest since November.  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline deliveries to wholesalers over the past four weeks
was 7.8 percent below a year earlier, according to department
data. By that same measure,  distillate demand  was 8.5 percent
below last year.  Heating oil for April delivery fell 3.73 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.1789 a gallon, the fourth straight loss. Prices
have gained 8.3 percent this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.7
cents to $3.881 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring group. Prices have gained 18 percent
this year and are 9.4 percent higher than a year ago. Gasoline
peaked in 2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
