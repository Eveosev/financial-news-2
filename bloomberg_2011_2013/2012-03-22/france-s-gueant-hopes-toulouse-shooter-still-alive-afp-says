French Interior Minister Claude
Gueant said today that he hopes that Mohammed Merah, the man
suspected of killing seven people and now holed up in a Toulouse
apartment, is still alive.  Gueant said he was surprised that Merah had shown no
apparent reaction to a series of explosions during the night,
AFP said, citing comments made by Gueant on RTL radio station.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
