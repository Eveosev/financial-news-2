California (STOCA1) , the most indebted U.S.
state, took orders for 25 percent of $939.8 million of bonds it
is offering this week to finance prison hospital and court
construction, according to the Treasurerâ€™s office.  Individual investors ordered $238.8 million of the lease-
revenue bonds issued by the State Public Works Board during the
first day of the sale today, according to the statement from
Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  Preliminary yields quoted to prospective buyers included
1.11 percent for a two-year maturity; 2.22 percent for a five-
year security; 3.83 percent for one coming due in 10 years, and
4.72 percent for a 20-year bond, according to the statement.  Sales to individuals will continue tomorrow, when the
offering will conclude after institutions will have a chance to
place orders. Final prices will be set after the sale has ended.  To contact the reporters on this story:
