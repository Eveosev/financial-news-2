Sellers of credit-default swaps on
 Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) ’s bonds will have to pay 79 percent of the
notes’ face value to settle contracts triggered by the
manufacturer’s bankruptcy filing.  The settlement was determined after dealers agreed to the
final value for Elpida bonds of 21 percent at an auction today,
according to administrators Markit Group Ltd. and Creditex Group
Inc.  The chipmaker filed for  Japan ’s biggest bankruptcy by a
manufacturer after it was cut to the lowest investment grade by
Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. The country’s last major maker
of DRAM computer-memory chips cited a stronger yen as a reason
for its failure, it said in a statement on Feb. 27, when it
filed for protection at the Tokyo District Court.  Elpida’s 0.5 percent convertible bond maturing October 2015
was at 14 yen per 100 face value today, according to prices from
Barclays Plc. The bonds have plunged from 74 on Feb. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
