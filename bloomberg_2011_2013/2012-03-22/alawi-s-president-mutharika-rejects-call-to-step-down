Malawi President Bingu wa Mutharika
rejected a call from civil-society groups for him to resign or
call a referendum to gauge his popularity.  “I will continue to run this country until 2014,”
Mutharika said in a speech in Mangochi, about 220 kilometers
(137 miles) south of the commercial capital, Blantyre, broadcast
on national television today. “I will not step down because the
constitution of this country mandates me to run for a full five-
year term.”  The 78-year-old leader, whose second term ends in 2014,
said he remains popular.  The groups, including the Human Rights Consultative
Committee, want Mutharika to step down as the southern African
nation faces a political and economic crisis after some donors
withheld aid last year over a crackdown by the government
against protesters. Demonstrators demanded changes to economic
policy to end fuel and foreign-currency shortages. The groups
made the call after a two-day conference last week.  They also called on the government to weaken the kwacha.
Malawi,  Africa ’s second-biggest tea producer, devalued the
currency by 10 percent on Aug. 8. It strengthened 0.1 percent to
166.80 against the dollar at 1:45 p.m. in Lusaka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
