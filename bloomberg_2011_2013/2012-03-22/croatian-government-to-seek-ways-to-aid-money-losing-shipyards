Croatia  will discuss ways to save
state-owned shipyards in Rijeka and Trogir after it rejected
offers by Zagreb-based  Jadranska Ulaganja d.d.  to buy the state-
owned plants.  The government also accepted an offer by Samobor, Croatia-
based  DIV d.o.o.  to buy the shipyard in Split, on Croatia’s
Adriatic coast, for the price of 1 kuna. DIV will need to invest
2 billion kuna ($349 million) in the next five years, according
to documents handed out to reporters before the government
session in Zagreb today.  The sale of money-losing shipyards was a key requirement
for Croatia to conclude the negotiations with the European Union
in June. The Adriatic Sea nation is set to join the bloc in July
2013.  The government is seeking “solutions” within 90 days from
the  Economy Ministry  for the shipyards in Rijeka and Trogir, it
said today. It will also start bankruptcy proceedings on the
Kraljevica shipyard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
