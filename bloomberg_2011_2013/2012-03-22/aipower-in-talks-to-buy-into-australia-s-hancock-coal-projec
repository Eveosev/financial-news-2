Taiwan Power Co., the island’s
state-run utility, is in talks to invest in a mine in  Australia 
being developed by Hancock Coal, owned by  India ’s GVK Group and
Hancock Prospecting Pty, to help secure supplies of the fuel.  The talks are at an initial stage, Roger Lee, spokesman of
the Taipei-based company, said today by phone, without giving
details.  Taiwan imports all the coal it requires. The fuel accounted
for about 40 percent of the island’s electricity output last
year, according to Lee. A deal with Hancock would be the
utility’s second investment in a coal mine, after it acquired a
10 percent stake in the Bengalla mine in the Hunter Valley
region of New South Wales, he said.  Paul Mulder, head of GVK Group and Hancock Prospecting’s
Hancock Coal unit, couldn’t be reached on his mobile phone for
comment.  Taiwan  Power, known as Taipower, is the island’s monopoly
grid operator and biggest electricity producer. It buys about 27
million metric tons of coal a year, according to Lee.  To contact the reporter on the story:
