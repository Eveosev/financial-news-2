SGL Carbon SE (SGL) , the German maker of
carbon materials that  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  (BMW) and  Volkswagen
AG (VOW)  (VOW) own stakes in, scaled back its forecast after predicting its
rotor-blades materials unit will remain unprofitable.  It’s currently “difficult to assess´´ whether the company
will reach a target of generating earnings before interest and
taxes of at least 12 percent by the end of the year, Wiesbaden,
Germany-based SGL Carbon in a  statement  today. Sales and
earnings will improve both this year and next, and the margin
target will be reached in 2013, it said.  Last year was the year ‘‘in which carbon -- our material --
achieved significant public awareness,’’ Chief Executive Officer
Robert Koehler said in the statement. ‘‘We fully intend to
benefit from this trend in the coming years.’’  Narrowing losses at the division that makes materials for
rotor blades may not be enough to help the company’s carbon-
fibers business generate a profit, SGL Carbon said.  The company will buy an 86 percent stake in Fisipe-Fibras
Sinteticas de Portugal SA, a maker of synthetic fibers, for
about 25 million euros ($33 million) to get access to more raw
materials for carbon fibers, SGL said today in a separate
 statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
