Japan  didn’t buy any of the 1.5
billion euros ($1.98 billion) of 20-year bonds sold for the
first time by the European Financial Stability Facility this
week, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said in Tokyo.  The government instead bought five-year bonds and six-month
bills, according to the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because of the ministry’s policy.  The 440 billion-euro EFSF is helping to finance a second
rescue of  Greece  and smaller aid programs for Ireland and
 Portugal  as part of efforts to stem a sovereign-debt crisis that
has threatened the European single currency.  Japan purchased 320 million euros of five-year bonds and 90
million euros of six-month bills, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
