The naira weakened for the first
time in four days as demand for dollars from oil importers and
businesses outweighed supply.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.1
percent to 157.5975 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of
12:20 p.m. in Lagos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Dollar demand has deepened from oil importers and
commercial businesses making imports for the Christian Easter
celebrations due early next month,” Sewa Wusu, currency analyst
at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone.  Nigeria approved a tender for 3.57 million metric tons of
gasoline imports for the second quarter on March 12. Fuel
imports have been a leading source of pressure on the naira,
according to the  Central Bank of Nigeria . Africa’s most populous
country of more than 160 million people, with Muslims and
Christians almost at par, experiences higher imports of personal
and household items during religious festivities.  “Dollar supply has been boosted from inflow into fixed
income securities and supply at currency auction.”  Nigeria  sold $200 million at a foreign-currency auction
yesterday, with lenders buying the entire amount on offer, the
Abuja-based central bank said. The marginal rate, which is also
used as the prevailing exchange rate, was 156.06 naira,
unchanged from the previous sale on March 19.  Rates Unchanged  The central bank left its key  interest rate  unchanged at 12
percent for a third consecutive meeting on March 20 to curb
inflation and stabilise the naira.  Inflation (NGCPIYOY)  in the West African
country declined to 11.9 percent in February from 12.6 percent a
month earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said March 19.  The yield on Nigeria’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 fell 0.01 percent to 5.537 percent. Borrowing costs of
domestic bonds due 2015 rose one basis point to 15.46 percent,
according to prices on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a second day, down less than 0.1
percent to 1.7775 per dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
