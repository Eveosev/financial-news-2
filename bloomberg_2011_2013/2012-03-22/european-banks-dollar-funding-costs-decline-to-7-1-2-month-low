The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for the fourth day to the lowest in 7 1/2
months, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 53 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 11:30 a.m. in
London, from minus 54 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the cheapest cost since Aug. 1.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 43 basis
points less than Euribor, the cheapest since Aug. 5. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, is 46 basis
points, the lowest since Aug. 3. The measure has declined from
95 basis points at the start of the year.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 755 billion euros ($994
billion) with the ECB from 769 billion euros on March 20.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.817 percent from 0.824 percent.
One-week Euribor rose to 0.320 percent from 0.316 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
