U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
strengthened as the spread between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent crudes widened.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on May futures contracts,
widened by 85 cents to $17.78 a barrel at 2:27 p.m. in  New York .
When Brent increases versus WTI, it boosts the value of low-
sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium to WTI widened 35 cents to
$23.10 a barrel over the U.S. benchmark at 1:54 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana
Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium gained 30 cents to $22.45 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium was unchanged at $20 a barrel over
WTI and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  increased 75 cents to a premium of $15.75.
Poseidon’s premium added 75 cents to $14.45, while Southern
Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $15.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 25 cents to $6.25 a
barrel below WTI.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount was unchanged at $30 a
barrel. Bakken oil was unchanged at $15.50 a barrel under WTI,
