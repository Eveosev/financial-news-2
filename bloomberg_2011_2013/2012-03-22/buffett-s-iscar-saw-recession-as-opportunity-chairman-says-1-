Eitan Wertheimer, chairman of
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s Iscar Metalworking Cos., called the
global recession “an opportunity” for his company.  Iscar, an Israeli manufacturer of precision cutting tools,
didn’t lay off employees and hired away workers from
competitors, Wertheimer said today at a session on Israel
investment strategies at the Bloomberg Link Sovereign Debt
Conference in Frankfurt. He emphasized the research and
development abilities of Israeli staff.  Iscar, based in Tefen, northern Israel, makes cutting gear
for industries ranging from aerospace to auto manufacturing, for
clients including Toyota Motor Corp. Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire (BRK/B) 
paid $4 billion in 2006 for an 80 percent stake in Iscar, which
has more than 10,000 employees around the world.  “Warren in his first visit in  Israel  said: ‘I came to the
Mideast looking for talent and I stopped in Israel,’”
Wertheimer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
