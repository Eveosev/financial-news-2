Germany  may propose letting the
euro area’s temporary and permanent financial backstops run
alongside each other, Die Welt said, citing euro-region
officials it didn’t identify.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government is working on a
proposal that may call for leveraging with structured financial
products the roughly 240 billion euros ($318 billion) remaining
in the European Financial Stability Facility, the temporary
rescue fund, the Berlin-based newspaper reported. Nothing is
decided yet, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
