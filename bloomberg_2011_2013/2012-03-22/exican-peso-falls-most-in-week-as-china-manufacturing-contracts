Mexico ’s peso slipped to the
weakest level against the dollar in two weeks after
manufacturing slowed in China and Europe, damping demand for
higher-yield emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.8 percent to 12.8122 per  U.S. dollar  at 3
p.m. in Mexico City, and earlier dropped to 12.8656, the lowest
since March 8. It’s strengthened 8.8 percent this year, the most
among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  A gauge of European manufacturing fell to 47.7 in March
from 49 in February, according to London-based Markit Economics.
A preliminary measure of Chinese manufacturing slipped to 48.1
in March, the lowest level in four months, based on figures from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  Evidence of an economic slowdown in  China  and Europe’s debt
crisis “have obviously created risk aversion in the market,”
Aryam Vazquez, an emerging-markets economist at  Wells Fargo &
Co . in New York, said today in a telephone interview. “The peso
is going to get hit during these times.”  The yield on peso bonds due in 2024 fell four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.52 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.35 centavo to 129.95
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
