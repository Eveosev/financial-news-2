The Paris appeals court overturned
charges against Philippe Courroye, prosecutor for the Paris
suburb of Nanterre, and his deputy, Marie-Christine Daubigney,
 Agence France-Presse  said today, citing the ruling.  Courroye and Daubigney had been placed under investigation
to determine whether they over-reached in trying to determine
the source of leaks to the press about their investigations
related to France’s richest woman,  L’Oreal SA (OR)  heiress Liliane
Bettencourt, AFP said.  The court found that investigators couldn’t pursue a case
against them as another court had already voided Courroye’s
investigation, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
