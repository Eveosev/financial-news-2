Hungary’s benchmark BUX stock index
fell 0.6 percent to 18,940.55 as of the close in Budapest.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL)  , Hungary’s former phone
monopoly, rose as the European Commission said it will sue the
government over its refusal to abolish a special tax on
telecommunications companies. The shares added as much as 0.7
percent and last traded 0.2 percent higher at 570 forint.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, dropped
1.7 percent to 3,824 forint. Purchasing manager indexes in
Germany, the euro area and China indicated weakening in
manufacturing, fueling bets of a global economic slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
