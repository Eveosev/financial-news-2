OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, is seeking opportunities to join a U.S. project
to liquefy the fuel for shipment by tanker.  Gazprom Global LNG is participating in tenders for fuel
shipments as U.S. shale gas output drives down prices, allowing
import terminals to be revamped for loading and production,
according to Frederic Barnaud, the executive director of the
Moscow-based company’s unit.  Gas from shale, fine-grained sedimentary rocks that trap
the fuel, made up 23 percent of U.S. production in 2010, and is
forecast to rise to 49 percent by 2035, according to the Energy
Department. The U.S. plans to be a net exporter of LNG from
2016, with initial sales of 1.1 billion cubic feet a day
doubling after three years.  The Gazprom trading unit has a 20-year deal to handle one
million metric tons annually with Russia’s only LNG project
known as  Sakhalin Energy , Barnaud said in Gazprom’s corporate
magazine. Gazprom wants to handle deliveries of as much as 90
million tons of LNG globally by 2030, he said.  Gazprom, which depends on piping gas to  Europe  for most of
its sales, said last month it plans to grow in  Asia  and boost
its share of the LNG trade by buying cargoes, building plants
and seeking projects abroad. Liquefied natural-gas is gas turned
into a liquid and shipped by tanker.  Gazprom opened its U.S. trading unit in Houston in 2009 to
gain a foothold in the local market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
