Bulgaria is in talks with  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  about a hydrocarbon exploration block in the Black
Sea that’s the subject of a dispute with Romania,  Hotnews 
reported today, citing unidentified diplomatic sources.  Cristian Diaconescu, Romania’s foreign affairs minister,
said on March 20 there has been litigation between Romania and
Bulgaria over a 300 square-kilometer (115,800 square-mile) area
in the Black Sea since 1994, because borders aren’t exactly
delineated, the online news service said.  Romania aims to resolve the dispute through bilateral talks
with Bulgaria but will take the issue to the  International Court
of Justice  in The Hague if a solution isn’t found, Hotnews said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
