France  will avoid a recession in
the first half of 2012 as exports and  consumer spending  hold up,
national statistics office Insee said.  Gross domestic product  will show no growth in the first
quarter before expanding 0.2 percent in the following three
months, Insee said in a report today. Domestic demand, including
households and government spending, will expand 0.1 percent and
0.2 percent in the quarters, while foreign trade will neither
boost nor detract from growth, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
