Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT) , a specialist in
so-called jumbo mortgages, plans to sell securities tied to $328
million of new U.S. home loans, the second sale this year of
such bonds without government backing and only the fifth since
credit markets seized in 2008.  The offering is being managed by Barclays Plc, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Kroll Bond Rating Agency will assign
top rankings to $305 million of the debt, the New York-based
credit grader said in a “pre-sale” report released today.  “Redwood is incentivized to maintain its focus on loan
quality as it retains an interest in the securitization through
its ownership of subordinate securities,” Kroll analysts
including Glenn Costello and Eric Williamson said in the report.  Redwood issued all four of the previous  non-agency  deals
since the market collapsed as prices tumbled, foreclosures
soared and  home values  plunged, helping spark the worst
financial crisis since the 1930s. Those Redwood transactions,
which packaged $1.3 billion of loans, compare with record
issuance of about $1.2 trillion in each of 2005 and 2006.  Michael McMahon , a spokesman for  Mill Valley , California-
based Redwood, declined to comment.  In the planned deal, the underlying 30-year fixed-rate
loans have balances that average $895,998, loan-to-value ratios
of 63.5 percent and borrower credit scores that average 768 on a
scale from 300 to 850, according to Kroll. About 10 percent
allow borrowers to pay only interest for 10 years. The average
“verified” income of borrowers is about $44,000 a month.  Jumbo Mortgages  Jumbo mortgages are larger than what’s allowed in
government-supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for
single-family properties in some areas. For  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac loans with the lowest costs for borrowers with 20
percent down payments, the limits range from $417,000 in most
places to $625,500.  A “potential risk that arises from a pool of mortgages to
affluent borrowers is due to the presence of very large loans,”
Kroll said. The six largest loans in the Redwood pool are each
more than $2 million, concentrating risk. Additionally, the
“valuations of luxury homes can be complex and potentially
subject to more volatility than conventional properties.”  First Republic Bank (FRC)  originated almost half of the loans
being pooled into the securities, with the mortgage company
PrimeLending accounting for 20 percent, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
