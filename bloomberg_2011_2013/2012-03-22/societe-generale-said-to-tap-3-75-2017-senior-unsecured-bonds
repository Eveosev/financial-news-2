Societe Generale (GLE)  SA plans to tap
its 3.75 percent bonds in euros due 2017, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  The additional senior unsecured notes may be priced to
yield 155 to 160 basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap
rate, the person said. SocGen is managing the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
