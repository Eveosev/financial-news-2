Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities dropped after manufacturing contracted more
than economists forecast in the euro-area, dimming the outlook
for global economic growth and Asian exports.  American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., a Japanese
camera maker that depends on  Europe  for almost a third of its
sales, fell 1.3 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
Those of  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets about 80 percent
of its revenue overseas, lost 2 percent after the yen rose,
damping the exporter’s earnings outlook. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
Australia’s top oil producer and the world’s No. 1 miner, slid
1.8 percent in Sydney after oil and metals prices declined.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 9,935 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 10,040
in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,940 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
fell 0.7 percent today in Sydney. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
slipped 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Weak economic data will correct the markets, which had
have too confident,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “Europe’s real economy is
squeezed by the financial institutions’ credit crunch and is
expected to have negative economic growth this year.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The gauge lost 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday
as a report showing manufacturing contracted in Europe added to
pessimism about the global economic outlook after an earlier
index showed  China  manufacturing also shrank.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. stocks fell even after a report showed American
jobless claims dropped to the lowest level in four years,
reinforcing signs the labor market is picking up.  In Europe, a euro-area composite index based on a survey of
purchasing managers in both industries dropped to 48.7 from 49.3
in February, London-based Markit Economics said in an initial
estimate yesterday. Economists forecast a gain to 49.6. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The Japanese currency rose against all of its 16 most-
traded peers tracked by Bloomberg. The yen appreciated to as
high as 108.49 against the euro today in Tokyo, compared with
110.44 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. Against the
dollar,  Japan ’s currency strengthened to 82.33 from 83.39. A
stronger yen cuts the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for May delivery fell 1.8 percent to settle at
$105.35 a barrel yesterday in New York, the lowest settlement
since March 15. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for
six industrial commodities including copper and aluminum sank 2
percent, the biggest drop since March 6.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S slipped 0.8 percent to 103.85 in New York
yesterday.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 11.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 10.8 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and an 8.6 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.9 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
