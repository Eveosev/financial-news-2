Kristian Orssten, head of EMEA loan
and high-yield  capital markets  at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , said
more borrowers are asking about bilateral loans, which involve
only one lender. He made the comment at a syndicated loan
conference in London yesterday organized by Euromoney Seminars.  On the impact of increased bilateral lending:  “We are seeing more inquiries in Europe for bilaterals as
borrowers find it more difficult to get consensus among lenders
for terms and documentations in today’s market condition.  ‘‘This is an alarming sign. If it becomes a trend in the
syndicated loan market it will negatively affect transferability
and transparency.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
