Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom,
accused of orchestrating the biggest copyright infringement
conspiracy in U.S. history, was awarded access to a car and cash
for living expenses by a New Zealand court.  High Court Justice Judith Potter today ordered Dotcom will
get NZ$60,000 ($48,800) a month and use of a Mercedes Benz four-
wheel drive vehicle that was confiscated from him by
authorities. A copy of the order was e-mailed to Bloomberg News.  Dotcom, 38, was indicted in what U.S. prosecutors dubbed a
“Mega Conspiracy,” accusing his file-sharing website of
generating more than $175 million in criminal proceeds from the
exchange of pirated film, music, book and software files. He
faces as long as 20 years in prison for each of the racketeering
and money laundering charges in the indictment.  Dotcom was arrested at his Auckland residence in late
January and spent four weeks in jail before being released to
await an extradition hearing, currently scheduled for Aug. 20.  The expense payments come from Dotcom’s existing bank
accounts and from interest on his holdings of  government bonds ,
according to Justice Potter’s order. He must arrange insurance,
certification and garaging for the car  A business associate, Bram van der Kolk, was granted access
to NZ$9,166 a month, according to the order.  The New Zealand case is Kim Dotcom v.  United States of
America . DCNSD [25 January 2012]. District Court at North Shore
