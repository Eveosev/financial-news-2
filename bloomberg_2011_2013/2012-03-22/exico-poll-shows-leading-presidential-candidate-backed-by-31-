Mexico’s leading presidential
candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto of the once-dominant  Institutional
Revolutionary Party , has 31 percent support in the latest
opinion poll before the July vote.  Josefina Vazquez Mota of President Felipe Calderon’s
National Action Party has 23 percent support and  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , who narrowly lost to Calderon in the 2006
election, has 15 percent, Grupo Economistas Asociados-ISA said
today in its daily poll.  The survey included 1,134 people interviewed from March 19
to March 21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
