TiVo Inc. (TIVO)  said Microsoft Corp.
agreed to drop patent-infringement litigation that could have
led to a U.S. import ban on TiVo’s television set-top boxes.  TiVo said in a regulatory filing it didn’t grant patent
rights to Microsoft, and it agreed to drop counterclaims against
the Redmond, Washington-based software maker.  Microsoft filed patent-infringement complaints at the U.S.
International Trade Commission in  Washington  and in federal
court in  San Jose ,  California , after TiVo sued Microsoft client
AT&T Inc. AT&T agreed to pay TiVo at least $215 million in
January to end that dispute.  TiVo, based in Alviso, California, has asserted its patent
rights after increased competition in the market for digital-
video recording services it pioneered.  In the ITC case, a judge was scheduled to release his
findings next month, while a mirror case filed in federal court
in San Jose was on hold while the ITC matter was under way. A
second case in California, alleging infringement of additional
Microsoft patents, was put on hold while the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office took a second look at the patents.  TiVo still has pending litigation against Verizon
Communications Inc.  The cases settled are  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  v. TiVo Inc.,
10cv240, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (San Jose), Microsoft v. TiVo, 11cv2896, U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Washington (Seattle).
The ITC case is In the Matter of Set-Top Boxes, 337-761, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
