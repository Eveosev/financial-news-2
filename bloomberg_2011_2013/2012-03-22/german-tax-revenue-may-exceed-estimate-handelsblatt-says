Tax revenue in  Germany  will
probably exceed government estimates, reducing the  budget
deficit  this year by 8.8 billion euros ($11.7 billion),
 Handelsblatt  said, citing calculations by the Kiel-based  IfW
economic institute .  Rising income and property-transfer taxes spurred by
Germany’s strong economy are boosting government revenue, which
probably makes Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ’s deficit
estimate released yesterday too high, the Dusseldorf-based
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
