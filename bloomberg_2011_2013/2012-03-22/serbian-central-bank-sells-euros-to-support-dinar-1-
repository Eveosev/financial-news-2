Serbia â€™s central bank sold 40
million euros ($53 million), adding liquidity to the market and
keeping the dinar from weakening further.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it was acting
against dinar volatility even though the currency fell less than
0.1 percent on the day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The National Bank of Serbia has spent 365.5 million euros since
the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar.  Serbia holds parliamentary elections on May 6 and President
Boris Tadic said on March 2 after a meeting with the central
bank governor and the prime minister that they assured him the
dinar would stabilize.  The National Bank of Serbia pursues inflation targeting as
its monetary policy framework, relying on  interest rates  as key
policy instrument along with a floating  exchange rate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
