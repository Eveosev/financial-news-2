Malaysia’s ringgit fell toward its
weakest level in almost two months after the central bank
forecast slower economic growth.  Southeast Asia ’s third-biggest economy may expand 4 percent
to 5 percent in 2012, the monetary authority said yesterday.
That is less than the Finance Ministry’s 5 percent-to-6 percent
predicted in October, and a 5.1 percent pace in 2011.  “The lower GDP target raises the possibility of a rate
cut,” said Akira Banno, a treasury adviser at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “This will make the
ringgit less attractive to investors.”  The ringgit declined 0.1 percent to 3.0800 per dollar as of
4:00 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0890 yesterday, the weakest level since
Jan 24.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 7.70 percent.  Five-year  government bonds  rose. The yield on the 4.262
percent notes due September 2016 fell seven basis points to 3.27
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
