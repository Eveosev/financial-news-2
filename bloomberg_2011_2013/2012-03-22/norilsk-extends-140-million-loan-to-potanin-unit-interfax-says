OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s
largest producer of the metal, extended a $140 million loan to
billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s unit until the end of 2017,
Interfax said, citing unidentified people.  The Rosa Khutor Olympic ski resort under development in the
south of  Russia  by Potanin’s Interros Holding, got the loan,
which was due to mature this year, in 2006 and 2008, the news
service said.  Potanin held about 30 percent of Norilsk before its last
share buyback at the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
