Chinese equities traded in the U.S.
dropped for the third day this week, as airlines slipped on
rising fuel prices and an index indicated manufacturing in China
shrunk this month to the lowest level since November.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. declined 0.8 percent to 103.85
yesterday in  New York , while the iShares FTSE China 25 Index
exchange-traded  fund  fell to a two-month low.  China Southern
Airlines Co. (ZNH)  tumbled to the weakest level in more than five
months, and  China Eastern  Airlines Corp. slid for a seventh day,
the longest run of losses in a year.  A preliminary 48.1 reading in a Chinese purchasing
managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
released yesterday was the lowest since November with results
below 50 signaling a contraction. Manufacturing output in the
euro region, China’s biggest trading partner, also shrank more
than economists forecast this month, boosting prospects policy
makers will take further steps to sustain expansion after they
cut the growth target for the first time in eight years.  “The market is awaiting further measures from the
government, such as cuts to  interest rates , to resume its
rally,” Michael A. Gayed, the chief investment strategist in
New York at Pension Partners LLC, which advises on more than
$150 million in assets and invests in Chinese stocks through
exchange-traded funds, said by phone yesterday. “The slower
manufacturing was also reflected in the government’s lower
growth target this year.”  The China 25 Index fund, the biggest Chinese ETF in the
U.S., slumped 1.4 percent to $36.89, the lowest level since Jan.
13. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slid for a third day,
falling 0.7 percent to 1,392.78.  China Southern Plunges  American depositary receipts of China Southern sank for the
eighth day, falling 3 percent to $22.50, the weakest closing
price since Oct. 5. The ADRs, each representing 50 common
shares, traded 1 percent  below   Hong Kong  stock, the widest
discount in a week. The air carrier’s shares lost 1.9 percent to
HK$3.53 in Hong Kong, the equivalent of 45 U.S. cents.  The Guangzhou, China-based carrier,  Asia ’s biggest airline
by passenger numbers, may report profit declined in the second
half of 2011, according to analysts’  forecasts  compiled by
Bloomberg. Adjusted net income fell 27 percent in the six months
to Dec. 31 from a year ago, after increasing 50 percent in the
first half of 2011, the average estimate of three analysts
showed. The company is  scheduled  to release 2011 financial
results on March 29.  Jet Fuel Jumps  Jet fuel prices have climbed 12 percent this year, reaching
a 10-month high on March 9, while oil futures have jumped 6.7
percent. Crude for May delivery fell 1.8 percent to $105.35 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today. The contract
reached $109.77 on Feb. 24, the highest settlement since May.  The slump in airlines’ stock is caused by “a feeling that
China will have a slowdown coupled with the fear of rising
oil,” Gayed at Pension Partners said. “If economic activities
are lessening, maybe there aren’t as many flights or people in
the seats doing business deals.”  ADRs of Shanghai-based  China Eastern (CEA)  retreated 3.5 percent
to $16.93 in their seventh day of declines for the longest
losing streak since Dec. 15. The stock dropped 2.2 percent in
Hong Kong to HK$2.68, the equivalent of 35 U.S. cents, and
traded unchanged at 3.96 yuan in Shanghai trading, or 63 U.S.
cents per share. Each ADR of China Eastern represents 50 common
shares in the company.  The company is due to report 2011 results today.  Property Stocks Slide  The airline industry’s profit this year will plunge 62
percent, a bigger drop than predicted in December, as fuel
prices rise, the  International Air Transport Association  said in
a March 20 statement.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.1 percent to
2,375.77 yesterday. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  for
Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong declined for the seventh
day, the longest losing streak since June. The measure fell 0.1
percent to 10,767.  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU) , the nation’s second-largest
mobile phone company, will boost  capital spending  30 percent
this year, Chief Executive Officer Chang Xiaobing told reporters
in Hong Kong yesterday, while Chief Financial Officer Li Fushen
said profit margins “will be under pressure” in 2012 as the
company faces higher marketing and network costs.  China Unicom Discounted  China Unicom’s ADRs, each representing 10 common shares in
the company, fell 3 percent to $16.33 in New York, the weakest
level in almost a year. The ADRs traded 3.3 percent below the
company’s Hong Kong stock, the biggest  discount  in four months.
China Unicom climbed 1.7 percent to HK$13.12 in Hong Kong, or
$1.69 per share.  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a Shanghai-based provider of
property agency services, declined 4.3 percent to $5.76, the
lowest level since Feb. 1. Property data and consulting firm
 China Real Estate Information Corp. (CRIC)  slid 0.4 percent to $5.13,
while  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , a realty website, lost 1.4 percent
to a two-week low of $17.72.  New home prices fell in 27 of 70 Chinese cities last month
from a year earlier, while prices were unchanged in six others,
China’s statistics bureau said on March 18. That was the worst
performance since the government started releasing individual
data for 70 cities at the start of 2011.  Chinese social-network operators Renren Inc. and  Sina (SINA)  Corp.
can’t rely on Facebook Inc.’s initial public offering to
continue to support their shares as the companies face
challenges luring advertisers amid the nation’s slowdown and the
domination of  television advertising , according to Maxim Group
LLC.  Renren (RENN) , which completed an $855 million IPO last year,
slipped 0.4 percent to $5.30 in New York yesterday and will
decline to $4.50 over the next 12 months, Maxim analyst Echo He,
who covers Chinese Internet shares, said in an interview.  Sina (SINA) ,
owner of the Twitter-like Weibo site in  China , dropped 0.9
percent to $70.15 and will fall to $51, He said.  Beijing-based Renren is up 49 percent this year, while Sina
has climbed 35 percent, data compiled by Blomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
