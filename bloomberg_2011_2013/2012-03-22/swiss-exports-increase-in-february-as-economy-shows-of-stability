Swiss exports climbed in February,
adding to signs the economy is stabilizing.  Foreign sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings,
gained 9.2 percent from January, when they fell a revised 10.4
percent, the Federal Customs Office in Bern said in an e-mailed
statement today. Imports dropped 12.3 percent from January, when
they increased a revised 5.5 percent, and the  trade surplus 
widened to 2.68 billion Swiss francs ($2.94 billion).  Switzerland ’s economy is regaining some strength, with an
indicator of manufacturing climbing in February and investor
confidence increasing for a third month in March. The Swiss
central bank last week raised its forecast for economic growth
this year to about 1 percent from 0.5 percent.  “Looking through monthly volatility, the latest new orders
and business survey data point to a stabilization in exports in
the coming months” said  Alexander Koch , an economist at
 UniCredit Group (UCG)  in Munich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
