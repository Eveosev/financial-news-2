A potential blockbuster drug
produced by  Bayer AG (BAYN)  and  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN)  to treat
a blindness-causing eye disorder infringes a patent held by
 Genentech Inc (DNA) ., a U.K. judge ruled.  Regeneron and Bayer asked a London court to revoke a
 Genentech  European patent for the treatment of wet age-related
macular degeneration and rule their VEGF Trap-Eye product, also
known as Eylea, was valid.  Judge  Christopher Floyd  rejecting that request today in a
written judgment, saying “the patent is infringed by VEGF Trap-
Eye.”  The Eylea product, which is marketed by Regeneron in the
U.S. and in other markets by Bayer, was identified by
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer as having potential sales of
about $1 billion at a meeting with analysts earlier this month.  Doreen Schroeder, a Bayer spokeswoman, said the ruling only
applied in the U.K. and that the patent will expire in October.  “We believe that the decision by the U.K. patents court is
wrong and will seek to appeal it,” she said in an e-mailed
statement.  Regeneron said in January it expected sales of Eylea to
reach between $140 million and $160 million in 2012.  “There is no impact at all of this decision on the
commercial availability or prospects for Eylea in the U.S.,”
said Peter Dworkin, a spokesman for Tarrytown, N.Y.-based
Regeneron.  Macular degeneration, a disorder caused by abnormal blood
vessel growth behind the retina, is a leading cause of blindness
in the elderly. Genentech is a unit of Basel, Switzerland-based
 Roche Holding AG. (ROG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
