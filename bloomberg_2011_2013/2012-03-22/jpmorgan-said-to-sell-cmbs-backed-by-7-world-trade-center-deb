JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold $125
million of securities linked to developer  Larry Silverstein ’s 7
World Trade Center in New York, refinancing debt against the
building.  The commercial-mortgage bonds rated Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by  Fitch Ratings , the lowest
investment-grade rankings, priced to yield 310 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person familiar
with the offering, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t public. The refinancing also includes $452.8 million of
senior tax-exempt Liberty bonds that were not offered with
today’s transaction, the person said.  The CMBS deal comprises debt against the 52-story tower in
downtown  Manhattan  constructed in 2006, according to Moody’s.
The property is 95.2 percent leased to 28 tenants, the rating
company said in a report. The largest tenant is Moody’s,
accounting for 38.7 of the available space, according to Fitch.  The tower was built to replace a building destroyed in the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  The offering is different from more common commercial-
mortgage backed securities deals in that it is less diversified
than those that bundle loans from multiple borrowers on as many
as 100 properties.  Bank forecasts for commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2012
range from  Wells Fargo & Co .’s $25 billion to Credit Suisse
Group AG’s projection of as much as $45 billion. About $4
billion has been issued this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  CMBS Sales  Wall Street banks arranged about $28 billion of commercial-
mortgage backed securities last year, compared with $11.5
billion in 2010. Rising sales are a boon for property owners
with loans coming due. Borrowers have $51 billion of mortgages
packed into bonds maturing this year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data.  Relative yields on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds
have plunged to 181 basis points more than Treasuries, the
lowest since May, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS Aaa
Super Duper Index. That’s down from a high of 323 basis points
on Oct. 4, at the height of the European sovereign-debt crisis.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
