OAO Gazprom dropped after Russian
Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said she will oppose a
request by the country’s gas exporter for an increase in
domestic prices for the fuel by about 26 percent this fall.  Gazprom sank 2.1 percent to 181.58 rubles as of 5:52 p.m.
in Moscow, dropping for a fifth day and poised for its worst
losing streak since Nov. 24.  “We don’t support above-forecast increases for services
provided by natural monopolies,” Nabiullina told reporters in
Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
