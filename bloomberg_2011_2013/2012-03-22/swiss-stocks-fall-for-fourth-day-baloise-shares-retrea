Swiss stocks  declined for a fourth
day, their longest streak of losses this month, after reports
showed that manufacturing contracted in  China  and the euro area.  Baloise Holding AG (BALN) , Switzerland’s third-largest insurer,
tumbled the most since April 2010 after posting 2011 profit that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest
operator of offshore drilling rigs, lost 2.9 percent as its
executives were charged with environmental crimes.  Meyer Burger
Technology AG (MBTN) , the biggest maker of solar-panel manufacturing
equipment, slid 4.7 percent as full-year profit dropped.  The SMI slipped 0.6 percent to 6,249.56 at the close in
Zurich. The gauge has still  advanced 5.3 percent  this year as
the  European Central Bank  disbursed more than 1 trillion euros
($1.3 trillion) to the region’s lenders and U.S. economic
reports beat estimates. The broader Swiss Performance Index
decreased 0.8 percent today.  “The market is looking for evidence of growth,” said
 Manish Singh , the London-based head of investment at Crossbridge
Capital, which has more than $2 billion under management. “The
purchasing managers’ index numbers put the spotlight back on
growth, and Europe’s austerity measures are biting into it.
Fiscal response from governments is needed and not just monetary
response from central banks.”  The number of shares changing hands on  the SMI (SMI)  today was 11
percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  German, French Manufacturing  A  purchasing manager’s index  for Germany’s manufacturing
industry dropped to 48.1 in March from 50.2 in February. That
missed the  median economist forecast  for an increase to 51. In
France, a manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell to 47.6 from 50.  “The purchasing managers’ indices are below
expectations,” Ulrich Wortberg, an analyst at Helaba Landesbank
Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail. “It’s sad
that the indices of the manufacturing sector slipped into the
contraction area in both Germany and France. The disappointing
PMIs have contributed to a rise in  risk aversion .”  Euro-area manufacturing output  dropped more than forecast,
falling to 47.7 in March from 49 in February.  A Chinese report indicated that manufacturing in the
country will contract by the most since November. The
preliminary 48.1 reading in the purchasing managers’ index from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today compared with a
final figure of 49.6 in February. A result below 50 means that
the industry contracted.  U.S. Jobless Claims  A U.S. Labor Department report today showed that  claims for
jobless benefits  dropped to 348,000 last week, the lowest number
in four years. The  median forecast  of 46 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 350,000.  Baloise tumbled 6.6 percent to 71.05 Swiss francs after
reporting full-year  profit  that fell 86 percent to 60.8 million
francs ($66.5 million) on investment losses and a writedown on
Greek sovereign debt. That missed the 75.2 million-franc average
estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg  survey .  Stefan Schuermann, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG, cut
the stock to hold from buy.  Transocean fell 2.9 percent to 50.80 francs. Seventeen
Transocean and Chevron Corp. executives were charged with
environmental crimes for an oil leak off the coast of Brazil.
Prosecutors asked each company to pay 10 million reais ($5.5
million) and sought 1 million reais from each executive.  Meyer Burger Drops  Meyer Burger slid 4.7 percent to 14.25 francs, its lowest
price in three months. The company posted  full-year profit  that
dropped to 35.8 million francs from 97.9 million francs a year
earlier. The company also said that the “challenging market
environment” will continue in 2012.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  and  Geberit AG (GEBN)  declined 2.1 percent to 60.25
francs and 1.9 percent to 187.80 francs, respectively. A gauge
of European construction companies posted the third-worst
performance of the 19 industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600
Index (SXXP) , falling 1.9 percent.  Huber & Suhner AG (HUBN) , the world’s biggest maker of connection
cables, tumbled 9.4 percent to 44.20 francs. The company said it
will propose a  dividend  of 95 centimes per share at its next
annual general meeting, down from 1.50 francs the previous year.  Addex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (ADXN)  soared 84 percent to 11.90
francs for the largest rally since its initial public offering
in May 2007. The drugmaker said its experimental treatment for
 Parkinson’s disease  reduced symptoms and proved itself safe in a
mid-stage study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
