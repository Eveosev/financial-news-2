Boyner Buyuk Magazacilik AS (BOYNR)  fell
the most in two weeks after a court case was filed against the
Turkish department store chain.  Boyner fell 3.1 percent to 3.12 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the biggest drop since March 6.  The Tan family, which holds a 37 percent stake in Yeni
Karamursel Giyim & Ihtiyac Maddeleri Ticaret Sanayi AS, or YKM,
filed a case to challenge Boyner’s purchase of a 63 percent
stake in YKM.  The family applied to a court saying it wasn’t informed
during the sale process when other partners sold their stake to
Boyner, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The Tan family was not party to the transaction, Boyner
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
