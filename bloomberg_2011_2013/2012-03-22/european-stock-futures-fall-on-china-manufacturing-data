  European stocks  fell for a fourth
day, the longest losing streak since November, as manufacturing
contracted in China and the euro area.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , which operates three mines in
 Mali , plunged the most since 2008 after a military coup in the
West African nation.  Baloise (BALN)  Holding AG, Switzerland’s third-
largest insurer, and  Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN) , a maker of
solar-panel equipment, slid more than 4 percent in Zurich
trading after profit declined.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  retreated 1.2 percent to 265.49
at the close of trading, the lowest since March 12. The gauge
has still gained 8.6 percent this year as the  European Central
Bank  disbursed 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) to the region’s
lenders and U.S. economic data surpassed estimates.  “People have been too optimistic regarding global economic
recovery,” said Stephane Ekolo, chief European strategist at
Market Securities in London. “We will hear more and more people
saying  China  is heading for a hard landing and that the  euro
zone  isn’t finished with its problems.”  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.8 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 retreated 1.6 percent and  Germany ’s DAX declined
1.3 percent.  A preliminary measure of Chinese manufacturing fell to 48.1
this month, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.
That’s the lowest reading on the purchase managers’ index since
November and compares with a final 49.6 in February. A result
below 50 indicates a contraction.  European Economy  European services and manufacturing output contracted more
than forecast in March. A euro-area  composite index  based on a
survey of purchasing managers in both industries dropped to 48.7
from 49.3 in February, according to Markit.  In the U.S., initial jobless claims fell to 348,000 in the
week ended March 17, the fewest since February 2008, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey had forecast a decline to 350,000.  The index of leading indicators in the world’s biggest
economy rose 0.7 percent in February, following a revised 0.2
percent gain a month earlier, according to figures from the
Conference Board. The gauge of the outlook for the next three to
six months had been predicted to increased 0.6 percent,
according to economists.  Mali Coup  Randgold plunged 13 percent to 5,765 pence, the largest
decline since October 2008. A Malian army officer said the
country’s constitution has been suspended and all state
institutions dissolved because of the government’s
“incompetence.” Randgold produced about 445,600 ounces of gold
in Mali last year, about 64 percent of total output.  A gauge of basic-resources companies was the  worst
performer  among 19 industries in the Stoxx 600. Glencore
International Plc lost 3 percent to 403.5 pence, while
 ArcelorMittal (MT)  dropped 4.3 percent to 14.78 euros.   Baloise slid 6.6 percent to 71.05 Swiss francs after
saying profit dropped 86 percent last year on investment losses
and a writedown on Greek sovereign debt.  Meyer Burger declined 4.7 percent to 14.25 francs after the
company said full-year profit dropped to 35.8 million francs
from 97.9 million francs a year earlier.  Amec Plc (AMEC)  lost 3 percent to 1,109 pence after JPMorgan Chase
& Co. reduced its recommendation on the oil and gas engineering
company to neutral, the equivalent of hold, from overweight.  Bank of Ireland  Bank of Ireland Plc slid 7.4 percent to 12.6 euro cents,
the largest drop in three months, as Citigroup Inc. began
coverage of the shares with a sell recommendation.  Ireland’s economy unexpectedly contracted in the fourth
quarter, pushing the nation back into recession. Gross domestic
product fell 0.2 percent from the third quarter, when it slipped
1.1 percent instead of a previously reported 1.9 percent, the
 Central Statistics Office  said in Dublin today.  Hermes International SCA (RMS)  rose 2.3 percent to 249.80 euros
after the French maker of Kelly bags and silk scarves posted
earnings that exceeded analyst projections and offered a bonus
dividend to shareholders.  Lanxess AG (LXS) , the German chemical maker spun off from Bayer
AG in 2005, jumped 8.5 percent to 61.05 euros, the largest gain
since November 2009, after reporting fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates on higher demand from Brazil and China.  SGL Carbon SE (SGL)  climbed 7.8 percent to 36.25 euros after the
German maker of carbon materials reported net income jumped 40
percent in 2011 and said it will resume dividend payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
