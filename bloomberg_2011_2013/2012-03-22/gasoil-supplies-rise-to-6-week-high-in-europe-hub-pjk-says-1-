Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage rose to the highest in six weeks in  Europe ’s Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub, according to PJK
International BV.  Gasoil inventories increased 13 percent to 2.77 million
metric tons in the week to today, according to PJK.  “There is a lot of product coming from  Russia , the U.S.
and  India ,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone from
Breda,  Netherlands , where the company is based. “The U.S. is
long ultra-low-sulfur diesel and a lot of refiners there are
sending material to Europe,” Kulsen said, referring to a
surplus in the U.S.  Gasoline (ARASGSLN)  stockpiles fell 3.4 percent to 627,000 tons as
companies reduced their inventories of winter-specification fuel
before the summer, he said.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
