Germany’s 2011 wheat crop remains
about 15 percent unsold, while barley and rapeseed are
“practically sold out,” according to farm-industry group
Bundesverband der Agrargewerblichen Wirtschaft e.V.  Feed makers in particular haven’t yet covered their
requirements, meaning remaining old crop can be sold “without a
problem” in coming months, the Bonn, Germany-based group wrote
in a  statement  on its website today.  The “tight” supply of international corn and soybean
markets suggests grain and oilseed prices will remain firm until
the next harvest, BVA wrote. Barley will stay in demand, and the
2012 wheat and rapeseed harvests will find buyers, according to
the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
