Seven-time All-Star third baseman
Chipper Jones said he’ll retire at the end of the 2012 Major
League Baseball season, ending a career played entirely for the
 Atlanta Braves  that included a Most Valuable Player Award and a
record streak of division titles.  Jones, 39, and the Braves have “expressed interest in
rejoining the organization in a yet-to-be-determined capacity
after 2012,” the team said in  news release  on its website.  Jones’s 18 years of major-league service with the same club
is the most of any active player in baseball, one year more than
the  New York  Yankees’  Derek Jeter  and  Mariano Rivera .  He was selected with the No. 1 pick in the 1990 major
league draft, debuting with the Braves in 1993. Having missed
the 1994 campaign because of injury, Jones has a .304 career
batting average, second all-time among switch-hitters behind
Hall of Fame member Frankie Frisch (.316), to go along with 454
home runs and 1,561 runs batted in. He’s the only switch-hitter
in major-league history to post a .300 average with more than
300 home runs.  The Braves won their division title a record 14 straight
years, omitting the strike-shortened 1994 campaign, from 1991 to
2005. Jones was the National League’s Rookie of the Year in
1995, when Atlanta won the  World Series . He was named MVP in
1999 and won an NL batting title in 2008 with a .364 average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
