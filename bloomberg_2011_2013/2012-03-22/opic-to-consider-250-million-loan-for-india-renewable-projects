The U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corp. will meet next week to consider a $250 million
loan to  Infrastructure Development Finance Co. (IDFC) , India’s second-
largest lender to power plants and roads, to finance clean-
energy projects.  OPIC’s board plans to meet on March 29 to make a decision
on the loan, Timothy Harwood, spokesman for the Washington-based
government investment agency, said in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News.  The loan would allow IDFC to finance more renewable-energy
and energy-efficiency projects that are suffering from a “large
gap” in private funding because “foreign capital has declined
and domestic capital is not adequate to meet demand,” according
to a copy of the loan proposal posted on OPIC’s website.  IDFC would have to obtain prior approval from OPIC before
funding wind farms, according to the proposal.  Mumbai-based IDFC has stopped approving new loans for coal
power projects in  India , which are facing delays and fuel-supply
risks, and is focusing on clean energy, Pradeep Singh, managing
director of its project finance unit, said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
