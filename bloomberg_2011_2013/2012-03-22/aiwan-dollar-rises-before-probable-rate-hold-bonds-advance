Taiwan ’s dollar halted a two-day
decline on speculation the central bank will keep  interest rates 
unchanged today as the economy recovers.  Government bonds 
advanced.  Eleven of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the
 discount rate  on 10-day loans will be left at 1.875 percent,
with one predicting a 25-basis point cut. Global funds bought
$15.4 million more local stocks than they sold yesterday,
bringing net purchases this month to $779 million, according to
exchange data. Export orders rose 17.6 percent in February from
a year earlier, following an 8.6 percent slump in January, the
government reported this week.  “I think the central bank will keep interest rates
unchanged as our economy is starting to stabilize,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “The
central bank won’t raise rates easily because it’s careful about
hot money inflows.”  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.574 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that
traders use to price options, dropped eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 4.5 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 fell one basis point to 1.289 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. It reached 1.30 percent on March 15, the
highest level for a benchmark 10-year note since Jan. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It looks like 1.3 percent is the psychological level at
the moment,” Wang said. “There are buyers coming in whenever
we get close to that level.”  The overnight  money-market  rate was little changed at 0.398
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
