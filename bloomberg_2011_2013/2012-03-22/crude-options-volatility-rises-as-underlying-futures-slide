Crude oil options volatility rose
as underlying futures fell the most since December after
manufacturing in Europe and  China  slowed, indicating that fuel
demand may drop.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.7 percent as of 1:28 p.m. in  New York ,
up from 24.7 percent in the previous session. The measure has
declined from 30.8 on March 6.  “Volatility is getting a little bit of a boost from the
selloff,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in New York. “The market got a little tired with
the rally and there were some bearish headlines.”  Crude for May delivery fell $2.48, or 2.3 percent, to
$104.79 a barrel at 1:27 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching $104.50. Futures have gained 6 percent
this year. Since Feb. 21, the front-month crude oil contract has
traded in a range of $103.78 to $110.55.  A preliminary measure of Chinese manufacturing was the
lowest in four months, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. The preliminary 48.1 reading is a decline from a
final 49.6 in February.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries fell to 48.7 from 49.3 in February,
London-based Markit Economics said in an initial estimate today.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
December $60 puts, with 2,362 lots changing hands as of 1:34
p.m. They rose 1 cent to 33 cents a barrel. May $90 puts, the
second-most active options, gained 4 cents to 14 cents with
2,149 lots trading.  Puts accounted for 51 percent of electronic trading volume.
