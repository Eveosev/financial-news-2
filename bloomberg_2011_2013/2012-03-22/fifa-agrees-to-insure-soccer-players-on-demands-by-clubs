Soccer’s governing body agreed to
pay for insurance for players representing their national teams
after FIFA President Sepp Blatter gave in to pressure from
 Europe ’s biggest soccer clubs.  Players including Bayern Munich’s  Arjen Robben  returned
injured from the 2010  World Cup , leading clubs to threaten not
to renew an agreement to release players for national team duty.
The pact expires in 2014.  Blatter said the insurance will be approved at next week’s
meeting of FIFA’s executive committee and likely be ratified at
the Zurich-based organization’s Congress in May. It will take
effect at the start of the European qualification phase for the
2014 World Cup in  Brazil .  “You have to take into account the best interest of the
players,” Blatter told European ruling body UEFA’s Congress in
Istanbul. “The players are the actors.”  The cost of the insurance is “tens of millions” of
dollars, Giorgio Marchetti, UEFA’s head of competitions, said in
an interview.  UEFA plans to increase compensation to clubs for players
released for national team matches. It will pay 100 million
euros ($132 million) relating to this year’s European
Championship, and 150 million euros for the 2016 tournament. It
contributed 55 million euros in 2008.  Last month, UEFA and leading European clubs agreed to a new
international match calendar proposal which features nine double
headers played over two years. The calendar is FIFA’s
responsibility, and will also be discussed by FIFA’s executive
next week, Blatter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
