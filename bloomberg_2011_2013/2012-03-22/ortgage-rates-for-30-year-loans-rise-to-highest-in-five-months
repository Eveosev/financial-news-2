Mortgage  rates  for 30-year U.S.
loans rose above 4 percent for the first time in almost five
months, increasing borrowing costs as fewer homeowners sought to
refinance.  The average rate for a 30-year mortgage increased to 4.08
percent in the week ended today, from 3.92 percent,  Freddie Mac (FMCC) 
said in a statement. The rate was the highest since Oct. 27,
when it hit 4.1 percent. The average  15-year (NMCM15US)  rate climbed to 3.3
percent from 3.16 percent, according to the McLean, Virginia-
based mortgage-finance company.  Home-loan applications in the U.S. fell for a sixth week,
reflecting the biggest slump in refinancing since November. The
 Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index declined 7.4 percent in the
period ended March 16 from the prior week, the Washington-based
trade group reported yesterday. The  refinance  index fell 9.3
percent, while the  purchase  gauge dropped 1 percent.  “The effect of the higher rates should be minimal as long
as the increases are limited,”  Sal Guatieri , a senior economist
at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, said in an interview
yesterday. “Refinancings could take a further hit but they’re
up hugely in the past year. I doubt applications for purchases
of a home would be affected much. Affordability has never been
better.”  Sales (ETSLTOTL)  of previously owned U.S. houses held close to an
almost two-year high in February, according to a report
yesterday by the National Association of Realtors. Purchases
dropped 0.9 percent to a 4.59 million annual rate from a revised
4.63 million pace in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
