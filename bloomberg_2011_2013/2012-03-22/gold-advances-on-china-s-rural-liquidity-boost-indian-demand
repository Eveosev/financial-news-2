Gold futures dropped to the lowest
since January as signs of slowing growth from  China  to Germany
sent the dollar higher, curbing demand for the precious metal.
Palladium slumped the most this year.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 raw materials fell
as much as 1.6 percent after Germany’s manufacturing and
services industries unexpectedly weakened and a report showed
China’s manufacturing may contract for a fifth straight month in
March. The dollar rose as much as 0.4 percent against a basket
of six currencies.  Weaker industrial output “in  Asia  and  Europe  lead to a
stronger dollar, and lately the dollar has been a strong driver
of gold prices,” Bernard Dahdah, a London-based analyst at
Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd., said in an e-mail.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1,642.50 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , after
touching $1,627.50, the lowest since Jan. 13. Still, prices are
up 4.8 percent this year.  Jewelers in north and east  India , the world’s biggest
bullion importer, will continue a shutdown to protest higher
taxes, leaving about half the nation’s stores closed, according
to a trade group. Jewelers held the first nationwide strike in
seven years after the government raised taxes on imports and on
non-branded jewelry last week.  “With physical demand not at full strength and waning
investor enthusiasm, the potential for further downside in gold
remains exposed,”  Leon Westgate , an analyst at Standard Bank
Plc, said in a report.  Silver futures for May delivery tumbled 2.7 percent to
$31.345 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier prices touched $31.09,
the lowest since Jan. 20.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery declined 5.5 percent to $651.05 an ounce, the
biggest fall for a most-active contract since Dec. 14. Earlier,
prices fell to $650.40, the lowest since Jan. 18. Platinum
futures for April delivery retreated 1.7 percent to $1,612.10 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
