Greece â€™s  Finance Ministry  detailed
almost 40 million euros ($53 million) of fees to be paid to
lawyers, advisers and agents hired for the largest sovereign
restructuring in history.  Payments to  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , which acted as financial adviser
to the transaction, are capped at 25 million euros, while  Cleary
Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton (1138L) , the law firm acting on the agreement,
has so far received 6.5 million euros, the ministry said in an
e-mailed statement late yesterday. As much as 4 million euros
will be paid to the closing agents on the transactions, which
the Feb. 24 public offer document for the swap identified as
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Greece used collective action clauses on March 9 to ensure
that holders of 197 billion euros of bonds take a 53.5 percent
reduction in the face value of securities in the exchange; the
cut is linked to a 130 billion-euro bailout from the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  Investors holding about 9 billion euros of bonds governed
by laws other than those of Greece have until tomorrow to decide
whether to participate in the swap.  Legislation approved by parliament yesterday also
authorizes payment of as much as 3.4 million euros to the
Institute of International Finance, which represented creditors
in the debt-swap negotiations, to cover legal fees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
