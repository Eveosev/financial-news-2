The  International Energy Agency 
isn’t planning a coordinated release of emergency oil stockpiles
among its 28 member nations, the agency’s chief said.  It is premature to speculate about “unconfirmed rumors”
regarding individual inventory releases by member countries,
Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven said today in an e-
mailed statement during an official visit to New Delhi. The
Paris-based IEA advises oil-consumer nations including the U.S.,
Japan, U.K. and Germany on energy policy.  “The IEA was created to respond to serious physical supply
disruptions,” Van der Hoeven said. “As no specific supply
disruption is currently underway, we are not planning any
coordinated actions at the present time.”  IEA nations are required to store enough oil to cover 90
days of imports, and no member countries have consulted the IEA
about using their individual stockpiles, Van der Hoeven said.
The agency coordinated the release of 60 million barrels of
crude and oil products in June after Libyan output was disrupted
by the armed uprising against former leader  Muammar Qaddafi . The
IEA also made supplies available during the 1991 Persian  Gulf
War  and when Hurricane Katrina damaged oil rigs and refineries
in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005.  Brent crude  has gained 16 percent this year to about $123 a
barrel in  London , mainly on concern that a conflict involving
Iran may choke off oil exports from the Persian Gulf.  To contact the reporters on this story:
