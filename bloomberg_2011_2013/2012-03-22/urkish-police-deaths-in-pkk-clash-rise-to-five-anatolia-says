Five Turkish policemen died while
fighting the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, as security
forces carried out attacks against the group in southeastern
mountains, according to state-run Anatolia news agency.  The death toll rose by one special-operations policeman,
after initial reports of the fighting yesterday in the Cudi
Mountains of the southeastern Sirnak province, Anatolia said,
citing Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin.  The PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by
 Turkey , the U.S. and the European Union, has been fighting for
autonomy in the southeast since 1984 in a conflict that cost
more than 40,000 lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
