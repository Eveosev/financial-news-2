Residual-fuel (SPIVRESD)  inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 0.7 percent to the highest in 10 months, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen rose 143,000 barrels in the week
ended yesterday to 22.1 million,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the
highest since the seven days ended May 18.  Middle-distillate (SPIVMDIS)  inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene increased 943,000 barrels, or 9.2 percent, to 11.2
million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the largest gain in
five weeks.  Supplies of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate fell 22,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to 10.1
million, according to the data. Stockpiles dropped for a third
week, the longest losing streak since May.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
