AMR Corp., the parent of  American
Airlines (AMR) , has made “substantial progress” on pensions, lawyer
Harvey Miller said in court today.  American Airlines has no choice but to seek to reject union
contracts, Miller also said in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan. The company wants to reach a consensual deal with the
unions but will seek to reject the contracts unless there is
“profound change,” Miller said.  AMR is seeking $1.25 billion in annual labor-cost
reductions as part of its bankruptcy reorganization. Today’s
hearing is intended to update the judge overseeing the case on
the status of the labor negotiations.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
