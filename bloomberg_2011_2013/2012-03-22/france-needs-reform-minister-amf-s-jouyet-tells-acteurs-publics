France  needs a junior minister in
charge of financial reform, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, president of
France’s financial markets regulator, said in an interview
published today on the website of  Acteurs Publics .  Jouyet, head of the Autorite des Marches Financiers, said
the proposal by Pascal Canfin, a member of the European
Parliament, is “a very good idea that answers a real need for
coordination” and could allow France a stronger voice in
negotiations with other countries, according to Acteurs Publics,
a monthly magazine.  Such a post would be under the Finance Minister, whose
agenda is too full to allow adequate focus on the issue, Jouyet
told Acteurs Publics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
