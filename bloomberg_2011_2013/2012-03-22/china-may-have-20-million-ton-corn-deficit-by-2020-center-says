Corn demand in  China , the second-
biggest consumer, may outstrip domestic production by as much as
20 million metric tons by 2020, boosting imports, a government
policy researcher said.  The use of corn to produce biochemical products is growing
rapidly and may make China a “large corn importer” so as to
meet demand, according to Cheng Guoqiang, deputy director of the
Development Research Center of the State Council.  China’s increased reliance on imported corn may help drive
up food prices and spur investment in agriculture. Imports in
the 2012-2013 marketing year beginning Oct. 1 may rise to 8.9
million tons from estimated 6.6 million tons this year, Shanghai
JC Intelligence Co. said March 19.  “With food demand set to rise irrespective of prices,
insufficient corn supply will become routine,” Cheng said in
slides prepared for a conference in Boao today. Bumper domestic
harvests won’t ease the supply deficit, he said.  Rising domestic corn prices will prompt farmers to switch
to corn while cutting planting of soybeans and cotton, Cheng
said. Annual corn demand for industrial use has increased to 45
million tons to 50 million tons from 38 million tons in 2008, he
said in the slides.  Imports by China may reach 20 million tons by 2020 on the
basis of domestic yields of 5.68 tons per hectare, Fan Zhenyu,
deputy general manager at the corn division of COFCO Corp., said
this month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
