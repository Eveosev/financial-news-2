Investors should sell the dollar
against the yen, betting the U.S. currency will weaken about 4.5
percent to 79, because of a “potential reversal of recent yen-
negative factors,” according to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   “There is a substantial risk that the sharp move in the
yen will reverse at least partially in the new fiscal year,”
Goldman Sachs analysts led by London-based Thomas Stolper wrote
today in an e-mailed report. “Seasonal patterns point in that
direction. The surprise improvement in the February trade
balance in  Japan  supports our view and we are now also coming
very close to fiscal year-end in Japan.”  Investors should end the trade should the dollar close
above 84.50 yen, Goldman Sachs said.  The dollar weakened 1.2 percent to 82.42 yen at 4:34 p.m.
