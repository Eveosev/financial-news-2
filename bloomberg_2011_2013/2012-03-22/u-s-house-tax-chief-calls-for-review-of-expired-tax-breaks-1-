The U.S. House’s top tax writer
said he will start examining the merits of dozens of expired tax
breaks.  Representative  Dave Camp , chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said in a statement today that he will hold a
hearing, probably in April, on the breaks.  Many business tax incentives, including the research and
development tax credit, expired at the end of 2011. The
provisions include benefits for appliance manufacturers,
teachers and multinational financial-services companies.  “Far too many provisions in the  tax code  are temporary,
making it hard for employers to plan, invest and create new jobs
for American families,” Camp, a Michigan Republican, said in a
joint statement with Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio
Republican and chairman of a Ways and Means subcommittee. “We
look forward to hearing from interested parties about the merits
of these tax policies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
