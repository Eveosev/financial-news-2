U.S. cinema chains are adding 3
a.m. screenings of “The Hunger Games” tomorrow to meet demand
for tickets to the  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)  film.  “We’re adding screens every minute,” John Fithian,
president of the  National Association of Theatre Owners , said
today at a press conference in  Washington  where he discussed
2011 box-office statistics.  The film, based on a 2008 novel in which children fight to
the death on live television in a post-apocalyptic world, may
produce $120 million in ticket sales this weekend, Fithian said.
That would make it the top-grossing film opening ever in March,
he said.  A $120 million opening would edge past  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s
“Alice in Wonderland” to become the 10th-largest first weekend
of all time, according to data from researcher
Boxofficemojo.com.  “The Hunger Games” is playing on more than 10,000
screens, Fithian said, with another couple of thousand to be
added tomorrow, the film’s opening day.  Lions Gate  dropped 6.1 percent to $14.72 at 3:14 p.m. in
New York trading. The shares gained 88 percent this year before
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
