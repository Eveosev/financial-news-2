Accenture Plc (ACN) , the world’s second-
largest technology-consulting company, raised its full-year
earnings forecast as customers seek more advice and savings
through outsourcing.  Earnings for the year ending in August will rise to $3.82
to $3.90 a share, the company said today in a statement.
Analysts projected $3.80, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Second-quarter earnings also exceeded analysts’
projections.  Accenture, which trails only  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  in technology-consulting sales, is seeking to
boost sales by expanding outside the U.S. in markets including
Brazil, Russia,  India ,  China , Mexico and  South Korea . Client
cost-cutting efforts are driving stronger outsourcing growth,
while consulting growth moderates, Chief Executive Officer
Pierre Nanterme said on a conference call.  “There’s relentless focus on cost takeout and getting more
operationally efficient, it just really lends itself to doing
that kind of work and really helping clients get more fit,”
Chief Financial Officer Pam Craig said on the call. “There are
opportunities to use new technologies to make some of these IT
costs more variable.”  Full-year revenue will increase 10 percent to 12 percent,
Accenture said. In December, it predicted full-year earnings of
$3.76 to $3.84 a share and sales growth of 7 percent to 10
percent.  Second-quarter net income rose 28 percent to $643.9
million, or 97 cents a share, from $503 million, or 75 cents, a
year earlier. Analysts  predicted  86 cents a share.  Sales Rise  Net sales for the quarter ended Feb. 29 increased 12
percent to $6.8 billion. Revenue from consulting, the company’s
biggest unit, rose about 8 percent to $3.8 billion.  Accenture, incorporated in Dublin, rose 1.5 percent to
$64.50 at 5:10 p.m. in late trading. It fell 0.4 percent to
$63.52 at the close in  New York . The  shares  have gained 19
percent this year.  Nanterme succeeded  Bill Green  as CEO last year, after
working at Accenture for 28 years. Green remains executive
chairman. The company employs about 246,000 people and has
worked on projects including New York City’s 311 call-in service
and Marriott International Inc.’s online reservations system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
