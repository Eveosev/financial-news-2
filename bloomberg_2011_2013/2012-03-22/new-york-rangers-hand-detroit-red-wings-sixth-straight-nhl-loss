Ryan Callahan ’s overtime goal gave
the  New York Rangers  a 2-1 victory against Detroit, building
their lead in the standings and handing the Red Wings their
sixth straight loss.  The Rangers (46-20-7) have 99 points to lead the National
Hockey League’s Eastern Conference with 12 points more than the
second-seeded Boston Bruins. New York leads the Atlantic
Division by three points over the  Pittsburgh Penguins .  “I think we’re starting to get our groove back, and we’re
starting to play how we want and how we were playing earlier in
the year,” Callahan said. “It’s an important time of year, and
we’ve got to keep building and keep going.”  Henrik Zetterberg gave the  Red Wings  a 1-0 lead 3 minutes,
36 seconds into the game last night at Madison Square Garden in
New York. Brad Richards scored a power-play goal 11 minutes
later to tie the game at 1-1.  After scoreless second and third periods, Callahan gave the
Rangers the win 2:42 into overtime.  The Red Wings (44-25-5) have 93 points to hold the fourth
seed in the Western Conference, seven points behind the St.
Louis Blues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
