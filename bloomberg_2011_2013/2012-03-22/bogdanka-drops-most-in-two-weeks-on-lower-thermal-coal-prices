Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB) , a
Polish coal producer, fell the most in two weeks as thermal fuel
prices dropped.  The stock retreated as much as 2.9 percent, the most since
March 7, and traded 2.4 percent lower to 126.7 zloty at 4:23
p.m. in Warsaw.  European coal for next year declined the most in a week,
tracking crude, after a report showed euro-area manufacturing
output contracted in March. Thermal coal for 2013 delivery to
Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp dropped as much 0.5 percent to
$113.75 a metric ton, the most since March 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
