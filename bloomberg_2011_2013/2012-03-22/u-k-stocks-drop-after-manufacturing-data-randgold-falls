contract this month and as purchasing managers’ indexes in
Germany and France unexpectedly fell.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  dropped the most since Oct. 2008
after a military coup in Mali, where the company operates mines.

Central Bank  boosted lenders’ resources by about $1.3 trillion.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index slid 0.8 percent and Ireland’s
ISEQ Index slipped 1 percent.  “We’d have to look for some form of correction of between

Kong. “People have been desperately squeezed into equity
markets to meet performance.” He spoke in a Bloomberg
Television interview today with  John Dawson .  The FTSE 100 Volatility Index surged 10 percent to 17.1,
the most since March 6. The gauge has surged 17 percent this

this month, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.
That’s the lowest reading on the purchase managers’ index since
November and compares with a final 49.6 in February. A result

contracted.  Germany (PMITMGE) ’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index
dropped to 48.1 in March from 50.2. The CDAF purchasing &

events haven’t affected the company’s mines.  Fresnillo declined 6.7 percent, the most since Dec. 14, to
1,621 pence as silver prices fell. Rio Tinto Group lost 3
percent to 3,334 pence and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  retreated 2.4
percent to 1,901 pence.  Independent News & Media Plc (INM)  slid 2 percent to 24.5 euro
