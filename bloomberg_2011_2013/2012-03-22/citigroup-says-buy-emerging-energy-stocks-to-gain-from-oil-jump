Citigroup Inc. is recommending
investors buy shares of  emerging-market energy companies  to
benefit from the rising price of oil.  Geoffrey Dennis, Citigroup’s global emerging-market equity
strategist, raised his rating on the sector to overweight,
according to a research note e-mailed today. Citigroup estimates
Brent crude will average $125 a barrel in 2012. Brent for May
settlement fell 0.9 percent to $123.14 on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange today.  Russia, Colombia and Brazil will benefit from higher oil
prices because they export the fuel, while countries dependent
on imports including Taiwan,  South Korea  and the Czech Republic
will suffer, Dennis said.  Dennis estimates emerging-market stocks will gain another
15 percent this year, according to the note, and energy
companies will outperform as long as oil prices move higher. The
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of developing-country stocks has
climbed 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
