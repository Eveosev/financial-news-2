The German Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, or DIHK, called for  Chancellor Angela Merkel â€™s pay to
be raised to 500,000 euros ($660,000) to 600,000 euros,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported in a preview of a story
that will run tomorrow, citing DIHK president Hans Heinrich Driftmann.  The chief executive officer of a company with 1,000
employees often gets a salary of 500,000 euros or more a year
and someone with the responsibility of the chancellor should not
get less, the newspaper cited Driftmann as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
