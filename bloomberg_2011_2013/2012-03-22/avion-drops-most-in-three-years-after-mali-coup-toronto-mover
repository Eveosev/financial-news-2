Avion Gold Corp. (AVR) , a miner of gold
in Mali, fell the most in four months after a military coup in
the West African country.  Avion  dropped  12 percent to close at C$1.20 in Toronto, the
biggest decline since Nov. 15.  The company’s Tabakoto mine and Kofi project “are running
normally and for the most part unaffected,” John Begeman, chief
executive officer of Toronto-based Avion, said today in a
statement.  “There appears to be reasonable calm and order to a
certain extent in the country, but we do not have full details
yet,” Begeman said. “Mali has had democratic rule for 20 years
and we do not expect any change in the political orientation of
the country or its peoples.”  The Malian constitution is suspended and state institutions
have been dissolved because the government was “incompetent,”
Lieutenant Amadou Konare said in a state television broadcast in
the capital Bamako. “The regime of President Amadou Toure has
fallen,” he said.  Shares in  Avnel Gold Mining Ltd. (AVK) , which operates the Kalana
mine in Mali, fell 11 percent to 37 cents in Toronto, the most
since Nov. 8.  Mining and exploration at the site “are continuing as
normal,” Avnel Chief Executive Officer Howard Miller said in a
telephone interview. “The road from our mine to Bamako is
completely clear and open, we have no interruption in
supplies,” he said.  Mines owned by  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Randgold Resources
Ltd. (RRS)  and  Iamgold Corp. (IMG)  in Mali are also operating normally, the
companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
