Czech interest rates will be
“rather stable” this year unless “some big surprise”
appears,  The Prague Post  reported, citing central bank Governor
Miroslav Singer.  The central bank doesn’t take changes in the value-added
tax, which boosted inflation this year, into account for its
monetary policy, the newspaper cited Singer as saying in an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
