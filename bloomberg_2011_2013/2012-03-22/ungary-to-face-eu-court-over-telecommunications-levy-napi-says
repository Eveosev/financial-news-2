The European Union will refer
Hungary to the  European Court  of Justice after the government
refused to abolish a special tax on telecommunications companies
which the EU says breaches its rules,  Napi Gazdasag  reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The government said earlier that it was ready to go to
court over the tax, which brings in revenue equivalent to 0.2
percent of gross domestic product, according to the Budapest-
based newspaper.  The EU will also take Spain and  France  to court over
telecommunications taxes, Napi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
