ODesk Corp., a provider of
technology for hiring freelance workers remotely, raised $15
million in new funding and named former Expedia Inc. executive
Gregory Stanger as its finance chief.  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW) , the Baltimore-based asset
manager, led the financing, ODesk said today in a statement.
 Benchmark Capital , Globespan Capital Partners and Sigma Partners
also joined the funding round, which brought the total amount
raised by the  Redwood City , California-based startup to $44
million.  ODesk’s software is used by more than 300,000 businesses to
find, hire and pay contract workers in far-flung locations. The
nine-year-old company said today that freelancers hired through
its system are earning more than $300 million a year in total.
ODesk is using its own technology, and has 230 contractors
working remotely, three times the number of people it employs
full-time, said Chief Executive Officer Gary Swart.  “We eat our own cooking to get work done,” Swart said in
an interview. In addition to its U.S.-based software developers
and technical workers, “we have a large support team, located
in the Philippines, managed by stay-at-home moms in Texas and
Tennessee,” he said.  Stanger will be taking the chief financial officer job
after a stint as finance chief at online textbook-rental company
 Chegg Inc.  Stanger previously held the same position at online
travel site Expedia, and served on the board of  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
