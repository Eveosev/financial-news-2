United Group SA , a Luxembourg-based
holding comprising Pilsen Steel s.r.o. and  Baummash OJSC (BUMM) , may
invest in Zelezara Smederevo,  Serbia ’s sole steel mill, the
government said.  United is interested in state-owned Zelezara and may
negotiate a takeover with the state, said Milos Colic, spokesman
for Deputy Premier Jovan Krkobabic, after government officials
met with United’s owner, Igor Shamis, in Belgrade today.  Serbia wants to divest Zelezara after  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  sold
the unprofitable plant back to the government in January for $1.  To contact the reporter on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade
