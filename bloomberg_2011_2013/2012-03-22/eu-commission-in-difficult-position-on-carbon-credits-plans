The European Commission has created
a “difficult position” for itself by insisting that aviation
be included from this year in its carbon curbs program, the head
of the  International Air Transport Association  said.  “I do believe the Commission has recognized that it’s in a
bit of a fix, but like any big public issue, it’s very difficult
for them to take a position publicly until it’s worked out how
it’s going to handle it privately,” IATA head  Tony Tyler  said
at a press conference in Geneva today.  “We do all want to get out of this mess,”  he said,
adding that the 27 countries protesting the EU-imposed carbon
curbs want to negotiate an agreement on a global scale without
pressure from the Commission’s curbs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
