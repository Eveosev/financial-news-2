Investors in  government bonds  are
getting “return-free risk” and should buy equities, said Guy Spier, chief executive officer of Aquamarine Capital Management
LLC in New York.  “Forget fixed-income securities for now,” Spier said at
the Bloomberg Sovereign Debt Conference hosted by Bloomberg Link
in Frankfurt today. “Equities are always attractive because
they have unlimited upside.”  Investors with large amounts to invest, such as the
People’s Bank of China and other central banks, are forced to
buy Treasuries and the bonds of other governments because of the
lack of alternatives, he said. Smaller investors should buy
stocks, he said.  Keith Wirtz , chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset
Management Inc. in Cincinnati, said equities offer “tremendous
value.” Emerging markets and the U.S. offer better potential
returns than Europe, he said.  The European Central Bank’s 1 trillion-euro ($1.32
trillion) longer-term refinancing operations, credited with
restoring confidence in the region’s banks and sovereign debt,
have had the effect of increasing the subordination of lenders’
bondholders, said  Martin Fridson , global credit strategist at
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA in New York.  “Banks are also buying more of their domestic sovereign’s
debt,” he said. “They are becoming less diversified,
increasing systemic risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
