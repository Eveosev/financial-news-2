Portugal  will not have to follow
 Greece  in seeking private investor losses to restructure its
debt, according to Erik F. Nielsen, global chief economist at
UniCredit SpA.  While the nation may have to seek more aid, it will not
need to ask for private-sector involvement, or PSI, Nielsen said
today at the Bloomberg Sovereign Debt Conference hosted by
Bloomberg Link in Frankfurt. Growth in the euro area will be
better next year, he said.  “For the next year or two the crisis has been resolved,”
he said. Greece has become “irrelevant,” Nielsen said.  Nielsen also said he’s more bullish on the dollar than he
is bearish the euro.  The 17-nation European currency fell 0.4 percent to $1.3160
at 11:03 a.m. London time. The yield on the  Portuguese (CTPTE10Y)  bond
maturing in April 2021 fell six basis points to 12.50 percent,
dropping for the fifth consecutive day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
