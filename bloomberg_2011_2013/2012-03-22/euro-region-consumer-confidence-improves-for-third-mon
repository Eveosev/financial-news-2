Euro-area  consumer confidence ,
which is part of a broader economic-sentiment indicator,
improved for a third straight month in March as the economy
showed signs of regaining strength.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
rose to minus 19 from minus 20.3 in February, the Brussels-based
European Commission said in an initial estimate today. Thatâ€™s
the highest since August. Economists had forecast a gain to
minus 19.8, the median of 31 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey 
showed. The commission will publish its report on euro-region
economic confidence on March 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
