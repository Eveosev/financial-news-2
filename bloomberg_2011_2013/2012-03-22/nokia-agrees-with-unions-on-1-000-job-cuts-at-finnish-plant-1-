Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  agreed with unions to cut
1,000 jobs at its oldest factory in Finland, which will be
converted for software customization of handsets manufactured in
 Asia .  Most of the cuts at Salo, which were in line with the plan
announced Feb. 8, will take place by the end of June, Nokia said
in a statement. The company also plans to cut 2,300 factory-
worker jobs in Komarom, Hungary and 700 in Reynosa, Mexico as it
performs similar conversions to those plants.  The firings add to more than 10,000 job reductions Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Elop has announced since Nokia linked
up with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  a year ago to fight a loss of smartphone
market share to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Nokia is shrinking the number of main
handset assembly plants to five from  nine  at the beginning of
2011, and building a new factory in Vietnam for low-end phones.
It made the first Lumia handsets at a Compal Communications Inc.
factory in Taiwan.  “Now that we are clear on the personnel and the job
positions, the changes will start to ramp up to the new mode of
operation,” spokeswoman Eija-Riitta Huovinen said by telephone.
Nokia expects to complete the conversion in the second half, she
said.  Nokia also announced agreement on cutting 624 jobs at its
Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture with  Siemens AG (SIE)  today.
Nokia shares  declined  1.7 percent to 3.93 euros as of 2:02 p.m.
in Helsinki.  Workers whose jobs are terminated will receive five to 15
months of salary depending on their years of service, and those
who have not found jobs can get an extra two months of salary,
Huovinen said.  The Salo factory, established in 1979 and the oldest of the
production plants listed on Nokia’s website, made smartphones
for European markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
