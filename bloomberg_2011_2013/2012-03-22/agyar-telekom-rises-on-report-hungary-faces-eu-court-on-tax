Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) , Hungary’s
former phone monopoly, rose for a second time this week after
Napi Gazdasag reported the country faces a  European court  case
over its refusal to abolish a special tax on telecommunications
companies.  The shares added 0.5 percent to 572 forint by 9:19 a.m. in
Budapest.  The European Union will refer Hungary to the European Court
of Justice because of the tax which the EU says breaches its
rules, Napi Gazdasag reported today, without saying how it
obtained the information.  “If the court decided in favor of the telecommunications
companies, that would help Magyar Telekom’s stock, while leading
to higher government bond yields and a weaker forint,”  Akos Kuti , an analyst at Budapest-based broker Equilor Befektetesi
Zrt., and colleagues wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
