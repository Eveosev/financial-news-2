Novartis AG (NOVN)  sued generic-drug maker
 Actavis Group hf  in federal court in Delaware alleging
infringement of two U.S. patents for the iron-control drug
Exjade.  Novartis, based in Basel,  Switzerland , contends Actavis, of
Zug, Switzerland, is wrongly planning to market copies of Exjade
in the U.S. before the patents expire.  In reply, Actavis, with operations in Iceland and the U.S.,
has told Novartis its patents “are invalid, unenforceable” and
the generic tablets won’t infringe, according to a complaint
filed yesterday in Wilmington.  Also yesterday, a person knowledgeable about merger
negotiations said  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  is in talks to buy
Actavis for as much as 5.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion), sending
Watson shares soaring.  David Myers Jr., an Actavis spokesman, didn’t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Exjade  can be used to treat patients with chronic anemia
disorders who get blood transfusions that result in an excess of
iron, which may cause damage to the heart, liver and other
organs.  The case is Novartis v. Actavis, U.S. District Court,
District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 6,465,504; 6,596,750.  To contact the reporter on this story:
