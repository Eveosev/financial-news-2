The U.K. Financial Services
Authority increased its annual budget by 15.6 percent to 578.4
million pounds ($914 million) in its last year of operation,
citing the challenges of structural changes and implementing
European rules.  The financial watchdog, funded by the firms it regulates,
is preparing to be abolished by 2013 and replaced by two new
regulators to police banks and markets. Around 1,100 people will
move to the  Prudential Regulatory Authority  at the  Bank of
England  while the rest of the FSA’s 4,000 employees will go to
the Financial Conduct Authority.  The “authorities will be very focused on controlling
costs,” said  Hector Sants , the FSA’s outgoing chief executive
officer. The FSA will “continue to deliver effective
supervision and to support the development of the key European
policy initiative,” he said in a  statement .  The regulator increased its budget by 10 percent last year
to 501 million pounds as it started two separate business units
to mirror the creation of the Prudential Regulatory Authority
and Financial Conduct Authority in 2013.  Sants will resign at the end of June after a five-year
stint leading the FSA that encompassed the 2008 financial crisis
and its aftermath, he said in an e-mailed statement last week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
