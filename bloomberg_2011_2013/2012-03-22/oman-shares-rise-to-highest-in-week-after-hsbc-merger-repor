Oman’s benchmark stock index rose
to the highest in more than a week after a report the central
bank will discuss a possible merger between the local unit of
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Oman International Bank SAOG. (OIBB)   Oman International surged the most since October, rising
3.7 percent.  Transgulf Investment Holding Co. (TGII) , a food, packaging
and financial services company, climbed to the highest in more
than a year. The  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  advanced 0.6 percent to 5,957.76,
the highest since March 14, at the 1 p.m. close in Muscat,
taking this week’s gain to 0.1 percent. The measure has added
4.6 percent this year.  Oman’s central bank will discuss the possible merger
between Oman International and the HSBC unit on March 25, the
regulator said in an e-mailed statement after the close of
trading today. AlWatan newspaper earlier reported the plan. A
Dubai-based spokesman for HSBC, who didn’t want to be identified
because of company policy, declined to comment.  “The market is up because of the news on Oman
International Bank,” said Kanaga Sundar, head of research at
Gulf Baader Capital Markets SAOC in Muscat. Investors are
expecting the central bank to approve the merger, he said.  Oman International in January said full-year profit rose 2
percent to 18 million rials ($47 million). The bank’s shares
rose to 0.282 rial. Transgulf Investment climbed 3.6 percent to
0.086 rial, the highest level since January 2011.  The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index was little changed. Dubai’s  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.3 percent and Qatar’s QE Index advanced
0.2 percent. Bahrain’s BB All Share Index rose less than 0.1
percent. Kuwait’s measure declined 0.1 percent, while  Abu
Dhabi ’s ADX General Index fell 1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s stock
market was closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
