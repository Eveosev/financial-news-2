Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  Chief
Executive Officer Sal Iannuzzi said he’s open to selling the
company whole or in parts and that potential buyers include
private-equity firms, technology companies and large investors.  “We’re agnostic as to what type of acquirer it is,”
Iannuzzi said today in an interview. “The real issue is we know
we have value, and we know we can go around and look for
opportunities to get that.”  The online job-recruiting company was showcasing its site’s
features today in New York, following an announcement on March 1
that Monster is exploring “strategic alternatives.” The
company has been investing in search technology and  emerging
markets , trying to rebound from the loss of market share to
 LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD)  and other sites.  Monster shares climbed 2 percent to $9.49 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The  stock  has jumped more than 30 percent since the
company first discussed strategic options, following a decline
of 66 percent in 2011.  Iannuzzi said finding an acquirer will help him give
investors value as they often ask him to explain why the stock
has declined.  “The way this particular investor said it was, ‘You’re a
terrific date, but you’re hard to love,’” Iannuzzi said.
“They’re saying we like the story, we like the ideas, but the
volatility of the stock makes it a very difficult stock to
hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
