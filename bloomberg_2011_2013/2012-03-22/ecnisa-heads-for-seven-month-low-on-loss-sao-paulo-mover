Brazilian homebuilder  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3) 
headed for a seven-week low after posting a fourth-quarter loss,
missing analysts’ estimates for a profit.  Tecnisa dropped 3.2 percent to 9.42 reais at 11:14 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the lowest since Jan.
31. It was the  worst performer  on the  BM&FBovespa Small Cap (SMLLBV) 
index, which slid 0.5 percent.  The company had a  loss  of 32.1 million reais ($17.6
million) in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday. The average estimate of three
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for an adjusted profit of 51
million reais. Contracted sales fell 48 percent to 403.8 million
reais in the quarter from a year earlier, the company said.  Tecnisa attributed the loss partly to lower revenue and a
63 million-reais revenue reversal because of an adjustment in
the budget of some developments, according to the filing.  Results “were weak,” analysts Guilherme Rocha, Daniel
Gasparete and Vanessa Quiroga at Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in
a note today. “Non-expected revenue reversion and extra
provisions coupled to management’s  poor disclosure  on the issues
may continue to keep investors away from the stock until more
clarification is shared.”  They have the equivalent of a buy recommendation for the
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
