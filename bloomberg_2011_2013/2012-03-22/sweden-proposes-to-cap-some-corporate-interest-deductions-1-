Sweden proposed new limits on
deductions companies can make on internal interest payments, in
an effort to prevent “aggressive” tax planning, Finance
Minister Anders Borg said.  The move is expected to generate 6.3 billion kronor ($930
million) in revenue, which can be used to lower other corporate
taxes by the same amount, the government said in a statement on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
