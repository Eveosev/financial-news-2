Ohio Art Co. (OART)  surged in trading
after its Etch A Sketch drawing toy became a metaphor for
Republican Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.  The thinly traded toymaker more than doubled to $9.65 after
three trades, totaling 800 shares, at the close in New York time
in the over-the-counter market.  Yesterday, Romney aide  Eric Fehrnstrom  was asked on CNN
whether he was concerned that the candidate might be forced by
Republican opponents to take extreme positions during the
primary that could alienate moderates in a race against
President  Barack Obama .  “You hit a reset button for the fall campaign,”
Fehrnstrom said. “Everything changes. It’s almost like an Etch
A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over
again.”  Romney’s rivals said it illustrates the candidate’s
tendency to vacillate on issues.  Ohio  Art, based in Bryan, Ohio, began offering the toy in
1960, and it was the company’s best-selling product until last
year. The company has 369,000 shares available to the public,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. There have been 35 trades this
year. The company’s president, Larry Killgallon, is the largest
 holder , with 26 percent. Next is his brother, Chairman William Killgallon, at 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
