New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republicâ€™s biggest producer of coking coal, declined to near its
lowest in three months on concern that a drop in manufacturing
from  China  to Europe will reduce commodity demand.  The stock slid 0.3 percent to 129.7 koruna by 3:40 p.m. in
Prague, 0.4 koruna shy of 129.3 koruna at the close two days
ago, which was the lowest since Dec. 20. NWR has retreated 4.8
percent so far this week and 18 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
