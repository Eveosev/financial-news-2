A major outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease in  Egypt  is threatening the North Africa and Middle East
regions, the  United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization 
reported on its website today.  Egypt suspects 40,222 cases of the livestock disease, and
4,658 animals have already died, the Rome-based FAO wrote,
citing official estimates.  The strain of the disease is new, meaning livestock have no
immune protection against it, according to the UN agency.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
