The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies rose 0.4 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 9 billion cubic feet in the week ended March
16 to 2.378 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for April delivery fell 5.5 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.305 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 10:24 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
