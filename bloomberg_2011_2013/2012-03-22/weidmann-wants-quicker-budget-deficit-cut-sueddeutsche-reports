Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
criticized the German government’s 2013-2016 budget plans and
said the country’s budget deficit needs to be lowered faster,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported today, citing an interview.  It’s “not very ambitious” that the structural deficit
will rise this year and that the government seeks to balance the
budget by 2016, Weidmann said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
