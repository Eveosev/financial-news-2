The probability of a woman getting
married by age 25 dropped to less than half as more Americans
opt to cohabitate with their romantic partners rather than tie
the knot, a U.S. government study shows.  The proportion of women living with men without marriage
almost quadrupled to 11 percent as of 2010 from 3 percent in
1982, according to data released today by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. For men, the proportion rose to
12 percent in 2010 from 9 percent in 2002, said Casey Copen, a
demographer at the National Center for Health Statistics.  The shift toward premarital living arrangements contributed
to the delay in first marriage for both women and men. The
recession that started in 2007 also may have played a role as
young couples avoided the commitment because of unemployment and
uncertain financial security. In 2006-2010, women and men
married for the first time at older ages than in previous years.  “In today’s economic climate, many young adults are
reluctant to pull the trigger,” said  W. Bradford Wilcox ,
director of the National Marriage Project at the  University of
Virginia  in Charlottesville, which monitors the health of
marriage. “They may be unemployed or underemployed or not know
what the future looks like. They’re hedging their bets.”  The median age at first marriage was 25.8 for women and
28.3 for men, according to the Atlanta-based CDC, which studied
12,279 women and 10,403 men 15 to 44 years of age. The
proportion of women who had never married at the time of being
interviewed rose to 38 percent in the 2006-2010 period from 34
percent in 1982.  Age-25 Marriage Drops  The probability of a woman marrying by age 25 fell to 44
percent from 59 percent in 1995.  “Despite high expectations that they will eventually
marry, young adults in the U.S. are postponing first marriage,”
the CDC said. “Cohabitation has increasingly become the first
co-residential union formed among young adults in the U.S.”  Among women, 68 percent of unions formed in 1997-2001 began
as living together rather than as marriage. For men, living
together was most common among foreign-born Hispanics at 20
percent, followed by 15 percent of U.S.-born Hispanic men.  About 10 percent of men with a bachelor’s degree were
currently cohabiting compared to 27 percent of men with less
than a high school education.  Fifty five percent of black women and 49 percent of U.S.-
born Hispanic women had never married in 2006-2010, the CDC
said. The proportion was 39 percent among Asian women and 34
percent for white women.  Education and Marriage  Those with more education were more likely to be in their
first marriage. The proportion of women currently married for
the first time was 37 percent among those without a high school
or equivalent diploma, compared with 63 percent of those with a
master’s degree or higher.  When it comes to marriages ending, the probability of a
first marriage lasting for at least 10 years was 68 percent for
women and 70 percent for men in 2006-2010, and drops to about 50
percent at 20 years.  That’s virtually the same as estimates from the early
1970s, according to the report. Marriage ends because of
divorce, separation and sometimes by death. Women and men who
lived with both biological parents at age 14 had a higher
probability of a first marriage lasting 20 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
