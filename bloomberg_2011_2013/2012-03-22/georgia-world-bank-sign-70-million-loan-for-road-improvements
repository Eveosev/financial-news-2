Georgia and the  World Bank  signed a
$70 million loan agreement to develop and improve the country’s
highways.  The project involves 225 kilometers (140 miles) of roads,
according to a statement from the  Finance Ministry  in Tbilisi
today.  World Bank commitments to Georgia since 1992 total $1.6
billion. In February, the bank described Georgia as a “unique
success” in tackling corruption, saying that reported crime
fell more than half between 2006 and 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
