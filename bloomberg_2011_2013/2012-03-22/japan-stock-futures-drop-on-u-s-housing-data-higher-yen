Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gaining the most in a week, after the
government reported higher-than-estimated exports and an
unexpected trade surplus for February. Rising crude prices
boosted energy companies.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of
its revenue overseas, climbed 1.7 percent. Inpex Corp., Japan’s
biggest energy explorer by market value, rose 1.4 percent. Fanuc
Corp., which makes industrial robotics, lost 1.2 percent after a
report that  China  manufacturing hit a four-month low. Nomura
Holdings Inc. slid 1.3 percent after the brokerage was linked to
an insider-trading case by a person familiar with the matter.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.4 percent to 10,127.08 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, its biggest advance since March 15. The broader
Topix Index gained 0.4 percent to 862.07, with almost twice as
many shares advancing as falling. Volume on the gauge was 19
percent lower than the 30-day average.  “The trade surplus was a surprise,” said  Yoshinori Nagano ,
a　senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about $104 billion. “The biggest concern was if
exports would really recover.”  The Nikkei 225 has risen 24 percent since its low in
November on signs of U.S. economic recovery, progress on
tackling Europe’s debt crisis and additional monetary easing by
the  Bank of Japan . The  bull market  has helped the benchmark
equity index nearly recoup all of its losses since last year’s
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crises.  Surprise Surplus  Japanese shipments beat estimates in February, leading to a
surprise trade surplus of 32.9 billion yen ($395 million), the
 Finance Ministry  reported today. The yen’s decline against the
dollar since the Bank of  Japan  expanded monetary stimulus last
month has made the nation’s exporters more competitive.  Honda climbed 1.7 percent to 3,275 yen. Nikon Corp., a
camera maker that gets more than 85 percent of its revenue
overseas, rose 1.1 percent to 2,440 yen. Nintendo Co., the
world’s biggest maker of gaming consoles, jumped 3.4 percent to
13,020 yen in Osaka.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge slid 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday on
concern the best first quarter since 1998 has outpaced economic
prospects.  Energy Stocks Climb  Oil-related stocks gained after the U.S. Energy Department
said  crude inventories  unexpectedly dropped 1.16 million barrels
last week. Oil for May delivery increased $1.20 to settle at
$107.27 a barrel in New York yesterday.  Inpex gained 1.4 percent to 571,000 yen. Offshore energy
contractor Japan Drilling Co. added 0.6 percent to 2,713 yen. JX
Holdings Inc., a refiner, increased 1.2 percent to 529 yen.  Japanese stocks erased gains earlier in the day after HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics published initial results from
a Chinese purchasing manager survey showing that manufacturing
activity fell to its lowest since November.  Fanuc (6954) , which counts China among its biggest markets,
dropped 1.2 percent to 15,170 yen.  V Technology Co. (7717) , a maker of
semiconductor inspection systems that gets 23 percent of its
sales from China, dropped 1 percent to 293,100 yen.  Among stocks that declined, Nomura lost 1.3 percent to 391
yen, the most active stock by value in Japan. The brokerage was
involved in an insider-trading case connected to energy explorer
Inpex’s 2010 stock offering, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc.,
which has a unit that was also involved, rose 2.2 percent after
falling 5.1 percent yesterday.  “Nomura expresses its regret, and will continue to
cooperate fully in the investigation,” the Tokyo-based
securities firm said in a  statement  on its website, without
explicitly confirming its role in the case.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in  Tokyo . Editors:  Jim
