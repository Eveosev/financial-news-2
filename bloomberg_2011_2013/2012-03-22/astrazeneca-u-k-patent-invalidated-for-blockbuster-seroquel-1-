AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  said a U.K. court
ruled that the patent on the Seroquel XR antipsychotic, the
drugmaker’s second-biggest seller, is invalid.  The decision only relates to the extended-release version
of the drug and is limited to the U.K. market, AstraZeneca said
in a statement. The ruling was in response to a legal challenge
by  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Sandoz generic unit,  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , Accord Healthcare Ltd.,  Intas Pharmaceuticals (INTAS) 
Ltd. and Hexal AG.  AstraZeneca, Britain’s second-largest drug firm behind
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , is struggling to protect sales of the
Seroquel franchise after the London-based company booked $5.8
billion of sales from the drug last year. Seroquel XR is patent
protected in the U.S., the drug’s biggest market, until 2017
while the older version loses U.S. patent protection this month.
The company says a U.S. decision on the drug’s exclusivity is
still pending.  “AstraZeneca is disappointed with the court’s decision,”
the company said in the statement. “However, the company
remains committed to defending its intellectual property.”  AstraZeneca is defending Seroquel XR patents and
exclusivity rights in “numerous” other cases, which includes a
trial decision still pending in the U.S., the company said.  In a bid to stem generic threats, the drugmaker entered
into an agreement with Handa Pharmaceuticals LLC last year that
granted the closely held company a license to sell copies of the
medicine in the U.S. starting in 2016.  AstraZeneca also sued the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration 
on March 13 in an attempt to overturn the regulator’s denial of
a request that Seroquel generics come with warnings about high
blood sugar and suicidal tendencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
