port,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 31 percent in
the week through yesterday as wheat shipments to  Africa  slipped.  Outbound grain shipments were 159,777 metric tons between
March 15 and March 21 from 231,849 tons a week earlier, the
 Seine River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Exports
included 114,100 tons of soft wheat.  Morocco was the biggest export destination, taking 85,980
tons of soft wheat and 32,898 tons of barley, the data showed.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of France’s maritime grain
