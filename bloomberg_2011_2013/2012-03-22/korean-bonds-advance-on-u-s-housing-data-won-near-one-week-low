South Korea ’s won traded near its
weakest level in two months as a preliminary survey showed
China’s manufacturing may have shrunk for a fifth month, damping
the outlook for exports.  Government bonds  were steady.  An index of factory output in the world’s second-largest
economy and South Korea’s biggest overseas market was at a four-
month low of 48.1 in March, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics reported today. A number below 50 indicates
contraction. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told
Congress yesterday that higher energy prices may weaken the  U.S.
economy  and that Europe’s financial and economic situation
“remains difficult.”  The won was little changed at 1,129.58 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,132.38
earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 20.  “The won fell in earlier trading as  China ’s manufacturing
data was below expectations,” said Han Sung Min, a currency
dealer at Busan Bank in Seoul. “It pared losses on speculation
exporters sold the dollar to convert income.”  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 13 basis points
to 8.15 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due December 2014 was
steady at 3.62 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-
year debt futures fell 0.02 percent to 103.51. The one-year
interest-rate swap declined one basis points, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 3.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
