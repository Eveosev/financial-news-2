Baloise Holding AG (BALN)  dropped the most
in almost two years in Zurich trading after full-year profit at
 Switzerland ’s third-largest insurer declined more than analysts
expected.  Net income  fell to 60.8 million Swiss francs ($67 million)
from 433.4 million francs in 2010. That missed the 75.2 million-
franc average estimate by 12  analysts   surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Baloise said on Nov. 16 that second-half profit would be
“wiped out” after declining interest rates and stock markets
led to a loss on investments. The insurer today reported
impairments on equity investments of 119 million francs and
wrote down its holdings of Greek sovereign debt by 78 million
francs, more than previously announced.  “The impairments are even higher than already announced in
November,” said Stefan Schuermann, a Zurich-based analyst with
Vontobel Holding AG who cut his rating on the stock to hold from
buy. “The market does not like this news.”  Baloise fell as much as 6.3 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since April 2010, and was down 6 percent at 71.50 francs as
of 11:01 a.m. in Zurich. That pared the stock’s gain this year
to 11 percent and cut the insurer’s market value to 3.58 billion
francs. Baloise proposed an unchanged  dividend  of 4.50 francs  “We are of course not satisfied with the level of
profit,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Strobel said on a
conference call, adding that the firm’s return-on-equity target
of 15 percent is “under review.” Baloise will publish a new
target next March and faces the future “optimistically despite
the uncertain prospects.”  Greece  pushed through the biggest sovereign restructuring
in history this month after getting private investors to forgive
more than 100 billion euros ($132 billion) of debt, opening the
way for a second bailout. Baloise also cut the valuation of a
Croatian insurer it acquired in 2007.  Baloise,  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  and other insurers may post
slower premium growth this year as the economy deteriorates,
according to the Swiss Insurance Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
