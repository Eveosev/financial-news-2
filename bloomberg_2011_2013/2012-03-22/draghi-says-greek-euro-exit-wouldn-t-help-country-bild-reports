European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said an exit by  Greece  from the euro zone and
introducing its own devalued currency wouldn’t improve the
situation in the country,  Bild  reported today, citing Draghi.  The need for reforms wouldn’t decrease and an exit would
also result in high inflation and instability while for an
incalculable period of time, no one would lend Greece money,
Draghi said, according to the newspaper. A loss of wealth is
inevitable if Greece is to improve its competitiveness, he also
told the newspaper.  Draghi objects to a transfer union within the euro-zone, in
which “one or two countries pay, the rest spend and all is
financed with joint euro bonds,” Bild cited him as saying. It’s
too early for joint euro bonds and the new fiscal pact between
euro members is therefore correct, Draghi told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
