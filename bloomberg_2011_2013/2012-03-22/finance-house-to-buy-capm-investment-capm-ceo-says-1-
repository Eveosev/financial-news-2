Finance House, a lender based in
the  United Arab Emirates , plans to acquire CAPM Investment PJSC,
said Yasser Geissah, the chief executive officer of the
unprofitable Abu Dhabi-based financial services company.  Finance House will pay close to a 10 percent premium over
the company’s cash value, Geissah said in a phone interview
today. CAPM’s  Asayel Shares & Bonds Trading LLC  was ranked 14th
by value of securities traded among 66 brokerages on the  Dubai
Financial Market (DFM)  in August. Asayel is under a permanent
cancellation process, according to the website of the Securities
& Commodities Authority, the U.A.E. market regulator.  CAPM shareholders earlier this week decided to sell the
four-year-old business, Geissah said on March 20.  Wissam Farran, group corporate communications manager at
 Finance House (FH) , declined to comment and calls to Asayel were
unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
