Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.,
the state-owned  oil company , invited bids for the sale of crude
oil for loading from June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013, the Abuja-
based company said.  “Applicant must have a minimum annual turnover of $600
million and net worth of not less than $300 million; applicants
must attach three years audited accounts,” the company also
known as NNPC said today in the e-mailed notice from Abuja, the
capital. “Payment for all cargoes shall be on the basis of
confirmed irrevocable Letter of Credit from approved local and
international banks.”  Nigeria is Africa’s top crude producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. imports. At least 90 percent of the
country’s oil is pumped by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Exxon Mobil
Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA (ENI)  in joint ventures
with the NNPC.  The tender for the sale of crude closes on April 5,
according to NNPC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
