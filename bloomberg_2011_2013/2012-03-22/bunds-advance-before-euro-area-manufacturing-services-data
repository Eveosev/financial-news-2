German  bunds  rose the most in a
month after industry data showed euro-region manufacturing and
services shrank more than economists forecast, spurring demand
for safer assets.  The securities advanced for a third day, the longest wining
run in seven weeks, after a Chinese purchasing managers’ index
also signaled manufacturing contracted in March. Spanish bonds
fell for a ninth day as signs that regional growth is slowing
sapped investor appetite for higher-yielding assets.  Germany 
boosted its target for debt sales next quarter by 3 percent to
provide funding for the euro-area’s bailout fund, the Federal
Finance Agency said.  “Bunds rallied as the PMI data disappointed,” said
Achilleas Georgolopoulos, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds
Bank Corporate Markets in London. “There were expectations that
the data would be better. The data refocused the attention to
economic growth, which is a problem for 2012.”  The yield on the 10-year bund fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 1.91 percent at 4:01 p.m. London time
after dropping eight basis points, the most since Feb. 22. The 2
percent bond due January 2022 rose 0.65, or 6.50 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,320) face amount, to 100.825. The last time bunds
gained for three days was the period ended Jan. 31.  A euro-area  composite index  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing fell to 48.7 in March
from 49.3 in February, London-based Markit Economics said. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction. A preliminary index of
 China  manufacturing from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
dropped to 48.1 from 49.6 in the previous month.  Spanish Bonds  Spanish 10-year yields climbed 10 basis points to 5.51
percent after reaching 5.53 percent, the  highest  since Feb. 16.
Italian 10-year yields rose 11 basis points to 5.11 percent.
They earlier reached 5.12 percent, the most since March 7.  Europe ’s debt crisis “is certainly not over,”  Andrew Bosomworth , Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Munich-based
head of  portfolio management  said today at a Bloomberg Sovereign
Debt Conference in Frankfurt. “The status quo is not working
and it has got to be fixed.”  Bosomworth said he won’t buy Italian or Spanish bonds until
their governments are in surplus.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish
bonds instead of similar-maturity bunds widened as much as 19
basis points to 3.61 percentage points, the most since Feb. 16.  ECB Funds  The  European Central Bank  has provided more than 1 trillion
euros in three-year loans to the region’s banks since December,
helping boost the bonds in nations such as Italy and  Spain .
Italian 10-year yields dropped from a euro-era record 7.48
percent in November to as low as 4.68 percent this month.
Benchmark Spanish yields fell from 6.78 percent to as little as
4.83 percent.  Germany will issue 68 billion euros of bonds and bills, up
from a 66 billion-euro forecast in December, the Frankfurt-based
agency said in an e-mailed statement. The country has agreed to
pay 21.5 billion euros of the 80 billion euros required for the
“paid-in” cash reserve of the 500 billion-euro European
Stability Mechanism.  German bunds have returned 11 percent over the past year as
the debt crisis increased demand for havens, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Portuguese debt dropped 16 percent
Spanish securities gained 4.8, the data show.  ‘No Value’  European and U.S. government bonds currently offer “no
value,” Daniel Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles & Co., said
at the conference in  Frankfurt  hosted by  Bloomberg Link .  The debt crisis in Europe and the U.S. is being caused by
structural deficits exacerbated by aging populations and will be
a long-term issue, he said. “There is reasonable value in some
corporate bonds,” Fuss said.  Italian 10-year bond futures may fall to a two-week low
should they stay below a key level of so-called resistance, UBS
AG said, citing trading patterns.  The contracts “are vulnerable while they trade below the
107 March 19 high,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income
technical strategy at UBS in London, wrote in a research note.
“A break below yesterday’s 105.25 will develop these themes
further, opening the door back to the 103.69 retracement
level,” he said.  The 10-year contract expiring in June dropped 0.6 percent
to 104.65. Resistance refers to an area on a graph where
technical analysts anticipate sell orders to be clustered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
