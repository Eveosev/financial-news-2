The Environmental Protection Agency
is considering a request that it waive stricter U.S. summer
pollution rules for  Pennsylvania , where idled refineries may
prompt seasonal fuel shortages.  Given rising gasoline prices, “of course we are
considering it,” Lisa Jackon, the EPA’s administrator, told
reporters today.  Jackson earlier told the U.S. Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works at a  hearing  that the EPA is in
discussions with Pennsylvania state officials following reports
of low supplies in the Pittsburgh area because of shuttered
refineries.  Pennsylvania Democratic Senator  Bob Casey  has asked Jackson
to waive the summer pollution rules for the Pittsburgh area.
Supplies of the seasonal blend of gasoline are limited and could
cause price spikes because of reduced refinery output, Casey
said in a letter to Jackson on March 16.  Regular gasoline at the pump in the eastern U.S. was $3.811
a gallon as of March 19, 7.7 percent higher than a year earlier,
Energy Department data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
