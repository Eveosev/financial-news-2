Confindustria,  Italy ’s employers’
association, named Mapei SpA Chief Executive Officer Giorgio Squinzi as its new president.  Squinzi will succeed  Emma Marcegaglia , whose term ends in
May. Confindustria represents almost 150,000 Italian companies
with more than 5.5 million workers.  Marcegaglia, 46, has spent the past two months negotiating
with Labor Minister Elsa Fornero and union leaders an overhaul
of the country’s labor market that will extend jobless benefits,
limit the use of part-time contracts and make it easier for
companies to fire workers.  Squinzi, 68, who has a degree in industrial chemistry, has
run his family’s chemical company since 1984. He also serves as
president of the European Chemical Industry Council.  Mapei is one of the world’s biggest producers of adhesives
and chemical products used in construction. The company has 59
production plants in 27 countries, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
