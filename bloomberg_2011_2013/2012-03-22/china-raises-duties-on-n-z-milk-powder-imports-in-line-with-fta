China  raised duties on whole-milk
powder imports from  New Zealand  this month in line with
provisions of the free trade agreement between the two nations.  The tariff increased to 10%, from 5.8%, China National
Radio reported today, citing Jiangxi provincial commerce
commission.  The first 115,473 metric tons of New Zealand milk powder
imported by China in 2012 were subject to the lower tariff,
instead of the usual 10 percent, Agrifax Ltd. said in a report
in January. Product exported from New Zealand in December was
eligible for the lower rate, according to the report.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
