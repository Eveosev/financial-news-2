Canadian  retail sales  rose by less
than a third of what economists forecast in January as the
biggest jump in new-car sales in three years was blunted by
declines at home-improvement and electronics stores.  Sales increased 0.5 percent to C$38.9 billion ($39.1
billion), following a revised December figure showing little
change, Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 1.8 percent increase,
based on the median of 24 projections.  “While the retail report was below consensus expectations,
that doesn’t negate the fact that Canadian consumers got off to
a decent start in 2012,” said  Krishen Rangasamy , senior
economist at National Bank Financial in  Montreal .  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  is relying on
households to contribute over half of the country’s projected 2
percent economic growth this year. The  Conference Board of
Canada  also reported today that its consumer confidence index
rose to 79.5 in March from 75.2 in the prior month, the third
straight increase.  Canada’s dollar weakened 0.7 percent to 99.89 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:15 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0011.  The retail sales gain was led by a 4.6 percent jump at new
 car dealerships  where people sought “lower-cost passenger
cars,” Statistics Canada said.  Ex-auto Sales Fall  Purchases  excluding  the motor vehicle and parts category
fell 0.5 percent. Economists had forecast a 0.5 percent
increase.  Sales rose in five of 11 categories marking 52 percent of
total sales.  Building material and garden supply sales fell the most in
dollar terms in January, dropping 5.2 percent to C$2.24 billion.
Electronics and appliance store receipts decreased 3.4 percent,
the third straight decline, and gasoline station sales declined
0.1 percent.  General merchandise stores climbed 1.7 percent in January,
led by department stores,  Statistics Canada  said. Clothing and
accessory sales rose 0.6 percent.  The volume of sales rose 0.3 percent. That measure excludes
the effects of price changes and more closely reflects the
industry’s contribution to economic growth.  December retail sales were revised to show little change
after a previously reported 0.2 percent decline.  In a separate report, the agency said the  number  of
Canadians receiving jobless benefits increased 2.3 percent to
561,060 in January, the highest level since August. From a year
earlier, the number of recipients fell 12.1 percent, or by
77,450.  To contact the reporter on this story:
