French authorities are conducting
an investigation to determine whether the dead terrorist who
admitted to murdering seven people acted alone or had
accomplices, President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said.  “An investigation is taking place to determine whether
there were accomplices,” Sarkozy said in a televised speech
today.  Mohammed Merah, the 23-year-old Frenchman of Algerian
descent who admitted to the killing of seven people, including
three children and a teacher at a Jewish school in Toulouse
earlier this week, died during a police raid today after being
holed up in his apartment for about 32 hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
