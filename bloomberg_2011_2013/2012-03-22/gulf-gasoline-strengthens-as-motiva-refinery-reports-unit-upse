Gulf gasoline strengthened after
Motiva Enterprises LLC reported a unit upset at the  Port Arthur ,
Texas, refinery.  The operational upset yesterday slowed process units,
according to a filing with the Texas Commission of Environmental
Quality. Kayla Macke, a plant spokeswoman, declined to comment.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf Coast rose 1.87 cents to 7.25 cents versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:40 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
2.45 cents to $3.3864 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor held steady at a discount
to futures of 17.5 cents.  The Port Arthur plant has a capacity of 300,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
