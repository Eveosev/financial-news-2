Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.15 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.12 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.12 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
August 2022 to February 2031 today under the Fed’s program to
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs further and
counter risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to purchase from $1.75 billion to
$2.25 billion of securities today, according to the New York
Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
