Dubai narrowed the  discount  for oil
to be loaded in June to 45 cents less than  Oman Crude Futures (OOSPOMAN) ,
after April and May cargoes were priced at the lowest
differential since the emirate began using the benchmark.  The sheikhdom, the second-largest in the  United Arab
Emirates , reduced the discount by 25 cents from the differential
set for May, according to an e-mailed statement from the
emirate’s Department of Petroleum Affairs today.  Dubai prices its oil as a premium or a discount to Oman’s
official selling price, which is determined through trading on
the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. The DME is part owned by Oman’s
sovereign wealth fund and by Chicago-based  CME Group Inc. (CME)   Dubai, which owns a stake in the DME through a government-
run investment fund, began pricing its high-sulfur crude in
relation to the Oman variety in September 2009. The DME is
seeking to establish the Oman contract as a more widely used
benchmark among Middle Eastern producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
