Lenzing AG (LNZ) , an Austrian maker of
cellulose fibers, said 2011 profit increased 62 percent and
predicted a further increase in sales and earnings this year.  Net income soared to 258.7 million euros ($341 million)
from 159.1 million euros a year earlier, according to a
statement today. That’s in line with the average  estimate  of
259.3 million euros of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales increased 21 percent to 2.14 billion euros, compared
to a 2.12 billion-euro estimate by analysts. Lenzing also is
proposing increasing its  dividend  to 2.5 euros a share from 1.55
euros last year.  Lenzing’s majority shareholder, B&C Industrieholding GmbH,
last year sold part of its stake in the fibre maker to increase
the so-called free float in the company. This allowed Lenzing to
join  Austria ’s benchmark ATX Index in September.  Shares fell 1.8 percent to 82.51 euros at 9:41 a.m. in
Vienna, reducing Lenzing’s increase this year to 29 percent.  “Once again the Lenzing Group expects a good year in 2012,
which should see quarterly development in a mirror-inverted
manner,” the company said in the statement. “However, in terms
of margins the current financial year will not be able to fully
match the exceptional record year of 2011.”  Lenzing said it sees sales of 2.2 billion euros to 2.3
billion euros for 2012, topping an average analyst estimate of
2.1 billion euros. Ebitda is seen between 400 million euros and
480 million and Ebit at between 285 million euros and 365
million euros, in line with analyst estimates of 436.6 million
euros and 311.5 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
