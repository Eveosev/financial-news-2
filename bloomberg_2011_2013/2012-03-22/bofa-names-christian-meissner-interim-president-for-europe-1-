Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, named Christian Meissner interim
president of Europe and emerging markets excluding Asia, as
Jonathan Moulds leaves amid a management shakeup.  Meissner, 42, will continue to lead global corporate and
investment banking and be based in London during the interim
period, co-Chief Operating Officer Thomas K. Montag said in a
memo to the staff today. The memo also confirmed the departure
of Andrea Orcel, the firm’s chairman of global banking and
markets.  UBS AG (UBSN)  hired Orcel, 48, as co-head of its investment bank
to help run a division rocked by key departures and last year’s
$2.3 billion loss from unauthorized trading. He will co-lead the
Zurich-based company’s investment bank alongside Carsten Kengeter, UBS said today in a statement.  “This is an opportunity for Andrea to have broader
management responsibilities, and we wish him well in his new
role,” said Jessica Oppenheim, a spokeswoman for  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based Bank of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
