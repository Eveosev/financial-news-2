Visa Inc. (V)  said China’s recent
decision to let Citigroup Inc. issue credit cards may be the
start of a broader market opening that will allow the world’s
largest payments processor to expand in the country.  Visa will keep investing in its business of processing
foreign-denominated payments in the world’s second-largest
economy, Elizabeth Buse, group president responsible for most
business outside the Americas, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today. China UnionPay Data Co. has a
monopoly on handling yuan payments.  Global payment volumes at Visa surpassed $1 trillion last
year, with 30 percent from Asia, Buse said. Volume growth in
China was more than 50 percent, she said. Citigroup last month
became the first foreign bank allowed to issue credit cards in
the world’s most populous nation.  “We hope that the license that has been granted to Citi is
just the beginning of a broader opening of that market,” said
Buse. The only thing that might “immediately” lead to a market
opening is a U.S. complaint about the monopoly at the  World
Trade Organization , she said.  Acting on the U.S.’s criticism, the WTO is investigating
China’s requirement that yuan-denominated payments be executed
through China UnionPay Data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
