Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago
President  Charles Evans  said the central bank needs to further
ease monetary policy to fuel the U.S. economic expansion.  “Clearly, more accommodation would be appropriate,” Evans
said in the text of speech today in  Washington . “At 8.3
percent, the  unemployment rate  is substantially above reasonable
measures of the natural rate.”  Evans repeated his call for the central bank to make more
explicit its pledge to hold down the benchmark interest rate. In
a paper released today, Evans and Chicago Fed economists said
the central bank may be able to limit inflation as economic
growth picks up by clarifying the changes that will prompt it to
raise the main interest rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
