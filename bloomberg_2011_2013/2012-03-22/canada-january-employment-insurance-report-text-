The following is the text of
Canada’s employment insurance report for Jan. released
by  Statistics Canada .  In January, the number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits increased by 12,400 (+2.3%) to 561,100.
This increase returned the number of beneficiaries to roughly
the same level as in June 2011.  The number of beneficiaries rose in eight provinces, with the
largest percentage increase occurring in  Quebec .  Number of Employment Insurance beneficiaries up in January  Number of Employment Insurance claims rise slightly in January  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a claim.
The number of claims provides an indication of the number of
people who could become beneficiaries.  Nationally, the number of initial and renewal claims rose by
3,700 (+1.6%) to 242,300 in January.  Provincially, the number of claims increased 4.4% in Quebec,
3.9% in Ontario and 2.8% in  New Brunswick . Claims fell 7.8% in
Alberta, 3.2% in British Columbia, 1.4% in Manitoba and 1.4% in
 Nova Scotia . There was little change in the remaining three
provinces.  Number of Employment Insurance claims edges up in January  More beneficiaries in most provinces  The number of people receiving regular EI benefits in January
rose in eight provinces, with the largest percentage increase
occurring in Quebec (+5.3%).  There were also notable percentage increases in Manitoba
(+1.7%) and Ontario (+1.5%). At the same time, the number of
beneficiaries edged down in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and
Labrador.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  EI data by sub-provincial region, sex and age are not
seasonally adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-over-
year basis.  Most large centres continue to post year-over-year declines  Of the 143 large centres, 122 posted declines in the number
of beneficiaries between January 2011 and January 2012 (see map).
Large centres are those with a population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of beneficiaries
decreased in all five large centres. In St. John’s, the number
of people receiving benefits fell 12.8% to 5,000, continuing a
series of year-over-year declines that began nearly two years
earlier.  In Prince  Edward Island , both large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in January. The biggest percentage decline was in
Charlottetown, where the number of beneficiaries fell 15.6%.  In Nova Scotia, all five large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to January. The largest
percentage decline occurred in Halifax, where the number of
people receiving benefits fell 14.6% to 6,000. This continued a
downward trend that began in the spring of 2010.  In New Brunswick, two of the six large centres had fewer
beneficiaries compared with 12 months earlier. The number of
people receiving benefits fell 11.5% in Moncton and 7.8% in
Saint John. At the same time, there were 7.8% more beneficiaries
in Fredericton. There was little or no change in the three other
large centres of the province.  In Quebec, the number of beneficiaries declined in 24 of the
33 large centres in the 12 months to January, with the largest
percentage decreases in Rouyn-Noranda, Amos,  Montreal  and
Shawinigan. In Montreal, the number of people receiving benefits
fell 12.0% to 70,500, extending a series of declines that began
nearly two years earlier. In Thetford Mines, the number of
beneficiaries rose 13.1%.  Of the 41 large centres in Ontario, 35 had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to January. The largest
percentage decreases occurred in Hamilton, Guelph, Chatham-Kent,
Stratford and Timmins. In Toronto, the number of beneficiaries
fell 20.3% to 64,900, continuing the trend of year-over-year
monthly declines that started in the spring of 2010.  In Manitoba, the number of people receiving regular benefits
was down in all four large centres in the 12 months to January.
In Winnipeg, the number of beneficiaries fell 9.9% to 7,900, the
17th consecutive month of year-over-year declines.  In Saskatchewan, all eight large centres continued to post
year-over-year declines in the number of beneficiaries, the
largest occurring in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon. In Saskatoon,
2,200 people received benefits, down 19.5%, continuing the
downward trend that began just over one year earlier. In Regina,
the number of beneficiaries fell 10.9% to 1,600, continuing a
series of declines that began in the summer of 2010.  In  Alberta , all 12 large centres had fewer beneficiaries in
January compared with 12 months earlier. The largest percentage
decreases occurred in  Grande Prairie , Lethbridge, Cold Lake, Red
Deer, Calgary and  Edmonton . In Calgary, 9,700 people received
benefits, down 34.1%, and in Edmonton, 10,600 people received
benefits, down 31.3%. For the third consecutive month, Calgary
and Edmonton posted the highest year-over-year declines among
all census metropolitan areas.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell in 24
of the 25 large centres, with the largest percentage declines in
Fort St. John, Powell River and Squamish. In  Vancouver , 27,300
people received benefits in January, down 22.2% from 12 months
earlier. In Victoria, the number of beneficiaries was down 20.0%
to 3,600.  Demographic groups  In January, 466,800 men received regular benefits, down 9.8%
from January 2011. The number of beneficiaries fell at roughly
the same pace for men under 25 (-10.0%) and men aged 25 to 54 (-
10.7%). Among men aged 55 and over, the number declined 6.9%.  A total of 233,400 women received regular benefits in January,
down 13.4% from 12 months earlier. This was the first time in
just over two years that the percentage decline was larger for
women than for men.  Among women under 25, the number of beneficiaries fell 15.8%,
while for those aged 25 to 54, it decreased 14.2%. For women
aged 55 and over, the decline was 9.5%.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment Insurance (EI)
beneficiaries reflects various situations, including people
becoming beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources
provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and Skills
Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be
affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or
administrative procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries
and the number of claims received for December and January are
preliminary. In this release, large centres correspond to those
with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who
received EI benefits from January 8 to 14. This period coincides
with the reference week of the Labour Force Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI
benefits, and should not be confused with data coming from the
LFS, which provides information on the total number of
unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people who
do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not
contributed to the program because they have not worked in the
past 12 months or their employment is not insured. Other
unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not
meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their
job voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of
work to receive benefits.
