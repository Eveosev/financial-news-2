Free-agent wide receiver Andre Caldwell said quarterback  Peyton Manning ’s addition to the
Denver Broncos convinced him to follow a day later.  “It was a big factor,” Caldwell said on a conference call
with reporters today, one day after agreeing on a contract with
the Broncos following four seasons with the  Cincinnati Bengals .
“He gets the best of his receivers. That played a big part of
it and that’s a big reason why I came.”  Caldwell, a third-round draft pick out of the University of
Florida, had 124 receptions for 1,172 yards and six touchdowns
in Cincinnati, including 37 catches for three scores last season.  Manning, the four-time National Football League Most
Valuable Player who missed all of last season following neck-
fusion surgery, chose the Broncos two days ago over several
other offers. The  Indianapolis Colts  cut Manning on March 7
rather than pay him a $28 million contract bonus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
