Credit-default swaps insuring
government and company debt rose after a contraction in
manufacturing in Europe and  China  triggered concern the global
economy will slow.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments jumped 10 basis points to 280, according to BNP
Paribas SA prices at 10:41 a.m. in London. An increase signals
worsening perceptions of  credit quality .  A measure of euro-region  manufacturing  fell to 47.7 in
March from 49 last month as German and French factory output
unexpectedly shrank, while  U.K. retail sales  fell more than
economists forecast in February as households curtailed
spending. A Chinese manufacturing  gauge  slipped to a four-month
low of 48.1 in March, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
data show.  “Despite the relative positive developments of the debt
crisis and regained confidence shown by financial markets,
industrialists still face the negative effects of a very uneven
scenario for demand,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst
at Newedge Group in London, wrote in a note.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings
increased 20.5 basis points to 590.5. The Markit iTraxx  Europe 
Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings advanced
2.25 basis points to 116.25 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 13 basis points to 203 and the
subordinated index jumped 14.5 to 326.5, BNP Paribas data show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
