Raiffeisenlandesbank Kaernten and
 BKS Bank AG (BKUS)  aren’t interested in Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
International AG’s Austrian unit, rejecting a newspaper report
citing comments from Hypo Alpe Chairman Johannes Ditz.  “As repeatedly said, BKS isn’t interested in acquiring any
parts of Hype Alpe Adria,” BKS Chief Executive Officer Heimo Penker said in an e-mailed statement. “We also won’t set any
actions in this direction in the future.”  RLB Kaernten spokesman Albin Aspernig also said that the
bank wasn’t interested in the Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank AG unit,
which comprises its local business in southern  Austria ’s
Carinthia unit as well as some German assets.  Hypo Alpe, nationalized by Austria in 2009, is trying to
restart the sale of the unit after a failed attempt last year.
It is also selling its Italian arm and its biggest business, a
group of banks in the former  Yugoslavia . Ditz was cited in
Austrian newspaper Kurier today as saying that he sees 3-Banken
Gruppe, Raiffeisen or financial investors as potential buyers,
according to the report.  “We will talk to all possible interested parties,
including those who have been in touch in the past,” Ditz later
told Austria Press Agency in an interview today, adding that
there were no concrete offers.  3-Banken Gruppe is made up of Klagenfurt-based BKS Bank AG,
Linz-based  Oberbank AG (OBS)  and Innsbruck-based  BTV Bank AG (BTV) .  To contact the reporter on this story:
