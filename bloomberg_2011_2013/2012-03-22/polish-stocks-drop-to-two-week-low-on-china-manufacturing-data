Poland ’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  fell to a two-
week low as manufacturing contracted in  China  and the euro area.  The gauge slid 1.2 percent to 2,270.26, the lowest intraday
level since March 8, by 11:02 a.m. in Warsaw.  KGHM Polska Miedz
SA (KGH) , the country’s sole copper producer, lost 2.2 percent to
144.7 zloty. China is the biggest copper consumer in the world.  A preliminary measure of Chinese manufacturing fell to 48.1
this month, the lowest since November, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. A result below 50 indicates a
contraction.  European services and manufacturing output contracted more
than forecast in March. A euro-area composite index based on a
survey of purchasing managers in both industries dropped to 48.7
from 49.3 in February, according to Markit. The euro region buys
more than half of Polish exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
