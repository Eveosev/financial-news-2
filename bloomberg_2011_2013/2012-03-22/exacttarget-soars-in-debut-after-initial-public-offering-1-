ExactTarget Inc. (ET) , the e-mail
 marketing company  that counts  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) 
as customers, gained 32 percent in its trading debut after
pricing its initial public offering above the range.  ExactTarget rose to $25.11 at the close in New York. The
Indianapolis-based company raised $161.5 million selling 8.5
million shares at $19 apiece yesterday, after planning to sell
them for $15 to $17 each, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  ExactTarget, which canceled a previous plan go public amid
the 2009 financial crisis, joins other newly public companies
that deliver marketing software to businesses via the Internet.
 Bazaarvoice Inc. (BV) , which raised $114 million last month, has
gained 51 percent since its debut. Responsys Inc. went public in
April and Eloqua Ltd. in August filed to sell shares.  ExactTarget provides computer programs that companies use
to customize e-mails and social media ads according to user
preferences, which are tracked through clicks. The company, led
by Chief Executive Officer Scott Dorsey, lost money in three of
the past five years, with a net loss of $35.4 million in 2011.
Sales increased 55 percent last year to $207.5 million.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Stifel Financial
Corp. led the offering. Technology Crossover Ventures, which
held about 26 percent of ExactTarget before the sale, now holds
about 22 percent.  ExactTarget plans to use proceeds from the sale for general
purposes, including expanding sales and marketing and overseas
operations. The shares are listed on the  New York  Stock Exchange
under the symbol ET.  To contact the reporter on this story:
