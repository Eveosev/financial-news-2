Waha Capital PJSC (WAHA)  surged the most
in 20 months after the Abu Dhabi-based investment and leasing
company said its board recommended the  highest cash dividend 
since at least 2004.  The shares jumped 7.5 percent, the most since July 2010, to
72 fils at the 2 p.m. close in  Abu Dhabi . The emirate’s
benchmark  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell 1 percent. The board
recommended a dividend of 5 fils a share, Waha Capital said in a
statement today. That’s the highest cash dividend since
Bloomberg started tracking the information in 2004. There are
100 fils to the dirham.  Waha “surged on the back of a dividend announcement this
morning,” said Omar Darwish, an equity sales trader at Cairo-
based Commercial International Brokerage Co. “It seems like it
came higher than expectations.”  Waha said last month 2011 profit tumbled 38 percent after
operating income dropped. Net income fell to 155.3 million
dirhams ($42 million) from 249 million dirhams a year earlier,
Waha Capital said Feb. 1. Operating income declined to 406.4
million dirhams from 657.5 million dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
