The U.K. Debt Management Office
will consult investors on whether it should issue bonds with
maturities longer than 50 years and so-called perpetual, or
undated debt, the agency’s chief said.  “We haven’t fixed the date, but it’s likely to be towards
the end of the first quarter of the fiscal year,” DMO Chief
Executive Officer Robert Stheeman said in Frankfurt. “We will
have to weigh long-term costs and the risks of issuing such
securities. I think there will be demand for it, but the key
question is at what prices?”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  wants to lock in
the benefits of near record-low borrowing costs for longer to
help reduce a  budget deficit  running at more than 8 percent of
gross domestic product. The U.K. will issue 167.7 billion pounds
($265 billion) of gilts in the next 12 months starting from
April, down from 179.4 billion pounds for this fiscal year.  The consultation period may take 12 weeks, Stheeman said.
The average maturity of U.K. debt is close to 14.5 years, he
said.  “We will seek the market view on this, and our focus will
be on long-term cost benefit to the country,” he said. “We
also have to look at what it actually means having so much long-
term debt in a portfolio.”  Gilts returned 14 percent in the past year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. The 10-year gilt
yield fell to a record low 1.92 percent Jan. 18 as investors
sought refuge from the euro-area debt crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
