Dutch company APM Terminals BV
signed a 33-year concession to build and operate a port terminal
on  Costa Rica ’s eastern Caribbean coast, President Laura Chinchilla said yesterday.  Investment on the port expansion is valued at nearly $1
billion, making it the largest infrastructure project in the
country’s history, she said to reporters in San Jose. When
complete, the 80-hectare port will be able to process 2.5
million shipping containers a year.  More than 80 percent of the shipping volume in Costa Rica
runs through the eastern ports of Limon and Moin, according to
the Transportation Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
