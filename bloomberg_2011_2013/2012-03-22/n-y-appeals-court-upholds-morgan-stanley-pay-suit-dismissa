The dismissal of a  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
shareholder lawsuit brought in 2010 over $45 billion paid to the
firm’s employees in three years was upheld by a New York appeals
court.  Shareholders including the Security Police and Fire
Professionals of America Retirement Fund sued Morgan Stanley,
former chairman  John Mack  and other executives in February 2010,
accusing the company of making improper compensation and bonus
payments.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich threw out the suit in December 2010, citing a
requirement that shareholders first make a demand on a board
before suing on behalf of a company or show that such a move
would be futile.  An appeals court in  Manhattan  upheld the dismissal today,
saying the complaint lacks specific allegations needed to
determine whether work done by company employees was “of such
limited value to the corporation that no reasonable person in
the  directors’  position” would have approved their pay.  “The complaint does not adequately plead waste,” Justice
Peter Tom, of the state Appellate Division First Department,
wrote. “It lacks the ‘specific allegations of unconscionable
transactions and details regarding who was paid and for what
reasons they were paid.’”  Mack ceded his chairman role at New York-based Morgan
Stanley in January to Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , who
took over as CEO for Mack at the end of 2009.  The case is Security Police and Fire Professionals of
America Retirement Fund v. Mack, 600359-2010, New York State
Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
