Peruvian dollar bonds fell, pushing
up yields for the first time in three days, on concern slowing
Chinese manufacturing activity may curb demand for copper, the
Andean nation’s top export.  The yield on  Peru ’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.68 percent at 1:21 p.m. in Lima. The
price fell 0.24 cent to 127.30 cents per dollar.  Copper fell to a two-week low in New York after a
preliminary Chinese purchasing managers’ index from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics dropped to the lowest since
November and signaled a contraction in manufacturing activity.
The data added to concern the world’s second-largest economy is
slowing after retail sales and  home prices  declined.  “It’s very evident that growth is starting to reduce and
there’s less demand overall for base commodities and industrial
metals,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin America fixed-
income research at IdeaGlobal in New York. “Negatives from
China are inevitably negatives for Latin America, and Peru,
Chile and Brazil in particular.”  China overtook the U.S. to become Peru’s biggest export
market last year on rising purchases of gold,  iron ore  and
fishmeal.  The sol was little changed at 2.6695 per U.S. dollar, from
2.67 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
