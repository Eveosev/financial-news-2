Canadian natural gas fell following
a report that U.S. stockpiles of the fuel increased last week in
the earliest seasonal gain in five years.  Alberta  gas declined 2.5 percent after the  Energy
Department (DOENUSCH)  said U.S. natural gas stocks rose 11 billion cubic
feet to 2.38 trillion in the week ended March 16. Warmer-than-
normal weather has helped inventories climb to 54 percent above
the  five-year  average.  “Mother Nature has just kicked natural gas in the guts,”
said Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors in
Houston. “The weather on an absolute basis has been really
bearish.”  Alberta gas for April delivery fell 4.75 cents to $1.82 a
gigajoule ($1.73 per million British thermal units) as of 2:45
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
is down 36 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  slid 9.1 cents, or 3.9 percent, to settle at $2.269 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
slipped 1.85 cents to $2.1264 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 1.26 cents to $2.1753 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas rose 0.18 cent to $2.2304.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet, 32 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.82 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.24 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 917 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.74 billion cubic feet today, or 66 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.1
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
