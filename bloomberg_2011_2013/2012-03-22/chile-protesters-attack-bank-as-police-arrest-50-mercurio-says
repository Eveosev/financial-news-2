Chilean protesters attacked a
branch of  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in downtown
Santiago last night after a peaceful demonstration by students
broke up,  El Mercurio  reported, citing witnesses.  Police arrested almost 50 people during the disturbances,
the Santiago-based newspaper  reported  in its online edition.  The protest was organized to support residents from the
southern region of Aysen who are calling on the government to
increase subsidies, El Mercurio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
