New Jersey (STONJ1) ’s pension-fund assets
increased 6.3 percent before payouts in the first two months of
the year, helped by stock gains, according to the state’s
investment division.  After payments to beneficiaries, excluding those in the
police and firefighter plans, the value rose 4.9 percent from
Dec. 31 to $70.5 billion, the division said in a report
presented today to the State Investment Council.  “It was definitely a stock-pickers’ market for the first
two months of the year,”  Timothy Walsh , director of the
Division of Investment, said at a meeting in Trenton.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 index  of shares gained 9 percent
in the first two months of 2012, including dividends.  Top gainers in the New Jersey portfolio for the calendar
year through March 14 included  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  All are among the top 10 U.S. domestic
holdings. Best-performing international stocks among the top 10
such holdings were  SAP AG (SAP) , HSBC Holdings Plc and Vanguard ETF
Emerging Markets, according to Walsh’s report.  The funds also benefited from a regulatory change allowing
cash transfers between common funds and pension funds, according
to the report. In January and February, the division transferred
$994 million in “cash drag” to the retirement pool.  “We have been able to significantly reduce frictional
cash,” the report said. “Recent cash levels have been the
lowest in the history of the division.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
