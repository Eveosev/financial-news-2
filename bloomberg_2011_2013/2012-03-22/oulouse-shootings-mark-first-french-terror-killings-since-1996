A French man of Algerian descent,
Mohammed Merah, was killed in a shootout with police today in
Toulouse following a 32-hour siege with authorities. He may be
the country’s first home-grown Islamic terrorist. Following is a
list of terrorist attacks committed or planned by radical
Islamic groups or individuals in  France  since the early 1990s.  -- March 2012: Merah, 23, killed three soldiers last week
and four people in a Jewish school in Toulouse on March 19.  -- December 2008: French police arrested three men for
plotting an attack on the headquarters of the country’s
 intelligence services  on the outskirts of Paris. Rany Arnaud, a
29-year-old Islamic convert who participated in the plot, blamed
France for being an “enemy of Allah” and for having troops
stationed in  Afghanistan .  -- December 2000: French and German police thwarted an
attack at a  Christmas market  in the eastern city of Strasbourg.
Four members of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat,
based in  Frankfurt , were arrested.  -- December 1996: A bomb on a commuter train exploded at
the Paris station of Port Royal, killing four and injuring 170.
There was no claim for the attack, but the police suspected the
Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA).  -- July 1995 to October 1995: The Algerian Armed Islamic
Group carried out or planned eight attacks in France, including:  July 25: A bomb exploded in a commuter train in central
Paris, killing eight and injuring 150 people.  August 17: A bomb detonated at the Arc de Triomphe in
Paris, wounding 17 people.  September 7: A car bomb exploded at a Jewish school in the
city of Villeurbanne, near Lyon, injured 14 people.  Oct. 6: A bomb blast in the Paris metro station Maison
Blanche wounded 13 people.  Oct. 17: A bomb exploded on a  commuter train  in Paris
between the Musee d’Orsay and the Saint Michel stations,
injuring 29 people.  -- December 1994: Four members of the Armed Islamic Group

three passengers. Special police forces stormed the plane in
Marseille, freeing the hostages and killing the four terrorists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
