U.K. government bonds stayed higher
after a report showed retail sales declined last month more than
economists predicted.  The 10-year gilt yield decreased six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.31 percent at 9:37 a.m.  London  time. Two-
year yields slipped three basis points to 0.45 percent.  Sales including fuel fell 0.8 percent from January, the
most in nine months, the  Office for National Statistics  said
today in London. Economists forecast a 0.5 percent decline,
according to the median of 23 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
