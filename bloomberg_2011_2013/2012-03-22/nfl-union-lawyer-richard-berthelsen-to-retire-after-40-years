Richard Berthelsen, the lead
attorney for the National Football League  player’s union , will
retire on May 15, his 40th anniversary with the organization.  Berthelsen, 67, joined the union as a lawyer in 1972 and
became general counsel in 1983. He was directly involved in
negotiating and writing four labor agreements and five contract
extensions, and was the union’s acting executive director after
Gene Upshaw died in August 2008.  “Professional football would not be what it is today
without Richard Berthelsen,” said  DeMaurice Smith , the current
union chief. “He has been involved in protecting and advancing
player rights for four decades, and in that time, he has been
steadfast in his devotion to our membership.”  Berthelsen, who will become a consultant with the union,
also represented NFL players in hundreds of grievance
arbitrations, served as the principal adviser to players and
agents on contract negotiations, established the union’s agent
regulation system and has overseen the salary cap and agent
administration.  In addition to his work with the NFL, he was general
counsel to the Major Indoor Soccer League union, the North
American Soccer League union and the United States Football
League union at various times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
