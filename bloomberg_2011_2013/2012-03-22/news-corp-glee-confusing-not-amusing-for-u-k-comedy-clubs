News Corp. (NWSA) ’s  Twentieth Century Fox
Film (2888A)  unit was sued by a British company claiming its ‘Glee’
television series may be confused with U.K. comedy events using
the same name.  The trademark-infringement claim was brought by Comic
Enterprises Ltd., which operates the  ‘Glee Club’  comedy venues
in Cardiff, Oxford and Nottingham that began in 1994. The
dispute was referred to a higher London court by a patent judge
today.  The owner of Comic Enterprises claims the title of the U.S.
series about a high school music club “led to clear confusion
between his business and the program,” Judge Colin Birss said.  The claim for an injunction would have “catastrophic
consequences” for Fox if successful and should be decided in a
higher court even if it means extra costs, Birss said in a
written ruling.  David Stone, a lawyer for Fox, declined to comment when
contacted by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
