French incumbent President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said the European Union must boost production and job
creation and not rely on consumer demand to bolster growth.  “Working is the heart of everything,” Sarkozy said in a
speech at a presidential campaign rally in  Strasbourg , eastern
France, today. “If  Europe  is no longer a place for production,
there will be no more jobs,” he said, adding that putting
consumption first was “not putting things in the right order.”  Sarkozy pledged to make economic convergence with Germany
one of his priority if re-elected in the two-round election to
be held April 22 and May 6.  “For Europe to become a motor for change, Europe must
change,” said the candidate, who is neck to neck with rival
Socialist Francois Hollande in opinion polls one month before
the first vote. Sarkozy changed his campaign slogan to “a
strong  France  in a strong Europe” for the first time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
