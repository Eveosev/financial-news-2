Kenya’s shilling weakened for a
third day on increased dollar trading as businesses prepare to
settle monthly obligations.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.6 percent to 83.40 and was trading 0.3 percent
weaker at 83.13 at 1:02 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The shilling weakening is due to increased interbank
trade as they prepare to meet increased dollar demand by
businesses for settlement of their end-month obligations,”
Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) ,
said in a phone interview today.  The central bank left its key lending rate at a record high
of 18 percent for a third month after increasing it six times
last year to keep the inflation rate under check and support the
shilling. The Kenyan currency has gained 28 percent since
reaching a record low in October, the best performer among more
than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Kenya ’s  inflation rate  declined for a third month to 16.69
percent in February from 18.3 percent in January, the Nairobi-
based Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed
statement Feb. 29.  Tanzania’s shilling fell for a second time, the longest
losing streak this month, depreciating as much as 0.4 percent to
1,598.75 per dollar and last trading 0.2 percent lower at
1,595.5 per dollar.  The Ugandan shilling also weakened for a second day,
depreciating as much as 0.4 percent to 2,495 per dollar and was
trading 0.1 percent weaker at 2,488. A close at that level will
be the lowest since March 6, according to data provided by
Bloomberg.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Alex Nicholson  To contact the reporter on this story:
