Brazil  economists raised their key
rate forecast for this year and next to double digits for the
first time, as policy makers signal they will extend the world’s
biggest tightening cycle to slow inflation.  Brazil’s central bank will raise the Selic to 10 percent
this year, compared with the previous week’s forecast of 9.75
percent, according to the Oct. 18 central bank survey of about
100 analysts published today. Officials will boost borrowing
costs to 10.25 percent next year, up from the previous week’s
estimate of 9.75 percent, the survey showed.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has renewed
pledges to keep inflation under control, as the biggest decline
among major currencies pressures consumer prices. Policy makers
on Oct. 9 increased the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to
9.50 percent and reiterated that the decision will help stem
inflation. In the minutes to their monetary policy meeting
published last week, central bankers affirmed that the current
pace of key rate increases is appropriate, as high inflation
pressured by a weaker real undermines growth and job creation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 were
unchanged at 10.51 percent at 9:17 a.m. local time. The real
weakened by 0.2 percent to 2.1736 per  U.S. dollar . Brazil’s
currency has dropped 7.4 percent in the past six months, the
most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The real will weaken to 2.40 per dollar in December 2014
from 2.25 at the end of this year, according to the central bank
survey. That compares with last week’s estimates of 2.40 and
2.29 for 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Upper Limit  While Brazil’s consumer prices rose 5.75 percent in the
year through  mid-October , the slowest since November 2012, both
monthly and annual inflation accelerated more than economists
expected, the national statistics agency said on Oct. 18.
Inflation has exceeded the 6.5 percent upper limit of the
central bank’s tolerance range twice this year. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points.  The central bank has raised the benchmark Selic by 225
basis points since April. That’s 75 basis points more than
 Indonesia , the only other major world economy that has lifted
borrowing costs this year.  Brazil’s industrial production unexpectedly stalled in
August from the month prior, as retail sales in the same month
exceeded economists’ forecasts and grew 0.9 percent, according
to the national statistics agency. Total  economic activity  in
August rose 0.08 percent, compared with analysts’ estimates of
0.2 percent growth, the central bank said on Oct. 16.  The bank last month lowered its 2013 growth forecast to 2.5
percent. While that’s down from 3.1 percent at the start of the
year, it’s faster than the 0.9 percent growth recorded in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
