U.S. Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau Director  Richard Cordray  said he doesn’t anticipate an
outburst of litigation after his agency’s qualified mortgage
rule takes effect next year.  Regulators understand that banks will need time for
implementation of the rule, which will require that lenders take
certain steps to confirm a borrower’s ability to repay, Cordray
said in a speech today at an American Bankers Association
conference in  New Orleans .  “Let me also assure you that our oversight of the new
mortgage rules in the early months will be sensitive to the
progress made by institutions that have been squarely focused on
making good-faith efforts to come into substantial compliance on
time –- a point that we have also been discussing with our
fellow regulators,” he said.  The consumer bureau will have no data initially and will
need to wait a few months after the rule takes effect in January
to judge its impact, Cordray said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
