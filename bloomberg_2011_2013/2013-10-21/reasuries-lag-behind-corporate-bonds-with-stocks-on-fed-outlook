Treasury 10-year notes snapped a
three-day advance before a government report this week that
economists predict will show U.S. employers added the most jobs
since April last month.  Benchmark yields rose from the lowest level since July
before a separate report Oct. 25 forecast to show durable goods
orders climbed. Treasuries are lagging behind stocks and
corporate bonds this month, even after fiscal gridlock in
 Washington  forced some federal agencies to close for 16 days.
The U.S. sold $35 billion of three-month bills and $30 billion
of six-month securities for the first time since the government
reopened at lower yields than the previous auction and below-average demand.  “People are just getting ready for tomorrow’s payroll
report,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading in  New
York  at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “We’re in a very tight range.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.60 percent as of 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.5
percent note due in August 2023 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000
face amount, to 99 1/8. The yield declined to 2.54 percent on
Oct. 18, the  lowest  since July 24, down from a 2013 high of 3
percent on Sept. 6.  September nonfarm payrolls data originally scheduled to be
released on Oct. 4 were postponed by the government shutdown
that ended last week.  Relative Value  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 16 percent to
$209 billion, from $249 billion on Oct. 18. The average this
year is $315.4 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE  index (BUSC)  was at 71.47 today. It touched 70.09 on
Oct. 17, the lowest level since May 24. It climbed on Sept. 5 to
114.2, the highest level in two months. It touched a record low
49 on May 9.  The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index has risen 0.3
percent this month. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of shares
returned 3.9 percent as the gauge climbed to a record on Oct.
18. The Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index advanced 1 percent.  The seven-day  relative strength  index (BUSY)  for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 39 today, up from 32 on Oct. 18,
according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  ‘Drift Higher’  The  term premium , a model that includes expectations for
 interest rates , growth and inflation, was at 0.23 percent, up
from 0.21 percent on Oct. 17, the lowest level since July 23.  The gauge has declined from this year’s high of 0.63
percent set Sept. 5, signaling the cheapest levels of 2013. A
positive reading indicates investors are getting yields that are
above what is considered fair value.  “We are toward the lower end of this range, we have more
room to see yields drift higher,” said  Michael Cloherty , head
of U.S. interest rate strategy in New York at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, a primary dealer. The range
is 2.5 to 2.8 percent, he said.  Treasuries remained lower as the purchases of previously
owned homes fell less than forecast in September. Sales dropped
1.9 percent to a 5.29 million annual rate, the National
Association of Realtors reported today in Washington, compared
with a 3.3 percent decline that was the median forecast of 67
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Payrolls Report  U.S. employers added 180,000 workers in September from
169,000 in August, according to the median estimate of analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News , indicating the economy was gaining
momentum before the shutdown.  “We’re going into tomorrow’s NFP report near the recent
lows in yields, and this could leave the market somewhat
vulnerable to a consensus or a better release,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “If we get a strong number, we could see
yields back up to the middle of the recent range” of about 2.65
percent.  Durable  goods orders  rose 2 percent in September from 0.1
percent a month earlier, according to a survey of analysts
before the U.S. Census Bureau data is released on Oct. 25.  March Taper  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
bonds a month to support the economy by putting downward
pressure on borrowing costs and pumping money into the economy.
The Fed today purchased $3.69 billion in notes maturing from
July 2019 to September 2020 today.  Economists expect the Fed to delay the first cut to its
quantitative-easing program until March, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey conducted Oct.
17-18 after the government resumed services.  Before the shutdown, most policy makers said the central
bank would probably cut the bond purchases this year, based on
the minutes of the central bank’s meetings. S&P estimated the
shutdown probably shaved at least 0.6 percent off fourth-quarter
growth.  Treasury-bill rates fell on Oct. 18 as the agreement on
 Capitol Hill  averted a potential default.  One-month rates were 0.02 percent today, after surging on
Oct. 16 to 0.45 percent, the highest level since October 2008.
Even when concern that the government would default was at its
highest, yields remained lower than historical levels, with one-month  rates  averaging 1.5 percent in the past decade.  Bill Sales  Bidding at the  U.S. Treasury ’s auction of $35 billion in
three-month bills showed this month’s partial government
shutdown remains on the minds of investors even after a last-minute agreement removed the risk of default.  The three-month bills sold today at a discount rate of
0.035 percent, down from 0.13 percent at the last auction on
Oct. 15 that was the highest since February 2011.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
the amount bid with the amount offered, was 4.03, below the
average of 4.64 at 40 bill sales this year before the Oct. 1
shutdown. It was 3.13 times at the previous auction, the least
since July 2009.  The  six-month bills  sold at a discount rate of 0.070
percent, compared with 0.15 percent at the last auction, the
highest since November 2012. The bid-to-cover ratio was 4.45,
compared with an average of 4.91 at the past 10 auctions. The
ratio of 3.52 on Oct. 15 was the lowest since October 2009.  Overseas investors, who own almost half the Treasuries
outstanding, reduced holdings for four consecutive months
through July, the longest stretch since 2001.  America’s borrowing costs are on the cusp of exceeding the
rest of the world for the first time since 2010. Yields on
Treasuries are within 0.2 percentage point of the 1.57 percent
for sovereign debt outside the U.S., according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
