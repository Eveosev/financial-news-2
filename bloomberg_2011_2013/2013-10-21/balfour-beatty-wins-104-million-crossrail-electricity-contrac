Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) , Britain’s
biggest construction company, won a 64 million-pound ($104
million) contract to install electrification equipment on a
section of London’s new high-speed railway.  Balfour Beatty will wire up a 12.5-mile (20-kilometer)
section of the Crossrail network between Stockley Junction, near
Heathrow Airport, and Maidenhead, it said in a statement. Work
under the contract awarded by Network Rail, the owner of
Britain’s train tracks and stations, will begin in December this
year for completion in late 2016.  The company looks forward “to continuing our long-term
relationship with Network Rail and continued support with the
Crossrail program,” Balfour Beatty Chief Executive Officer
Andrew McNaughton said in the statement. “Our investments in
specialist high-output plant solutions for these works confirm
our ongoing commitment to the U.K. rail market and, in
particular, to the National Electrification Program.”  The agreement adds to previous contracts on Crossrail for
London-based Balfour Beatty, ranging from track infrastructure
to station and tunnel works. The estimated 15 billion-pound
Crossrail project will cut commuting times by as much as half
when completed in 2018 and boost  London ’s rail capacity by 10
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
