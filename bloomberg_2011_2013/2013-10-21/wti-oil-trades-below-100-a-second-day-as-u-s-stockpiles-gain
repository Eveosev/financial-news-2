West Texas Intermediate traded below
$100 a barrel for a second day after crude stockpiles rose to a
15-week high in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil consumer. The
grade’s discount to Brent jumped to its biggest since April.  Futures were little changed, recovering from a three-month
low amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus
after data showed the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast in
September.  Crude inventories  increased by 4 million barrels to
374.5 million in the week ended Oct. 11, according to data from
the Energy Information Administration. Supplies were projected
to climb by 3 million, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Relatively low refining runs and slow pre-winter demand
continue to weigh on WTI,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst
at VTB Capital in London. “There is little scope for a WTI
price rebound at the moment given slackening fundamentals.”  WTI for November delivery, which expires today, decreased
as much as 55 cents to $98.67 a barrel in electronic trading on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The more-active December
contract was at $99.76, up 8 cents, as of 2:04 p.m. London time.
The volume of all futures traded was 52 percent higher than the
100-day average.  Brent for December settlement rose 90 cents to $110.54 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, after
losing 30 cents yesterday. The European benchmark crude was at a
premium of as much as $11.14 to WTI for the same month, the
widest spread on an intraday basis since April 24.  $100 WTI  Payrolls climbed less than projected in September,
indicating the  U.S. economy  had little momentum leading up to
the federal government shutdown. The addition of 148,000 workers
followed a revised 193,000 gain in August that was larger than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington .  WTI may extend its slide below $100 a barrel through the
end of the year as U.S. supplies surge, tensions over Iran ease
and political wrangling in Washington continues, a Bloomberg
survey on prices showed. Futures will lose another $2 by Dec.
31, according to the mean of 16 analysts and traders polled.  Crude’s decline may stall as technical indicators show
futures are supported. The 14-day relative strength index is at
about 35 today, the lowest level since April, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. A reading below 30 typically means the market
has fallen too quickly for further losses to be sustainable. The
front-month contract is also trading near its 200-day moving
average, at $98.60 a barrel today, where prices rebounded from
May through June.  Gasoline Stockpiles  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, postponed
the release of its Weekly Petroleum Status Report last week
after the partial U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1 led to the
temporary closing of the agency.  Gasoline inventories slid by 2.6 million barrels, the data
show. They were  projected  to shrink by 1 million, according to
the median estimate of nine analysts in the survey on
stockpiles. Distillate supplies, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, dropped by 1.8 million barrels, compared
with a forecast fall of 2 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
