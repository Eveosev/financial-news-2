Copper rose for a second day in
 London  after imports of refined metal climbed in  China , the
world’s biggest user.  Shipments rose 18 percent to 347,305 metric tons in
September, customs data showed today. Imports of unwrought
copper and products reported last week climbed to the highest
since March 2012.  “The strong China import figures demonstrate the demand
for the largest metal consumer is not bad at all,” said Richard
Fu, director for Asian commodity trading at Newedge Group SA in
London, by e-mail today. “The physical demand is not bad at
all.”  Copper for delivery in three mmonths climbed 0.3 percent to
$7,267.75 a ton at 8:05 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices gained 0.2 percent on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
