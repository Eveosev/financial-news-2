Malawi plans to establish a court
specializing in corruption cases, as the southern African nation
grapples with allegations of massive diversion of government
money, Vice President Khumbo Kachali said.  Corruption wastes as much as 30 percent of  government
spending  each year, Kachali told lawmakers in the capital,
Lilongwe, in an address broadcast live on MBC Radio. Authorities
are auditing transactions dating back to 2005 with U.K.
assistance, and the government has frozen the bank accounts of
several companies and individuals, Kachali said.  President Joyce Banda is struggling to assuage donor and
public demands for a crackdown on corruption, amid allegations
dubbed “cash-gate” by local media. Banda dismissed her cabinet
on Oct. 10, and set up a special unit of police and government
officials to examine public finances.  Malawi is  Africa ’s top exporter of burley tobacco, and
Limbe Leaf Tobacco Co., a unit of U.S.-based Universal Corp.,
 Alliance One International Inc. (AOI)  and  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  are among
buyers. About half of the population of 15 million live on less
than $1 a day, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  Kachali didn’t comment on allegations by some legislators
that he himself was involved in the scandal. The speaker of
parliament, Henry Chimunthu Banda, has assured legislators that
they’ll be given a chance to interrogate the vice president over
the allegations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
