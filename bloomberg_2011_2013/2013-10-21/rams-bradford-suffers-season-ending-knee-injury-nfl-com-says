St. Louis Rams starting quarterback
Sam Bradford will miss the rest of the season with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, the National
Football League team said on its website.  The injury occurred during yesterdayâ€™s 30-15 loss to the
Carolina Panthers.  Kellen Clemens is the only other quarterback on the roster
for the Rams, who have a 3-4 record.  Bradford, who was the first pick in the 2010 NFL draft,
passed for 1,432 yards, 13 touchdowns and three interceptions
this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
