Ethanol advanced for the eighth time
in 10 days as the government reported  record-low  seasonal
inventories of the biofuel and corn rose.  Ethanol gained and narrowed the discount to gasoline after
the U.S. Energy Information Administration said  stockpiles  were
15.4 million barrels on Oct. 11. That was the lowest level for
this time of year since the EIA began keeping weekly records in
2010 and up 29,000 barrels from the previous week.  “There’s a pretty good bid in the market,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida . “The
stockpiles weren’t as significant as what people were expecting.
They’re certainly coming after it and if they thought that there
was enough inventory, they wouldn’t have to do so, they would
just wait.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery advanced 1.8 cents
to $1.828 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. It has gained
8.4 percent in two weeks and dropped 17 percent this year.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed 3.74 cents to 82.58
cents a gallon. November-delivery gasoline fell 1.94 cents to
$2.6538 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , following
a decline in domestic crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate.
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December settlement gained 2.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $4.44 a bushel in Chicago. Prices have slumped this
year as the U.S. is harvesting a record crop estimated at 13.8
billion bushels. The ethanol crush spread based on December
contracts was little changed at 7 cents a gallon.  Corn-based Renewable Identification Numbers were unchanged
at 29 cents. The government uses the tradable RINs, which are
connected to each gallon of ethanol, to track compliance with
rules requiring ethanol use. Advanced RINs, which cover
biodiesel and sugarcane-based ethanol, fell 2 cents to 42 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 3 cents a gallon to
$2.23 in  New York , 2 cents to $2.075 in Chicago, 2 cents to
$2.165 on the  Gulf Coast  and 0.5 cent to $2.315 on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
