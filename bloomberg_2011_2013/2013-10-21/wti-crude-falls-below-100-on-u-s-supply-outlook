West Texas Intermediate fell as
crude inventories increased to the highest level in three months
in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil-consuming country.  Futures slid 1.6 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said  supplies  rose 4 million barrels to 374.5
million in the week ended Oct. 11, the most since June 28. A 3
million-barrel  gain  was forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Refinery
operating rates have declined in three of the last four weekly
reports from the EIA.  “Inventories are rising because of lackluster demand from
refineries during turnarounds,” said  Stephen Schork , president
of the Schork Group Inc., an energy advisory company in
Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “We’re in the middle of the trend and
should continue to see supply gains for several more weeks.”  WTI crude for November delivery, which expires tomorrow,
fell $1.59 to $99.22 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was the lowest settlement since July 1. The more
actively traded December contract decreased $1.43, or 1.4
percent, to close at $99.68. The volume of all futures traded
was 7 percent higher than the 100-day average at 4:10 p.m.  Brent oil for December settlement slipped 30 cents, or 0.3
percent, to end the session at $109.64 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 24 percent lower
than the 100-day average. The European benchmark traded at a
$9.96 premium to WTI, the most since April 26 and up from $8.83
at the Oct. 18 close.  Delayed Release  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, postponed
the data release because of the 16-day partial government
shutdown that ended Oct. 17.  Refineries operated  at 86.2 percent of capacity, up 0.2
percentage point from the prior week. Utilization rates usually
peak during the summer months when U.S. gasoline demand rises
and decline as the season comes to an end.  Nationwide supplies have climbed 18.9 million barrels in
the last four weekly reports, the longest stretch of gains since
the first quarter, EIA data show. Inventories at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI traded in  New York , jumped
366,000 barrels to 33 million. It was the first increase since
June. Supplies at the hub have decreased as improved pipeline
networks and shipments by rail eased a North American supply
glut created by rising oil production from shale formations.  Production Slips  U.S.  crude output  fell 4.9 percent to 7.43 million barrels
a day, a three-month low, according to the EIA. Output surged
last month to the highest level since 1989 as the combination of
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has
unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations in the central
part of the country.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 2.57 million barrels to 217.3
million. Supplies of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, declined 1.8 million barrels to 124.2
million.  President  Barack Obama  signed a bill Oct. 17 to reopen the
government through Jan. 15 and extend its borrowing authority to
Feb. 7.  “We’re probably under some additional downward pressure
because the issues that caused the recent government shutdown
haven’t been solved,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “They’ve
just been kicked down the road.”  Adequately Supplied  Global oil markets are adequately supplied, and prices in a
range of $100 to $110 a barrel are suitable for consumers and
producers, Abdalla El-Badri, secretary-general of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said at a
conference today in Muscat, Oman.  OPEC’s biggest member, Saudi Arabia, pumped more crude in
August than  Russia  and boosted exports to the highest level in
14 months, according to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative.
 Saudi Arabia  produced 10.2 million barrels a day in the month,
up 160,000 from July, and shipped 7.8 million, the most since
June 2012, data on JODI’s website showed yesterday. Russia
pumped 10.1 million barrels a day in August.  U.S. and European diplomats described negotiations held on
Oct. 15-16 in Geneva to resolve differences over  Iran’s nuclear
program  as detailed and substantive. International sanctions on
 Iran  have hobbled the nation’s oil exports and the financial
system supporting them.  ‘Positive Indications’  “There’s a lot working against the bulls,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. “We are looking at rising
inventories in the U.S., and there were positive indications
coming out of the Iranian talks in Geneva.”  Nigeria ’s Movement for the Emancipation of the  Niger Delta 
said it plans to escalate a violent campaign of disruption to
oil output in  Africa ’s leading producer. Attacks including
kidnappings and bombing of oil installations by groups including
MEND cut more than 28 percent of Nigeria’s oil output from 2006
to 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
December was 19.9 percent, up from 19.1 percent from Oct. 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 602,194
contracts as of 4:10 p.m. It totaled 510,007 contracts Oct. 18,
13 percent lower than the three-month average. Open interest was
1.81 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
