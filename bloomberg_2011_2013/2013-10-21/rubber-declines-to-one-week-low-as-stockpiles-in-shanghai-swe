Rubber ended a three-day losing
streak as  Japan ’s currency weakened against the dollar after
data showed the nation’s exports trailed estimates, boosting the
appeal of yen-denominated futures.  The contract for March delivery added 0.4 percent to settle
at 268.4 yen a kilogram ($2,737 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange. The most-active contract advanced 1.1
percent last week.  Japan’s export growth slowed in September and the nation
extended a record run of trade deficits, underscoring the
challenge for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in sustaining momentum
in the world’s third-biggest economy. The  Bank of Japan  will
continue pumping cash into the economy to spur inflation,
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said today. The yen weakened to 98.10
per dollar.  “A weaker yen gave support to futures,” said Takaki
Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.
“The BOJ may add stimulus to bolster growth, which could weaken
the currency further.”  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.8 percent to close at 20,605  yuan  ($3,381) a ton.
Thai rubber free-on-board fell 0.6 percent to 79.55 baht ($2.56)
a kilogram today, the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand  said.  Natural-rubber  stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai
exchange increased 9 percent to 140,445 tons, the highest level
since January 2010, the bourse said on Oct. 18. Supply in China
is increasing as domestic production expanded on good weather in
Yunnan and Hainan provinces, Shigemoto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
