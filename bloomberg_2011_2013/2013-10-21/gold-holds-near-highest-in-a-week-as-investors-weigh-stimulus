Gold futures rose for the third time
in four sessions on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will
delay scaling back the pace of monetary stimulus, increasing
demand of the metal as a store of value.  Last week, gold gained 3.7 percent, the most in two months,
on speculation that the Fed won’t start tapering until 2014
after the 16-day closure of the federal government damped the
economy. The first cut in debt purchases will be in March,
according to the median estimate of 40 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Tomorrow, the Labor Department will release September
jobs data delayed by the shutdown.  “The market is convinced that there will be no tapering
this year,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Investors will be closely watching tomorrow’s jobs
data to gauge the nation’s economic conditions.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,315.80 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Trading was 55 percent below the average for the past 100
days for this time, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  This year, gold has dropped 21 percent, heading for the
first annual decline since 2000. Some investors lost faith in
the metal amid a rally in U.S. equities to a record and low
inflation.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 1.7 percent to
$22.278 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $22.335, the
highest for a most-active contract since Oct. 9.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery increased 0.1 percent to $1,438.60 an ounce.
The price climbed for the fourth straight session, the longest
rally since late April.  Palladium futures for December delivery climbed 1.3 percent
to $750.25 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached $752.35, the
highest since Aug. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
