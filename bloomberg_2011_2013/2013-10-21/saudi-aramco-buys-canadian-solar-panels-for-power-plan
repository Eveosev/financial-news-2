Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, agreed to buy 1.78 megawatts of
photovoltaic panels from  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  to expand the
country’s biggest solar project.  The state-owned oil producer will add the panels to the
solar system it began operating in December at the King Abdullah
Petroleum Studies and Research Center, according to a statement
today from Guelph, Ontario-based Canadian Solar.  The project in  Riyadh , Saudi Arabia, will help the country
meet a goal of installing 16 gigawatts of photovoltaic panels,
Shawn Qu, Canadian Solar’s chairman and chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  Saudi Aramco initially used  3.5-megawatts  of panels from
Suntech Power Holdings Co. for the project, and the expansion
will make it the country’s largest ground mounted solar farm,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
