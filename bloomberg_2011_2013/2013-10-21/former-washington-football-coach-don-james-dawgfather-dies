Don James , who guided the University
of Washington’s football team to a share of the 1991 national
championship during his 18-year coaching tenure, died from the
effects of pancreatic cancer. He was 80.  James, known as the “Dawgfather” to Husky football fans,
passed away yesterday at his home, the school said in an e-mailed statement. James was Washington’s coach from 1975 through
1992, compiling a 153-58-2 record, won five Pacific-10
conference titles and went to 15 postseason bowl games.  “My family and I are extremely saddened to hear of coach
James’s passing,” current Washington coach Steve Sarkisian said.
“His accomplishments as a football coach stand alone, but what
made him truly special is the quality of man he was away from
the game. The guidance and leadership he instilled into this
program and community are still felt today, and will continue to
be felt here for a long, long time.”  When James retired in 1993, his 10 bowl victories ranked
fourth in college football history behind Paul “Bear” Bryant,
 Joe Paterno  and Bobby Bowden.  The Huskies in 1991 went 12-0 and defeated Michigan in the
 Rose Bowl  to win a share of the national title, finishing first
in the coaches’ poll.  Born on Dec. 31, 1932,  in Massillon,  Ohio , James played
quarterback at the University of Miami and in 1952 set school
records for completions, attempts and yards in a season. After
stints as an assistant coach at Florida State, Michigan and
 Colorado , James was named head coach at Kent State in 1971,
compiling a 25-19-1 record over his four seasons. He was hired
as Washington’s coach prior to the 1975 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
