EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  and other
companies produced 49 percent more oil from the Eagle Ford shale
formation in southern  Texas  in August than during the same month
last year.  The nine fields making up the majority of the Eagle Ford
yielded 664,088 barrels of crude a day, according to preliminary
data from the  Texas Railroad Commission , which oversees oil and
gas drilling in the state. The fields yielded 446,372 barrels a
day in August 2012.  July output was revised to 672,952 barrels a day from the
preliminary report of 569,191, the commission said. Production
totals typically increase in subsequent months as the state
receives revised, corrected or late reports.  The Port of  Corpus Christi , to which much of the Eagle Ford
crude is shipped by pipeline, moved out 367,535 barrels of oil a
day in August, up 91 percent from the same month in 2012.  The  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , the largest waterborne
petroleum import terminal in the U.S., received 139,953 barrels
of oil a day from Texas in July, according to the state
Department of Natural Resources. LOOP received its first tanker
of domestic crude in August 2012 after making modifications to
one of its three offshore buoys to allow receipts from smaller
domestic vessels, such as those carrying Eagle Ford crude.  Texas Renaissance  Growing production from the Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in Texas oil. The  state  produced 2.63 million
barrels a day in July, the most since February 1981, according
to the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of
the Energy Department. The EIA hasn’t released July production
data for the state.  EOG Resources is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle Ford
play, with 639,000 net acres.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  is next
with 485,000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Plains Marketing LP’s  posted price  for Eagle Ford light oil
was $97.25 a barrel Oct. 17. The price relative to Light
Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 90 cents to a discount of $4.46
a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread
has narrowed 83 percent since reaching $26.46 on March 20.  The shale formation yielded 2.87 billion cubic feet of
natural gas in August, up 5.4 percent from the previous year. It
produced 146,296 barrels of condensate a day, down 12 percent
from August 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
