Santiago Phelan resigned as head
coach of  Argentina ’s rugby team after 5-1/2 years, leaving the
Pumas as they prepare for three matches in Europe next month.  Phelan, 39, will hold a news conference today at the
 Argentine rugby union ’s headquarters in Buenos Aires after
informing its board of directors of his decision yesterday, the
governing body said in an e-mailed statement.  Former Pumas flanker Phelan, whose contract had been due to
expire in December, was hired as Marcelo Loffreda’s replacement
in March 2008 and coached the team to 13 wins, 31 losses and a
draw in his 45 games in charge.  Argentina reached the 2011 Rugby World Cup quarterfinals
and joined Australia,  New Zealand  and  South Africa  in an
expanded southern hemisphere championship the following year.
The Pumas failed to win a match in their first two seasons in
the competition, finishing last on both occasions.  The Pumas open their European tour Nov. 9 against England
before facing Wales a week later and Italy on Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
