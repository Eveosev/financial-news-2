Webb Simpson  won his first golf
tournament since the 2012 U.S. Open, cruising to a six-stroke
victory in Las Vegas at the second event of the U.S. PGA Tour’s
new wraparound season.  Simpson shot a 5-under-par 66 during yesterday’s final
round at the TPC at Summerlin to finish with a four-round total
of 24 under at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open.  It’s the fourth U.S. PGA Tour title for Simpson, who had
opened with rounds of 64, 63 and 67 and received $1.08 million.
Jason Bohn and  Ryo Ishikawa  tied for second at 18-under-par, one
shot better than Charley Hoffman.  The PGA Tour’s 2013-14 season started last week with the
Frys.com Open in San Martin,  California , and includes 45
tournaments over 43 weeks. The next event is the Oct. 24 to 27
CIMB Classic in Kuala Lumpur and the tour then moves to Shanghai
for the World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions.  All six events for the new season held this year award
FedEx Cup points for the first time. The McGladrey Classic is
held Nov. 7-10 in Sea Island, Georgia, followed by the OHL
Classic at Mayakoba in Mexico the week after. The PGA Tour
schedule then resumes in January with its traditional swing
through  Hawaii  before moving to the U.S. West Coast for six
events in California and Arizona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
