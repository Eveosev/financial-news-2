German stocks  declined after
reaching a record last week, as Deutsche Bank AG and Bayer AG
led the  DAX (DAX)  Index lower.  Deutsche Bank retreated 1.7 percent, as a measure of
European lenders fell the most of the 19 industry groups on the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Bayer dropped the most on the benchmark
German gauge. SAP AG surged 5.3 percent after reporting higher
earnings on rising cloud and database revenue.  The DAX slipped 0.2 percent to 8,848.89 at 9:39 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The gauge climbed 1.6 percent last week and has
gained 3 percent this month as U.S. lawmakers reached a last-minute deal to end a fiscal impasse and optimism grew that Janet
Yellen, nominated to head the Federal Reserve, won’t rush to
withdraw stimulus. The HDAX Index slipped 0.1 percent today.  The Fed will postpone a cut to its monthly bond-buying
program until March after a partial shutdown of the U.S.
government lasting 16 days trimmed fourth-quarter economic
growth by 0.3 percentage point and disrupted the flow of data,
according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey conducted Oct. 17-18. Policy makers will taper asset
purchases to $70 billion from $85 billion, the poll forecast.  A previous survey had indicated the U.S. central bank would
start trimming stimulus measures at its September gathering. The
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee’s last two meetings
this year are scheduled for Oct. 29-30 and Dec. 17-18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
