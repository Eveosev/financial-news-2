The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell to the lowest level in almost nine
months as crude-oil price cuts reduced costs.  Regular gasoline slid 2.01 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.3628 a gallon, the least since Jan. 25, Lundberg Survey Inc.
said yesterday.  Gasoline fell as U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
crude dropped $3.03, or 2.9 percent, to $100.81 a barrel on the
Nymex, in the two weeks to Oct. 18. The survey conducted the
same day is based on information obtained at about 2,500 filling
stations by the Camarillo, California-based company. The average
gasoline price marks six weeks of declines.  “It would take another substantial downturn in crude oil
for the retail gasoline price decline to continue,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a
telephone interview, noting that wholesale gasoline margins have
narrowed. “The squeeze is on, so we can probably expect that
wholesale price-cutting will probably slow or ease.”  The average gasoline price, which reached a year-to-date
peak in the survey of $3.795 on Feb. 22, is 39.01 cents below
the year-earlier price of $3.7529 a gallon.  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in the San Francisco Bay Area, at
$3.81 a gallon, Lundberg said.  Albuquerque Lowest  The lowest was in  Albuquerque ,  New Mexico , where customers
paid an average of $3.03. Regular gasoline averaged $3.55 a
gallon on  Long Island ,  New York , and $3.75 in  Los Angeles .  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose
6.56 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.6732 a gallon in the two weeks
ended Oct. 18.  Futures climbed two weeks in a row as refineries  reduced
rates  amid maintenance and lower margins. U.S. plants processed
14.9 million barrels a day of crude and other feedstocks in the
week ended Oct. 4, the lowest amount since April 26.  Gasoline stockpiles  were 7.1 percent above the five-year
average for the time of year as of Oct. 4, according to data
from the  Energy Information Administration , the statistical arm
of the Energy Department.  The EIA, which was closed as part of the government
shutdown, will release data today for the week ended Oct. 11.  Crude  inventories  surged 6.81 million barrels to
370.5 million Oct. 4, the biggest gain since the week ended
September 2012, EIA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
