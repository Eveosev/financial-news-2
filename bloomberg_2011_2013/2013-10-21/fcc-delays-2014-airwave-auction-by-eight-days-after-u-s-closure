The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission rescheduled an auction of airwaves for high-speed
mobile data to Jan. 22 from Jan. 14, the agency said.  The commission cited the 16-day partial closing of the U.S.
government that ended last week in its e-mailed notice today
about the sale of airwaves known as the H Block.  Sprint Corp. (S)  had pressed the agency for an auction in
January, and the commission accepted that idea over a proposal
to wait so the auction coincides with other sales later in 2014.  The auctions can leave winning companies flush with
frequencies to feed smartphones and losers barraged with
complaints of slow apps and Web pages.  The H Block comprises 10 megahertz of spectrum, a fraction
of President  Barack Obama â€™s target of 500 megahertz for
commercial mobile data. Congress has told the FCC to auction an
additional 55 megahertz next year, for a total of 65 megahertz.
The FCC estimated that the largest auction planned, of airwaves
relinquished by TV stations, would free up 120 megahertz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
