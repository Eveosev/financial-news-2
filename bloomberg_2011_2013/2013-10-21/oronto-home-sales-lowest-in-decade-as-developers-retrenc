Sales of new houses and condominiums
in Toronto plunged 26 percent this year to the lowest since 2003
as developers pulled back on projects.  Sales of new low-rise units dropped to 8,878 from January
to September from 11,604 in the same period last year and high-rise sales fell to 10,449 compared with 14,399, according to
data released today by  RealNet Canada Inc. , a Toronto-based real
estate research firm.  Developers planned to build 20,722 new homes and condos
during the first nine months of the year, a 31 percent drop from
the same period last year, according to RealNet’s report.  The cost difference between houses and their high-rise
counterparts reached a record C$226,016 ($219,454) in the city,
with houses forecast to continue losing affordability for many
residents.  “They continue to move in opposite directions,” George
Carras, president of RealNet, said in a quarterly conference
call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
