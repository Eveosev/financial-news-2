Wind power may multiply more than
sixfold to generate as much as 18 percent of the world’s
electricity in 2050, the  International Energy Agency  said,
raising an earlier estimate by half.  Spending on new wind farms would need to ramp up to about
$150 billion a year from $78 billion last year to achieve the
necessary level of installed capacity, the Paris-based IEA said
today in a statement on its website. As much as 10 times the
current capacity of almost 300 gigawatts is needed, it said.  The IEA estimated in 2009 that wind power may provide 12
percent of global power in 2050. It cited improvements in wind
technology and the “changing global energy context” for
today’s upward revision. Wind turbines currently provide about
2.6 percent of global electricity, the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
