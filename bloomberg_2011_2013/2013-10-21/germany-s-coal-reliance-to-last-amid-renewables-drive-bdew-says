Germany ’s reliance on coal-fired
plants will last even as  Europe ’s biggest power user seeks to
get more of its electricity from renewable sources, according to
the head of energy lobby group BDEW.  “We won’t be able to renounce coal from Germany in the
foreseeable future,” Hildegard Mueller said at a coal
conference in Berlin today. “Coal is essential to the energy
mix.”  Germany covered about 45 percent of its 2012 power
consumption with coal-fired power, while 22 percent came from
renewable sources, according to BDEW in Berlin. The government
plans to meet at least 35 percent of its electricity requirement
from clean energy supplies by 2020, from about 23 percent now.  At times of high solar and wind generation, the wholesale
price of electricity can drop below the level where coal plants
make money, rendering new investment unprofitable, Mueller said.
German power for 2014 has fallen 16 percent this year, reaching
a record low in August, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “No  investment decision  has been made in favor of coal
since 2008 because of the uncertainty of the utilization rate of
the plant,” Mueller said. New investment has also been held
back by the financial crisis and expectations of higher
emissions costs, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
