Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ,  Anglo
American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  and  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  are studying
building a $3 billion platinum and base metal refining complex
in Zimbabwe, an industry group said.  Together the companies are considering jointly building a
smelter, a base metals refinery and a precious metals refinery,
the association, which represents the miners, said in a
statement handed to  Bloomberg News . Platinum occurs with a
number of other precious metals including palladium and rhodium
as well base metals, used in industry, such as nickel.  Impala, through its Zimbabwe Platinum Mines Ltd. unit,
operates the Ngezi mine itself and runs the Mimosa operation in
a venture with Aquarius. Anglo American Platinum, known as
Amplats, owns the Unki mine. Together the mines are forecast to
produce about 365,000 ounces of platinum this year. Zimbabwe has
the world’s second-biggest platinum deposits after  South Africa 
and accounts for about 6 percent of world production.  “The PPA are still finalizing the cost of construction and
commissioning of these units,” the group said.  Additional costs will include power supply, road, water and
housing, the group said. Currently the country can’t supply the
more than 100 megawatts of electricity the complex would need,
it said.  “The critical requirement to spur growth in our industry
is power,” it said.  Amplats and Impala, the world’s two biggest producers of
the metal, are based in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
