JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, hired Shuya Kekke as head of Asia-Pacific sales for
electronic trading from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Kekke will be the regional head of electronic client
solutions and program trading and report to Andrea Casati and
Kazuma Naito, co-heads of equity distribution for  Asia  Pacific,
Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman, said by telephone
today. He was co-head of electronic trading at Goldman Sachs.  With Kekke’s appointment, JPMorgan has added six people to
its Asia electronic trading team in the past three months,
including three internal transfers. It hired Vivian Peng from
Barclays Plc to focus on developing liquidity products for Asia,
and Moses Lee, formerly with Credit Suisse Group SA, joined in
August to run the electronics futures business, Cheung said.  “The recent hires and additions we’ve made in Asia will
position us well to expand our product offering, deliver more
bespoke solutions to clients, and address regulatory and
structural changes,” Francis Troise, head of global electronic
client solutions, said in an e-mail. “These are our top
priorities.”  Andy Milton and Steven Brooks moved to  Hong Kong  from
 London  to focus on algorithms and electronic trading technology
respectively, Cheung said. Milton, Peng and Malavika Shanker,
who heads analytics, report to Shilesh Shekhawat, head of
