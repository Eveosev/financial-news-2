ING Groep NV (INGA) , the largest Dutch
financial-services company, filed to sell more than $900 million
of stock in its U.S. insurer through a secondary offering.  The parent plans to divest 30 million shares of ING U.S.
Inc., according to a regulatory filing today. The sale would
raise about $937 million based on the Oct. 18 closing price of
$31.23. That compares with $19.50 in the initial  public offering 
in May.  ING U.S., which is to be renamed Voya Financial, surged as
higher bond yields fueled a  rally in life insurers . The insurer
and asset manager, led by Chief Executive Officer Rodney Martin,
had a fixed-maturity portfolio valued at $74 billion as of June
30, with about half the holdings in U.S. corporate securities.  “A key benefit of rising rates is that we will be able to
achieve higher new-money rates on our investment portfolios,”
Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen said in a conference
call Aug. 7 after the company posted quarterly results.  The secondary offering will cut the Dutch company’s stake
to 60 percent from about  71 percent , the U.S. business said in a
statement today.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  are leading the latest
share sale.  The U.S company fell 3.1 percent to $30.26 at 9:36 a.m. ING
Groep slipped 0.6 percent in Amsterdam. The parent, which raised
about $1.27 billion in the May IPO, has been divesting assets as
part of the conditions of its 2008 bailout from the Netherlands.  ING Groep  agreed with European regulators  to divest at
least 25 percent of the U.S. unit by the end of 2013, more than
half by the end of 2014 and the rest by year-end 2016. It has
until the end of 2018 to complete the sale of its global
insurance operations.  Shareholders’ Equity  ING Groep granted the underwriters an option to sell as
many as 4.5 million additional shares. That would cut its stake
in the U.S. business to about 58 percent, according to a
statement today.  The offering will probably cut ING Groep’s shareholders’
equity, a measure of assets minus liabilities, by about 500
million euros ($683 million), the Amsterdam-based company said
in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
