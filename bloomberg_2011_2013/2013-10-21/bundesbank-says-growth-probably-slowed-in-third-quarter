The Bundesbank said that the German
economy,  Europe ’s largest, probably expanded at a slower pace in
the third quarter.  “It seems economic output in  Germany  increased in the
summer quarter of 2013, albeit not to the same extent as in the
second quarter,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its
monthly report published today. Growth in the three months
through June was partly due to “catch-up effects,” it said.  Gross domestic product  expanded  0.7 percent in the second
quarter after a stagnation in the first three months when an
exceptionally cold winter damped output. German growth has
helped the 17-nation euro area emerge from its longest-ever
recession after six straight quarterly contractions.  Sentiment (GRIFPBUS)  among companies as measured by the Ifo institute
rose for a fifth month in September and  ZEW investor confidence 
increased for a third month in October. At the same time,
factory orders unexpectedly dropped in August and unemployment
rose for a second month in September.  German gross domestic product probably increased 0.4
percent in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg’s monthly
economic survey published Oct. 10. The economists see it
climbing 0.5 percent in 2013 and 1.8 percent next year, ahead of
the Bundesbank’s forecast of 0.3 percent and 1.5 percent,
respectively.  The German Federal Statistics Office is due to publish
preliminary GDP numbers for the third quarter on Nov. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
