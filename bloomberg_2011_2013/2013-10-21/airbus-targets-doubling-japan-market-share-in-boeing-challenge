Airbus SAS (EAD) , which won its first
order from  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  this month, intends to double its
market share in the country by 2020 as air travel demand climbs.  The European manufacturer’s planes will make up 25 percent
of Japanese airline fleets within seven years, from 13 percent
currently, Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said
in a speech in  Tokyo  today. The planemaker aims to double that
again to 50 percent in 20 to 25 years, he said.  Airbus’s agreement, valued at $9.5 billion at the time, to
supply  Japan  Airlines with 31 long-range A350s follows a 2010
order from Tokyo-based  Skymark Airlines Inc. (9204)  for the A380
superjumbo in a country that  Boeing Co. (BA)  has dominated for
decades. Single-aisle jets from Airbus were also chosen by all
three low-cost carriers that started flying in Japan last year.  “ Asia  will be center stage for our business in coming
years,” Bregier said at The 15th Nikkei Global Management
Forum. We are emphasizing “the importance of getting close to
growth markets,” he said.  Airbus, based in Toulouse,  France , will also reach 50
percent market share in China next year, from 30 percent in 2005
and 5 percent in 1995, Bregier said.  Japan Airlines ordered 18 A350-900 aircraft and 13 larger
A350-1000s, JAL President Yoshiharu Ueki told reporters this
month. The carrier also has an option to buy 25 more planes.  ANA Shopping  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , the nation’s largest carrier, is
considering whether to buy Airbus A350s or the new generation
777s to replace its current wide-body 777-300Rs, the company’s
president, Shinichiro Ito, said in an interview last month.  The JAL order is Airbus’s biggest for the A350 this year.  The A350 had its maiden flight earlier this year and the
first variant is set to enter service in 2014, with the largest
model slated for late 2017. The planemaker has said the
A350-1000 will offer 25 percent better operating economics than
Boeing’s 777-300ER.  The Chicago-based planemaker has integrated Japanese
manufacturers into its supply chain over decades in the country,
with ties stretching back to the country’s post-World War II
reconstruction.  Japanese companies designed and supplied 35 percent of the
structure of the 787, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
supplying the wings and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji
Heavy Industries Ltd. building part of the front fuselage
section and center wing boxes.  Airbus buys about $1 billion of parts and materials
annually at manufacturing partners in Japan, Bregier said, and
the company is interested in increasing its suppliers in the
country.  JAL had  166  Boeing jets, making up 78 percent of its  214 -
plane fleet, at the end of June, while ANA had  199 Boeing jets ,
or 84 percent of its fleet of 238 planes, as of Sept. 20,
according to separate figures from the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
