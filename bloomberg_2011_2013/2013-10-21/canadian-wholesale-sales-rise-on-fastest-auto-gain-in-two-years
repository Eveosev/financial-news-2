Canadian  wholesale sales  rose for a
second month in August on the fastest gain in motor vehicles in
two years.  Sales rose 0.5 percent to C$49.8 billion ($48.4 billion),
Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa, compared with the median
estimate for a 0.3 percent gain in a Bloomberg  survey  with 11
responses.  Wholesale sales have been rising from a low of C$40.1
billion in March 2009 at about the time of Canadaâ€™s last
recession. They remain close to the May 2013 record of C$50.3
billion, as steady employment growth bolsters domestic demand.  Five of seven major categories tracked by the agency rose
in August, representing about two thirds of sales, Statistics
Canada said.  Motor vehicle sales advanced 4.5 percent, the most in two
years, leading a 3.2 percent increase in the autos and parts
category to C$8.54 billion, the highest since June 2012.  Personal and household goods rose 1.8 percent to C$7.12
billion, and agricultural supplies dropped 12.9 percent to
C$1.56 billion because of uncertainty about global fertilizer
prices, Statistics Canada said.  Wholesale sales also rose 0.3 percent in volume terms,
which removes the impact of price changes.  Statistics Canada revised the July sales gain to 1.7
percent, from a 1.5 percent increase previously.  Inventories decreased 0.5 percent to C$61.9 billion, with
the  ratio  of inventories to sales declining to 1.24 from 1.26.  Wholesale sales were 1.3 percent higher in August than the
same month  a year earlier .  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
