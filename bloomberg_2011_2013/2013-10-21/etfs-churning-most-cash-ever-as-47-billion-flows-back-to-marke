Money has been flowing in and out of
financial markets more rapidly than ever before this year, a
bullish signal as the threat of a U.S. government default fades.  About $47 billion has gone to exchange-traded funds that
track everything from stocks to bonds to commodities since Sept.
1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That followed about
$18 billion pulled in August, $40 billion added in July and $11
billion pulled in June, making it the most volatile period on
record for flows. Almost $7 billion went to ETFs on Oct. 17
alone, as Congress passed legislation to avoid a default.  The unleashing of investor funds this year has coincided
with the  broadest  U.S. stock-market rally in at least a quarter
century as fresh cash helped overcome slowing profit growth and
concern the Federal Reserve will cut stimulus. Resolution of the
budget impasse sends an all-clear signal that will spur another
round of deposits, according to  David Kelly , the chief global
strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York, which oversees about
$400 billion in long-term assets.  “The pattern we’d seen with flows for much of 2013 is
going to resume now that things have settled down,” Kelly said
by phone Oct. 17. “It’s a realization that the markets have
been able to survive Washington.”  Budget Deal  The S&P 500 rallied 2.4 percent to 1,744.50  last week ,
surpassing the all-time high reached Sept. 18 after Congress
ended a standoff over the budget that sent the index down as
much as 4.1 percent. Increasing profits and Fed stimulus have
helped the gauge  advance  22 percent in 2013 and 158 percent
since March 2009. The index fell less than 0.1 percent to
1,743.35 at 9:41 a.m. New York time today.  The 16-day government shutdown ended on Oct. 17 after
President  Barack Obama  signed a bill to fund the government
through Jan. 15 and extend the borrowing authority through Feb.
7. About $725 million went into ETFs on Oct. 16, $6.9 billion on
Oct. 17, and $2.5 billion on Oct. 18, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Oct. 17 had the biggest daily inflow in a month.  Month-to-month swings in ETF flows totaled more than $53
billion since June, about six times the 13-year average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Fluctuations are tracked by
comparing outstanding shares in the funds, which change as
demand from investors rises and falls, with their prices, which
are pegged to an underlying index or asset.  Stock Flows  Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks received $12 billion
in October after $14 billion last month. The  SPDR S&P 500 ETF
Trust  had the biggest inflows at $6.7 billion last month. The
iShares Russell 2000 ETF absorbed $2 billion, and the iShares
MSCI Emerging Markets ETF received $4.5 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The SPDR, the largest ETF with a market cap of $158
billion, saw $14 billion come out in August after $13.8 billion
was added in July. It was the biggest swing in assets since the
beginning of 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ETFs have been gaining momentum as the stock market surged.
In 2013, shares of more than 450 companies have risen, the most
since at least 1990, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Assets in U.S. ETFs have almost tripled to $1.5 trillion in
the last five years, according to data from the Investment
Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group. About $284
billion was drained from actively managed mutual funds in the
same period, data from Morningstar Inc. show. Unlike mutual
funds, ETFs, the vast majority of which are pegged to indexes,
can be traded throughout the day like stocks.  Greater Influence  “There’s no doubt that ETFs have greater influence than
before, and the swings in the ETFs are indicative of general
market feelings,”  Nick Sargen , who oversees $45 billion as
chief investment officer at Fort Washington Investment Advisors
in Cincinnati, said in an Oct. 16 phone interview. “They become
the market.”  ETF inflows were similarly strong when the S&P 500 was
 peaking  in October 2007. In the four months leading up to the
record on Oct. 9 of that year, they attracted more than $54
billion. Money continued to go in even as the equity gauge
floundered through the end of the year, with another $65 billion
coming in through December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Now that the S&P 500’s rally since March 2009 has lasted
longer than the average bull market since World War II and
 corporate earnings growth  is slowing, investors shouldn’t expect
to make the same kind of easy money, according to  Eric Marshall ,
who oversees $1.4 billion as president and portfolio manager at
Hodges Capital Management.  Blindly Investing  “The past strategies of just blindly investing in the ETFs
and index funds may be a little bit more challenging,” Marshall
said in a phone interview from Dallas. “You really need to go
out there and find these pockets of opportunity.”  Earnings growth for the S&P 500 slowed to 2.5 percent last
quarter, according to analyst projections, after averaging 4.2
percent since the start of 2012. That’s a fraction of the 28
percent mean for 2010 and 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  S&P said last week the impact of the budget impasse had
shaved at least 0.6 percent off fourth-quarter growth, taking
$24 billion out of the economy. The ratings agency forecast 2
percent annualized growth, down from the 3 percent seen last
month. Fitch Ratings put the government of the world’s biggest
economy on watch for a possible credit downgrade.  “After this drama with this past shutdown is over, people
will have to focus on fundamentals, and that’s earnings, holiday
sales and the impact of the debt negotiations on the economy,”
 Matt McCormick , who helps oversee $10.1 billion as a portfolio
manager at Cincinnati, Ohio-based Bahl & Gaynor Inc., said by
phone Oct. 16. “All of that is going to be less than stellar.”  Profit Growth  While profit growth has slowed, the S&P 500’s  valuation  is
in line with the historical average. The S&P 500 trades at 16.8
times earnings, compared with the 10-year average of 16.3, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. After this year, companies will
resume their profit expansion, with S&P 500 earnings forecast to
increase more than 10 percent in 2014 and in 2015, according to
analyst estimates.  Alcoa Inc., which  beat analyst profit estimates  for the
third quarter, is up 6.3 percent in October, after the last four
months’ performance mirrored ETF flows. The largest U.S.
aluminum producer  rallied  5.5 percent in September, dropped 3.1
percent in August and gained 1.7 percent in July. In June, the
shares fell 8 percent.  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Shares  of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., the maker of the
eye medicine Eylea, have risen and fallen in the same months
flows have gone in and out of ETFs. It led the S&P 500 higher
last month, rising 29 percent, after a 10 percent drop in August
and a 20 percent gain in July. Analysts project the Tarrytown,
New York-based company will  boost  earnings 57 percent this year
and another 29 percent in 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Morgan Stanley has  advanced  10 percent in October. The
owner of the world’s biggest retail brokerage posted earnings
that exceeded the average analyst estimate and is forecast to
increase them another 36 percent next year. The shares had risen
and fallen in line with the pattern of ETF flows since June.  Of the 100  S&P 500 companies  that have posted earnings so
far this reporting season, 70 have surpassed the projections of
analysts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The S&P 500 is up 5.4
percent since Oct. 8, when Alcoa was the first company in the
index to report.  “The stock market fooled the hand wringers yet again,”
said  Howard Ward , the chief investment officer for growth equity
at Rye, New York-based Gamco Investors Inc., which oversees
about $40 billion. “Now that we have at least a temporary deal
in Washington, I suspect this will push some ETF money, or
market-timing money, in the direction of stocks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
