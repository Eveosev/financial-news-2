European stocks  gained for an eighth
day as companies from Royal Philips NV to Akzo Nobel AG reported
profit that beat estimates and investors speculated the Federal
Reserve may maintain stimulus measures into next year.  Philips, the world’s biggest lighting manufacturer, and
Akzo Nobel, the Dutch maker of Dulux paint, jumped more than 5
percent. Actelion Ltd. rallied to a six-year high as its lung
drug Opsumit won U.S. approval. SAP AG added 4.8 percent after
the maker of business-management software posted increased
third-quarter earnings and reiterated its full-year forecast.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.3 percent to 319.54
at the close of trading, the highest level since June 2008. The
gauge has risen 2.9 percent this month as U.S. lawmakers agreed
to extend the government’s borrowing authority until 2014 and
ended the first partial government shutdown in 17 years.  “While we saw a variety of profit warnings earlier in the
earnings season, we’re also seeing some good numbers now,”
Andrew Parry, who manages about 2 billion euros ($2.73 billion)
at Hermes Sourcecap Ltd. in London, said by phone. “While the
recession has receded in Europe and we’re seeing a bit of growth
recovery, it has not benefited all companies equally. It remains
a stockpicker’s market.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 16 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  added 0.4 percent for an
eighth day of gains while  France ’s CAC 40 fell 0.2 percent.
 Germany ’s DAX was little changed.  Fed Stimulus  In the U.S., the Fed will maintain its monthly bond-buying
program until March after a 16-day government shutdown trimmed
fourth-quarter economic growth by 0.3 percentage point and
disrupted the flow of data, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey conducted Oct. 17-18. Policy
makers will taper asset purchases to $70 billion from $85
billion, the poll forecast.  A previous survey had indicated the U.S. central bank would
start trimming stimulus measures at last month’s gathering. The
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee’s last two meetings
this year are scheduled for Oct. 29-30 and Dec. 17-18.  A release tomorrow may show U.S. payrolls increased by
180,000 in September, after gaining 169,000 a month earlier,
economists forecast. The government shutdown delayed the Labor
Department data originally due on Oct. 4.  Philips climbed 5.3 percent to 25.73 euros, its highest
price since July 2010. The company said third-quarter earnings
before interest, taxes, amortization and one-time items rose to
634 million euros, compared with the 567 million-euro average
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Akzo Advances  Akzo surged 6.6 percent to 51.63 euros, its biggest gain
since December, after saying earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization climbed 7 percent to 456 million
euros. Analysts on average had estimated 444 million euros.  Actelion jumped 5.9 percent to 68.40 Swiss francs, the
highest since October 2007. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said late Oct. 18 that it approved the use of
Opsumit once daily for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension.  SAP added 4.8 percent to 56.06 euros after saying third-quarter operating profit adjusted for some items rose to 1.3
billion euros as revenue from the Hana database product surged
79 percent. The world’s largest maker of business-management
software reiterated a July forecast for double-digit percentage
growth for software-related services sales this year, excluding
currency swings.  “With SAP, people had baked in a lot of fears about a
warning that didn’t come to pass, so that was positive,” Hermes
Sourcecap’s Parry said.  G4S Climbs  G4S Plc advanced 3.5 percent to 250.5 pence after people
familiar with the matter said private-equity firm Charterhouse
Capital Partners LLP is considering an offer of 1 billion pounds
($1.6 billion) for the cash-solutions business of the world’s
biggest security-services provider.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, the largest state-owned
British lender, tumbled 5.3 percent to 353.1 pence, its biggest
drop since June. The U.K. government will decide by November
whether to spin off RBS’s toxic assets into a so-called bad
bank, the Daily Telegraph reported, citing an interview with
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.  Tod’s SpA (TOD)  slipped 2.7 percent to 124.90 euros and Hugo Boss
AG fell 2.1 percent to 93.51 euros after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. downgraded both stocks to sell from neutral.  A rally in Tod’s over the past six months has overshot the
earnings outlook, Goldman Sachs analysts led by William Hutchings wrote in a report. Tod’s, which owns stakes in
leather-goods maker Sant’Espidio a Mare and New York-based
retail chain Saks Inc.,  surged 22 percent  from a June 24 low
through the close on Oct. 18, compared with 8.6 percent for the
Stoxx 600 Personal & Household Goods Index.  Hugo Boss is “less well-placed to capture incremental
growth in the luxury-goods sector,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
