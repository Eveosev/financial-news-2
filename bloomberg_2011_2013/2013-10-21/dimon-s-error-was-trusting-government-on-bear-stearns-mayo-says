Jamie Dimon ’s mistake was thinking
the government would agree to let  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  avoid
mortgage-related legal costs after it purchased Bear Stearns
Cos. during the financial crisis, said Mike Mayo, an analyst at
CLSA Ltd.  “Jamie Dimon trusted the government when he bought Bear
Stearns,” Mayo said today in a Bloomberg Television interview,
referring to the chief executive officer of the New York-based
bank. “What’s the first rule of contract law? Get it in
writing. So yes, I do fault Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan and their
legal staff for not giving them adequate protection.”  JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, has tentatively agreed to
pay a record $13 billion to end civil claims over its sales of
mortgage bonds, a deal that won’t absolve the bank
of potential criminal liability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
