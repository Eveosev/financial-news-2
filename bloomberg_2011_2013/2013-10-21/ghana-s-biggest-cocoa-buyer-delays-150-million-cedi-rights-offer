Produce Buying Co.,  Ghana ’s largest
buyer of cocoa beans from farmers, postponed a sale of shares
until the first quarter of 2014 as it waits for approval from
the government, Managing Director Kojo Atta-Krah said.  “The rights issue is at cabinent level, we are expecting
approval to come in November,” he said in an interview in Accra
on Oct. 18. The offer will be for at least 150 million cedis
($68 million), Atta-Krah said. The West African nation,
including the state pension fund, owns about 75 percent of the
company.  The remaining 25 percent of  investors  approved the share
sale, initially pegged at 200 million cedis, of new shares in
March, pushing the stock to the highest in more than a year. The
offer, scheduled to have started in July, would have been the
first by a member of the Accra-based bourse this year. The
shares fell 50 percent since the peak after the company reported
a loss.  PBC lost 2.2 million cedis in the nine months through June
30, compared with profit of 12.4 million cedis a year earlier,
the company said on July 30. Its net debt climbed to 2.94 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
in 2012 from 1.98 times a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Deputy Finance Minister Cassiel Ato Forson said he didn’t
want to pre-empt the cabinet’s decision when called on Oct. 18.
Michael Atiboly, acting general manager for Investment and
Development at the Social Security and National Insurance Trust
wasn’t immediately available to comment, said a man who answered
the phone at his office on Oct. 18.  PBC’s  shares  were unchanged at 18 pesewas by the close in
Accra on Oct. 18.  The company plans to boost cocoa bean purchases by 3.8
percent to 270,000 metric tons in the harvest season that
started on Oct. 18. Ghana Cocoa Board, the industry regulator,
targets a total crop of 830,000 tons after output reached
837,000 tons in the year that ended on Sept. 30.  Farmers will be paid 3,392 cedis a metric ton for their
beans by buyers including PBC in the 2013-14 period, the same as
last year, Forson said on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
