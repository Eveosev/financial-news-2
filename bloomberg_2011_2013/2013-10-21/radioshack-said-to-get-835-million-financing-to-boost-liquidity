RadioShack Corp. (RSH) , the unprofitable
consumer-electronics seller, received commitments for $835
million in new financing, said a person with knowledge of the
matter, replacing its existing $625 million credit facilities.  The lenders include GE Capital, Salus Capital Partners LLC,
 CIT Group Inc. (CIT)  and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said the
person, who asked not to be named because the process is
private. The new  credit line  boosts RadioShack’s liquidity as
the company tries to persuade suppliers to support its
turnaround efforts after it lost $139.4 million last year.  Chief Executive Officer Joe Magnacca is counting on vendors
to supply exclusive products to help the Fort Worth, Texas-based
company distinguish its offerings from rivals’ merchandise.
RadioShack has posted six straight quarters of net losses and
declining sales as customers defect to big box retailers such as
Best Buy Co. and online competitors including Amazon.com Inc.  Merianne Roth, a spokeswoman for RadioShack, didn’t reply
to a telephone call and e-mail seeking comment. Representatives
for Salus and  GE Capital  declined to comment, while spokesmen
for RBS and CIT didn’t respond to messages seeking comment left
outside normal business hours.  The financing will comprise $585 million in new first-lien
loans and $250 million in second-lien credit, said the person
familiar with the situation. Parts of the new financing package
were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
