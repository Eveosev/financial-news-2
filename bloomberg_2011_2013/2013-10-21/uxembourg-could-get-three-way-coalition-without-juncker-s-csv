Luxembourg’s next government could
be a three-way coalition among Liberals, Socialists and Greens,
pushing current Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker’s party into
opposition.  The Liberals, Socialists and Greens will discuss the
possibility of a three-way coalition, Xavier Bettel, head of the
Liberals party DP, told reporters in Luxembourg tonight. “It’s
a historical approach because a three-way coalition so far never
happened.”  Juncker’s Christian Social People’s party, or CSV, remained
the strongest party even as it lost three seats in yesterday’s
elections, moving to 23 seats out of a total of 60 in the
Parliament.  The Liberals gained four seats to 13, and the Socialists
LSAP maintained their 13 Parliament seats in the vote. The
Greens have six seats, after losing one yesterday.  Juncker today offered his government’s resignation to the
Grand Duke, who asked his administration to continue to take
care of current affairs and any urgent measures that may be
needed. Coalition talks could take days or weeks.  CSV has been in government since 1945 except 1974-1979.
Juncker, who turns 59 in December, has been Luxembourg’s prime
minister since 1995. He called for early elections after the
Socialists in July submitted a motion for an early vote, saying
Juncker had to be held politically responsible for a spy scandal
involving his country’s secret service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
