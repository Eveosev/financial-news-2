Newark Mayor  Cory Booker , elected to
the  U.S. Senate  last week, officiated at the wedding of two men
on the first day of legal same-sex marriage in New Jersey.  The 44-year-old Democrat had declined to perform
heterosexual marriages during his almost eight years as mayor of
New Jersey’s largest city because gays were barred from the
rites. Booker was elected to the U.S. Senate on Oct. 16 to
replace Democrat  Frank Lautenberg , who died in June at 89.  The New Jersey Supreme Court on Oct. 18 declined to
postpone the ceremonies, allowing the state to become the 14th
in the U.S. to recognize the unions.  Joseph Penessidi, 65, a retired advertising executive, and
Orville Bell, 65, a youth educator, were the first of nine
couples -- seven same-sex and two heterosexual -- whom Booker
wed. Booker called his role “one of the greatest privileges of
my life.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
