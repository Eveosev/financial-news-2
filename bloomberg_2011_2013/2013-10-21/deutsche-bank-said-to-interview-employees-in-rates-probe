Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Europe’s biggest
investment bank by revenue, is interviewing about 50 employees
as it investigates whether traders tried to rig benchmark
interest rates, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  The interviews are part of an investigation that has
included conversations with staff and a review of their
electronic communication that started after the Frankfurt-based
bank’s management was informed in 2011 of potential attempts to
manipulate rates, said the person, who asked not to be
identified as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.  Regulators around the globe are examining whether more than
a dozen lenders including Deutsche Bank colluded to rig
benchmark interest rates.  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  are among firms already fined about $2.6
billion for rigging the London interbank offered rate, the
benchmark for more than $300 trillion of securities worldwide.  Deutsche Bank declined to comment on its investigation.
Germany’s largest lender has said that its probe indicates no
wrongdoing by current or former management board members and
that it would fire or suspend employees who acted
inappropriately without identifying individuals.  Ernst & Young LLP is helping German banking regulator Bafin
with its investigation of alleged attempts by Deutsche Bank
traders to rig rates, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter. Spokesmen for the auditor and Bonn-based Bafin
declined to comment when contacted by  Bloomberg News  today.  German newspaper Handelsblatt reported the interviews
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
