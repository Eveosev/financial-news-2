The  University of Alabama  is ranked
No. 1 in college football’s first Bowl Championship Series
standings of the season, while Florida State holds the No. 2
spot ahead of the University of  Oregon .  Alabama , the two-time defending national champion, has a
7-0 record after routing Arkansas 52-0 two days ago.  Florida State (6-0) is ranked third behind Oregon (7-0) in
both the Harris Interactive Poll and the USA Today coaches’
poll, yet grabbed the second spot in the  BCS standings  by being
ranked No. 1 in the computer polls. The Seminoles two days ago
rolled to a 51-14 win at Clemson, which had been 6-0, and Oregon
defeated Washington State 62-38.  The BCS standings, which determine who plays for the
national championship on Jan. 6 in  Pasadena , California, factor
in the USA Today coaches’ poll and Harris Interactive poll in
addition to six computer rankings. Only twice in the past 15
years have the teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the initial
standings gone on to play in the championship game, according to
BCS executive director Bill Hancock.  “A lot can change over the next seven weeks,” Hancock
said in a statement. “Let the roller coaster ride begin.”  Alabama has a .984 rating out of 1.000 in the BCS
standings, with Florida State at .935 and Oregon at .932.  There’s then a drop to Ohio State (7-0), which is fourth
with a .855 rating. Missouri (7-0), Stanford (6-1), Miami (6-0),
Baylor (6-0), Clemson (6-1) and Texas Tech (7-1) round out the
top 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
