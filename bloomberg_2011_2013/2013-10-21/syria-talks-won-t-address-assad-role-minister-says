International peace talks aimed at
ending the Syrian conflict won’t discuss the fate of President
Bashar al-Assad, Syrian Minister for National Reconciliation Ali Haidar said.  The proposed talks, backed by the U.S. and  Russia , would
initially seek agreement on a national unity government, Haidar
said in a phone interview from Damascus. That administration
would then set out a program for a political solution to the 2
1/2-year conflict, including the president’s status, and
agreement would be by consensus and not a vote, he said.  Efforts to convene the conference have intensified since
Russia and the U.S. reached an agreement last month to destroy
 Syria ’s chemical weapons, averting an American military strike
in retaliation for a chemical attack allegedly carried out by
Syrian government forces on Aug. 21.  The opposition hasn’t yet agreed to attend the talks. The
U.K. is hosting a meeting of 11 foreign ministers and the Syrian
National Coalition, the main political opposition, tomorrow to
discuss the conference.  “Geneva will mark the launch of a political process not
the achievement of a political process,” said Haidar. He said
80 percent of the preparations for the conference have been made
and there’s tentative agreement that it will take place late
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
