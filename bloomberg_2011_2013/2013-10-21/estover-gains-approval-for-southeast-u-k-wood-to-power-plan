Estover Energy Ltd. won approval to
build a 65 million-pound ($105 million) plant in southeast
 England  that will use wood to produce heat and power.  Construction of the plant in Kent is expected to begin
early next year and will create about 100 jobs, the Edinburgh-based company said today in a  statement  on its website. Power
will be fed into the national grid and should be sufficient to
supply about 21,000 homes, it said.  The U.K. expects 15 percent of its energy to come from
renewable sources by 2020 compared with 9.4 percent now. The
government estimates as much 30 percent of that may be sourced
from biomass plants that use municipal waste, wood and straw.
Estoverâ€™s plant will have power capacity of 11 megawatts to 15
megawatts and heat capacity of 8 megawatts to 12 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
