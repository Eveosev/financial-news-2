China ’s benchmark price for power-station coal rebounded from the lowest level in four years as
the government sought to shut unsafe mines.  Spot coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram at the port of Qinhuangdao rose to a range of 530 yuan
($86.87) to 540 yuan a metric ton as of yesterday, according to
data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association
today. That’s the first weekly gain since Oct. 15 last year.  China, the world’s largest coal consumer, is pushing for
small and mid-sized mines to be suspended to avoid fatal
accidents as the nation convenes a high-profile Communist Party
meeting in November. Key economic reforms may be announced at
the Beijing plenary meeting of the  Central Committee , which will
be the third full gathering of the party leadership. More than
2,000 mines may be closed by 2015, according to a government
statement on Oct. 12.  “Coal-mine construction in Shanxi, a key producing
province, was suspended from Oct. 10 for safety checks, an
apparent political move,”  Helen Lau , an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian
Ltd. in  Hong Kong , said by phone today. “That’s something we
may see more throughout next March.”  The northern province produced 913 million tons of coal in
2012, or 25 percent of the nation’s output, and the shutdown of
mines may cut supplies by 70 million tons, Lau said in a
research note on Oct. 17.  China’s coal-price recovery may be sustained through March
next year at an average of about 540  yuan  a ton, according to
UOB Kay Hian.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
