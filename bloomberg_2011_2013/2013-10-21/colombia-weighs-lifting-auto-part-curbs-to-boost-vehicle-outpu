Colombia ’s government is studying
measures to ease restrictions on imports of auto parts in a bid
to reverse a fall in local vehicle assembly, Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  said.  “To make this sector more competitive we’re going to have
to move toward allowing auto parts to come without restriction
from any country, so that Colombia’s vehicle assembly industry
doesn’t disappear,” Cardenas told reporters in Bogota today.
Colombia is following a model that was implemented with success
in Mexico, Cardenas said.  Colombia’s vehicle industry contracted 28.9 percent in
August from a year earlier, contributing to a 3.9 percent
percent drop in  industrial  output, the national statistics
agency said in a report published Oct. 18. The contraction in
industry was worse than the forecast of all 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Colombia will announce its decision later this week,
Cardenas said.  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Renault SA (RNO) ,  Mazda Motor Corp (7261)  and  Toyota
Motor Corp (7203)  have assembly operations in Colombia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
