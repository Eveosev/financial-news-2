Pop star Lady Gaga settled a lawsuit
brought by a former personal assistant who claimed the singer
failed to pay her for more than 6,600 hours of overtime, lawyers
for both sides said in a memo to the court.  Jennifer O’Neill filed suit in federal court in  Manhattan 
in December 2011, alleging that she worked at the singer’s home
and with her on tour and needed to be available to the singer 24
hours a day, often without a break. The case was scheduled to go
to trial Nov. 4.  O’Neill had claimed she served as Lady Gaga’s “personal
alarm clock” to ensure she remained on schedule, that her stage
outfits were available for a show and even to make sure the
singer had a towel after a shower.  O’Neil, who said she was paid as much as $75,000 a year
while working for the singer, had alleged that she was owed back
pay of $19,200 for her work in early 2009 and almost $360,000
for her nonstop work between February 2010 and March 2011.  Lawyers for both O’Neill and Lady Gaga today submitted a
stipulated order to U.S. District Court Judge Paul Gardephe, who
is presiding over the case, informing him that they’d agreed to
settle the case for an undisclosed amount and asking him to
dismiss the case. The agreement also states that O’Neill is
barred from bringing further claims for wages and overtime pay.  Paul Millus, a lawyer for O’Neill, and Steven Hurd, a
lawyer for Lady Gaga and her company, didn’t immediately return
voice-mail messages seeking comment about the accord.  The case is Jennifer O’Neill v. Mermaid Touring Inc., 11-cv-99128, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
