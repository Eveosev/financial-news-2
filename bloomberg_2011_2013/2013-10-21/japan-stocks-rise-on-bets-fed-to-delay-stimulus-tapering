Japan ’s  Topix index  rose to a three-week high as investors speculated corporate earnings will beat
forecasts and a weaker yen boosted exporters.  Canon Inc., the world’s No. 1 camera maker, gained 1.4
percent as the yen slid against all of its 16 major
counterparts. Suzuki Motor Corp. climbed 2.4 percent on a report
the carmaker’s first-half operating income may beat estimates.
Furukawa Battery Co. jumped 10 percent after reporting better-than-expected profit.  The Topix climbed 0.6 percent to 1,212.36 at the close in
 Tokyo , its highest since Sept. 27, with all but three of its
industry groups advancing. The gauge rose 0.7 percent last week
after U.S. lawmakers reached an accord to end the government
shutdown and lift the debt ceiling. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
today added 0.9 percent to 14,693.57. The yen slipped 0.4
percent to trade at 98.11 against the dollar.  “Market focus is shifting to reporting season after the
U.S. avoided default,” said Takahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based
senior strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of
Japan’s third-largest bank by market value. “I think there’s
optimism about corporate earnings. Companies that haven’t fully
priced in a weaker yen have room to raise their profit
forecasts.”  While leading gains among developed markets this year, the
 Topix (TPX)   added  just 1.5 percent this month after Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe decided to push ahead with a sales tax increase and
the U.S. shut down parts of its government. Some 590 companies
on the 1,744-member gauge are scheduled to report  results 
through Oct. 31, with earnings season peaking next week.  Earnings per share for companies on the Topix are expected
t o grow  56 percent from the previous quarter, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Trade Data  Japan’s exports grew 11.5 percent in September from a year
earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said today, less than the revised
14.6 percent gain in August and below the 15.6 percent median
forecast of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Imports
climbed 16.5 percent, leaving a trade deficit of 932.1 billion
yen ($9.5 billion).  Separately,  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said
today Japan’s economy is moving smoothly to achieve a 2 percent
inflation target.  Canon gained 1.4 percent to 3,185 yen as the yen fell.
Komatsu Ltd., a maker of construction machinery that gets most
its revenue abroad, added 1.5 percent to 2,402 yen.  Suzuki, Furukawa  Suzuki Motor climbed 2.4 percent to 2,470 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the carmaker may report a 90 billion
yen operating profit for the first half.  Furukawa Battery jumped 10 percent to 577 yen after
reporting 410 million yen in net income, beating its 200 million
yen forecast.  Jafco Co. added 2 percent to 5,120 yen after the investment
firm’s half-year profit rose about sevenfold from a year
earlier.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent today. The measure rose 0.7 percent on Oct. 18 as
results from Google Inc. topped estimates and speculation grew
that the  Federal Reserve  will delay cutting the pace of bond
purchases.  U.S. Reports  The September U.S. jobs report, originally scheduled to be
released Oct. 4, will be issued tomorrow after being delayed by
the partial government shutdown. October employment figures will
come out on Nov. 8, rather than Nov. 1. Delayed economic data
will prevent policy makers from paring asset buying until their
March 18-19 meeting, according to the median of 40 responses by
economists in a survey conducted by Bloomberg last week.  “Money is flowing into stocks after the U.S. dodged a
financial crisis for now as the Fed’s tapering is likely to be
delayed.” said  Gentoku Kiyokawa , Tokyo-based head of the
Japanese investment management department at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners. “But investors can’t buy stocks a lot
because the fiscal problem was just postponed without getting
solved.”  The Topix  traded  at 1.27 times book value as of today,
compared with 2.56 for the S&P 500 and 1.79 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index on Oct. 18. Its 30-day historic volatility was at
16.11 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
