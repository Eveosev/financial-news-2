A lawsuit alleging LinkedIn Corp.
hacked into subscriber e-mail contacts without their consent was
assigned to U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh in San Jose,
California, who is known for what  Google Inc. (GOOG)  called her
“novel” approach to Internet privacy.  Koh has been critical of the argument by companies accused
of privacy violations that they properly disclosed to customers
that their private information would be used.  David Straite, an attorney with Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer
LLP, said Koh’s ruling in the Google case, that customers
deserve clear and explicit explanations of how their information
will be used, may help LinkedIn plaintiffs prove their hacking
accusations, which the company has denied.  Google has asked Koh to let it appeal her ruling in that
case. Koh’s assignment to the LinkedIn case was disclosed in an
Oct. 18 court order.  The LinkedIn case is Perkins v.  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , 13-cv-04303, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
