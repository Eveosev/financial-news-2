Most  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks rose, with the
benchmark index holding at a three-year high, after companies
posted better-than-expected earnings and global investors added
to their holdings.  Engineering company  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  rallied to a
three-month high and  Asian Paints Ltd. (APNT)  surged 6 percent after
reporting profit that beat estimates. Hindalco Industries Ltd.,

high.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  and  HCL Technologies Ltd. (HCLT) 
dropped after climbing to records on Oct 15.  Two stocks rose for each that fell on the S&P BSE Sensex,

Nov. 5, 2010. Profits at all seven Sensex companies that have
posted earnings this season have exceeded or matched estimates.

11th day on Oct. 18, the longest series of purchases since May,

markets tracked by Bloomberg. The Sensex rose 1.7 percent last
week, its third week of gains, as investors bet the  Federal

mortgage lender, erased an intraday loss of 1.9 percent after
saying profit climbed to 12.7 billion rupees in the September
quarter. That compared with the 12.5 billion-rupee median of 30
analyst estimates compiled by the Bloomberg.  Federal Bank Ltd. (FB)  surged 10 percent to a three-month high
