Blumont Group Ltd. (BLUM) , Asiasons Capital
Ltd. and  LionGold Corp. (LIGO)  surged after Singapore Exchange Ltd.
ended restrictions imposed on the commodity stocks.  Blumont jumped 65 percent to 22 Singapore cents as of 9:03
a.m. local time, set for the biggest gain in more than four
years. Asiasons rose 76 percent, set for a record advance, and
LionGold climbed 60 percent.  The shares slumped at least 87 percent in the three trading
days through Oct. 8, wiping $6.9 billion from the combined
market value of the companies. SGX declared them designated
securities on Oct. 6, meaning investors were barred from selling
the shares unless they held the same quantity of stock.  “The designation of the stocks and its ending are done in
the interest of the investing public and the market,” the
exchange said Oct. 18. “SGX will continue to monitor closely
the trading activities in the marketplace.”  The lifting of the restrictions is because trading has
become more stable, Kelvin Koh, head of market surveillance at
SGX, said at a media briefing on Oct. 18.  Asiasons (ACAP)  tumbled 96 percent over the three trading days
through Oct. 8, while LionGold plunged 87 percent over the
three-day period. Blumont, which invests in minerals and energy,
slumped 94 percent over two trading days on Oct. 4 and Oct. 7.  SGX plans to add circuit breakers by early next year, it
said after the shares plunged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
