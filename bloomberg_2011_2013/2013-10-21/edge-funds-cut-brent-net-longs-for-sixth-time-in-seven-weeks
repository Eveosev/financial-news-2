Hedge funds  and other money managers
cut  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  for the sixth time in seven
weeks, according to ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 162,012 lots in
the week ended Oct. 15, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. That’s a reduction of
2,982 contracts, or 1.8 percent, from the previous week.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 322,007, a 2.8
percent decrease in their net-short from Oct. 8.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Brent futures slipped 0.2 percent to $109.96 a barrel in
the week to Oct. 15 and traded at $109.69 as of 12:26 p.m. local
time today on the ICE exchange.  Swaps dealers reduced net-long positions in Brent by 1.9
percent to 178,359.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European gasoil fell by
0.3 percent to 71,883 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
