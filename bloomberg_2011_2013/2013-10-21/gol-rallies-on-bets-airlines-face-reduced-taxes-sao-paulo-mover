Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
Brazil’s second-biggest air carrier by market share, rallied on
speculation the government will cut taxes for airlines.  The  shares  climbed 6.5 percent to 11.23 reais at the close
in Sao Paulo, the biggest gain since Sept. 13. The advance was
the best performance after  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) 
on the benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV)  gauge, which added 1.3 percent.  Traders are betting the government will reduce levies on
jet fuel and cut trim taxes that fund the Brazilian social
security system, according to Sandro Fernandes, a trader at the
brokerage firm Geraldo Correa. Sao Paulo-based Gol posted  losses 
in seven of the past eight quarters.  “Rumors have been spreading for some days, but today’s
rally may mean that an effective measure is about to be
released,” Fernandes said in a telephone interview from  Belo
Horizonte , Brazil.  Gol has fallen 13 percent this year as the real tumbled in
August to a 4 1/2-year low, driving up the cost of dollar-denominated expenses such as fuel, plane leases and debt
payments. The currency has climbed 12 percent since Aug. 22,
when the government announced a $60 billion intervention program
to boost the real and curb import price increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
