Chicago  gasoline weakened to a two-month low relative to  New York  futures as stockpiles climbed to
a  three-year seasonal high  and refineries completed work.  Conventional,  85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago slid
2 cents to 12.5 cents a gallon below futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 2:36 p.m., the  lowest since  Aug. 16 and a
third consecutive daily decline.  The differential widened after a government report showed
 stockpiles of gasoline  in the Midwest, known as PADD 2, climbed
223,000 barrels to 49.5 million barrels in the week ended Oct.
11, the highest for the time of year since 2010, according to
U.S. Energy Information Administration data.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s 356,000-barrel-a-day Wood River,  Illinois ,
refinery completed planned maintenance that began around Oct. 7,
while  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) ’s Catlettsburg, Kentucky, plant
was expected to restart a unit over the weekend. The refineries
have a combined capacity of about 596,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel  in Chicago climbed 0.75 cent
to 9.5 cents a gallon below New York diesel futures. The  3-2-1
crack spread  for refiners in the region, a rough margin for
gasoline and diesel fuel based on West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , rose 31 cents to $12.47 a barrel, a second
consecutive advance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  CBOB in the Gulf Coast fell 2.25 cents to 19.5 cents a
gallon below futures, the lowest level since Sept. 10.
Reformulated, 84-octane in New York Harbor slipped 0.05 cent to
a premium of 1.2 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
