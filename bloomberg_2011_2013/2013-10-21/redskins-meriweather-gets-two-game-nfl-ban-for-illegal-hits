Brandon Meriweather of the
Washington Redskins was suspended two games for repeat
violations of the National Football League’s rules prohibiting
hits to the head and neck area of defenseless players.  Meriweather was fined $42,000 for an illegal hit in the
Redskins’ Week 2 game against the Green Bay Packers, and had two
more violations in a win this past weekend against the Chicago
Bears.  The Redskins’ safety was penalized for unnecessary
roughness in the third quarter of the Oct. 20 game for a
forcible helmet-to-helmet hit on a defenseless receiver, and was
flagged again in the fourth quarter for a forcible hit to the
head and neck area of a defenseless receiver.  Meriweather, who has until Oct. 24 to appeal the
suspension, would miss the Redskins’ games against the Denver
Broncos on Oct. 27 and against the San Diego Chargers the
following week. He can’t practice or participate in any football
activities during the ban, which ends Nov. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
