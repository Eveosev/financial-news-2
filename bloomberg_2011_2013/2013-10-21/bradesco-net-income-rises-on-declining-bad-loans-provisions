Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ,  Latin America ’s
second-biggest bank by market value, said profit rose 6.5
percent in the third quarter, matching estimates, as it set
aside less money to cover bad loans.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time items, climbed
to 3.08 billion reais ($1.42 billion) from 2.89 billion reais, a
year earlier, the Osasco, Brazil-based lender said today in a
statement. That compares with the 3.09 billion-real  median
estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bradesco, led by Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi, 62, reduced provisions as the nation’s
unemployment rate fell to a  eight-month low  of 5.3 percent in
August. Bradesco had provisions of 2.88 billion reais in the
third quarter, down 13 percent from a year earlier, while its
portfolio of loans expanded 11 percent to 412.6 billion reais.
Debt payments overdue more than 90 days slowed to 3.6 percent in
the third quarter from 3.7 percent at the end of June and 4.1
percent a year earlier.  Bradesco  rose  3.4 percent this year, compared with a 9
percent decline for the Ibovespa benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
