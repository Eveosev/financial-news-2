(Corrects nature of project in headline.)  A joint venture between  Mitsui &
Co. (8031) ,  Marubeni Corp. (8002) , and  SoftBank Corp. (9984) ’s renewable energy unit
won a contract to build transmission lines on Hokkaido to
increase wind power capacity in a government pilot project.  Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a Tokyo-based clean energy
developer, was chosen for a separate contract for the same
project, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said today
in a  statement .  “The project is intended to service and identify technical
issues in areas that are suitable for wind power generation with
weak transmission networks,” the ministry said.  METI will cover half of the total project costs, according
to an application for the subsidy issued in September. The
ministry has allocated 25 billion yen ($255 million) for the
project for the year ending March 31, according to its website.  Japan  is seeking to diversify its energy mix after the 2011
Fukushima nuclear crisis. The country began an incentive program
for clean energy in July 2012 which boosted mostly solar energy
among the five types of renewables covered by the program. Solar
plants typically require less time to build compared with wind
and geothermal.  The joint venture comprising the two Japanese trading
companies and SB Energy Corp., all based in  Tokyo , will cover an
area around Mashike town where wind capacity is estimated to be
between 300 megawatts and 600 megawatts, according to the
statement. Eurus Energy will be in charge of an area around
Wakkanai, with wind potential of up to 1,400 megawatts.  Japan’s installed wind capacity is 2,614 megawatts, ranked
13th in the world, data from Global Wind Report 2012 by the
Global Wind Energy Council show.  China  has the largest capacity
of 75,324 megawatts followed by the U.S. with 60,007 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
