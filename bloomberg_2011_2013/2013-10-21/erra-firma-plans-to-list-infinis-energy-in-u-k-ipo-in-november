Infinis Energy Plc plans to list in
 London  in November following an initial public offering to allow
owner Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. to realize part of its
investment in the U.K.â€™s third-biggest renewable power producer.  Infinis plans to offer a dividend of 55 million pounds ($89
million) in the year ending March 2015, its first full financial
year following the IPO, the company said today in a statement.  Terra Firma will seek an enterprise value, including debt,
of about 1.5 billion pounds in the IPO, said two people with
knowledge of the deal who asked not to be identified as the
details are private. A spokesman for Infinis in London declined
to comment on the valuation sought for the company.  Infinis had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of 125 million pounds on sales of 226 million
pounds for the year ended March 2013. Barclays Bank Plc, Deutsche
Bank AG and Royal Bank of Canada are among managers of the sale.  European issuers have raised about $17 billion in IPOs this
year, compared with $10 billion in the same period in 2012, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Just Retirement Holdings Ltd. and
Merlin Entertainments Group Ltd. are among those attempting to
sell shares amid rising investor interest in regional markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
