China’s  yuan  advanced for a sixth
day, the longest winning streak since May, after the central
bank strengthened the currency’s reference rate to a record.  The government called for “unrelenting” implementation of
its economic policies and reforms to consolidate the nation’s
recovery from a slowdown, according to a State Council statement
released over the weekend. Asia’s largest economy grew 7.8
percent in the three months through September from a year
earlier, from 7.5 percent in the previous quarter, data showed
on Oct. 18. The yuan was 0.3 percent off the upper limit of the
1 percent band in which it’s allowed to trade from the central
bank’s daily fixing each day, compared with about 0.7 percent on
Oct. 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The currency advanced 0.07 percent to 6.0925 per dollar at
the close in  Shanghai , China Foreign Exchange Trade System
prices show. It touched 6.0915 on Oct. 18, the strongest level
since the government unified the official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993.  “Expectations for appreciation are building up,” said
Andy Ji, a foreign-exchange strategist in Singapore at
Commonwealth Bank of  Australia . “Today’s fixing is probably to
relieve the pressure for intervention. Otherwise, they have to
buy a lot of U.S. dollars.”  Concern over the U.S. government shutdown increased demand
for the yuan, forcing policy makers to raise the daily fixing
rate since early September, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
economists led by Hong Kong-based Ting Lu wrote in an Oct. 18
research report. The People’s Bank of  China  boosted the
 reference  rate by 0.03 percent to 6.1352 per dollar today, the
strongest since a peg to the greenback was removed in July 2005.  Forwards, Offshore  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.02 percent to
6.1530 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts are trading at a 1 percent  discount  to
the onshore spot rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.0884, compared with 6.0893 on Oct. 18, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility in the
onshore yuan, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, slipped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
