“Betrayal” is hot, but Shakespeare is coming in on the outside as the  Harold Pinter  revival enjoys a pre-opening sales surge and the latest Broadway entry by the Bard of Avon makes a strong debut.  “Betrayal,” with  Daniel Craig  and his wife,  Rachel Weisz , sold $1.3 million of tickets last week, according to figures from the Broadway League. It was up 12 percent as the production added an eighth preview, from seven the previous week. The play officially opens on Oct. 27.  All-male productions of “Twelfth Night” and “Richard III,” both starring two-time Tony Award winner Mark Rylance, sold $468,000 as the alternating program had its first six previews prior to a Nov. 10 opening.  “ Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark ” declined 10 percent to $857,000, the ninth consecutive week of sales below its expenses of roughly $1 million. Average weekly sales in 2012 were $1.5 million.  “A Time to Kill,” Rupert Holmes’s adaptation of the  John Grisham  novel, opened to mixed reviews on Sunday and did a muted $251,000.  In its first three previews over the weekend, the Harlem jazz revue “After Midnight” took in $236,000. “The Glass Menagerie” was little changed, playing to capacity at $722,000.  ‘Fun Home’  Opening tonight at off-Broadway’s  Public Theater  is “Fun Home,” a dramedy with music by  Jeanine Tesori  and book and lyrics by Lisa Kron. It’s based on Alison Bechdel’s best-selling graphic novel about a funeral-home-owning family’s issues with sexual identity.  “Caroline, Or Change,” Tesori’s collaboration with Tony Kushner, began at the Public a decade ago and transferred to Broadway.  “Fun Home” is “selling really well,” a Public spokeswoman said in an e-mail.
