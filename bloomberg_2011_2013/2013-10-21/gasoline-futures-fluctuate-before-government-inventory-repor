Gasoline fluctuated before the first
government inventory report since Oct. 10, which is projected to
show motor fuel inventories declined while crude stocks jumped.  Futures swung between gains and losses before the Energy
Information Administration report scheduled for 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington . The EIA will probably say gasoline  supplies  fell 1
million barrels in the week ended Oct. 11 while crude stockpiles
rose 3 million, according to the median estimate of nine
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg. Gasoline crack spreads
widened as  Scotland ’s only refinery is shut because of a strike.  “There’s more than adequate crude supplies and the market
is expecting another large build,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Gasoline is being
supported by the closing of the Grangemouth refinery and the
consensus is for a decline in inventories.”  Gasoline for November delivery rose 0.28 cent to $2.676 a
gallon at 9:56 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
swung between $2.658 and $2.6779. Trading volume was 67 percent
below the 100-day average.  The EIA report, scheduled to be released Oct. 17, was
delayed because federal workers were furloughed for 16 days
during a partial government shutdown that ended Oct. 16. The
report for supplies in the week ended Oct. 18 will be released
on Oct. 23.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 94 cents
to $12.40 a barrel. The  premium  to Brent rose 31 cents to $2 a
barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to $3.349 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 32.7 cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery rose 0.02
cent to $3.0355 a gallon on trading volume that was 10 percent
above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI widened 78 cents to $27.46 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent climbed 10 cents to $17.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
