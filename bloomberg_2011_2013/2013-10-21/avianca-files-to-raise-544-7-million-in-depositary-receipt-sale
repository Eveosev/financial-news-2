Avianca Holdings SA filed to raise
as much as $544.7 million in a share sale in the U.S. as the
Colombian airline seeks funds to help pay for about 100 planes
over the next six years.  The company  said  it will offer about 27.2 million American
depositary receipts for $17 to $20 a piece, each of which
represents eight preferred shares. The shares closed at 4,010
pesos in Bogota on Oct. 18, giving eight of them a value of
about $17.05.  The Bogota-based airline plans to use proceeds from the
offering to buy new planes, including up to 15 Boeing Co. 787
Dreamliners, according to the filing.  Chairman German Efromovich, along with his brother Jose,
controls about 70 percent of Aviancaâ€™s voting shares through
their closely held Synergy Aerospace Corp. They will hold a
stake equivalent to 78 percent of the common stock after the
share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
