The ruble moved between gains and
losses after  Russia ’s central bank said it didn’t intervene to
stem the currency’s declines for the first time since May.  The ruble climbed as much as 0.2 percent and weakened 0.1
percent before trading little changed against Bank Rossii’s
target basket of dollars and euros at 37.1976 by 1:08 p.m. in
Moscow. The yield on  government bonds  due February 2027 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.61 percent.  Bank Rossii, which announces interventions data with a lag,
didn’t buy or sell foreign currency on Oct. 17, it said today.
The central bank  spent  more than $19 billion in 100 trading
sessions since May 29 to smooth exchange-rate volatility, the
regulator’s data show. Bank Rossii has pared back interventions
as it prepares to switch to a free-floating currency in 2015.
Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, declined 0.2 percent to
$109.75 a barrel in  London .  “It’s too early to speak of stabilization on the  currency
markets ,” Denis Poryvay and Maria Pomelnikova, analysts at ZAO
Raiffeisenbank in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed note.  The ruble traded little changed against the dollar at
31.9245 and was steady against the euro at 43.6420.  The monthly tax period continues today in Russia with
value-added and water taxes. Companies face about 900 billion
rubles ($28 billion) of taxes this month, according to Vladimir Miklashevsky, a trading strategist at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Helsinki.  The  Finance Ministry  plans to announce the volume and tenor
of notes it will offer at auctions on Oct. 23. The ministry sold
14.7 billion rubles of bonds due Aug. 2023 and 11.6 billion
rubles of notes due Jan. 2018 last week.  “Demand has returned mainly to long-term issues,” Olga Sterina, an analyst at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said in a note
to clients. “The ministry will offer notes with a duration of
at least 10 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
