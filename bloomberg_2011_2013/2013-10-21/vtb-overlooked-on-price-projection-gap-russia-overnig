VTB Group is trailing the average
analyst target for the stock by the most among eastern European
lenders, a sign to Veles Capital and Sovlink Securities that
 Russia ’s second-largest bank is undervalued.  Analysts’ price target on VTB’s Moscow-listed share is 48
percent above the stock price, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Futures on VTB’s Moscow-listed stock lost 0.7 percent by 12:46
p.m. in Moscow. The lender’s global depositary receipts advanced
3.2 percent last week in  London  to $2.73, the highest level
since Sept. 23. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the
most-traded Russian shares in the U.S. rose to an eight-month
high as RTS Index  futures  slipped in U.S. hours.  VTB has dropped 19 percent this year after second-quarter
profit missed estimates, while OAO Sberbank, the nation’s
largest lender, has rallied 13 percent. The drop sent valuations
to 5 times estimated earnings, a 44 percent discount to the
average multiple for companies on the MSCI Emerging Market Banks
Index. Seven of 11  analysts  covering VTB recommend buying the
shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “VTB enjoys all the privileges of a major  state bank  in
Russia, meaning lower risks and easier access to capital,” Olga Belenkaya, an analyst at Sovlink Securities in Moscow, said in a
telephone interview Oct. 18. She has a hold recommendation on
the bank’s London-listed stock. “And yet somehow the market
overlooks that.”  Analysts’ buy ratings on VTB Group’s Moscow-listed stock
increased to the highest level since February 2009, while
Sberbank’s buy ratings fell to a three-year low this month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Belenkaya’s target price on VTB’s London-listed GDRs
implies a 25 percent gain. The depositary receipts dropped 0.6
percent to $2.719 in London, while the Moscow-listed shares
declined 0.1 percent to 0.04325 rubles today.  ‘Sberbank’s Shadow’  “VTB has been hiding in Sberbank’s shadow,” Ivan Manaenko, head of research at Veles Capital in Moscow, said by
phone Oct. 18. “It has been undervalued by the market. VTB has
a lot of potential for growth, the problem is that it lacks
triggers for a rally.”  Investors were concerned VTB exposed itself to additional
risks when it bought non-banking assets, including the purchase
of mobile phone company Tele2 Russia Holding AB for $3.55
billion in the spring, both Manaenko and Belenkaya said. The
bank, which had pledged to cut its stake in Tele2 to below a
controlling level by next March, sold 50 percent of the carrier
Tele 2 to Yury Kovalchuk, an ally of President  Vladimir Putin ,
according to the bank’s Oct. 17 statement.  Bad Loans  VTB said Sept. 12 that second-quarter  profit  missed
estimates as it increased provisions to cover problem loans.  American depositary receipts of Sberbank added 3.2 percent
last week to $13.15, the highest level since May. The  stock 
added 2.5 percent last week in Moscow to 103.35 rubles, or
$3.24. Each ADR represents four shares.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose for a third week,
adding 1.7 percent to $29.93. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in the index futures, fell 1 percent to
20.96, while RTS Index futures expiring in December declined 0.2
percent to 151,380 in U.S. hours.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , Russia’s third-biggest cell phone company
by subscribers, rallied 6.8 percent last week to $13.11, the
highest level since June 2011. Trading volume on Oct. 18 was 29
percent higher than the average daily level for the past three
months in  New York . It posted the biggest increase on the
Bloomberg Russia-US gauge last week.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY) , Russia’s biggest gold
producer, added 3.6 percent to $3.15 on Oct. 18 in New York. It
climbed 4.7 percent last week, the biggest advance since
January. Polyus, in which billionaire Suleiman Kerimov holds 40
percent, said in an Oct. 18 statement that sales of the metal
rose 21 percent in the third quarter from a year ago.  United Co. Rusal (486) , a Moscow-based aluminum producer, dropped
0.4 percent to HK$2.29 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:41 a.m.
local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
