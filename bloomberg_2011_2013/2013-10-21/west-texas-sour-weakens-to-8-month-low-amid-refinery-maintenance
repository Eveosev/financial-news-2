West Texas Sour crude weakened to an
eight-month low relative to the U.S. benchmark as refinery
maintenance along the  Gulf Coast  reduced demand for Permian
Basin oil.  WTS, a low-density, high-sulfur grade, fell $1 to a $8-a-barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma,
at 4:11 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the
largest discount since Jan. 25.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  is performing maintenance at its 146,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Borger, Texas,  Rich Johnson , a Houston-based company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement Oct. 18.
The plant may be forced to keep a fluid catalytic cracker shut
for at least two weeks for repairs, a person with knowledge of
the situation said Oct. 18.  Flint Hills Resources LLC,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and Motiva
Enterprises LLC are among companies said to be planning work
this month at Texas and Louisiana plants with a combined
capacity to process more than 2.3 million barrels of crude a
day.  West Texas Intermediate in Midland  also weakened relative
to its counterpart in Cushing, falling $1.25 to a discount of
$6.75 a barrel.  WTS and WTI in Midland are both crudes from the Permian
Basin, the largest oil field in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
