Co-Operative Bank Plc, the U.K.
lender seeking to raise capital after losses, said it will set
aside as much as 105 million pounds ($170 million) more to cover
costs related to client redress.  The 100 million pounds to 105 million pounds of additional
provisions relate to the cost of compensating clients who were
sold payment-protection insurance they didn’t need and other
additional provisions, Manchester, England-based Co-Operative
Bank said in a statement today. The lender said it’s still
working on its recapitalization plan and will disclose further
information “shortly.”  Co-Operative Bank is being pushed by regulators to bolster
capital by the end of 2014 after the failure of its bid for 632
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  branches exposed a shortfall of 1.5
billion pounds. The lender has said it plans to raise 500
million pounds by asking existing bondholders to exchange
subordinated debt for new equity and senior debt as part of a
plan to plug the shortfall.  Bondholders have told Co-Operative Bank they oppose that
plan, and Co-Operative Group Ltd., the bank’s customer-owned
parent, may lose control of the lender, the  BBC  reported on its
website today, without saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
