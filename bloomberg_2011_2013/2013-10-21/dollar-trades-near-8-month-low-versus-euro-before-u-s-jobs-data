The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index held
a gain from yesterday before a report analysts said will show
employers last month added the most jobs since April, boosting
the case for the Federal Reserve to cut its stimulus program.  The greenback rose against the yen before the data, which
was delayed by a 16-day government shutdown. Chicago Fed
President Charles Evans said the disruption will probably cause
the central bank to delay plans to taper its stimulus program
that tends to debase the dollar. A gauge of  currency-market
volatility  slid to the least since January. Norway’s krone slid
as SEB AB revised down its forecast for Norwegian growth.  “Attention is on the payrolls report, and the dollar is in
focus,” said Antje Praefcke, a senior currency strategist at
Commerzbank in  Frankfurt . “The number needs to be very, very
good to change the market perception of the impact of the
shutdown. With the focus on U.S. monetary policy, many people
have changed their expectations regarding the Fed’s stimulus and
that means a weaker dollar.”  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index climbed less than 0.1
percent to 1,004.95 at 6:43 a.m.  New York  time after advancing
0.2 percent yesterday. The gauge reached 1,002.65 on Oct. 17,
the lowest close since Feb. 19.  The U.S. currency was little changed at $1.3673 per euro,
after touching $1.3704 on Oct. 18, the weakest since Feb. 1. The
greenback rose 0.2 percent to 98.38 yen. The Japanese currency
fell 0.1 percent to 134.50 per euro after reaching 134.54, the
weakest since Sept. 23.  Payroll Report  Payrolls rose by 180,000 last month, the most since April,
after a 169,000 gain in August, according to the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report was originally
slated for Oct. 4 and will instead be released by the Labor
Department at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The shutdown may have trimmed fourth-quarter growth by 0.6
percent, according to Standard & Poor’s. Fed policy makers will
probably wait until March to begin trimming stimulus, a
Bloomberg survey of analysts showed last week. A separate survey
last month forecast the first reduction would be in December.  “It may be easier to dismiss a strong release as relating
to a pre-shutdown economy and, as such, a weak report would
probably provoke a larger market reaction,” Adam Cole, head of
Group-of-10 currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada wrote in a
note to clients.  Volatility Index  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G-7 FX Volatility Index fell to 7.60
percent, the lowest level since Jan. 8. One-month implied
volatility for the dollar-yen rate slid to 8.91 percent, the
least since Jan. 4.  “Investors are hesitant to take positions ahead of the
U.S. jobs data,” said Noriaki Murao, the New York-based
managing director of the marketing group for financial markets
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  The U.S. dollar declined 2.8 percent in the past three
months, making it the second-worst performer in a basket of 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. Norway’s krone is the worst performer,
declining 3.1 percent. The euro climbed 1.2 percent, while the
yen slid 1.3 percent.  Norway’s krone weakened after SEB AB said in a note to
clients that mainland gross domestic product will grow 1.8
percent in 2013, 0.3 percentage point below a previous forecast
released in August. The nation’s central bank will raise
interest rates in September rather than in June, analysts at the
Swedish bank wrote.  “The revisions are first and foremost due to slower growth
in private consumption, which nonetheless should pick up
somewhat in 2014,” the analysts wrote. “Norges Bank is likely
to broadly stick to its current assessment at the two remaining
meetings this year. While we still expect a hike next summer, we
now see a move in September as most likely and subsequent hikes
should be very gradual.”  The krone slid 0.5 percent to 5.9496 per dollar and
depreciated 0.4 percent to 8.1345 per euro. Sweden’s krona
declined 0.2 percent to 6.4095 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
