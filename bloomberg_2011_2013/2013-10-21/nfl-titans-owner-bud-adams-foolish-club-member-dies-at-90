Tennessee  Titans owner K.S. “Bud”
Adams died at his home in Houston this morning, the National
Football League team said in a statement. He was 90.  Adams helped found the American Football League 54 years
ago as a member of the self-proclaimed “Foolish Club” of eight
men who’d been denied NFL franchises. His  Houston Oilers  won two
AFL titles before the leagues merged in 1966.  In 1995, after a feud with Houston over using public money
for a new stadium, Adams reached an agreement to move the team
to Tennessee, renaming the club beginning in the 1999 season.  Adams’ death comes three days after that of former Oilers
coach Bum Phillips, also 90. Phillips led the Oilers to two
American Football Conference championship games.  Adams served in the Navy during World War II before
founding the ADA Oil Company, a forerunner of  Adams Resources &
Energy Inc. (AE)  His wife of 62 years, Nancy, died in 2009. They had
two daughters, Susie Smith and Amy Strunk; a son, Kenneth S.
Adams III, who is deceased; and seven grandchildren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
