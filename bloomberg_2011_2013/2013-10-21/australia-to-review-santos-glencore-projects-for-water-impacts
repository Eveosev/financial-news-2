Coal and coal-seam gas projects in
 Australia  planned by  Santos Ltd. (STO) , Arrow Energy Ltd., Hancock
Prospecting Pty Ltd. and  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)  must face a
federal environmental review of their impact on water, filings
with the Australian government show.  Environment Minister Greg Hunt’s decisions on the projects
were dated Oct. 17 and lodged on the department’s website. Hunt
said Sept. 26 that 47 projects will be assessed for their impact
on water before they can gain government approval.  Arrow Energy, based in Brisbane, is owned by Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and PetroChina Co.  Link to website:  http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/   To contact the reporter on this story:
