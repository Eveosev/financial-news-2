Crude options volatility rose as
futures slipped below a $100 a barrel amid rising stockpiles.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
19.79 percent at 2:20 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
from 19.06 percent on Oct. 18. Put options protecting against a
10 percent drop in prices increased to 26.56 percent from 25.4.  “We’ve crossed the Rubicon when we crossed that $100 a
barrel threshold,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Now the fundamentals are heavy
and people are starting to try to protect their oil position on
the downside.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery fell
$1.43, or 1.4 percent, to $99.68 a barrel on the Nymex. Futures

11, the highest level in three months.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for the
