The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will
rise past 1,800 as earnings and the U.S. economy improve,
 Michael Shaoul , the chairman and chief executive officer of New
York-based Marketfield Asset Management LLC, told Bloomberg TV.  “We feel pretty good about equities,” said Shaoul in an
interview from New York. “Corporate earnings point to a re-accelerating domestic economy. 1,800 is attainable.” He did not
specify a time frame.  The benchmark U.S. equities gauge yesterday rose to
1,744.66, extending a record high as economists pushed back
expectations as to when the Federal Reserve will reduce record
stimulus and investors await jobs data delayed by the U.S.
government shutdown.  The investment advisory firm’s $16.7 billion flagship
 MainStay Marketfield Fund (MFLDX)  climbed 15 percent this year and has
beaten returns of 99 percent of its peers in the past three
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
