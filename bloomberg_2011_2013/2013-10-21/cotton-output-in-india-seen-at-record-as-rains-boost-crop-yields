Cotton harvest in  India , the world’s
second-largest producer, is poised to reach a record this year
as the best rains in six years boost yields.  Output may jump 6.7 percent to 38.1 million bales of 170
kilograms (375 pounds) each in the crop year that began on Oct.
1 from 37.5 million bales estimated in September and 35.7
million bales in 2012-2013, the  Cotton Association of India  said
in an e-mailed statement today.  A record Indian crop may increase exportable surplus,
adding to global supplies and capping a 11 percent gain in
prices in New York this year. World reserves are estimated to
expand to 20.3 million metric tons by July 31 from 19.22 million
tons estimated a month before, the  International Cotton Advisory
Committee  said on Oct. 10.  “The available moisture is likely to help increase the
yields and result in a larger than estimated crop,” said Dhiren Sheth, president of the association.  The monsoon, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the
country’s annual rainfall, was the highest since 2007 during the
June-September period, according to the  India Meteorological
Department . The showers eased a drought that cut production the
previous year.  “Exports may be similar to what we saw last year,” said
Sheth. “We have already contracted to export 1.5 million bales
of the new crop.”  Shipments totaled 9.8 million bales in 2012-2013, mainly to
 China , according to the association. Surplus is pegged at 13.75
million bales for this year, it said. Domestic consumption may
climb to 26 million bales from 24.7 million bales last season,
while imports are seen dropping to 1.2 million bales from 1.6
million bales, it said.  Cotton for December delivery was little changed at 83.20
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  at 2:09 p.m in
Mumbai. Futures tumbled 18 percent last year, extending a 37
drop in 2011. The contract for delivery in April on the National
Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. in Mumbai was unchanged at
994.50 rupees ($16.2) per 20 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
