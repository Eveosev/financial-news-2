Brazil ’s real fell as the central
bank studied demand for foreign-exchange swap rollover auctions,
indicating it may pare back support for the currency.  The real depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.1746 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:23 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . Swap rates on contracts due in
January 2015 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 10.53 percent.  The central bank said in a statement on its website that it
will consider today whether the market supports holding auctions
tomorrow and Oct. 23 and 24 to roll over $8.9 billion in
currency swaps. The real has rallied 12 percent since policy
makers announced on Aug. 22 a $60 billion program of currency
swap and credit line offerings to support the currency and curb
import price increases. That is the biggest gain among all of
the world’s currencies, making exports more expensive.  “The central bank’s study opens the door to not rolling
over the swaps, which generates speculation,”  Luciano Rostagno ,
the chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brasil in Sao Paulo,
said in a telephone interview. “The real has strengthened a
lot, and there’s the government’s perception that it’s not
benefiting exports.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
