Chelsea manager  Jose Mourinho  was
charged with improper conduct by English soccer’s governing body
after being sent to the stands during his team’s 4-1 win against
Cardiff City three days ago.  Mourinho was ordered from the technical area by referee
Anthony Taylor after protesting about what he said was time-wasting by Cardiff, and sat with supporters for the final 20
minutes of the Premier League match.  The Football Association said last night in an e-mailed
statement that Mourinho has until 6 p.m. on Oct. 24 to respond
to the charge, which could result in a reprimand, fine or
suspension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
