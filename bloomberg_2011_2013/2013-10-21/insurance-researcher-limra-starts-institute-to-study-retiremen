 Limra  and Loma are starting a unit to study retirement trends as
more people get set to leave the workforce.  The Limra-Loma Secure Retirement Institute will conduct
studies on savings by individuals and products and services
offered by financial firms, Bob Kerzner, the chief executive
officer of the two groups, said in an interview last week.  “We’re looking a lot deeper at some of the institutional
parts of the business,” Kerzner said. “We think you’re going
to need a lot of research to understand this ever-changing
world, and that we’re in a unique position to provide that.”  Limra already gathers data on annuities and life insurance
sales, and  Loma  provides training for financial-services
workers. The organization has added staff to conduct the
research, Mark Morris, a Limra spokesman, said in an e-mail. He
declined to give specific figures.  Kerzner is set to announce the initiative at Limra’s  annual
conference  this week in New York. Limra estimates that the U.S.
population 55 and older will have about $22 trillion in
investible assets by 2020, up from $12 trillion in 2010.  SRI’s research agenda includes studies on institutional
retirement plans, pension risk-transfers and annuity features.
The organization will also examine retirement planning among
younger people.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) 
have representatives on the board, which will help decide what
to research, Morris said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
