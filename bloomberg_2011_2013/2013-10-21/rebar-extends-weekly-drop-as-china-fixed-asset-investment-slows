Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  extended a weekly drop as  China ’s fixed asset
investment dipped and industrial production slowed.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,551 yuan ($582) a
metric ton and was at 3,559 yuan at 10:44 a.m. local time. The
most-active contract lost 0.9 percent last week, the first such
drop in three weeks.  China’s  fixed asset investment , the main driver for
building-material demand, rose 20.2 percent in January through
September, compared with a 20.3 percent rise the year through
August, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Oct. 18.
Industrial production grew 10.2 percent in September, down from
10.4 percent in August, according to the statistics bureau.  “Although data last Friday confirmed China’s economy is
rebounding, there’s now concern about the dip in fixed asset
investment and its impact on future building material demand,”
said Dang Man, an analyst at Maike Futures Co. in Xi’an.  The spot price of rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,499  yuan  a
ton on Oct. 18, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  Iron ore for May delivery, the most-active contract by
volume on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, fell 1.4 percent to 963
yuan a ton.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port gained 1
percent last week to $134.40 a dry ton on Oct. 18, the highest
since Sept. 13, according to a price index compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
