Croatia ’s government revised its
2012 budget gap to 5 percent of gross domestic product, from an
earlier estimate of 3.4 percent, as the European Union’s newest
member began using the bloc’s methodology for the first time.  The government expects the bigger estimate to trigger the
European Union’s monitoring system of budget offenders, which
applies to economies in which budget gap exceeds 3 percent of
GDP, Marko Kristof, head of the statistics office, told
reporters in Zagreb today.  “Based on this data, the European Commission is expected
to start the excessive deficit procedure,” Kristof said. The
wider figure includes state guarantees for Croatia’s shipyards
and the recapitalization of state companies, he said.  Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic ’s 22-month-old government
will preside over a budget gap expansion to 5.5 percent of
economic output in 2014, from an estimated 3.5 percent this
year, according to a Finance Ministry outlook released last
month.  The Adriatic state has been hobbled by four years of
contraction or stagnation and is weighed down by rising interest
payments, state company debts and higher salaries and pension
payouts. This year’s growth was cut to 0.2 percent from a
prediction of 0.7 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
