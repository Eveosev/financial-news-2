U.K. government bonds fell for the
first time in three days after a gauge of  house prices  rose this
month by the most since February, adding to signs the recovery
is gaining momentum and damping demand for the safest assets.  Implied  interest rates  on short-sterling futures rose
before data this week that analysts said will show the U.K.
economy expanded at a faster pace in the third quarter. Bank of
England policy maker Ben Broadbent said central-bank officials
will only consider raising interest rates once the recovery is
secure. The pound fell against the dollar on speculation data
tomorrow will show U.S. employers added the most jobs since
April. The U.K. sells 2068 gilts via banks this week.  “Gilts are likely to continue to underperform given the
U.K. growth momentum,” said Peter Osler, head of interest-rate
strategy at broker Marex Spectron Group Ltd. in  London . “I
guess you can argue that the interest-rate curve is already
ahead of where the Bank of England wants it to be.”  The yield on five-year gilts rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.56 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time.
The 1.25 percent security due July 2018 dropped 0.12, or 1.20
pence per 1,000-pound ($1,615) face amount, to 98.595. The 10-year gilt yield climbed two basis points to 2.74 percent.  Home values climbed 2.8 percent in October after declining
1.5 percent last month, property-website operator  Rightmove Plc (RMV) 
said.  Gross domestic product  advanced 0.8 percent in the third
quarter, according to a Bloomberg News survey before the Office
the data on Friday.  Property Demand  Demand for property has been boosted by a government
program to help Britons buy a home with a deposit of as little
as 5 percent. At the same time, the  Bank of England  has said it
won’t consider raising its benchmark interest rate from 0.5
percent at least until unemployment falls to 7 percent from 7.7
percent currently, a level it doesn’t expect until 2016.  Gilts lost 3 percent this year through Oct. 18, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries dropped 2.1 percent
and German bonds declined 1.8 percent.  Implied rates on the short-sterling futures contract
maturing in March rose one basis point to 0.59 percent.  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to $1.6157 after rising to
$1.6225 on Oct. 18, the highest level since Oct. 3. It was
little changed at 84.65 pence per euro after strengthening to
84.51 pence.  The dollar advanced against all but one of its 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. U.S. employers added 180,000
workers in September from 169,000 in August, according to the
median estimate of analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News ,
indicating the economy was gaining momentum before the shutdown.
The data will be published tomorrow.  Sterling appreciated 5.2 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro strengthened
3.8 percent, while the dollar weakened 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
