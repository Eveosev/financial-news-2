Australia ’s dollar snapped an eight-day advance as a technical gauge signaled the currency was
poised for a reversal.  The 14-day relative-strength index for the Aussie climbed
to 77 on Oct. 18, a level unseen since May 2011. Australia’s
bonds rose for a third day after speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will put off tapering stimulus sent U.S. yields to
almost a three-month low. Demand for New Zealand’s kiwi dollar
was bolstered after data showed net immigration climbed to a
decade high in the smaller nation.  “The Aussie will struggle from here towards parity” with
the dollar, said Hideki Shibata, a senior interest-rate and
currencies strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center Co.
“Relative-strength indexes are often used as a trigger for
profit taking by those who are long a certain currency.”  The Aussie was little changed at 96.73 U.S. cents at 4:59
p.m. in Sydney after rising 2.7 percent in the eight sessions
through Oct. 18. It earlier touched 96.79, the strongest since
June 4.  New Zealand ’s dollar lost 0.1 percent to 84.93 U.S.
cents.  The RSI gauge for the kiwi versus the  U.S. dollar  advanced
to 73 last week.  The Fed will delay the first reduction in its bond
purchases until March after the partial government shutdown
slowed fourth-quarter growth and interrupted the flow of data,
economists said. Policy makers will pare the monthly pace of
asset buying to $70 billion from $85 billion at their March
18-19 meeting, according to the median of 40 responses in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists conducted Oct. 17-18.  Australian Bonds  Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields dropped to as low as 2.54
percent in  New York  on Oct. 18, the least since July 24.  Yields (GACGB10) 
on similar-maturity Australian government debt fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.08 percent today.  In New Zealand, permanent arrivals exceeded departures by
2,740 in September, the most since July 2003, the statistics
bureau  said  in its International Travel and Migration report.
The seasonally adjusted net loss of 800 migrants to Australia
last month was the smallest since September 2003.  “We did have some quite strong New Zealand migration
figures, which actually tell the story of New Zealanders turning
for New Zealand from Australia after a long period of the flip
side, which, I guess, does reinforce the story of fundamentals
favoring the kiwi,” said Mike Jones, a currency strategist in
Wellington at Bank of New Zealand Ltd.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at NZ$1.1387 per
Aussie. It touched NZ$1.12 on Aug. 1, the strongest since
October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
