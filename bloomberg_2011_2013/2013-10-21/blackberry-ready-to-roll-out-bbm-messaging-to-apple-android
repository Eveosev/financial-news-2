BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY) ’s BBM instant-messaging system is rolling out to users of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android, following a hitch that suspended the
software’s introduction last month.  “We are about to officially resume our rollout of BBM for
Android and iPhone customers around the globe,” BlackBerry
executive Andrew Bocking said in a  blog  post. “In the next few
hours, people will start seeing BBM in Google Play, the  App
Store  and in select Samsung App Stores.”  The debut of the free application, which is designed to let
users of non-BlackBerry smartphones exchange text messages on
the company’s platform, was postponed last month due to
difficulties with the software. At the time, the company blamed
an unofficial version of the app for Android that was posted
online. That software has since been disabled. Last week,
BlackBerry said that about 6 million customers had already
preregistered to be notified about the rollout.  BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, decided earlier
this year to make the free app available to rival phones in a
bid to shore up the platform, which has been losing market share
to Apple and Android for years.  The move is part of a comeback plan that also involves
taking the company private in a $4.7 billion deal backed by
Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., its biggest shareholder.
BlackBerry co-founders Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin, who
together control 8 percent of BlackBerry’s shares, also have
said that they’re considering a separate offer.  Last month, BlackBerry said it will cut 4,500 jobs and take
a charge of as much as $960 million for unsold smartphone
inventory as it fights to return to profitability.  To contact the reporters on this story:
