Kior Inc. (KIOR) , operator of the first
U.S. commercial-scale cellulosic biofuel plant, received
commitments for $100 million in financing from  Khosla Ventures 
LLC and Gates Ventures LLC to expand production at its Columbus,
Mississippi, plant.  Kior issued $42.5 million in convertible debt to Khosla
Ventures, which also agreed to purchase as much as $42.5 million
of shares in the Pasadena, Texas-based biofuel company after it
raises enough to build its Columbus II project, according to a
statement today. Gates Ventures bought a $7.5 million equity
stake and will purchase an additional $7.5 in stock when the
plant is fully funded.  Kior expects to complete financing for the $225 million
Columbus II plant through a debt offering, according to the
statement.  Vinod Khosla  and his Khosla Ventures committed
another $50 million to the plant last month. Khosla Ventures is
Kiorâ€™s largest shareholder, with a 26 percent stake, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Columbus site went into production in October and has
annual capacity of as much as 13 million gallons (49 million
liters) of transportation fuel from wood waste and non-food
crops, the company said. The Columbus II addition is expected to
double that to 26 million gallons.  Kior said in August that it shipped about 75,000 gallons in
the second quarter, compared with a May forecast of as much as
500,000 gallons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
