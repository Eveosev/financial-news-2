Etihad Airways  is in talks to buy as
many as 30 of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s upgraded 777 jets, a deal with a list
value of about $10.2 billion, as the planemaker prepares to
unveil the new model, people familiar with the matter said.  An order for the 777X, which is targeted to enter service
near decade’s end, may be wrapped up before next month’s Dubai
Airshow, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the plans are private. The plane will be bigger than the
current 777, already the world’s largest twin-engine jetliner.  Boeing may formally introduce the 777X at the expo with
“large Middle Eastern orders,” including a deal by Dubai-based
Emirates,  Douglas Harned , a New York-based analyst with Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in an Oct. 17 report. He rates
Chicago-based Boeing the equivalent of a buy.  A sale to Abu Dhabi-based Etihad would build on Boeing’s
momentum for the 777X after  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  agreed last
month to buy 34 of the wide-body jets. Emirates, the largest
operator of the current 777, intends to replace 175 of those
aircraft with the new model and may announce an order at the
Dubai show, President  Tim Clark  said on Oct. 1.  “The scale of what we are contemplating is enormous,”
said Clark, who declined to elaborate on the potential purchase
size.  Boeing’s board has yet to publicly commit to building the
777X, and Doug Alder, a company spokesman, declined to comment
yesterday about any talks with Etihad. A spokesman for Etihad,
who asked not to be identified because of airline policy, said
the state-owned carrier had no comment.  Fleet Planning  Etihad, the third-largest Persian Gulf carrier, is talking
with Boeing and Airbus SAS about jetliners that would meet its
fleet requirements beyond 2020, Chief Commercial Officer Peter Baumgartner said Oct. 2.  While Boeing hasn’t said what it will charge for the 777X,
Lufthansa’s $11 billion order implies a retail price of $340
million per jet, according to an estimate by  Peter Arment , a
Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. analyst in Birmingham,  Alabama .  The 777, Boeing’s top seller among its current wide-body
offerings, will be redesigned to include the biggest engines
ever and boast a record wingspan that can be shortened by having
the tips fold up after landing.  The first model, the 777-9X, will be able to fly as far as
8,000 nautical miles (14,800 kilometers) with more than 400
passengers while burning 20 percent less fuel than current 777s.
A second variant, carrying about 350 people, will push past
9,400 nautical miles, enough to go nonstop from  New York  to
 Singapore .  In 2012, Etihad canceled an order in 2012 for six Airbus
A350-1000s, the biggest variant of that twin-engine plane and a
future competitor to the 777-8X.  Reuters first reported the scope of the Boeing-Etihad talks
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
