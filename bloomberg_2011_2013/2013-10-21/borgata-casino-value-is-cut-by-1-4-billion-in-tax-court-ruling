Boyd Gaming Corp. (BYD)  and  MGM Resorts
International (MGM)  won a 61 percent reduction in property taxes on
their Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, a cut
reflecting the decline in business there.  The assessed value of the resort, New Jersey’s top-grossing
casino, was reduced to $870 million from $2.26 billion for 2010,
according to an Oct. 18 decision released today by the Tax Court
of New Jersey.  The tax reduction will boost profit for the casino’s owners
while reducing revenue for the city. The Borgata, under its
previous valuation, represented about 16 percent of Atlantic
City’s $14.4 billion tax base, according to  Michael Stinson , the
city’s director of revenue and taxation.  “We certainly didn’t expect this,” Stinson said in a
telephone interview. “The city’s expert came up with a value of
$2.3 billion.”  The companies will be owed refunds totaling $48.8 million
for the 2009 and 2010 tax years, or by about 61 percent, as well
as interest, according to calculations by A. Paul Genato, a tax
attorney in Princeton, New Jersey, who wasn’t involved in the
case.  “This is a devastating blow to Atlantic City,” Genato
said in an e-mail.  Stinson said the city will appeal the decision. “We
certainly don’t have $50 million sitting in the bank,” he said.  Increased competition for players on the East Coast has
hurt Atlantic City casinos prospects “for the foreseeable
future,” according to the decision.  Casinos in the city routinely challenge their tax
valuations, and the Borgata decision was the last for the 2010
tax year, Stinson said. Boyd and MGM, which co-own the property,
have challenged the 2011 and 2012 assessments as well, he said.
The decision, if it stands, will impact values for all of the
casinos going forward, Stinson said.  Boyd, based in Las Vegas, fell 2.3 percent to $13.72 at the
close in New York. MGM International, also based in Las Vegas,
rose 0.4 percent to $20.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
