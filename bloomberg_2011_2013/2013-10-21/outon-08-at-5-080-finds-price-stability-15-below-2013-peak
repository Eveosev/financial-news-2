Twelve bottles of 2008 Chateau
 Mouton Rothschild , a Medoc first-growth wine estate, sold for
3,140 pounds ($5,080) on Liv-ex, a similar level to four trades
over the past two months and 15 percent below its 2013 peak.  The sale Oct. 18 followed seven months of weakening demand
for top Bordeaux vintages, and compared with 3,710 pounds paid
for each of 10 cases of the same vintage in March, according to
data on the London-based market’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top claret,
has fallen 6 percent since mid-March after gains of 8 percent in
the first 10 weeks of this year, leaving it up 1 percent since
the end of 2012. Collectors’ increasing appetite for wines from
Burgundy, Italy and  California  has combined with a rally in
British sterling since July to weaken demand for Bordeaux.  “The share of the First Growths’ trade on Liv-ex seems to
act as a proxy for  market sentiment ,” Liv-ex said in a market
blog last week. “When buyers and sellers are feeling
optimistic, First Growths see an increased level of trade.
Lately, the level has fallen to around 35 percent,” barely half
the level of mid-2010 during the Bordeaux bull run, it said.  Mouton ’08 is 63 percent below its Liv-ex record reached in
January 2011, although trading at almost double the 1,585 pounds
for which it sold in April 2009 soon after its release to the
market, according to Liv-ex data.  Cabernet Sauvignon  The 2008 Mouton ranks as the Pauillac estate’s third most-expensive wine of the past five years, behind the 2010 and 2009
vintages, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its
Cellar Watch website.  The 2008 Mouton was given a rating of 94+ points on a 100-point scale by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , lagging behind
three of the subsequent four vintages from the estate, according
to data on the  eRobertParker.com  website.  Chateau Mouton Rothschild  has 84 hectares (208 acres)
planted with red-grape vines. Cabernet Sauvignon accounts for 83
percent of the vineyard, Merlot 14 percent and Cabernet Franc
the remaining 3 percent.  The average age of the vines is 44 years and they are
planted at a density of 10,000 per hectare on gravel. The wine
is fermented in oak vats for 15 to 25 days, and then matured for
as long as 22 months in barrels, according to Mouton
Rothschild’s  website .  The vineyard, owned by Baron Philippe de Rothschild SA, was
promoted in 1973 to the ranks of the top Bordeaux first-growth
estates on the left bank of the Gironde estuary, joining the
four other estates designated in the classification drawn up for
Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition.  Mouton has been under the control of the Rothschild family
since being acquired by Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild in 1853.
The property was developed extensively by Baron Philippe, who
ran the estate from 1922 until his death in 1988, and since then
has been managed by his daughter Philippine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
