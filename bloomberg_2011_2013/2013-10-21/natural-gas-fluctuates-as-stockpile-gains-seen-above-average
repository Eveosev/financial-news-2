Natural gas futures fluctuated in
New York amid speculation that government reports this week may
show above-average U.S. inventory gains before colder weather
boosts fuel use.  Gas moved between gains and losses before Energy
Information Administration data tomorrow that may show supplies
rose 78 billion cubic feet in the week ended Oct. 11, based on
the median of 18  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
five-year average increase is 75 billion. Data for last week
will be released Oct. 24.  “The injections will be what they have been recently,
probably a little bit on the healthy side,” said Tom Saal,
senior vice president of energy trading at FCStone Latin America
LLC in Miami.  Natural gas for November delivery fell 1 cent to $3.763 per
million British thermal units at 9:26 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was near the 100-day
average. Gas has risen 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
