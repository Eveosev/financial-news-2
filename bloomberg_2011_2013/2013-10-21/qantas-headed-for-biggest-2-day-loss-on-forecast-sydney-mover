Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  had its largest
two-day loss since June 2012 after the nation’s biggest carrier
said last week it expects the lowest yields in more than a
decade for passenger flights.  The stock dropped 5.6 percent to A$1.35 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney today. Qantas declined 3.4 percent on Oct. 18
after Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said he expects group
yield, a measure of earnings for each kilometer flown by a
passenger, to fall 2 percent to 3 percent in the six months
ending December from a year earlier.  Joyce told shareholders last week the airline faces
headwinds from a volatile economy, uncertain exchange rates,
high fuel prices and intense competition. Qantas, which controls
65 percent of  Australia ’s local market, has added services after
 Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. (VAH)  vowed to take share in the
profitable business-travel segment.  “It’s difficult to see international yields improving with
the capacity growth from competitors,” CIMB analysts led by
 Mark Williams  said in a note to clients today. Virgin’s
“competition for domestic corporate accounts is likely to limit
the recovery in domestic yields,” they wrote.  The yield decline guidance was “a surprise, given the
apparent moderation in domestic capacity growth and the 3
percent decline for the same period last year,” UBS AG analysts
led by Simon Mitchell said in a note dated Oct. 18.  Yield was 10.46 Australian cents in the six months ended
December 2012, implying a range of 10.15 cents to 10.25 cents in
the current period, based on Joyce’s estimate.  The average estimate from 11 analysts for net income
adjusted for fiscal 2014 was cut by 85 percent after Qantas’s
presentation to shareholders Oct. 18, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Qantas has declined 9.4 percent this year, compared with a
15 percent gain for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index. It is the
eighth-worst performing stock among industrial shares, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
