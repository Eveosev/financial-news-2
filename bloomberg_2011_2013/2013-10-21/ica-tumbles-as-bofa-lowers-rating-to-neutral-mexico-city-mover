Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) , Mexico’s biggest
construction company, dropped the most on the country’s
benchmark index as Bank of America Corp. cut its rating to
neutral on concern the builder faces higher taxes.  The shares declined 4.3 percent to 26.88 pesos at 12:39
p.m. in Mexico City, the most on a closing basis since July 8.
The benchmark IPC slipped 0.6 percent.  Legislation that Mexico’s lower House passed last week will
probably boost ICA’s future cash taxes, Bank of America analysts
Carlos Peyrelongue, Daniel Rojas Vielman and Alan Macias wrote
today in an e-mail to clients.  The analysts cut their rating on ICA shares from buy. The
company may face a new liability of 4.6 billion pesos ($355
million) based on “the expected reduction in deferred taxes
related to tax payables from fiscal deconsolidation,” they
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
