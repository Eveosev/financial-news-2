Hog futures fell for a third
straight session on speculation that U.S. pork supplies are
rising as demand slows. Cattle prices advanced.  Wholesale pork  has tumbled 7.9 percent since Sept. 26 to
94.3 cents a pound on Oct. 18, the lowest since May, according
to U.S. Department of Agriculture data that recorded no prices
during the government shutdown from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16. The
average hog-carcass weight on Oct. 18 was 209.46 pounds (95.1
kilograms), up 2.1 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
The price of corn used as  animal feed  has tumbled 42 percent in
the past 12 months, reaching a three-year low last week.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if our weights got heavier,
especially with this low-priced corn” encouraging farmers to
feed hogs more,  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar
Commodity Investments Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.2 percent to
87.8 cents a pound at 11:30 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.  Corn prices are tumbling as U.S. farmers collect a record
crop that the government forecasts will reach 13.8 billion
bushels, up 28 percent from last year’s drought-damaged harvest.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.3215 a pound on the CME, after fluctuating between gains and
losses. The most-active contract is up 12 percent since reaching
this year’s low on May 20.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement increased 0.2
percent to $1.669 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
