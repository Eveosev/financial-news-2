Harvard University named Lane MacDonald, captain of the school’s hockey team when it won its
only national championship, as head of the endowment’s private
equity portfolio.  MacDonald, who received his undergraduate degree from
Harvard and an MBA from Stanford University, will become
managing director of private equity effective in December,
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard said today in an e-mailed
statement.  He has been with Harvard Management Co., the university
entity in  Boston  that oversees the $32.7 billion endowment,
since 2008, and will report to Andrew Wiltshire, head of
alternative assets, according to the statement.  MacDonald played for the U.S. hockey team at the Winter
Olympics in 1988 and was captain of Harvard’s team when it won
the NCAA championship in 1989. Harvard is the world’s wealthiest
university and helped redefine endowment investing by pushing
into alternative assets such as private equity funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
