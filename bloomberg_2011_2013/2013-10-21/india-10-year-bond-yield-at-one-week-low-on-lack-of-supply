India ’s 10-year bonds rose, pushing
the yield to a one-week low, on speculation a lack of sales
reduces concern there will be too much supply.  The government won’t sell any debt this week, the issuance
 calendar  on the Reserve Bank of India website shows, which is
positive for bonds as it eases worries about oversupply, said
Debendra Kumar Dash, a Mumbai-based fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who
boosted the key repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.5
percent last month in the first increase since 2011, will review
borrowing costs on Oct. 29.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.55 percent
as of 10:29 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the central
bank’s trading system. That was the lowest level since Oct. 11.  “Markets are likely to trade range-bound till the central
bank policy next week,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based
executive vice-president of treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK) 
“Everyone is looking for cues from the RBI.”  Ten-year notes fell in each of the last four months, the
longest run of losses since 2009, as the RBI raised interest
rates and curbed funding support to banks to stem a slide in the
rupee. The currency has rebounded to 61.545 per dollar from a
record low of 68.845 on Aug. 28, allowing the central bank to
scale back some of the measures. Rajan twice cut two rates at
which the RBI supplies cash to lenders in the past month.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was unchanged at
8.43 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
