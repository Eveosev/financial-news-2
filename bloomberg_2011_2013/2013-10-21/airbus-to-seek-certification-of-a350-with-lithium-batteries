Airbus SAS (EAD)  will seek permission to
fly its new A350 jet with more advanced  lithium batteries  only
after first using a standard nickel-cadmium model in a bid to
secure faster approval, said the program director for the A350.  The two flying A350 test aircraft are still equipped with
lithium packs, while the first models to enter into service will
feature nickel cadmium. Airbus plans to gain certification of
the newer technology about a year into regular commercial
operation in 2014, said Didier Evrard, head of the A350 program.  Airbus had designed the A350 to fly with the lighter
lithium packs and changed tracks earlier this year after some
 Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliners experienced battery fires, leading to
a three-month grounding of the fleet. While the cadmium model is
heavier, it’s tried and tested, allowing for faster approval.  “We didn’t seek initial certification for the A350 with
lithium because we didn’t want to take any risk of delay,”
Evrard said in Toulouse,  France , where Airbus is based. “But we
think our lithium power design is sufficiently different” from
its rival’s system, he said.  Airbus has said that the electrical design of the A350 and
its lithium batteries is more conservative than in the Boeing
787 Dreamliner. The fifth A350 test plane that is set to fly for
the first time in about May, will incorporate nickel-cadmium
batteries, according to the company.  On Schedule  The A350 remains on schedule, with plans to hand over the
first plane to Qatar Airways Ltd. toward the end of 2014, Evrard
said. The aircraft had won 756 orders at the end of September
from 38 customers including earlier this month an order from
 Japan Airlines (9201)  for 31 A350s.  Airbus expects to be producing one A350 a month by January
2014, increasing to three a month by early 2015 and gradually
ramping up to 10 a month by 2018. The planemaker may consider
higher rates after that, Evrard said, though no decisions on
that have yet been made.  The plane is offered in three versions: the A350-900,
seating 300 and the first to get built; the larger A350-1000,
with 350 seats, scheduled for entry into service in late 2017,
and the 270-seat A350-800.  Stretch Version  While multiple -800 customers have moved to the longer
A350-900, Airbus still has outstanding orders for 89 units and
will build the plane if customers want it, Evrard said. He gave
no indication when production of the -800 versions may begin.  The A350-1000 is now moving from development to
industrialization. Final assembly will start in late 2015, with
a first flight in the second part of 2016 before entry into
service in 2017. Buyers including Emirates, British Airways Plc
and Cathay Pacific Ltd.  Evrard said stretching the A350-1000 by adding panels to
make the fuselage longer for additional passengers would be
perfectly feasible from a technical point of view.  “Stretching further is possible, there are no show-stoppers, but today it’s still in the pre-concept phase” he
said.  Boeing is developing a wide-body plane bigger than its
current 777-300ER, and one of those variants would seat 400
passengers, more than the A350-1000.  The second A350-900 test aircraft began flights last week
after a first plane flew for the first time in June. The two
planes combined have already made 75 flights, or more than 370
hours.  The third test aircraft, which hasn’t yet flown, will be
the first fitted out with a cabin, including cabin crew rest
area, galleys and baggage racks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
