Billionaire  Carlos Slim , the world’s
second-richest person, is getting about 7.3 billion pesos ($565
million) in cash as his holding company distributes the proceeds
from the sale of its cigarette business.  Grupo Carso SAB, of which Slim controls 80 percent,
approved a special dividend of 4 pesos a share, the company said
yesterday in a filing. The company agreed in May to sell its 20
percent holding in a Mexican joint venture to co-owner  Philip
Morris International Inc. (PM)  for about $700 million.  Slim opted to distribute the proceeds to himself and other
investors instead of using the cash for Carso’s businesses,
which include retail, construction and industrial materials.
 Arturo Elias , a spokesman for the billionaire, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on the
decision.  Carso rose 1.9 percent to 69.92 pesos at the close in
Mexico City. The shares have climbed 12 percent this year,
compared with a 6.6 percent decline for the benchmark IPC index.  Slim, 73, has a net worth of $68.7 billion, trailing only
Bill Gates on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
