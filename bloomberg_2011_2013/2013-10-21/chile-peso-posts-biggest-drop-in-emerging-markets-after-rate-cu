Chile’s peso fell the most among
emerging-market counterparts as traders exited bets on the
currency after the central bank unexpectedly lowered its
benchmark  interest rate  last week.  The currency depreciated 1 percent to 501.95 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Santiago, the biggest drop since Aug. 19.
The peso extended its drop after touching a level weaker than
500 for the first time since Oct. 10.  “The market wasn’t expecting a cut and was short
dollars,” said Eugenio Cortes, the head of currency forwards at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA. “On Friday, people were
defending their positions, but above 500 we saw some alarms
going off and we have seen stop losses.” The peso may decline
to 505 to 506 per dollar, Cortes said.  The central bank surprised all except two of the 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg when it cut the  target lending
rate  on Oct. 17 for the first time since January 2012, lowering
it by a quarter-percentage point to 4.75 percent. Before the
decision, foreign investors had a $6.2 billion net short peso
position, the smallest in five months. A short is a bet an asset
will decline in value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
