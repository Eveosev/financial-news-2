German government bonds fell for the
first time in three days before euro-area manufacturing and
confidence reports this week that economists said will add to
signs of recovery, damping demand for safer assets.  Belgian and Dutch securities also declined before the
publication of a delayed U.S. jobs report tomorrow that analysts
say will show employment in the world’s biggest economy
increased last month. Italian bonds dropped for the first time
in eight days after 10-year yields dropped to the least since
August.  France  auctioned 7.25 billion euros ($9.91 billion) of
bills maturing in three, five and 12 months.  “People will be waiting for U.S. data and important euro-zone data scheduled for coming days,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a
senior fixed-income strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan. “We
should get improving data in the euro zone but I don’t think
this will be enough to send yields up. There are still a lot of
sources of uncertainty around.”  Germany’s 10-year yield increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.85 percent at 4:41 p.m. London time after
dropping to 1.82 percent on Oct. 18, the lowest level since Oct.
9. The 2 percent bund maturing in August 2023 fell 0.135, or
1.35 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.365.  UniCredit may lower its year-end bund yield forecast from 2
percent because the U.S. government shutdown earlier this month
has made it less likely the Federal Reserve will cut asset
purchases, Cazzulani said. The benchmark German yield will end
2013 at 1.93 percent, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Belgian  10-year yields  rose three basis points to 2.62
percent and similar-maturity Dutch rates climbed two basis
points to 2.21 percent.  Most Volatile  Volatility on  Germany ’s bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Austria and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  U.S. employers added 180,000 workers in September, the most
since April, economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict. The data
was originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 4.  An index of euro-area household confidence rose to minus
14.5 this month, the highest since July 2011, a separate
Bloomberg survey showed before the data is released on
Wednesday. A composite gauge based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing industries increased to
52.4 from 52.2 in September, a separate  Bloomberg survey  shows.  Italian Bonds  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed three basis points to 4.19
percent after falling to 4.16 percent, the lowest since Aug. 13.  Former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who imposed
austerity on the nation in 2011, quit the leadership of his
political party last week after criticizing the policies of his
successor, Prime Minister Enrico Letta.  “There are still a lot of tensions within the Italian
government,” said Felix Herrmann, a Frankfurt-based research
analyst at DZ Bank AG. “This is certainly one aspect why BTPs
are still under pressure,” he said, referring to Italian
government bonds.  French 10-year yields rose one basis point to 2.36 percent
after today’s bill sales.  The Netherlands auctioned 3.4 billion euros of 100- and
188-day securities.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this
year through Oct. 18, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
French securities dropped 0.8 percent and Dutch bonds declined
2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
