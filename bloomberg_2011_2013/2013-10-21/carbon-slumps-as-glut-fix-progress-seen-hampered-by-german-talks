European Union carbon permits for
December declined the most since May as the slow pace of German
coalition talks dimmed the prospects for a swift agreement on a
plan to bolster the region’s carbon market.  The benchmark December contract fell 11 percent to close at
4.59 euros ($6.27) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the lowest close since Sept. 4.  Chancellor Angela
Merkel , who won a third term last month, and  Germany ’s Social
Democrats said they were prepared to negotiate through the end
of the year to form a coalition government.  A proposal to temporarily delay the sale of some EU permits
to boost prices, known as backloading, needs the backing of
Germany’s government in order to gain a qualified majority in
the bloc’s Climate Change Committee. Merkel last week said she
favored the proposal, fueling carbon’s surge to a two-week high
of 5.50 euros on Oct. 16.  “We expect the process of forming a coalition in Germany
to be drawn out and thus do not expect any vote by the Climate
Change Committee on backloading in 2013,” Milan Hudak, an
analyst at Virtuse Energy sro in  Prague , said by e-mail. “This
moves backloading implementation to mid-2014 or later depending
on the pace of the legislative process and the risk that the
present Parliament might leave the vote for its successor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
