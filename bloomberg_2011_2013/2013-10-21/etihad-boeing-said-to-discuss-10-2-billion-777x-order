Etihad Airways is in talks to buy as
many as 30 of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s upgraded 777 jets, an order with a
list value of about $10.2 billion, people familiar with the
matter said.  A deal for the 777X planes may be wrapped up before next
month’s Dubai Airshow, said one of the people, who asked not to
be identified because the discussions are private. The expo may
mark the formal unveiling of the 777X, which is targeted to
enter service near decade’s end.  A sale to Etihad, the third-largest Persian Gulf carrier,
would build on Boeing’s momentum for the redesigned version of
its biggest twin-engine plane.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s $11
billion 777X order last month implies a retail price of $340
million per jet, according to an estimate by  Peter Arment , a
Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. analyst in Birmingham,  Alabama .  A spokesman for Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, who asked not to be
identified because of airline policy, said the state-owned
carrier had no comment about any aircraft orders. Chicago-based
Boeing also declined to comment, said Doug Alder, a spokesman.  Reuters reported the scope of the Boeing-Etihad talks
earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
