China formally arrested venture
capitalist Wang Gongquan after he was detained last month on
charges of assembling a crowd to disturb public order, his
lawyer said today.  Wang was arrested yesterday, lawyer Chen Youxi said by
phone, declining to give more details. Wang was being held in
Beijing, Chen had said Sept. 18.  China is tightening controls over the Internet and free
speech ahead of a November gathering of the Communist Party’s
 Central Committee . Liu Hu, a journalist who posted allegations
of wrongdoing by government officials online, was arrested on a
charge of defamation last month, his lawyer said.  Wang founded CDH Venture, the venture-capital unit of CDH
Investments, in 2005, according to the parent company’s website.
Prior to that he was a general partner at IDG Technology Venture
Investment, and previously one of the founders of Vantone
Industry Group. His public recognition surged in May 2011 when
he used a Sina Weibo microblog to announce he was leaving his
wife for his mistress.  Wang signed a letter in July calling for the release of
rights activist Xu Zhiyong. The document also called for the
lifting of restrictions on the Internet and other media,
according to a translation by the Hong Kong-based  China  Media
Project.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
