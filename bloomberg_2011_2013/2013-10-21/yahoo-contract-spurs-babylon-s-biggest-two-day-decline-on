Babylon Ltd. (BBYL) , Israel’s largest
translation software maker, posted the biggest two-day retreat
on record after saying  Yahoo (YHOO) ! Inc. may suspend their
partnership.  Babylon sank 15 percent to 23.30 shekels in  Tel Aviv  in the
past two days, the most since the company’s initial public
offering in February 2007. Volumes today were five times the
daily average during the past three months.  Failure to resolve the defects in the agreement’s
implementation by the end of the day will lead to breach of
contract, Yahoo told Babylon in a letter, according to a
statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange yesterday. Babylon
signed in April a four-year accord with Yahoo as it seeks to
diversify income sources. Second-quarter revenue from that
relationship more than tripled to 32 percent from 10 percent in
the previous period.  “If the deal is terminated this is bad news for Babylon in
the short term because Yahoo represented 30 percent of revenue
in the last quarter,” Eran Jacoby, head of research at DS
Securities & Investments in Tel Aviv, said by phone today. “If
the deal is preserved, then the share will correct.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
