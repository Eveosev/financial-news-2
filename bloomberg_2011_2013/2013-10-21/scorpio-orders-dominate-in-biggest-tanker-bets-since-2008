Scorpio Tankers Inc. (STNG)  is leading the
biggest construction boom for vessels hauling diesel and oil
products since the recession five years ago with plans to have
54 refined-fuel carriers built.  The Monaco-based company, founded in 2009 by an investor
whose family has owned ships for six decades, ordered more
vessels than any other operator in a year when spending of $4.4
billion on new capacity is already the most since 2008,
according to data from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the biggest shipbroker.
Almost all of Scorpio’s carriers will be launched next year.  The spending shows that shipping of fuels is recovering
even as earnings plunge to an all-time low across the merchant
fleet. Demand for tankers is rising as the U.S. exports
unprecedented amounts of oil products and Middle East refineries
expand capacity at a record pace. Owners are betting the
shipments will mean longer-than-normal voyages to Europe, where
declining profits are causing refineries to close.  “Shifting refinery capacity to  Saudi Arabia  and the Middle
East and increased oil-product exports from the U.S. has led to
increased demand for oil-product tankers,” Scorpio President
Robert Bugbee said by phone yesterday. “We clearly have first-mover advantage.”  Clarkson Measure  Daily rates for the ships averaged $13,284 this year, 24
percent more than in 2012 and the most since 2008, according to
a Clarkson measure of earnings across all types of product
tankers. Rates peaked at $49,273 in January 2006, spurring a
surge in orders for new vessels just before the global
recession. Returns fell as low as $3,491 by April 2009.  Earnings for Large-Range-2 tankers, each hauling as much as
115,000 metric tons of cargo, will average $18,000 a day next
year, or 10 percent more than in 2013, according to the average
of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Shipping companies ordered $1.67 billion of LR tankers in
the past two years and 207 smaller Medium-Range vessels valued
at $6.8 billion, data from London-based Clarkson show. Their
$4.4 billion of investment this year is the highest since the
recession that began in 2008.  Scorpio was formed in 2009 by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Emanuele Lauro, whose grandfather Glauco Lolli-Ghetti
married into an Italian shipping family in the early 1950s, its
website shows. The company’s investment program exceeds $3
billion, Bugbee said.  More Refineries  “Scorpio is positioning itself to become the largest oil-product tanker owner,” said Eirik Haavaldsen, an analyst at
Oslo-based Pareto Securities AS whose recommendations on the
shares of shipping companies returned 20 percent in the past
year. “They were very early in setting out to do this. Refining
infrastructure is moving to the  Middle East  and other crude-producing regions, and more refineries are coming.”  Shares of Scorpio rose 59 percent to $11.28 this year in
 New York  and will advance another 5.4 percent to $11.89 in 12
months, according to the average of 12 analyst estimates. The
six-company Bloomberg Tanker Index climbed 29 percent in 2013.  Scorpio has ordered about six times more new tankers than
 Frontline 2012 Ltd. (FRNT) , which is controlled by billionaire  John
Fredriksen  and has the second-largest construction program,
according to Clarkson. Shares of Frontline 2012, based in
Hamilton,  Bermuda , climbed 56 percent this year to 42 kroner in
Oslo and will gain another 46 percent to 61.46 kroner in a year,
the average of five predictions shows.  Maersk Investments  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the largest shipping line by
market value, said Oct. 15 it was considering investing in new
MR tankers, in part because of rising Persian Gulf exports.
 Wilbur Ross , the billionaire who spent $900 million with other
investors to buy 30 product tankers in 2011, said in August of
this year shipping markets should start improving late in 2014,
with the biggest gains related to trade in oil and gas from new
reserves such as those found in shale formations.  Europe may present the biggest threat to the anticipated
rally in rates because it buys 32 percent of the 20 million
barrels a day of oil products shipped annually. The 17-nation
euro area’s economy will shrink 0.3 percent this year after a
0.7 percent contraction in 2012, according to the mean of 56
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The continent consumed less gasoline every year since 1999,
according to data from BP Plc. Demand for diesel and other
middle distillates slumped 2.3 percent in 2012 to the lowest
level since 2003, the data show.  Global Growth  World economic growth next year will be weaker than
previously expected, the  International Monetary Fund  said Oct.
8, reducing its forecast to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent. That
may curtail gains in fuel consumption, in turn slowing the
easing in the glut of shipping capacity. The supply of product
tankers expanded faster than demand in seven of the past eight
years, Clarkson data show.  “As an investor, you want both profit on your operations
and return on your assets, which is not the case in the product
market yet,” Klaus Rud Sejling, chief commercial officer of
Maersk’s tanker unit, wrote in an Oct. 15 e-mail. “Demand in
the MR market will develop positively, and this rhymes with the
fact that this market is now doing relatively well. There is an
ongoing shift in refinery capacity.”  Scorpio ordered 46 product carriers this year, the most of
any owner, according to Clarkson. It will report net income of
$21 million for this year after losing $26.5 million in 2012,
according to the mean of six  analyst  estimates.  Fredriksen Spending  Frontline 2012 is amassing a fleet of 60 product tankers,
gas carriers, and coal and iron-ore transporters. It will report
profit of 432.5 million kroner this year, from 8.1 million
kroner in 2012, according to the average of six estimates. The
orders for fuel tankers represent Fredriksen’s largest-ever
investment in the industry, according to Arctic Securities ASA
in Oslo.  U.S. refineries are  exporting  the most refined products in
at least two decades as the country extracts the most crude oil
since 1992. The government prohibits the overseas sale of most
types of crude, spurring shipments of fuels instead. Refiners
sent an average of 2.97 million barrels a day abroad this year,
the most since at least 1993, Energy Department data show.  Middle East refineries will increase their combined
capacity by 530,000 barrels a day this year, a 6.4 percent
expansion that is the most in data going back to 1994, according
to Pareto Securities AS, an investment bank in Oslo.  Shipments to  Europe  will extend voyages for tankers because
they will replace traditional trade routes. A  journey  from
 Latvia  to  France , a benchmark route for European rates, is 1,300
miles. The same cargo from Saudi Arabia would have to travel
6,200 miles and from the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  about 5,600 miles.  “People are investing in product tankers because of this
change in trading patterns, which is starting to finally bear
fruit,” said Nigel Prentis, the head of consulting at Hartland
Shipping Services Ltd., a London-based shipbroker. “Oil trading
has been turned on its head.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
