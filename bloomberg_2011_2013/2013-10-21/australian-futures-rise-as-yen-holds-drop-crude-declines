U.S. stocks rose with Treasuries,
while European shares extended the longest rally since 2010, as
lower-than-forecast growth in American payrolls spurred
speculation the Federal Reserve won’t rush to withdraw stimulus.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  advanced 0.6 percent to
1,754.67 at 4 p.m. in New York, reaching a record for a fourth 
straight day, and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.4 percent
for a ninth consecutive gain. Ten-year Treasury yields fell 9 
basis points to 2.51 percent, the lowest since July. The
Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index dropped 0.5 percent to an almost
nine-month low. Copper and gold rose more than 1 percent while
oil slid to an almost four-month low of less than $98 a barrel.  The S&P 500 extended its 2013 gain to 23 percent, on pace
to challenge 2009’s 23.45 percent advance for its best  yearly
rally  in a decade. U.S. employers added 148,000 workers
following a revised 193,000 increase in August that was larger
than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today.
The data was delayed by a 16-day government shutdown that
spurred economists to push out expectations for tapering of
Federal Reserve stimulus.  “These numbers show we are going to continue to see
stimulus from the Fed, there is nothing here to indicate the Fed
will taper earlier than first quarter of 2014 now,” Chris Gaffney, senior market strategist at EverBank Wealth Management,
said by phone from St. Louis. “The equity markets have been
supported by the easy money that the Fed has been pumping to the
system. These numbers show the stimulus will continue, therefore
it gives a boost to the equity markets.”  Raising Guidance  The median forecast of 93 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a 180,000 increase in jobs. Unemployment fell to 7.2
percent, the lowest level since November 2008. The Fed will
probably delay the first cut to its quantitative-easing program
until March, according to a poll conducted Oct. 17-18. The
authority’s last two policy meetings this year are on Oct. 29-30
and Dec. 17-18.  The Fed unexpectedly refrained in September from reducing
its monthly purchases of $85 billion of bonds, saying it wanted
more evidence of an economic recovery.  Among U.S. stocks moving today, Walt Disney Co., Procter &
Gamble Co. and Caterpillar Inc. rose more than 1.6 percent to
lead gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU)  DuPont Co.
advanced 1.2 percent as profit beat analyst estimates amid
strength at units that make materials for solar panels and
bullet-resistant vests. Apple Inc. erased an early 1.4 percent
advance and dropped as much as 2.6 percent before recovering
some losses and trading down 0.3 percent.  Apple Event  Apple update its lineup of iPads at an event today, as the
company works to remain ahead of rivals in the increasingly
crowded tablet market.  Texas Instruments Inc. fell 1.7 percent after the largest
analog-chip maker forecast revenue and profit that fell short of
analysts’ estimates. Netflix Inc. lost 9.2 percent, reversing an
earlier gain of as much as 9.6 percent fueled by third-quarter
earnings that exceeded projections. Chief Executive Officer Reed
Hastings attributed the rally in the stock, which is up 250
percent this year, to investor “euphoria.”  Earnings Season  The S&P 500’s advance this year has been fueled by the
unprecedented Fed stimulus and better-than-estimated corporate
earnings. Analysts have raised their forecasts for profits in
the third quarter, predicting an average increase of 2.5 percent
for all companies in the gauge, according to estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with a 1.7 percent projection at the
beginning of the month.  Earnings beat analyst estimates at 73 percent of the 131
companies in the index that have released their results so far
in the reporting period, while 53 percent exceeded sales
projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The S&P 500 will rise past 1,800 as earnings and the U.S.
economy improve,  Michael Shaoul , the chairman and chief
executive officer of New York-based Marketfield Asset Management
LLC, told Bloomberg TV.  “We feel pretty good about equities,” said Shaoul in an
interview from New York. “Corporate earnings point to a re-accelerating domestic economy. 1,800 is attainable.” He did not
specify a time frame.  The Stoxx 600 has rallied 5.2 percent over nine days, the
biggest advance over similar time periods since May. Novartis
AG, Europe’s biggest drugmaker by sales, climbed 2 percent today
after raising its forecast for the second time this year.
 Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) , the maker of Nurofen painkillers
and Durex condoms, jumped 5.2 percent after increasing its sales
guidance and starting a strategic review of its pharmaceutical
unit.  European Movers  Tele2 AB tumbled 12 percent, the most in five months, after
the Swedish phone company posted an unexpected loss. Telekom
Austria AG sank 5.7 percent after agreeing to pay 1.03 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) for wireless spectrum in the alpine nation.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose for the eighth time in
nine days, climbing 0.3 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index
slid 0.8 percent, led by developers, as a report showed home
prices in  China ’s four major cities jumped the most since
January 2011, spurring speculation the government may tighten
property curbs.  Brazil ’s Ibovespa extended its two-day gain to
almost 2 percent.  European, Canadian and emerging-markets debt rallied along
with U.S. Treasuries. Canada’s benchmark 10-year government
yield dropped 7 basis points to 2.48 percent, the lowest level
since August.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield dropped 8 basis points to 4.20
percent. Italy’s declined nine basis points to 4.10 percent.  Nickel, aluminum, silver and gold rose at least 1.6 percent

the Swiss franc strengthening the most. The euro rallied 0.8
percent to $1.3783. The Swiss franc touched its strongest level
against the greenback since February 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
