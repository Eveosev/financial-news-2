Credit-default swap investors have
bought and sold 4,183 contracts insuring a net $3.2 billion of
Greek debt, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  That’s down from 4,713 contracts covering $5.6 billion of
bonds a year ago and is little changed since the start of this
year, DTCC  data show . Twenty nine contracts covering a gross
$128.8 million of the country’s debt traded in the week ending
Feb. 10.  It costs $6.9 million in advance and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years, signaling a 90
percent chance of default within that time, according to CMA.  Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
