The  New Zealand  dollar advanced
after Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said the country’s
economic performance may be understated.  The so-called kiwi climbed 0.3 percent to 83.57 U.S. cents
at 12:26 p.m. in Wellington from 83.30 cents in  New York 
yesterday.  “New Zealand is in some ways better off than is often
thought,” he said in e-mailed notes for a speech to the Trans
Tasman Business Circle in Auckland today. He said gross domestic
product may be as much as 10 percent higher than official data
relative to other nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
