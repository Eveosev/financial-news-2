Japanese  stocks  fell for the first
time in four days after a bailout for  Greece  was delayed. Losses
were limited as the yen held near a three-month low against the
dollar, boosting the outlook for exporters.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  slid after rising 5.4
percent in the two days following a surprise decision by the
Bank of  Japan  to buy more bonds. Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s
biggest shipping line by sales, lost 2.9 percent after a gauge
of cargo rates dropped.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the nation’s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics, rose 0.9 percent. Tokyo
Electric Power Co. gained 3.8 percent after a report utilities
may be allowed to restart nuclear  power plants .  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  retreated from a six-month
high, sliding 0.2 percent to 9,238.10 at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo after swinging between gains and losses of 0.5 percent.
The broader  Topix (MXAP)  Index fell 0.3 percent to 800.25, with more
than twice as many shares declining as advancing.  “Investors are irritated because Greek debt issues aren’t
being decided,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-
based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees about
$29.6 billion. “The BOJ’s monetary easing was a positive
surprise. The yen is unlikely to strengthen, supporting
stocks.”  Yen’s Slide  Japanese stocks today outperformed most major Asian markets,
with the  MSCI Asia Pacific Ex-Japan Index (MXAPJ)  falling 1.6 percent.
The central bank’s decision to expand asset purchases this week
pushed the yen to its lowest against the dollar since Nov. 1,
boosting the earnings outlook for exporters such as Sony, which
gets about a fifth of its sales from the U.S. The electronics
maker gained 0.9 percent to 1,589 yen today.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.5
percent today. The gauge slid 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday
as European officials delayed a decision on a 130-billion euro
($170 billion) bailout for Greece until at least Feb. 20 and
possibly until after the Mediterranean nation holds elections
later in the year.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group lost 1.7 percent to 401 yen,
while  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s No. 2 lender
by market value, retreated 1.3 percent to 2,667 yen.  The Topix has added 6 percent this month, outpacing a 2.4
percent gain on the  S&P 500  and a 3.8 percent increase for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Technical indicators have risen above
levels that suggest the Topix is overbought.  The  14-day relative strength index  for the Topix rose to
73.7, above the 70 threshold that some traders see as a sign the
index is poised to reverse course. The 25-day  Toraku (TORAKU)  gauge, an
indicator of market momentum, topped 120 for a third day,
suggesting the market may fall.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese  market  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Shipping lines declined the most among the 33 Topix
industry groups.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  (9101 JT) fell 2.9 percent to
238 yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  (9104 JT) slid 2.8 percent to
353 yen, while  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  (9107 JT) lost 3.3
percent to 178 yen. The stocks declined after the  Baltic Dry
Index (BDIY) , a measure of shipping costs for commodities, yesterday
fell for the first time since Feb. 3. UBS AG also cut the equity
ratings on the companies to “sell” from “neutral.”  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)  (8601 JT), Japan’s second-
largest brokerage, rose 2.3 percent to 309 yen. Its Hong Kong
unit cut 10 percent of its 600 positions this week as part of
the parent’s cost-cutting plans, Chief Operating Officer Terence
Mackey said by telephone today.  GCA Savvian Group Corp. (2174)  (2174 JT), a merger adviser,
tumbled 6.7 percent to 89,500 yen. The company said operating

a possible drop in sales.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662)  (1662 JT), the nation’s
second-largest oil explorer, climbed 2.8 percent to 3,650 yen.

rating to “outperform” from “neutral,” saying natural gas
revenue may recover after the March earthquake.  Qol Co. (3034 JQ) advanced 2.7 percent to 52,700 yen. The
pharmacy operator said it will conduct a 100-for-1 stock split,
adopting minimum trading of 100 shares.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  (7261 JT), the least profitable of
Japan’s biggest carmakers, added 2.6 percent to 161 yen. Shares
rose after President Takashi Yamanouchi said Mazda is in
discussions about forming an alliance. He declined to name any
potential partners.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  (7733 JT) slipped 2.4 percent to 1,273 yen
after three former executives at Olympus, including former

connection with the camera maker’s accounting scandal.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501 JT) gained 3.8 percent to
217 yen. The government may allow utilities to restart nuclear

imports of Iranian oil, the Asahi newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Tohoku Electric Power Co. (9506) 
(9506 JT) rose 1.6 percent to 942 yen.  Unipres Corp. (5949)  (5949 JT) slumped 4.4 percent to 2,290 yen.
