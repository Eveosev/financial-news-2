Jeremy Lin switched to playmaker
from leading scorer as he handed out a career-high 13 assists to
help the  New York Knicks  win a seventh straight game.  Lin, who left last night’s game at Madison Square Garden
near the end of the third quarter with the Knicks leading by 21
points, was one of seven New York players to score at least 10
points in a 100-85 home win against the  Sacramento Kings . The
23-year-old point guard has scored 146 points in his first six
National Basketball Association starts.  “I don’t know when there’s an ending, maybe there won’t,”
Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni  told reporters.  On Feb. 14, Harvard University graduate Lin became the only
player to score more than 20 points and win each of his first
five starts since the NBA merged with the American Basketball
Association in 1976. Lin wasn’t drafted after graduation from
Harvard and was cut by two NBA teams before joining the Knicks
on Dec. 27.  Landry Fields led  New York  last night with 15 points and 10
rebounds, while Bill Walker and reserve Steve Novak each
contributed 14 as the Knicks hit 51 percent of their field goal
attempts. Amar’e Stoudemire scored 11 points, one more than Lin,
who played 26 minutes.  “I just tried to move the ball around,” Lin said. “When
we have guys like Amar’e and Landry, I just throw the ball up
and they go and get it. They make me look good.”  Lin opened the scoring with a three-point play and gave the
Knicks a lead that they’d never relinquish with a layup to make
it 9-7 with eight minutes, 56 seconds to play in the first
quarter.  A .500 Record  New York led 25-17 after the first quarter, 54-36 at
halftime and 77-55 with one quarter to play.  After committing a career-high eight turnovers two nights
ago, Lin had a team-high six turnovers against the Kings.  “It’s something I’ve got to work on because my turnovers
are sky high,” Lin said. “I’m still making a lot of mistakes,
but being able to play through that, grow as a player and build
on my confidence was the best thing that could have happened to
me.”  The Knicks improved to 15-15, the first time they’ve held a
.500 record since Jan. 14. Before last night, New York hadn’t
won seven in a row since April 10 last season.  During their 8-15 start to the season, the Knicks used
 Toney Douglas , Iman Shumpert and Mike Bibby at point guard
before turning to Lin.  Record Start  The 6-foot-3 Lin scored 28 points in his first career start
against the  Utah Jazz  on Feb. 6 and then had 23 points and 10
assists in a win against Washington two days later. He
contributed a career-high 38 points against the  Los Angeles
Lakers  on Feb. 10, and had 20 points against Minnesota the
following day. Two nights ago, he hit the winning 3-pointer in
the final second against the  Toronto Raptors  and totaled 27
points and 11 assists.  Last night’s win moved New York within one game of tying
the  Boston Celtics  for second place in the Eastern Conference’s
five-team Atlantic Division behind the  Philadelphia 76ers . The
Celtics lost 98-88 at home last night to the  Detroit Pistons .  The Knicks have been playing without leading scorer  Carmelo Anthony , who is recovering from a groin strain and may return
this weekend, the New York Times reported.  The Knicks, who lost 11 of 13 games prior to the Feb. 4 win
against the Nets, continue their five-game homestand against the
New Orleans Hornets tomorrow before hosting the NBA champion
Dallas Mavericks two days later.  Tyreke Evans scored 19 points and DeMarcus Cousins added 15
for the Kings (10-19), who hit 38 percent of their attempts from
the floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
