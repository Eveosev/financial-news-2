The  Washington State Investment
Board  agreed to invest $400 million in an Asian private equity
fund managed by  KKR & Co.   The commitment follows a similar $400 million placement in
a KKR Asian fund in 2007, according to Liz Mendizabal, a
spokeswoman for the board.  Washington â€™s pension fund, with $80.4 billion in assets as
of Dec. 31, invests public money for 17  retirement plans  and 22
other state funds. It has about $15.2 billion invested in
 private equity  and earned about 21 percent on the entire fund in
the fiscal year that ended June 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
