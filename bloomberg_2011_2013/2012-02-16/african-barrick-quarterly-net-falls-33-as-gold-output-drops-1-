African Barrick Gold Plc (ABG) , a miner of
the metal in Tanzania, fell by a record after fourth-quarter
profit slumped 33 percent and it forecast the lowest production
since the company listed in London in 2010.  The stock dropped 14 percent, the most since it first sold
shares in March 2010. Net income declined to $52.7 million from
$79 million a year earlier, the London-based company said today
in a statement. This year’s production target is 675,000 to
725,000 ounces.  African Barrick produced 688,278 ounces of gold in 2011,
missing its forecast for a second year, and posting a second
consecutive annual decline in output. The company, which targets
annual output of 1 million ounces in 2014, said it will need to
make acquisitions to reach that goal.  “We can get most of the way there with the organic
projects and then we will probably need to do something to push
us over the top,” Greg Hawkins, chief executive officer, said
in a telephone interview. The company will probably produce
about 900,000 ounces in 2014 in the absence of making any
acquisitions, Hawkins said.  For 2010, African Barrick initially forecast 2010
production of 800,000 ounces to 850,000 ounces. That was cut to
750,000 to 800,000 and then to about 716,000 ounces because of
production delays at its Buzwagi project and after a gang stole
fuel at the mine. The projected range for last year was 700,000
to 760,000.  ‘Need to Deliver’  African Barrick fell 70.5 pence to 448 pence by the close
in London trading. The stock has slumped about 19 percent since
it first sold shares.  African Barrick is “yet to garner market support and will
need to meet targets and deliver its growth projects favorably
to consummate a re-rating,” Numis Securities said in a note to
investors today.  Gold producers are battling cost increases even after
rising demand drove prices to a record last year as  Europe ’s
debt woes spurred investors to turn to precious metals as a
haven. African Barrick’s mining costs advanced 29 percent to
$779 an ounce last quarter, while production slipped 11 percent
to 160,020 ounces. Sales dropped 7.9 percent to $285.2 million.  Costs will rise to $790 to $860 an ounce in 2012, the
company forecast.  Hawkins said African Barrick is looking to make
acquisitions in West and Northeast Africa and has looked at more
than 20 projects in the past couple of years. Prices of
potential targets have “dramatically re-calibrated,” he said.  This year “now starts to look a lot more attractive for a
lot of these projects that we liked, but couldn’t make the
valuation case for,” Hawkins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
