South Korea ’s won slid to a two-week
low and government bonds rose after European leaders delayed a
decision on Greece’s bailout and as the  Federal Reserve  said
board members were divided on policy.  A decision slated for yesterday on offering 130 billion
euros ($170 billion) of rescue funds to Greece was postponed to
Feb. 20 and may be pushed back until after a still-unscheduled
Greek election. Minutes of the Fed’s last meeting released
yesterday showed a division over the need for more asset
purchases, which have previously fueled buying of emerging-
market securities. Sales at South Korean department stores fell
4.1 percent in January from a year earlier, the most in three
years, government data showed today.  “There was some speculation in the market for another
monetary easing by the U.S., but yesterday’s release watered
down expectations,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency
dealer at Daegu Bank. “Concerns surrounding  Greece  are also
continuing. Still, currency declines may be limited as we’ve
constantly observed exporters selling the dollar if the won
weakens beyond 1,125 per dollar.”  The won dropped 0.5 percent to 1,126.65 per dollar as of
9:16 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,127.30, the weakest since Feb. 1. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of
shares fell 1 percent from a six-month high reached yesterday.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.44 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year
futures rose 0.07 percent to 104.24. The one-year interest-swap
rate fell one basis point to 3.48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
