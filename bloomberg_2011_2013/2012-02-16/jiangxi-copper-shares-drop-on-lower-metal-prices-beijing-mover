Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362) , China’s largest
producer of the metal, fell the most in a week after prices for
the commodity declined to a three-week low.  The shares fell as much as 1.9 percent to 26.26 yuan in
Shanghai trading and closed at 26.49. In  Hong Kong , Jiangxi
Copper’s shares fell as much as 4.3 percent to HK$21.00 and were
trading at HK$21.35 as of 3:00 p.m. local time. China’s
benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  declined 0.4 percent.  Futures contracts for copper fell to the lowest in more
than three weeks today after a decision on a second bailout for
Greece was postponed, spurring concern the nation may be forced
to default. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell
a fifth day, poised for the longest losing streak since November.  “The copper smelters’ shares prices are correlated to the
underlying commodities prices in the long-term,” Zuo Xichao, an
analyst at Beijing Antaike Information Development Co., said by
telephone from the city of Changsha today. “Demand may pick up
in the second quarter,” usage by companies such as the power
industry and air-conditioning manufacturers increase, he said.  Jiangxi Copper’s shares fell more than 50 percent last year
in Shanghai and declined more than 34 percent in  Hong Kong. (358)  So
far this year, the stock has risen by more than 20 percent in
both Shanghai and Hong Kong.  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
