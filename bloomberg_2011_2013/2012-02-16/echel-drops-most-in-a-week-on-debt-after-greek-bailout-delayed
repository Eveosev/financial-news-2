OAO Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest coking
coal producer, declined the most among the country’s metal and
mining companies in Moscow as European leaders delayed a Greek
bailout, raising concerns about corporate borrowers’ costs.  Mechel, whose $9 billion of net debt at the end of
September was the highest level among Russia’s steel and coal
producers, dropped 3.1 percent to 321.90 rubles a share at 2:33
p.m. in Moscow, the biggest decline since Feb. 10.  “Russia’s whole mining and steel sector is falling on
Greece economy concerns,”  George Buzhenitsa , Deutsche Bank
analyst said by phone. “Mechel is declining the most as it has
the largest debt.”  Mechel fell 3.85 percent in New York yesterday to the
lowest level since Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
