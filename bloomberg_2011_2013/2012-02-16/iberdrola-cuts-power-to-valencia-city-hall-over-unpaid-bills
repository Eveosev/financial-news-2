Iberdrola SA (IBE) , Spain’s biggest power
utility, cut electricity to one of Valencia City Hall’s office
buildings because the municipality didn’t pay its bills.  Supply was restored after city officials agreed to a debt-
repayment plan, an Iberdrola spokesman said today in an e-mailed
response to questions. Spain’s third-largest city owed Iberdrola
about 6 million euros ($7.8 million) as of November,  El
Economista newspaper  reported earlier today.  Companies are struggling to squeeze payments out of Spain’s
public institutions that already are under pressure from a
national government that aims to cut its  budget deficit  to 4.4
percent of gross domestic product this year. Cleop SA, the
Valencia-based public infrastructure contractor, said this week
it is negotiating with creditors to refinance its debt after
public-sector clients failed to pay their bills.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos this month set up a  credit
line  through the state-managed Official Credit Institute to help
town halls pay their bills and offered regional governments as
much as 15 billion euros in loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
