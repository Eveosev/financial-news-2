SPX Corp. (SPW)  Chief Executive Officer
Chris Kearney said he has about $1 billion of cash and is eager
to make acquisitions in the flow-control industry.  SPX’s  Flow Technology unit , which sells pumps and valves to
the energy and food industries, will account for 53 percent of
estimated sales from continuing operations this year, up from 14
percent in 2004, Kearney said in an interview today. The company
completed the acquisition of ClydeUnion Pumps on Dec. 22 and is
considering more deals, he said.  “The strategy around flow will continue to evolve in a
positive direction, looking for other acquisitions to grow the
flow business,” Kearney said following release of the company’s
fourth-quarter earnings.  The strategy was validated by the flow unit’s 16 percent
increase in fourth-quarter sales and 20 percent jump in profit,
Kearney said. SPX, based in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , reported
adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.78,
higher than analysts’ average estimate of $1.75.  The company said it may also use its cash for more share
repurchases.  SPX said in January it would sell its vehicle-servicing
business to  Robert Bosch GmbH (RBOS)  for $1.15 billion. Kearney
declined to say if he’s looking to shed businesses from the
Industrial Products or Thermal Equipment units.  “There will be a lot of focus on looking for additional
opportunities to grow the flow platform,” he said. “We’re not
in any particular hurry to move anything else because we think
we’ve got other very good businesses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
