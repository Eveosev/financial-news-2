Japan ’s government maintained its
assessment that the economy is recovering from the March
earthquake even after a report this week showed  gross domestic
product  shrank.  “The Japanese economy is still picking up slowly, while
difficulties continue to prevail” due to last year’s record
earthquake and tsunami, the Cabinet Office said in a monthly
report in  Tokyo  today. The government left its evaluation
unchanged for a fourth consecutive month.  Japan’s economy shrank more than economists forecast in the
fourth quarter as the nation posted its first annual trade
deficit in 31 years amid a slump in exports. The government
lowered its evaluation of  China’s economy  for the first time
since August 2010, citing a cooling expansion in Japan’s largest
trading partner.  An economic slowdown fueled lawmaker criticism that the
 Bank of Japan  has been slower to act than its global
counterparts. The bank unexpectedly expanded monetary stimulus
and set an inflation goal this week.  The government was more optimistic about  consumer spending 
for the first time in six months, saying “personal consumption
has held firm recently.” It also raised its evaluation of
public investment and downgraded its view of housing
construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
