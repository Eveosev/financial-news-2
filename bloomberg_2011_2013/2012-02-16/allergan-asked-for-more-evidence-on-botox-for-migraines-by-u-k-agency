Allergan Inc. (AGN)  needs to provide more
information on its wrinkle-smoother Botox as a treatment for
chronic migraine headaches, the U.K.’s health-cost agency said.  More information is needed because the benefit demonstrated
by clinical trials is small and the results may have been
biased, the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence said in a statement today. Trial participants may
have known they were getting Botox rather than a placebo because
of the muscle paralysis it causes, the agency said.  “Without this additional evidence, potentially we will be
unable to advise the  National Health Service  that this drug is
good value for money,” Carole Longson, director of NICE’s
Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said in the statement.  Allergan of  Irvine ,  California  won U.S. regulatory approval
to sell Botox for chronic migraine headaches in October, which
may help almost double the drug’s annual sales to $2.3 billion,
according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The drug, a purified
form of the poison botulinum, is given as an injection. It was
cleared for those who have migraines at least 15 days a month
and whose pain lasts at least four hours.  NICE will accept comments through March 8 and will issue
final guidance in June, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
