Ministers from 12 European Union
countries including Portugal and  Hungary  called on the bloc’s
policy makers to support strong cohesion policy, saying it can
help spur investment and boost jobs.  The EU should ensure better use of cohesion funds, aimed at
less-developed regions, which may provide an important source of
growth, they said in a letter published in the European Voice
today. Its signatories also included European ministers from
Estonia, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.  “While it helps poorer regions, more developed countries
in  Europe  are beneficiaries of the knock-on effects,” they said
in the letter. “Getting Europe’s economy out of its current
quagmire will take more than getting cohesion policy right, but
it can provide a welcome boost.”  Cutting the cohesion-policy budget, which was set at 347
billion euros in the current seven-year budget through 2013,
would risk more acute territorial disparities, according to the
letter, which was also signed by ministers from Bulgaria, the
 Czech Republic , Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
