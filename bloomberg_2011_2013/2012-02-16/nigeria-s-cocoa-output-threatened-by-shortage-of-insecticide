Cocoa output from  Nigeria , the
fourth-biggest producer, is threatened by the shortage of an
insecticide to fight mirids, the country’s cocoa association
said.  Wet weather has brought on an onslaught of mirids, insects
that attack cocoa leaves, Robo Adhuze, spokesman for the
association, said today by phone from Akure, western Nigeria.
They could damage up to 40 percent of the crop, “if not treated
quickly and adequately.”  Patemglobal Nigeria Ltd., which said it’s the country’s
main supplier of the insecticide Actara 25WG, has sold out of
the product, Patrick Ikemefuna, managing director, said by phone
today from Lagos. The company is waiting for more deliveries.  Adhuze is concerned because farmers need the insecticide
immediately. “The rains have started and the chemical should be
in use by now, but the likelihood is that the farmers will use
unapproved chemicals or nothing at all,” he said. If that
happens the bean quality could be rejected by the European Union
and Japanese buyers, Adhuze said.  Output in the 2010-11 season was expected to be about
230,000 metric tons, or about 5 percent of global production,
according to Marex Spectron Group Ltd.  Nigeria ranks behind the  Ivory Coast ,  Ghana  and  Indonesia 
as the world’s largest cocoa producer, according to the website
of the  International Cocoa Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
