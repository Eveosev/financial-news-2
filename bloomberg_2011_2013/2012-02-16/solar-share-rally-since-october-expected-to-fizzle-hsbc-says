The rally in solar shares is
expected to fizzle out, HSBC Holdings Plc said, forecasting
“flat” photovoltaic panel installations for 2012.  Global solar panel installations will total 25.5 gigawatts
of capacity in 2012, down from last year’s 26 gigawatts, the
London-based bank said in an e-mailed note. It predicted 25
gigawatts of installations in 2013 and 27.275 gigawatts in 2014.  “We continue to suggest investors stay cautious given our
expectations of flat global installation growth and flat pricing
outlook in 2012,” HSBC analysts led by Joseph Jacobelli said in
the note, dated yesterday. “The sharp surge in January was a
result of volume surprises in a number of countries, namely
 Germany ,  China , the U.K.,  Belgium ,  France  and  Greece .”  The Bloomberg Industries  Global Leaders Solar Index (BISOLAR)  has
risen 30 percent this year after Germany in 2011 installed a
record 7.5 gigawatts of panels and as Suntech Power Holdings Co.
Chief Executive Officer Zhengrong Shi and Trina Solar CEO Jifan
Gao said the Chinese market may double this year.  By contrast, the analysts estimate 3 gigawatts of
installations in China this year, up from 2.14 gigawatts in
2011.  “We believe China wants to cap new additions for now and
developers want to see more tariff subsidies,” HSBC said. Even
so, the bank raised its 2013 forecast for Chinese installations
by 1.5 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts.  HSBC also raised its forecast for the Indian market by 200
megawatts to 800 megawatts this year and by 450 megawatts to 1.2
gigawatts in 2013. It cut its U.S. forecast for 2013 by 1.5
gigawatts to 3.5 gigawatts, citing concerns about financing for
utility-scale projects and low gas prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
