Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  Chief Executive
Officer Richard Glynn said growth in the U.K. bookmaker’s
digital arm gives “real confidence” for prospects in 2012.  “If you look at the momentum in the digital division and
you take that momentum through into 2012, that gives us real
confidence,” Glynn said in an interview on Bloomberg TV today.  Ladbrokes said today that 2011 pretax profit fell 8.5
percent to 134.6 million pounds ($211 million).  The stock lost as much as 2.4 percent, or 3.5 pence, in
London trading and was at 143.8 pence as of 8:36 a.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
