Republican presidential candidate
 Rick Santorum  paid more than 27 percent of his adjusted gross
income in federal taxes each of the past three years, according
to tax returns he released.  Santorum, who earned most of his income from what he listed
as “consulting and speaking” in 2010, paid taxes at rates from
2008 through 2010 that were about double the 13.9 percent
effective rate presidential rival  Mitt Romney  paid that year on
$21.6 million in income. Santorum released his tax returns last
night.  Santorum, a former senator from  Pennsylvania , provided
returns from 2007 through 2010, the period after he lost his
2006 re-election bid. He deducted $5,142 in moving expenses in
2007. The whited-out address visible on the returns as they load
on the Internet is in Great Falls,  Virginia , just outside
 Washington .  Santorum, 53, has emerged in the past few weeks as the main
challenger to Romney. Recent polls have shown Santorum leading
Romney in  Michigan , which holds its primary on Feb. 28.  Santorum’s income has increased over the past few years. In
2009, he and his wife, Karen, reported $659,637 in adjusted
gross income. They reported income of $945,100 in 2008 and
$1,116,736 in 2009.  The returns were  first reported  by Politico.  Relatively Steady  Their tax rate stayed relatively steady, reaching a minimum
of 25.4 percent in 2007 and hitting a maximum of 28.5 percent in
2010.  The returns present a “stark contrast” to Romney because
the Santorums received virtually no benefit from preferential
tax rates on dividends and long-term  capital gains , said Anthony
Nitti, a tax partner at WithumSmith & Brown in Aspen,  Colorado .  “He just doesn’t appear to be a player in the stock market
in any way, shape or form,” Nitti said. “All of his income is
essentially earned income, taxed at his maximum rate.”  Santorum’s financial disclosure forms show that he has
stock holdings inside individual retirement accounts.  The Santorums, who have seven children, contributed $16,289
to charity in 2010, or 1.8 percent of their adjusted gross
income. The returns released last night don’t list the
recipients of those donations.  Rental Income  Santorum and his wife received income from rental
condominiums and spent $59,322 on household help in 2010.  Mitt and Ann Romney contributed 13.8 percent of their
income to charity in 2010. The Romneys have released only a 2010
return and an estimated 2011 return.  The Santorums deducted $84,943 in mortgage interest in
2009, an amount that Nitti said stretches the limits of what is
possible under the cap of $1.1 million in indebtedness.  In 2009, the Santorums received a $945 tax credit for
spending $3,151 on energy-efficient exterior windows and
skylights. The tax break was part of the stimulus law championed
by President  Barack Obama  that Republicans opposed.  Santorum said on his returns that they were self-prepared.
In 2009 and 2010, Santorum paid a total of $925 in penalties for
not having enough taxes withheld or not paying enough estimated
taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
