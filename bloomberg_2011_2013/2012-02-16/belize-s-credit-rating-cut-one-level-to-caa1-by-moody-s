Belize ’s credit rating was cut by
Moody’s Investors Service Inc. on “significant questions about
the country’s willingness” to make debt payments.  Moody’s cut Belize’s foreign-currency credit rating to
Caa1, or seven steps below investment grade, from B3. The rating
will remain on review for further downgrades, Moody’s said in a
statement.  The change reflects increased concerns the government will
seek to restructure its debt after comments about such a move by
the prime minister ahead of upcoming elections, Moody’s said.  “Recent statements coming out of Belize suggests this
administration may eventually contemplate modifying the original
conditions,” Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
