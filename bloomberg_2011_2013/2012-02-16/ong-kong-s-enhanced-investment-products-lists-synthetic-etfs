Enhanced Investment Products Ltd.,
an exchange-traded  fund manager , listed four synthetic ETFs on
 Hong Kong ’s stock exchange today, with three more planned for
next week.  The company was the first local synthetic ETF manager to
have funds authorized by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures
Commission, Enhanced Investments said in a statement yesterday.  The funds, called XIE Shares, will track  Korean (3090) ,  Malaysian (3029) ,
 Taiwanese (3089)  and  Thai (3069)  stock indexes, the company said in the
statement. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc are the funds’ swap counterparties.  The listings come six months after the regulator  required 
managers of synthetic funds to increase collateralization levels
to boost protection for individual investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
