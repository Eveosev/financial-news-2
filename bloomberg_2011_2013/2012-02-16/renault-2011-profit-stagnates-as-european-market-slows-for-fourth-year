Renault SA (RNO) ,  France ’s second-biggest
carmaker, reported earnings and cash flow for 2011 that
outperformed larger competitor  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  on sales
growth in Brazil and  Russia .  Renault’s earnings before interest, taxes and one-time
items fell 0.7 percent last year, the carmaker said in a
 statement  today. That was less than the 27 percent operating
profit drop posted by Peugeot. Free cash flow from Renault’s
car-manufacturing unit was 1.08 billion euros ($1.4 billion)
versus negative cash flow of 1.65 billion euros at Peugeot.  The French carmakers have strategies of boosting sales
outside Europe as they predict the region’s vehicle market will
contract a fifth consecutive year in 2012. Non-European
deliveries accounted for a little more than 40 percent of last
year’s vehicle sales at both manufacturers, while those markets
generated 38 percent of revenue for Renault compared with 27
percent for Paris-based Peugeot.  “The big success in the Renault strategy and model range
is reflected in the strong revenue increase in relation to the
volume increase,” said Albrecht Denninghoff, a Frankfurt-based
Silvia Quandt Research analyst with “neutral” recommendations
on both carmakers. “At Peugeot, the weighting between  Europe 
and the rest of the world is different, so they were unable to
outweigh the pricing pressure inside Europe with price increases
elsewhere.”  Stock Rises  Renault  rose  as much as 4.8 percent to 37.94 euros and was
trading up 3.2 percent at 12:09 p.m. in Paris. The stock has
gained 39 percent this year, valuing the carmaker, based in the
Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, at 11 billion euros.
Peugeot fell as much as 4.9 percent to 13.37 euros and was down
4.1 percent.  Earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items fell to
1.09 billion euros from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier,
Renault said. Revenue rose 9.4 percent to 42.6 billion euros.
Deliveries increased 3.6 percent to a record 2.72 million cars
and light trucks, led by a 19 percent jump in countries outside
Europe, with the proportion of deliveries from those markets
increasing to 43 percent from 37 percent in 2010.  Renault and Peugeot, which ranks second to  Volkwagen AG (VOW)  in
the European car industry, both staged production stoppages late
last year to reduce inventory. Renault forecast today that the
region’s car market will contract 3 percent to 4 percent in
2012, marking the fifth consecutive annual decline.  Excess Capacity  Excess capacity in Europe’s car industry is probably about
20 percent, based on two shifts five days a week, Chief
Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said today at a press conference
at Renault headquarters. Peugeot CEO Philippe Varin yesterday
estimated overcapacity exceeds 20 percent.  Renault said it plans to pay a dividend of 1.16 euros per
share. Ghosn said today at an analysts’ conference that,
depending on how European car markets perform, “you can start
seeing a dividend being paid from the core operation of
Renault” for 2012 or 2013.  The payout plans are “good news” especially “in contrast
to Peugeot, where there’s unlikely to be any dividend,” said
Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based Commerzbank analyst with a
“hold” recommendation on Renault stock.  Peugeot said yesterday that it will sell property and a
stake in its Gefco trucking unit in a 1.5 billion-euro asset-
disposal program after net debt widened to 3.4 billion euros at
the end of 2011 from 1.6 billion euros on June 30.  Brazil Sales  Renault’s sales in  Brazil , which overtook  Germany  last year
to become the manufacturer’s second-biggest national market,
jumped 21 percent in 2011, pushing the company’s market share up
0.9 percentage point to 5.7 percent. Sales in Russia surged 60
percent, making the country Renault’s fourth-biggest market
compared with the ninth-biggest in 2010.  The French manufacturer is likely to reach a target market
share in Brazil of 8 percent a year earlier than its 2016 goal,
Ghosn said. Peugeot yesterday said the carmaker failed to meet a
target of break-even in  Latin America  in 2011.  Renault’s automotive  free cash flow  last year exceeded its
target of 500 million euros. The company said it’s planning to
maintain positive free  cash flow  in 2012 for the carmaking unit.
Industrial net debt, which excludes sales-financing operations,
fell to 299 million euros as of Dec. 31 from 1.14 billion euros
a year earlier.  The cash-flow figure is “particularly good news,
especially in the context of Peugeot yesterday announcing a
massive cash burn,” Gommel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
