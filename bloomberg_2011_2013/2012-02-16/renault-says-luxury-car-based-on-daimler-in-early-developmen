Renault SA (RNO) , France’s second-biggest
carmaker, is in the early stages of developing a luxury car
based on a Mercedes-Benz platform as it seeks to expand its
offerings in that segment.  The French carmaker, which helps Mercedes parent  Daimler AG (DAI) 
build its Smart compact car, is studying whether a Mercedes-
based luxury model would be a viable product, Renault Chief
Operating Officer Carlos Tavares told journalists in a briefing.  “At least one vehicle on a Daimler platform will help
us,” Renault Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  told
journalists in a separate briefing at the company’s headquarters
in the Paris suburb of  Boulogne Billancourt . “The intention is
to say that the exchanges with Daimler are not in one direction.
It’s not just Daimler coming and making its little cars, its
engines at Renault.”  Renault outperformed French competitor  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) 
in reporting higher earnings and cash flow last year. Renault
plans a new generation of its Espace minivan for 2014, followed
by a new luxury sedan, Tavares said today. The Mercedes-based
vehicle is the third luxury model planned, he said.  “It is about using their platform and designing a Renault
upper body to extend to it what I might call the French touch,”
Tavares said.  Production for the model would be “concentrated” in
France, according to Ghosn. The platform alone would not allow
them to charge higher prices, which are dependent on the car’s
specifications, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
