Manchester City  rallied to beat
defending champion Porto 2-1 in soccer’s Europa League as
Manchester United defeated Ajax 2-0.  Sergio Aguero’s goal in the 85th minute gave City the win
last night in Portugal. The Premier League leader tied the score
early in the second half on an own goal from Alvaro Pereira
after a goal by Porto’s Silvestre Varela in the 27th minute.  “It’s an important win because Porto are a top side,”
City manager  Roberto Mancini  said on the Europa League website.  City will host the return match in the two-game round of 32
series on Feb. 22.  Ashley Young and Javier Hernandez scored in the second half
to give  Manchester United  the advantage heading to the second
leg Feb. 23 at Old Trafford.  “I’m delighted with the score line,” United manager  Alex Ferguson  told UK’s Channel Five. “We improved in the second
half and deserved to win.”  United is in European soccer’s second-tier club competition
for the first time since 1996 after dropping down from the elite
Champions League. United was European champion in 1968, 1999 and
2008 and won the now-defunct Cup Winners’ Cup in 1991. Only
Juventus, Ajax and Bayern Munich have won those titles plus the
UEFA Cup/Europa League.  Valencia beat Stoke 1-0 on a goal from Mehmet Topal in the
36th minute, while  Radamel Falcao  scored twice to help  Atletico
Madrid  to a 3-1 win over Lazio. Falcao scored a Europa League-
record 17 goals last season in helping Porto to the title.  Hannover Rallies  Hannover rallied for a 2-1 home win over Club Bruges on
goals by Artur Sobiech and Jan Schlaudraff in the final 17
minutes, PSV Eindhoven scored twice in the first 11 minutes to
beat Trabzonspor 2-1 and FC Twente won 1-0 at Steaua Bucharest.  Wisla Krakow, which had Michal Czekaj sent off in the first
half, got a goal from Tsvetan Genkov in the 88th minute to tie
1-1 with Standard Liege, while Udinese and PAOK finished
goalless in Italy.  Metalist Kharkiv won 4-0 at Red Bull Salzburg,  Lokomotiv
Moscow  beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 and AZ Alkmaar defeated
Anderlecht 1-0. Schalke tied 1-1 with Viktoria Plzen and
Sporting Lisbon drew 2-2 with Legia Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
