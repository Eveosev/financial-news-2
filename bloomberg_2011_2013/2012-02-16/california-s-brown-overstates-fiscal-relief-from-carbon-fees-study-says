California (STOCA1)  will be able to use only
$100 million of the estimated $1 billion in proceeds from
auctioning carbon allowances to balance its budget, not the $500
million projected by Governor  Jerry Brown , the state legislative
analyst said.  Brown’s plan “likely overestimates the magnitude of
potential general fund relief,” said a  report  from the
Legislative Analyst’s Office, a nonpartisan agency that advises
lawmakers.  Brown is anticipating $1 billion from the nation’s first
economy-wide program for auctioning carbon allowances to
polluters. Half of that may be applied toward programs paid out
of the general fund, which supports education, health care and
some bond payments, among other things. The analyst’s office
said it identified only $100 million worth of qualifying
programs.  The cap-and-trade regulation lets polluters use credits
from certified carbon-reducing projects, such as urban forestry,
to “offset” as much as 8 percent of their emissions. Proceeds
from auctioning allowances must, under the law establishing the
program, be applied toward programs that reduce greenhouse-gas
emissions.  Brown has said he expects some money may be used for
 California ’s proposed high-speed rail project linking  San
Francisco  with  Los Angeles  and San Diego. The analyst did not
comment on that plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
