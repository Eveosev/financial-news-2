Russian prosecutors are probing the
independent TV channel Dozhd following its coverage of
opposition protests against Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  in
December, the Financial Times reported, citing the Moscow
prosecutor’s office.  Natalia Sindeeva, chief executive of Dozhd, has been
summoned for questioning next week about who funded the
channel’s broadcasts of the demonstrations following a request
from a pro-Kremlin deputy in the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
