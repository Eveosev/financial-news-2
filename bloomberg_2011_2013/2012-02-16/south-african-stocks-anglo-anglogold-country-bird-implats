The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
declined for a third day, falling 0.9 percent to 33,801.64 by
the close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active equities in the
South African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , a diversified miner that makes
up about 9 percent of the index, retreated to its lowest in a
month, slipping 2.6 percent to 320.51 rand. Copper fell for a
fifth day in its longest losing streak since November after
 Europe  postponed a decision on a second Greek bailout, spurring
concern the nation may default. Aluminum, zinc and lead fell.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL)  , the world’s biggest miner,
edged 0.9 percent lower to 248.30 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AGN)  (ANG SJ),  Africa ’s biggest producer
of the metal, closed at its lowest in four months, easing 4.1
percent to 326.14 rand. Gold declined after the delay on
 Greece ’s bailout boosted the dollar and eroded demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  City Lodge Hotels Ltd. (CLH)  , a hotel operator, rose the
most in almost seven months on a closing basis, jumping 5.5
percent to 76.02 rand. The stock was raised to “neutral” from
“underweight” at HSBC Holdings Plc.  Country Bird Holdings Ltd. (CBH)  , a chicken producer,
slumped the most in 11 months, slipping 5.8 percent to 4.85
rand. Earnings per share for the six months to Dec. 31 will be
44 percent to 48 percent lower than a year earlier after a
strike at one of its abattoirs, the company said in a regulatory
filing after yesterday’s market close.       Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the second-biggest
producer, fell 4 percent to 158.19 rand, the lowest close since
July 2009. The company said it has lost 60,000 ounces of
production from the Rustenburg operation after an illegal
strike. The South African Defence Force joined police outside of
the company’s Rustenburg mine to help stop protesters who are
looting, blocking roads and intimidating those who want to
return to work at the world’s largest platinum mine, a union
official said.  Mondi Ltd. (MND)  , Europe’s biggest maker of office
paper, dropped for the first time in four days, falling 2
percent to 66.89 rand. The company offered 1.17 billion zloty
($360 million) to buy the remaining 34 percent of its Polish
unit Mondi Swiecie SA and delist the company from the  Warsaw
Stock Exchange .  Mustek Ltd. (MST)  , a South African information
technology company, fell to the lowest in more than a month,
sliding 2.1 percent to 5.63 rand. Earnings per share dropped as
much as 45 percent in the six months through December from a
year earlier, the company said in a trading statement today.  Telemasters Holdings Ltd. (TLM)  , which sells phone
services to South African companies, sank 7.7 percent to 1.20
rand, the lowest in almost eight months. The company reported a
loss of 2.5 cents per share for the three months through
December from a profit of 8.05 cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
