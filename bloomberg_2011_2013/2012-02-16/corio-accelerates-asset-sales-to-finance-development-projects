Corio NV (CORA) , the largest Dutch real-
estate company, said it will increase asset sales fivefold this
year to help finance a 2.5 billion-euro ($3.3 billion) pipeline
of shopping-center projects.  The company will sell 670 million euros of properties,
mostly in the Netherlands and France, compared with the 136
million euros raised last year, Utrecht-based Corio said today
in a statement. The company today reported a 6.4 percent rise in
2011 earnings excluding items as acquisitions in preceding years
boosted rental income.  The asset sales accompany efforts by Chief Executive
Officer Gerard Groener to preserve cash, including offering to
pay a 2.76-euro dividend with shares and slowing or halting
projects in Italy and  Turkey . He is focusing the company on
large shopping centers, where retail sales have been stronger
than the national average in countries where Corio owns
property.  “In the context of an uncertain macroeconomic environment,
our focus is on preserving the capital structure of Corio,” the
company said.  Corio last year sold Liekeblom in the Dutch town of Leek
and Paris’s Passage Provence Opera. That cut 12.2 million euros
from net rental income. Corio said today it’s already in talks
to sell 150 million euros of properties.  Earnings excluding changes in asset values and deferred
tax, known as direct result, increased to 267 million euros
($349 million), or 2.91 euros a share from 251 million euros, or
2.88 euros, a year earlier.  2012 Forecast  Earnings excluding items, known as the direct result, will
probably fall “slightly” in 2012 because of the proposed  scrip
dividend , which is paid in shares.  Net asset value rose 2.5 percent from Sept. 30 to 47.15
euros a share, the company said. Net rental income rose 7.8
percent to 396.5 million euros in the quarter.  Corio made  acquisitions  worth 1.25 billion euros in 2010
and its purchases totaled 159.1 million euros last year, chiefly
the Saint-Jacques center in Metz,  France . These boosted net
rental income by 28.8 million euros last year.  Average rents rose 1.9 percent last year, excluding the
impact of acquisitions and asset sales. Corio signed 329 new
leases and renewed another 173 at 6.6 percent higher rents.  New developments opening in the Netherlands, including
Nieuwegein, Heerhugowaard and Spijkenisse, plus extensions to
existing centers generated an additional 8.9 million euros in
rent.  Net income  fell to 218.2 million euros, or 2.38 euros, from
375.7 million euros, or 4.31 euros, a year earlier when the
company’s real estate appreciated by significantly more.  The results were released after the close of trading. Corio
fell 17.5 cents to 36.525 euros in Amsterdam today. The shares
advanced 12 percent in the past three months, exceeding the 10
percent gain for the  FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index (EPRA)  of
real estate shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
