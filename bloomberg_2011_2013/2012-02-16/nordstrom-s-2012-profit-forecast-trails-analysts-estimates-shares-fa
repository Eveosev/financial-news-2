Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) , the U.S. chain with
more than 100 namesake department stores, projected full-year
earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates amid rising costs.  Earnings per share in 2012 will be $3.30 to $3.45, the
Seattle-based retailer said today in a statement. Analysts
projected $3.60, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Nordstrom’s selling expenses climbed in the fourth quarter
after it offered free shipping on all purchases and it incurred
costs stemming from its acquisition of the flash sales website
HauteLook Inc. Sales jumped as the retailer’s affluent consumers
spent more freely at year-end than other retailers’ lower-income
shoppers who have been struggling with job losses.  Nordstrom’s selling, general and administrative expenses
climbed to $876 million from $752 million.  Richard Jaffe , an
analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. projected $861 million. Jaffe,
who is based in  New York , recommends buying the shares.  The chain began offering free shipping on all purchases in
August and acquired HauteLook for about $180 million a year ago.  Nordstrom  fell  1.3 percent to $51.49 at 4:15 p.m.in New
York. The shares advanced 17 percent last year.  Net income in the quarter ended Jan. 28 rose 1.7 percent to
$236 million, or $1.11 a share, from $232 million, or $1.04, a
year earlier, the retailer said. The average  estimate  of 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.10.  Nordstrom’s retail sales gained 13 percent to $3.17 billion
in the quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year climbed 7.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
