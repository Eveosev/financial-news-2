Oil fell from a five-week high in
 New York  as the euro weakened against the dollar and European
equities declined after government leaders delayed a Greek
bailout.  Crude for March delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange declined as much as 75 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$101.05 a barrel, and was at $101.06 at 8:45 a.m. London time.
The contract gained $1.06 yesterday to close at $101.80, the
highest settlement since Jan. 10.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped as much as 1.1 percent
and the euro fell as much as 0.6 percent to $1.2988, reducing
the appeal of commodities priced in the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
