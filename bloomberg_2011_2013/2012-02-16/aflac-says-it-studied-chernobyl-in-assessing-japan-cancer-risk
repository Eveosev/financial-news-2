Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the insurer that gets
about three-quarters of its revenue from  Japan , studied
Chernobyl in assessing the risk of cancer from radiation after a
nuclear disaster in the Asian country last year.  “The main issue with Chernobyl ended up being the milk
that the children were drinking and they ended up getting
thyroid cancer,” Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos said today at
a conference in New York sponsored by Bank of America Corp.,
referring to the 1986 nuclear accident in the Ukraine. “There
is a pill that you can take that helps prevent that, and the
Japanese made sure that that pill was passed out and has been
taken.”  Aflac incorporated assumptions about the cancer risk into
its pricing, Amos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
