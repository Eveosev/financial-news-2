Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the
second-largest producer, said first-half profit rose 67 percent
as rand-based prices climbed.  Adjusted earnings climbed to 5.73 rand a share in the six
months through December, from 3.44 rand a year before, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. The mean
estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for adjusted
earnings of 5.35 rand.  While the average dollar platinum price increased 1.7
percent to $1,654.33 in the six-month period, the rand price of
the metal advanced 8.5 percent as the local currency
depreciated. Impala mines mostly in  South Africa , which has the
largest reserves.  Refined platinum production declined 21 percent to 356,000
ounces after a 48 percent decrease in volumes supplied to Impala
by rival companies.  Second-half output will be eroded by a stoppage at Impala’s
largest mine near Rustenburg, northwest of Johannesburg. The
company is losing about 3,000 platinum ounces a day at the
operation, which came to a complete halt on Jan. 30 as an
illegal strike by rock-drill operators over pay spread,
prompting the dismissal of about 17,000 workers.  Impala lost 60,000 ounces as of Feb. 14 at Rustenburg, the
company said. That’s the equivalent of $98 million at today’s
price of $1,635 an ounce.  Impala accounts for about a quarter of the world’s platinum
production, less than  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
