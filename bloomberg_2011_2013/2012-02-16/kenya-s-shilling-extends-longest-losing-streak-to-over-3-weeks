Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second day, its longest losing streak in more than three weeks,
as the euro debt crisis weighed on investors and drove them to
the safety of the dollar.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.6 percent and traded 0.2 percent lower at 83.05 as
of 1:03 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at this level will be the
longest stretch of losses since Jan 23.  A decision slated for yesterday on 130 billion euros ($170
billion) of aid to  Greece  was postponed to Feb. 20. Euro-area
finance ministers extracted concessions from Greek political
leaders to pave the way for the endorsement of an aid package
next week, though Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker 
said “further considerations are necessary.” Ratings for
global banks may be cut as lenders worldwide face risks of
rising funding costs amid  Europe ’s debt woes, Moody’s Investors
Service said.  “The shilling has weakened due to the ongoing euro crisis
which has seen major currencies weaken against the dollar, as
investors seek the safety of the US currency,” Jeremiah Kendagor, acting head of trading at Nairobi-based Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview. The euro fell
to 1.3 against the dollar today from 1.3061 yesterday and 1.3209
on Monday.  Tanzania’s shilling headed to its highest level in 14 days
as the central bank sold dollars. The currency of the second-
biggest economy in  East Africa  appreciated 0.2 percent at 1,592
per dollar as of 12:58 p.m. in Dar es Salam, the commercial
capital.  “The shilling is strengthening due to inflows coming in
from the central bank and walk-in customers,” Eric Chijoriga, a
trader with National Bank of Commerce Ltd., ABSA Group Ltd.’s
local unit, said by phone from  Dar es Salaam .  The Ugandan shilling weakened for the second day
depreciating as much as 0.3 percent to 2,324.50 per dollar as of
1:07 p.m.  -- Editors: Ash Kumar, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
