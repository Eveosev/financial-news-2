Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE)  reached an
agreement with staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission,
clearing the way for the final regulatory approval needed to
complete its $5.46 billion purchase of  Southern Union Co. (SUG)   Under the settlement, which must be approved by the four
commissioners, Dallas-based  Energy Transfer  agreed not to
increase utility rates because of the merger and to shield a
Missouri subsidiary from harm in the event of a credit-rating
downgrade, according to a filing today with the state regulator.
Southern Union’s Missouri Gas Energy sells natural gas to
customers in the Kansas City area.  “We’re on track for closing sometime in mid-to-late
March,” Energy Transfer Chief Financial Officer Martin Salinas
said on an earnings conference call today.  Energy Transfer agreed in July to pay $44.25 a share in
cash and partnership units for Houston-based Southern Union,
which owns 15,000 miles (24,000 kilometers) of interstate gas
lines. The price was increased after Williams Cos. made a
counteroffer to buy Southern Union.  Energy Transfer Chief Executive Officer Kelcy Warren said
Dec. 9 the company may sell some of the pipelines it’s acquiring
to Williams.  “There’s probably less desire on our part to have any
substantial divestitures,” Warren said today.  Energy Transfer rose 3 percent to $43.15 at the close in
 New York . Southern Union  gained  1 percent to $43.72, the highest
price since July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
