Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., California’s third biggest utility, agreed to buy
300 megawatts of wind and solar power from projects under
development by Spain’s  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and 8minutenergy Renewables
LLC.  SDG&E signed a 25-year contract for 200 megawatts of power
from 8minutenergy’s Mount Signal Solar project in Imperial
Valley and a 20-year contract for 100 megawatts from Iberdrola’s
189-megawatt Manzana Wind project near Rosamond, Sempra said
today in a statement.  The first 100 megawatts from the Mount Signal project, will
be operational by mid-2013, and the rest by late 2013. Power
will be delivered on SDG&E’s  Sunrise Powerlink  transmission
line, which is expected to be completed this year, SDG&E said.  Iberdrola’s U.S. renewables unit said yesterday it sold 50
megawatts of power from the Manzana project to Silicon Valley
Power, which is owned by the city of  Santa Clara , California.
The wind farm will use 126  General Electric Co. (GE)  1.5-megawatt
turbines and is expected to be complete this year.  Iberdrola Renewables Inc., based in Portland, Oregon,
operates about 5 gigawatts of wind power in the U.S.  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ’s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and  Edison
International (EIX) ’s Southern California Edison Co. are the state’s
largest utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
