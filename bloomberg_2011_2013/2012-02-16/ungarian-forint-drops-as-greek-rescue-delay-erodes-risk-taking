The forint weakened as concern grew
that delaying a rescue package will result in  Greece  missing a
debt payment, eroding demand for riskier emerging-market assets
as  Hungary  sought to restart bailout talks of its own.  The currency of Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted
eastern member, depreciated as much as 1.1 percent and traded
0.5 percent weaker at 292.79 per euro by 4:24 p.m. in Budapest.
The forint rose to 287.8 during yesterday’s trading, the highest
in more than four months, as data showed Hungary’s economy
expanded more than economists expected in the fourth quarter.  Europe ’s creditor countries have been struggling to reach
an agreement over a rescue of Greece, seeking more control over
how future aid is spent as the country faces the threat of
default over a bond payment due on March 20. Hungary will
tomorrow send a reply to the European Commission that will
address the disputed laws obstructing its own aid talks, without
allowing those outside Hungary to “overwrite” its policies,
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said today.  “The negative Greek news hurt sentiment, so the forint
weakened from its four-month high,” Imre Kerekgyarto, a
Budapest-based currency trader at Commerzbank AG, and colleagues
wrote in an e-mailed report today. “Despite the hope that
Hungary’s economy may avoid recession this year, rising risk
aversion is overshadowing trading.”  Investors are wrong to assume that Hungary reaching an
agreement with the IMF and EU on a financing package is a “done
deal,” Tim Ash, head of emerging-market research at Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc in  London , wrote in a research report late
yesterday after meeting government and central bank officials in
Budapest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
