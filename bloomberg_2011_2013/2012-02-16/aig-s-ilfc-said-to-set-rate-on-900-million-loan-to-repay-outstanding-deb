International Lease Finance Corp. (AIG) ,
the aircraft lessor owned by American International Group Inc.,
set the  interest rate  on a $900 million  term loan  the company is
seeking repay outstanding debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The loan, due in five years, will pay 4 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other, will have a 1 percent floor.  ILFC is proposing to sell the debt at 99 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  The debt is rated Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
graded BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  Bank of America Corp. is arranging the financing for the
Los Angeles-based company, the person said. The debt will be
distributed to investors this afternoon with the deal expected
to close Feb. 23.  Paul Thibeau, a spokesman for ILFC, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
