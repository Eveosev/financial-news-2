Women living with HIV or at high
risk of becoming infected can safely continue using hormonal
contraceptives, the  World Health Organization  said after
reviewing possible links between the products and the virus.  The Geneva-based United Nations health agency confirmed its
existing recommendations today after a study published last year
found using contraceptive injections doubles the chance women
will catch HIV and transmit it to a male partner. A higher risk
was also observed for birth-control pills, but that finding
wasnâ€™t statistically significant, the researchers wrote in
October in  The Lancet Infectious Diseases  journal.  Women and their partners should also use condoms to prevent
HIV transmission, the WHO said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
