OAO Russian Railways is seeking to
spend 7.5 billion rubles ($250 million) of government funds to
develop the Ust-Luga port instead of the Primorsk seaport as
intended,  Vedomosti  said, citing letters from key ministries to
Chief Executive Officer  Vladimir Yakunin .  The Primorsk port relies on pipelines and truck routes as
it lacks a direct rail link, the Moscow newspaper said. Ust-Luga
and Primorsk are both Baltic Sea ports in  Russia ’s northwestern
Leningrad region. Primorsk is owned by OAO Novorossyisk
Commercial Seaport, which is in turn controlled by oil-pipeline
operator OAO Transneft and businessman Ziyavudin Magomedov’s
Summa Group.  The Transportation Ministry is ready to allow the funds to
be used for Ust-Luga if the rail operator agrees to build out a
link to Primorsk in 2013, while the  Finance Ministry  encouraged
Russian Railways to use its own funds to build infrastructure
for Ust-Luga, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
