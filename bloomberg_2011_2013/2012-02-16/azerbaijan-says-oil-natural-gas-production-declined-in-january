Azerbaijan â€™s oil and natural-gas
production declined in January from a year earlier, the State
Statistics Committee said on its website today.  Oil output dropped 4.5 percent to 3.9 million metric tons
and gas production fell 20 percent to 1.6 billion cubic meters,
the committee said. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan previously
attributed lower output to increased safety measures at BP Plc-
led fields following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  Azerbaijan, the third largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , reduced 2011 oil output by 11 percent to 45.5
million tons and gas production 2.4 percent to 25.7 billion
cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
