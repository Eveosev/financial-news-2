Asian  stocks  fell, with the region’s
benchmark index retreating from a six-month high, after a second
bailout for Greece was postponed and  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
reported lower earnings.  Westpac, Australia’s second-largest lender, fell 3.5
percent as higher funding costs stemming from  Europe ’s crisis
ate into profit.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining
company, lost 2.2 percent in Sydney after metal prices dropped
and rival Vale SA said earnings fell as customers pressed for
discounts.  Phison Electronics Corp. (8299) , a maker of controllers for
 flash memory , slid 6.9 percent in Taiwan on lower chip prices.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.2 percent to 125.79
as of 5:11 p.m. in Tokyo, with all 10 groups on the measure
falling. The gauge yesterday rose 1.9 percent to 127.34, the
highest level since Aug. 4. Shares slipped today after European
officials delayed a decision on a 130 billion euro ($169
billion) bailout for  Greece  until at least Feb. 20.  “The Greek situation is being used to sell and lock in
profits today,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-
based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of
$37 billion. “If the markets were pricing in a default, losses
would be much bigger. Most people are expecting they would have
to reach a bailout decision on Feb. 20.”  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.2 percent after
gaining 2.3 percent yesterday, the biggest advance since Nov. 29.
South Korea’s Kospi Index declined 1.4 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.7 percent even after a report showed the
nation’s employers added more jobs than economists expected and
the  unemployment rate  slid.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index dropped
0.4 percent.  Bailout Decision  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.4 percent
today. The index slid 0.5 percent in New York yesterday
following the delay on a bailout for Greece. U.S. stocks also
declined after minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting last month
showed policy makers were divided on additional asset purchases
to spur economic growth.  Financial companies, led by Australian banks, were among
the biggest contributors to losses in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index. Westpac Banking fell 3.5 percent to A$20.22 after saying
its unaudited cash earnings in the three months ended Dec. 31
were A$1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) as rising funding costs
squeezed profits from lending.  Earnings Analysis  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. , Australia’s
third-largest lender, dropped 2.3 percent to A$21.20.  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  retreated 1.8 percent to A$22.63.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s biggest bank, lost 0.6 percent to
HK$69.35 in Hong Kong.  More than half the companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
that have reported  earnings  since Jan. 9 have missed analysts’
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 6.8 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and an 8 percent gain by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  BHP Billiton fell 2.2 percent to A$35.30.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) ,
Australia’s second-largest mining company by market value,
declined 2.3 percent to A$67.28.  Vale, a Rio de Janeiro-based miner, said clients pressured
it to revise its pricing system after iron-ore prices fell in
October to the lowest level since late 2009.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum lost 0.5 percent
yesterday.  Phison Electronics slumped 6.9 percent to NT$250.50 after
