Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) , the U.K.’s
biggest building company, lost a bid for a court order blocking
a proposed strike by hundreds of union workers.  Judge David Eady in London refused to issue an injunction
in a written judgment this morning.  Members of Unite labor union employed by Balfour Beatty
Engineering Services voted two-to-one for a strike in the most
recent ballot, the group said on its website Feb. 2. Unite
claims a new employment deal will lead to pay cuts of as much as
30 percent and worse contract terms for construction staff.  The dispute relates to collective bargaining agreements in
the  construction industry  and a “divide” between the
electrical and mechanical trades, according to the judgment.
Strike action at Balfour Beatty may affect infrastructure
projects including a  London  train line and new power stations,
Unite has said.  The company argued in the case that the strike vote process
was flawed.  “It seems clear that any such failures would be
unintentional,” the judge wrote. It isn’t clear how many of the
workers involved failed “to receive a ballot paper or to have
an opportunity to cast a vote.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
