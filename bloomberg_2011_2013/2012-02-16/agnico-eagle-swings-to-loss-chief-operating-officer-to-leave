Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM) , a gold
producer with mines in  North America , posted a fourth-quarter
loss after taking a $644.9 million writedown on its Meadowbank
project in Nunavut Territory in northern Canada.  The net loss was $601.4 million, or $3.53 a share, compared
with net income of $88 million, or 51 cents, a year earlier,
Toronto-based Agnico-Eagle said in a statement released after
the close of regular trading yesterday.  Profit excluding the writedown, foreign-exchange losses and
tax and stock-option expenses was 2 cents less than the 47-cent
average of 11 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Agnico-Eagle took the writedown on Meadowbank because of
“persistently high operating costs,” it said in the statement.
The move cuts the project’s mine life by three years. Cash costs
at the mine may rise to $1,040 an ounce this year from $1,000 in
2011, according to the statement.  Canada ’s Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc., the world’s
two largest producers of the metal by market capitalization,
have also reported higher costs as labor and raw-material
expenses rise. Kinross Gold Corp. said yesterday it took a $2.49
billion goodwill writedown on its Tasiast mine in  Mauritania .  Mining companies will take “several writedowns” as the
they deal with increasing costs, Agnico-Eagle Chief Executive
Officer Sean Boyd said today in an interview with Betty Liu on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop.”  Agnico-Eagle erased earlier losses to close 7.2 percent
higher at C$36.57 in Toronto.  Chief Operating Officer Eberhard Scherkus will leave after
26 years with the company, Agnico-Eagle said. Paul-Henri Girard,
vice president, Canada, will also depart after 25 years.  The company’s output was 985,460 ounces last year, 13
percent less than the bottom end of the range of its forecast in
December 2010. Agnico-Eagle forecast production of 875,000
ounces to 950,000 ounces in 2012, about 990,000 ounces in 2013,
and 1.06 million ounces in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
