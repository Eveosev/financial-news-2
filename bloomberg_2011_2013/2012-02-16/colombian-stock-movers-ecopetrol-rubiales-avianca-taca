flights at Bogota’s El Dorado airport due to fog, limitations
due to infrastructure deficiencies and labor negotiations
between air traffic controllers and the government, according to
an e-mailed statement yesterday after markets closed.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
rose 0.2 percent to 4,820 pesos. Fourth-quarter profit jumped 64

oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, climbed 1.1
percent to 48,000 pesos after the company reported yesterday a
natural-gas discovery at its Cotorra well in the lower Magdalena
Basin in Colombia.  “Investors see the potential for gas as a positive in the
medium term,” Bolsa y Renta analysts including Mauricio Restrepo del Toro said in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
