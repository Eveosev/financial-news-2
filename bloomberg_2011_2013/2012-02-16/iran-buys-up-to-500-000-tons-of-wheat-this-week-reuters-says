Iran  bought as much as 500,000
metric tons of soft wheat this week, lifting total purchases of
the grain in the past two weeks to more than 1.1 million tons,
Reuters reported, citing traders in Europe it didnâ€™t identify.  The purchases in the period included 420,000 tons of wheat
from German origin, 300,000 to 360,000 tons of Canadian grain,
240,000 tons from Brazil and 200,000 tons of wheat from
Australia, the  news agency  reported, citing the traders. Iranian
traders are in talks with Russia to import grain in rubles to
bypass European Union and U.S. currency restrictions, Reuters
said in a separate report, citing unidentified traders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
