DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-
TV provider, reported a 16 percent increase in fourth-quarter
profit as customer gains in  Latin America  climbed to a record.  Net income  rose to $718 million, or $1.02 a share, from
$618 million, or 74 cents, a year earlier, the El Segundo,
California-based company said today. Analysts predicted 92
cents, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
company also said it plans to start a new $6 billion share-
buyback program.  DirecTV gained 590,000 customers in Latin America, topping
the record 574,000 achieved in the previous quarter as it added
services to challenge pay-TV rivals such as America Movil SAB.
U.S. subscriber gains were smaller than projected, which may
concern investors as DirecTV battles rising programming costs
and cable rivals such as  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , said Michael McCormack,
an analyst at Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York.  “It’s costing more for DirecTV to acquire customers, and
U.S. subscriber gains were weaker than expected,” McCormack
said in an interview. “At the same time, Comcast is limiting
video customer losses. The dynamic is that cable’s Internet
bundling is becoming that much more important as the way people
watch TV develops.”  DirecTV gained a net 125,000 U.S. customers, fewer than the
162,000 average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, yesterday reported its
smallest quarterly video customer decline since 2007, losing
17,000 customers.  DirecTV  fell  0.6 percent to $46.01 at 11:39 a.m.  New York 
time. The shares had gained 8.3 percent this year before today.  Preparing for 2012  DirecTV’s sales increased 13 percent to $7.46 billion,
exceeding projections.  “The focus is likely to be on the company’s strategy and
expectations for the U.S. market in 2012,” said  James Ratcliffe , a Barclays Capital Inc. analyst in New York.  DirecTV said programming costs rose because of network fee
increases and expenses related to its NFL Sunday Ticket football
content. The programming expense will be exacerbated when
DirecTV negotiates new contracts with CBS Corp. and Discovery
Communications Inc. this year, said McCormack, who has a
“reduce” rating on shares.  DirecTV bought back $1.13 billion of its stock in the
quarter, part of the previous $6 billion share-repurchase
program announced last February.  (DirecTV plans to hold a conference call at 1 p.m. New York
