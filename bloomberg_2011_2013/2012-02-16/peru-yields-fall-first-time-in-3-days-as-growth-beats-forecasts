Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields for the first time in three days, after the economy
expanded in December at a faster pace than analysts forecast.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.6 percent at 12:07 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price
rose 0.05 centimo to 114.92 centimios per sol.  Peru’s economy expanded 6 percent in December from a year
earlier as mining and manufacturing activity reversed November’s
declines and fishing output surged, the national statistics
agency said today. The median estimate of 13 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for growth of 5.5 percent.  “The economic data in Peru remains pretty strong,” said
Bret Rosen, a Latin America debt strategist at Standard
Chartered Bank in  New York . “When you compare the fundamentals
of the country vis-à-vis others in emerging markets, it stacks
up quite well.”  January data on car sales, cement demand,  consumer
confidence  and machinery imports point to a “pretty strong”
first quarter of 2012, he said.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.6825 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6840 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
