Soybeans fell from a 20-week high in
Chicago as European leaders remained divided over a bailout for
 Greece , overshadowing indications demand is set to remain steady
in  China , the biggest importer.  Global stocks slid and the euro weakened after a decision
slated for yesterday on Greek aid was postponed to Feb. 20.
China signed agreements yesterday valued at $4.3 billion to buy
8.62 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans during a five-day
visit by Vice President  Xi Jinping .  “It’s broader markets, not fundamentals,” that are
pushing prices lower, Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London, said by phone. “There have been strong
U.S. bean sales this week and not much improvement to Brazilian
weather.”  Soybeans for May delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $12.6175 a
bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The oilseed yesterday reached $12.765, the highest price for a
most-active contract since Sept. 27. Brazil is the world’s
second-biggest soybean exporter after the U.S.  The delay in the Greek rescue “is negative for risk
assets, which includes commodities,” Adam Davis, a trader at
Merricks Capital Services Pty Ltd., said by e-mail. Soybeans
need “a fresh catalyst to go much higher” after yesterday
touching a level at which sell orders may be clustered, he said.  Corn for May delivery declined 0.4 percent to $6.2875 a
bushel. The grain slid for a third day and has lost 1.6 percent
this month.  Wheat for delivery in May dropped 0.2 percent to $6.33 a
bushel. The grain fell for a seventh session in eight. Milling
wheat for delivery the same month traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
declined 0.5 percent to 204.50 euros ($265.87) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
