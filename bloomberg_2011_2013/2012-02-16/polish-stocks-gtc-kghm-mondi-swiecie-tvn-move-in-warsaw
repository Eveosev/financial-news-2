Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  fell 0.7
percent to 2,319.33 at the close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC)  , the country’s biggest
property developer, plunged to the lowest level in more than
three weeks, retreating 6.9 percent to 9.41 zloty after a
management board member said the company may raise capital.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, dropped to the lowest level since Jan. 26, slipping
1.5 percent to 133.3 zloty. The metal slid as European leaders
remained divided over a bailout for Greece.  Mondi Swiecie SA (MSC)   jumped 5.8 percent to 73 zloty,
the highest level since Oct. 28, after Mondi Group, Europe’s
largest maker of office paper, announced a bid to buy the
remaining 34 percent stake in its Polish unit for 1.17 billion
zloty ($360 million).  TVN SA (TVN)   fell 1.3 percent to 10.66 zloty, extending
yesterday’s 8.5 percent loss after the country’s biggest
television network reported profit that missed analysts’
estimates and withdrew earnings guidance for 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
