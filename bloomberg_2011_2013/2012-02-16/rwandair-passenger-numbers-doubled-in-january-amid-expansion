RwandAir (0118669D) , the Rwandan national
carrier, said passenger numbers almost doubled in January after
it added more routes and bought additional aircraft.  The airline carried 25,000 passengers last month, compared
with 13,000 a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer John Mirege
said in an interview today in Kigali, the capital. Last year,
passenger numbers surged 82 percent to 200,000 from a year
earlier, he said.  “The achievement is attributed to the opening up of new
destinations and adding more aircrafts on our fleet,” Mirege
said.  RwandAir’s fleet currently consists of two Boeing Co. 737-
800s, two Boeing 737-500s and one Bombardier Inc. Dash 8 100
that fly to 13 destinations. Last month, the company said it
planned to buy two aircraft by June to replace two 50-seater CRJ
planes that were being sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
