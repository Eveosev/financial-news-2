Rates for  30-year  U.S. mortgages
held at the lowest level on record as fewer Americans sought
loans to buy homes.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan was unchanged in
the week ended today at 3.87 percent, the lowest in records
dating to 1971 and the third straight week at that level,
 Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average  15-year  rate
remained at 3.16 percent, according to the McLean, Virginia-
based mortgage-finance company.  “Rates have moved very little now for the last couple of
months,”  Keith Gumbinger , vice president of HSH.com, a loan-
data company in Pompton Plains,  New Jersey , said in an interview
yesterday. “Rates are at fantastic levels.”  Low borrowing costs have done little to spark consumer
interest in buying houses. Financing applications for  purchases 
have fallen in three of the past four weeks, according to data
from the Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association. The
group’s  purchase  index declined 8.4 percent in the period ended
Feb. 10, while its  refinancing  gauge rose 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
