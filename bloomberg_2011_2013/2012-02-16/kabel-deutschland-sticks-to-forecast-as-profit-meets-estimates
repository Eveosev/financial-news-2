Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8) ,
 Germany ’s largest cable-network operator, forecast net income
will “significantly” exceed 100 million euros ($130 million)
this fiscal year after profit rose in the third quarter.  Analysts project net income of 146 million euros for the
year ending March 31, according to estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization in the three months through
December rose 8 percent to 200 million euros, said the company,
based in the Munich suburb of Unterfoehring.  “We expect strong growth from January to March, which will
carry us into the range which we’ve set for ourselves,” Andreas Siemen, the company’s chief financial officer, said during a
conference call. “We’re very content with how the business has
developed, in Internet and telephone as well as in the TV
category.”  Kabel Deutschland  maintained projections for the year
ending March 31 of Ebitda of 790 million euros to 800 million
euros, and sales growth of 6.25 percent to 6.75 percent. Kabel
Deutschland is trying to sell more phone and Internet services
for multiple home devices to TV customers to catch up with
German and European peers in average revenue per user.  Germany’s cable market is consolidating.  Liberty Global
Inc. (LBTYA)  won antitrust approval from German authorities in December
to buy Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH, after the U.S. company
earlier purchased the country’s second-largest operator,
Unitymedia, in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
