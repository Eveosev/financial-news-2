Japan  and Mozambique will cooperate
on the development of coal, oil and natural gas in the southern
African country as global competition to secure natural
resources intensifies.  A memorandum of cooperation was signed today in Tokyo with
Mozambique’s mineral resources ministry, the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan said in a statement. The
agreement also covers the participation of Japanese companies in
development projects, according to the statement.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and  Posco (005490) , the largest steelmakers in
Japan and  South Korea , are investing in the $600 million Revuboe
coking coal project in Mozambique. Coking coal and iron ore are
the key raw materials used to make steel.  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s largest oil company, yesterday reported a
second “giant” natural-gas discovery off Mozambique, near the
Mamba South find that it made last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
