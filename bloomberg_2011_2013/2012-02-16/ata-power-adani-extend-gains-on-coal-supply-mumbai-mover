Tata Power Co. (TPWR) ,  India ’s biggest
private utility, and rivals including Adani Power Ltd. gained a
second day in Mumbai on expectations a shortage of coal for
generation plants will ease after signing purchase agreements.  Tata Power added 4.7 percent to 115.60 rupees, the highest
intraday level since Aug. 11, as of 10:11 a.m. The stock gained
5.9 percent yesterday. Adani Power climbed 6.5 percent to 83.95
rupees, after rising a record 14 percent yesterday. The BSE
Power Index, a measure of 19 Indian companies, rose 2.3 percent.  Coal India Ltd., the world’s largest producer of the
commodity, will sign agreements with the nation’s utilities for
the first time since 2009, according to a statement yesterday on
the Prime Minister’s website. The accords will increase coal
supplies to projects due for completion by March 2015 and those
constructed by Dec. 31.  “The confirmation that  Coal India (COAL)  will sign the coal
supply agreement for a higher supply is a big boost for power
companies,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at Mumbai-
based K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. “With the coal
supply concerns getting addressed, it seems the worst is behind
us for the power sector.”  The agreements will benefit  power plants  with a combined
capacity of an estimated 50,000 megawatts, according to the
statement. That’s equivalent to about 27 percent of the
country’s current installed capacity.  Coal India will arrange alternative supplies, including
imports, if its domestic production isn’t enough to meet
commitments. The mining company reported a 2.8 percent drop in
output to 291.2 million metric tons in the nine months ended
Dec. 31, according to a Feb. 13 statement. Coal India fell 3.4
percent to 328.40 rupees.  Billionaire owners of Indian utilities, including Ambani
and Gautam Adani, Chairman of  Adani Power (ADANI) , joined Tata Power
Chairman Ratan Tata last month in urging Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh to ease fuel shortages and help increase generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
