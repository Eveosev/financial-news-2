Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s ruling party snapped five months of declines in polls in
February, Szonda Ipsos said.  Backing for Orban’s Fidesz party rose to 18 percent from 16
percent in January among eligible voters, Ipsos said on its
 website  today. Support for the opposition Socialist Party rose
to 13 percent from 11 percent while for the radical nationalist
Jobbik it fell to 8 percent in February from 9 percent the
previous month.  The share of undecided voters and those who say they
wouldn’t vote in an election dropped to 53 percent in February
from a record 57 percent in January, Ipsos said.  The poll, conducted between Feb. 4 and 11 among 1,500
adults, has a 2.5 percentage point error margin. The next
parliamentary election is scheduled for 2014.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
