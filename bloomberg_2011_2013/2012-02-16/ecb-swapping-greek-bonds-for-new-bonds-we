The  European Central Bank  is
swapping its 50 billion euro Greek government bond holdings for
new Greek bonds,  Germany â€™s Die Welt newspaper reported, citing
unidentified central bank officials.  The swap will be completed by Feb. 20, Die Welt said in a
pre-release of an article to be published tomorrow. The ECB is
swapping the bonds at their nominal value, generating a profit
because they were purchased at a discount.  The profits will be distributed via national central banks
to the governments who can do with them as they please, the
newspaper said.  This is a technical operation ensuring the ECB will not
have to take part in a private sector bond swap, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
