County Bird Holdings Ltd. (CBH)  fell the
most in 11 months after saying earnings per share for the six
months through December were probably 44 percent to 48 percent
lower than a year earlier.  Shares in the poultry producer declined as much as 8.4
percent, the most since March 11, to 4.72 rand, and closed 5.8
percent lower at 4.85 rand in Johannesburg.  The drop in profit is mostly a result of a strike at one of
its South African abattoirs, the company said in a trading
statement today. The work stoppage at Country Bird’s Botshabelo
abattoir in South Africa’s Free State province in July lasted
nine weeks.  Country Bird jumped to a four-year high on Feb. 14 after
 South Africa  imposed higher charges on chicken imports from
 Brazil  to protect local suppliers.  Brazil’s poultry association said it will ask the
government to approach the World Trade Organization about South
Africa imposing higher tariffs on some imports from the South
American nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
