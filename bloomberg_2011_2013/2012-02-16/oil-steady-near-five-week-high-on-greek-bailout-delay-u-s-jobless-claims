Oil advanced to a six-week high on
optimism that  Greece  will get a second bailout and as U.S.
jobless claims dropped to the lowest level since 2008.  Futures rose 0.5 percent after Pantelis Kapsis, a
government spokesman, said Greece expects euro area finance
ministers to approve a deal at a meeting on Feb. 20.
 Applications (INJCJC)  for unemployment insurance payments dropped 13,000
in the week ended Feb. 11 to 348,000, the Labor Department said.  “All of the markets are clearly rising on the latest Greek
news,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New
York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. A bailout “should
lead to greater stability and strength in all of the euro-zone
economies and reduce the fear of a total default, which could
have had terrible consequences.”  Oil for March delivery gained 51 cents to $102.31 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since Jan. 4. Prices have gained 3.5 percent this year.  Brent oil for April rose $1.18, or 1 percent, to settle at
$120.11 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, an eight-
month high.  Letters of commitment to implement the second aid plan
won’t be required from party leaders outside the two supporting
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , Kapsis said in  Athens .  “The Greek conservative leaders have finally signed on,
which is removing a final impediment to assistance,” Kilduff
said.  Equities, Euro Gain  U.S. stocks and the euro gained after the Greece bailout
news. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose as much as 1.1
percent. The  euro strengthened  0.6 percent against the dollar
after falling as much as 0.7 percent. A stronger euro and weaker
dollar boost oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  The  European Central Bank  is swapping its 50 billion-euro
($66 billion) Greek government bond holdings for new Greek
bonds,  Germany ’s Die Welt newspaper reported, citing
unidentified central bank officials. The swap will be completed
by Feb. 20, Die Welt said in a pre-release of an article to be
published tomorrow.  European governments may cut  interest rates  on emergency
loans to Greece and use contributions from the ECB to plug a new
financing gap in the second bailout program for Athens, two
people familiar with the discussions said.  “If we aren’t going to have a meltdown, it’s good for risk
assets,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis . “The Germans,
Finns and Dutch have gotten some real concessions out of the
Greeks, and may be ready for a deal.”  Jobless Claims  Estimates for first-time jobless claims ranged from 350,000
to 380,000 in a Bloomberg survey of 45 economists. The Labor
Department revised the prior week’s reading up to 361,000 from
358,000. The number  continuing  to collect jobless benefits
dropped by 100,000 to 3.43 million, the fewest since 2008.  Total  fuel demand  increased 5.9 percent from a 12-year low
to 18.7 million barrels a day last week, the Energy Department
reported.  “The jobs number is pretty bullish,” said  Phil Flynn , an
analyst at PFGBest in Chicago. “If the jobs market starts to
recover, oil demand will come back.”  Oil was also supported by other government data that beat
expectations. The Commerce Department reported that U.S.
builders  broke ground  on more homes than forecast in January and
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s  general economic
index  for February rose to 10.2, a four-month high.  “Economic numbers are showing the  U.S. economy  is
recovering,” said James Williams, an economist at WTRG
Economics, an energy research firm in  London , Arkansas.  Futures dropped as much as 0.9 percent in early trading
after Moody’s Investors Service said it is reviewing the credit
ratings of 17 banks and securities firms and as the U.S. played
down Iran’s claim of a nuclear breakthrough.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 595,430
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 792,027
yesterday, 30 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.48 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
