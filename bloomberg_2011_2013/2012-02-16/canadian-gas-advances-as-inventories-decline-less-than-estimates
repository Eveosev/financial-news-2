Canadian natural gas advanced after
a U.S. government report showed that stockpiles of the fuel fell
more than analysts estimated.  Alberta  gas rose 3.2 percent as inventories dropped 127
billion cubic feet to 2.761 trillion last week, according to the
 Energy Department (DOENUSCH) . Analysts had forecast a decline of 120
billion, the median of 24 estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .
Stockpiles were 38 percent above the five-year average as of
Feb. 10, the report showed.  “Whenever you have a number that deviates from the
estimates and indicates some bullishness, the market sees there
may be some support out there,” said Eric Bickel, a natural-gas
analyst with Summit Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky .  Alberta gas for March delivery gained 6.25 cents to C$2.04
a gigajoule ($1.93 per million British thermal units) at 11:35
a.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
has lost 29 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 13.6 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $2.561 per million
Btu as of 11:40 a.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 83 million above target.  Flow Rates  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.42 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.1 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 417 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.03 billion cubic feet today, or 83 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.95
billion cubic feet at 10:35 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
