Clifford Chance LLP has become the
first foreign  law firm  to apply to open an office in  South Korea 
since free trade agreements with the European Union and U.S.
were ratified last year.  South Korea’s Ministry of Justice is reviewing the London-
based firm’s application for preliminary approval, which would
take about two to four months, it said in a statement today.  U.S. firms including  Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton LLP 
and  McDermott Will & Emery LLP  announced plans to open in Seoul
soon after the U.S.-South Korea free trade accord was ratified
in November. Clifford Chance, which announced its plans before
the EU-South Korea agreement took effect in July, has worked
with clients in the Asian country for more than 30 years.  “We have ambitious plans for our Asia Pacific operations,
and South Korea is an important part of those expansion plans,”
said Peter Charlton,  Clifford Chance ’s Asia Pacific regional
managing partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
