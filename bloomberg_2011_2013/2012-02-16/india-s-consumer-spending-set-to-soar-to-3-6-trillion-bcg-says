India’s consumer spending is likely
to almost quadruple by 2020 to $3.6 trillion spurred by economic
growth and rising incomes, the Boston Consulting Group said.  Consumer expenditures are set to expand 3.6 times from $991
billion in 2010, a 14 percent annual pace of growth, the Boston-
based company said in a report. That compares with the projected
global average pace of 5.5 percent and 9 percent for emerging
economies, it said.  Higher consumer spending may give companies such as
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , a unit of the world’s second-biggest
consumer-goods maker, an opportunity to expand in Asia’s third-
biggest economy. Businesses “with growth ambitions must make
India a priority” as household incomes could climb 2.9 times
from 2010 to 2020, the company said.  “While inflation and higher  interest rates  may have
momentarily caused consumers to hit the pause button, the long-
term trends for consumer spending in India all point north,”
said  Arvind Subramanian , a partner in Boston Consulting Group’s
Mumbai office and an author of the report.  By 2020, India will constitute 5.8 percent of global
consumption, compared with 2.7 percent now, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
