Wal-Mart de  Mexico  SAB,  Latin
America ’s largest retailer, advanced after Credit Suisse Group
AG raised its recommendation on the stock to “outperform” from
“neutral,” saying a pickup in consumer credit will buoy
spending.  Walmex, as the Mexico City-based company is known, gained
1.3 percent to 40.08 pesos at 12:16 p.m. in Mexico City. A close
at that level would be the biggest gain since Jan. 31.  “ Consumer spending  in Mexico will accelerate,” Credit
Suisse analysts led by Antonio Gonzalez wrote in a research note
sent late yesterday. “Walmex will disproportionately benefit
from a growing industry in years to come.”  While Mexican consumer  sentiment  has struggled to return to
levels reached before the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brother
Holdings Inc., the confidence gauge last month climbed to the
highest level since July. Mexican  consumer credit  jumped 23
percent in the last quarter of the year, compared to the same
period in 2010, according to the latest data published by the
National Securities and Banking Commission, known as CNBV.  Credit Suisse maintained its “outperform” recommendations
for Organizacion Soriana SAB, Mexico’s second-largest grocery
store chain, and Grupo Comercial Chedraui SAB.  The benchmark  IPC index  of 35 Mexican stocks rose 0.4
percent today after claims for U.S. jobless benefits
unexpectedly dropped last week to the lowest level in four
years. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the
world’s biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
