Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts fell for a third day on speculation a delay on
 Greece ’s bailout and slowing inflation in Brazil will make room
for further cuts in borrowing costs.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.24 percent at
9:39 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened 0.4 percent to 1.7352
per  U.S. dollar , from 1.7285 yesterday.  Global stocks ,
commodities and the euro fell after Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker said “further considerations are
necessary” before endorsing an aid package for Greece.  In Brazil, consumer prices as measured by the IPC-S index
rose 0.30 percent in the 30 days through Feb. 15, the Getulio
Vargas Foundation said today. The increase was less than the
0.38 percent median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Consumer prices in  Sao Paulo  as measured by the IPC-
Fipe rose 0.24 percent in the four weeks through Feb. 14, also
below estimates.  The figures were “surprisingly low,”  Luciano Rostagno ,
chief strategist with Banco WestLB do Brasil SA, said by phone
from Sao Paulo. “The bad performance international markets are
having today and the price indexes released in Brazil affect the
DI curve.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
