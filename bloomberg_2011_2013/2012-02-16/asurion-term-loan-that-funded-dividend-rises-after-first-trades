Asurion Corp.’s $1 billion unsecured
 term loan  to fund a dividend payment rose in its first day of
trading, according to data provider Markit Group Ltd.  The 7.5-year debt, sold to investors at 97 cents on the
dollar, began trading today at 100.5 cents, Markit prices and
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Morgan Stanley arranged the
financing for the Nashville, Tennessee-based provider of
wireless and handset insurance, Bloomberg data show.  The loan pays interest at 9.5 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.5 percent minimum on
the benchmark, Bloomberg data show. Libor, the rate at which
banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other, acts as a
benchmark for about $360 trillion of financial instruments
worldwide.  Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, Providence Equity Partners
Inc. and Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe acquired Asurion for $4.1
billion in July 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
