TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (TRW) , the
world’s biggest vehicle-safety equipment supplier, rose the most
in more than two years after topping analysts’ profit estimates,
boosted by increased auto production in  North America  and demand
for its safety products.  TRW climbed as much 14 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since November 2009. The shares rose to $47.25 at 10:36 a.m. New
York time. Before today, TRW had risen 27 percent this year
after sliding 38 percent in 2011.  Fourth-quarter profit rose to $425 million, or $3.27 a
share, from $204 million, or $1.56, Livonia, Michigan-based TRW
said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit was
$1.84 a share. The average of seven analysts’ estimates in a
 Bloomberg survey  was for a profit of $1.55.  Sales in the quarter increased 7.4 percent to $3.99
billion, compared with $3.96 billion, the average of six
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
