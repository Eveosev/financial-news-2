Mexico ’s peso gained for the first
time in three days as growing confidence in the  U.S. economy 
boosted the outlook for exports from the Latin American country.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 12.8174 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close in Mexico City, from 12.8791 yesterday. It has gained 8.7
percent this year.  U.S. data on jobless claims, housing starts and
manufacturing bolstered optimism about the world’s biggest
economy. The U.S. buys about 80 percent of Mexican exports.
Mexico’s economic activity index rose 3.51 percent in December
from a year ago, the national statistics agency said today,
compared with the 3.55 percent median estimate of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Mexican growth data “brought some positive signs for
markets and I think that is being reflected in the rebound of
the peso,” Alfredo Coutino, Latin America director at Moody’s
Analytics, said by phone from  West Chester , Pennsylvania. “The
news from the U.S. today is also behind the rebound.”  Mexico central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said
yesterday that economic growth expectations for the Latin
American country haven’t fallen, maintaining his forecasts for
expansion this year and next of 3 percent to 4 percent.  “We’re working with an assumption, with a projection of
GDP growth this year of 3.5 percent,” Mexico Deputy Finance
Minister  Gerardo Rodriguez  said today in a telephone interview
from Mexico City.  The yield on peso-denominated debt due in 2024 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.47 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the
securities fell 0.16 centavo to 130.68 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
