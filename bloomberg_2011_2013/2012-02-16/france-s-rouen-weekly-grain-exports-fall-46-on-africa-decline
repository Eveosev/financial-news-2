Grain exports from France’s Rouen
port,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 46 percent in
the week through yesterday to the lowest in five weeks on a lack
of cargoes for  Algeria  and West Africa.  Outbound grain was 56,801 metric tons between Feb. 9 and
Feb. 15 from 105,609 tons a week ago, the  Seine River port  said
in an e-mailed report today. Exports included 43,101 tons of
soft wheat and 6,600 tons of durum wheat.  Morocco was the biggest export destination, taking 20,000
tons of soft wheat and 6,600 tons of the harder durum variety
used to make couscous and pasta. Cuba was the second-biggest
customer with 23,101 tons of soft wheat.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
