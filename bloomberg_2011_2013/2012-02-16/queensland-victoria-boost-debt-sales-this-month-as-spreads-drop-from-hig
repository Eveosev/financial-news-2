Queensland,  Australia ’s biggest
state borrower, and Victoria boosted debt sales this month as
concerns eased that  Europe ’s crisis would spur global financial
turmoil.  Queensland raised A$3.2 billion ($3.4 billion) since Jan.
31 and has now met 87 percent of its 2011-2012 financing program
after borrowing A$16.7 billion since July 1, 2011, Queensland
Treasury Corp. said yesterday in an e-mailed response to
questions. Victoria had net debt issuance of A$1.1 billion in
February, Treasury Corp. of Victoria said.  Australian states pulled back from bond markets in the
final quarter of 2011 as concern Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
would slow global growth drove up the provinces’ borrowing costs
relative to federal government debt. QTC’s February sales
contributed to A$4.2 billion in term-debt issuance this year,
after borrowings dropped by almost 75 percent to A$1.4 billion
in the three months ended Dec. 31, from the previous quarter.  “A lot of people in the market have been sitting on cash
and only buying  government bonds , not bank or semi-government
debt, and that builds up over a period of time,” Justin Lofting, general manager of treasury at TCV, said Feb. 15.
“People looked at the market and said: ‘We haven’t bought these
things for a while and spreads look wide historically.’ So the
good demand has been there in the last few weeks for semi-
government debt.”  Victoria issued net debt of A$3.9 billion since July 1,
2011, its funding arm said in a Feb. 14 e-mail. TCV has
completed more than 70 percent of this financial year’s program,
Lofting said.  Spreads Narrow  The extra yield Queensland’s 6.25 percent note maturing in
February 2020 offers over similar-maturity Australian government
bonds narrowed to 122 basis points after touching 163 basis
points on Feb. 1, the most since it was issued in February 2010,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader. The state has A$74 billion
in outstanding debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The spread for Victoria’s June 2020 bond declined to 84
basis points from as much as 106 basis points on Feb. 1, the
most since it was sold in 2009. The state has A$28.7 billion in
debt outstanding, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
