The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission may violate the intent of Congress if it permits
companies to “furnish” rather than “file” disclosures on
their use of so-called conflict minerals, a group of Democratic
lawmakers said in a letter to the agency.  Furnishing rather than filing information about use of the
gold, tin, tantalum or tungsten tied to warfare in Central
Africa could diminish companies’ liability under  securities law 
in a way that’s inconsistent with the intent of the Dodd-Frank
Act provision requiring disclosures, Senator Patrick Leahy of
Vermont and six other lawmakers wrote in a letter dated today.  “We are very concerned about the outlines of the final
rule, in particular, that the Commission will approve a rule
that contravenes Congress’ legislative intent,” the lawmakers
wrote in the letter to SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro .  The SEC has yet to complete work on the conflict-minerals
measure, missing the April 2011 deadline set under Dodd-Frank,
the financial-regulation overhaul enacted in 2010. The rule will
require public companies disclose whether any of the listed
metals in their manufacturing or products came from the
 Democratic Republic  of Congo or surrounding countries, where
mining revenue has funded violent militia groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
