Xing Wu Pan, accused in  New York
City  of participating in a political donation scheme, was
indicted by a grand jury on a charge of attempting to use straw
donors to raise funds for a candidate’s campaign.  Pan, also known as “Oliver Pan,” and others engaged in a
scheme to defraud the city by using fake donors “to attempt to
obtain matching funds to support the candidate’s campaign for
citywide elective office,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the indictment filed yesterday in federal court
in Manhattan. The candidate wasn’t named in the document.  The  New York  Times reported in November that Pan is a
fundraiser for New York City comptroller John C. Liu, whose
campaign finances are, the newspaper reported, under federal
investigation. Pan was charged in November with  wire fraud ,
according to court documents. The Times reported in November
that he was arrested on charges that he helped illegally funnel
thousands of dollars into Liu’s campaign account, citing court
papers and unidentified people briefed on the case.  Greg Ryan, an attorney for Pan, didn’t immediately return a
voice-mail message after regular business hours yesterday
seeking comment on the indictment.  The case is U.S. v. Pan, 12-00153, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
