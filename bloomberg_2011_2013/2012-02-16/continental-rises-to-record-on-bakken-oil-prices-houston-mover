Continental Resources Inc. (CLR) , the
biggest petroleum leaseholder in  North Dakota ’s Bakken Shale
field, rose to a record today as prices for oil from the field
increased from recent lows.  Continental rose 7.1 percent to a  record  $88.83 at the
close in  New York .  Bakken oil closed at $92.20 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloombeg. Prices have risen 30 percent since a
partial shutdown at a refinery that processes the crude sent
them as low as $71.17 a barrel on Feb. 10, Brian Lively, an
analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. in Houston, said in an
interview.  Lively rates Continental a “hold” and owns none of the
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
