Thailand’s baht weakened after
European leaders postponed a decision on a second bailout for
 Greece , boosting demand for the relative safety of the dollar.  The  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-Pacific Index of shares fell after a decision
slated for yesterday on 130 billion euros ($170 billion) of aid
was postponed until at least Feb. 20 as creditor countries
sought more concessions from political leaders in  Athens . Greece
has a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment due March 20. The baht
strengthened 2.3 percent this year and the SET Index of Thai
stocks climbed 9.9 percent as global funds purchased $910
million more Thai equities than they sold, exchange data show.  “Uncertainty about Greece is growing, which weighed on
stocks and boosted the dollar,” said Paisarn Lertkowit, a
currency trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “Investors are becoming a
little bit risk averse. It may also be regarded as a correction
as the risk-asset rally so far this year is quite impressive.”  The baht slid 0.2 percent to 30.84 per dollar as of 8:25
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may trade between 30.75 and 30.95 this week, Paisarn
said.  Data on Feb. 20 may show  Thailand ’s economy contracted 5.2
percent in the last three months of 2011, compared with a 3.5
percent expansion the previous quarter, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Annual growth slowed to 0.9 percent from
7.8 percent in 2010, a separate poll shows.  “Weak data is already priced in for that quarter and what
we are concerned about now is how businesses affected by the
floods last year will recover,” Bangkok Bank’s Paisarn said.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 was
unchanged at 3.19 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
