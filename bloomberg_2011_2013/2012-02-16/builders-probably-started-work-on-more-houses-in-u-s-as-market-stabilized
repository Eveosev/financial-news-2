Builders in the U.S. probably  broke
ground  on more houses in January, indicating the residential
real estate market is stabilizing, economists said before a
report today.  Starts climbed 2.7 percent to a 675,000 annual rate,
according to the  median  estimate of 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Building permits, a proxy for future
construction, may have climbed 1.3 percent. Manufacturing in the
Philadelphia area accelerated and higher fuel costs drove up a
measure of wholesale prices, other data may show.  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH)  and  D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI)  are among
builders reporting more orders as a pickup in employment,
cheaper properties and borrowing costs close to a record low
attract buyers. At the same time, the glut of foreclosed houses
remains a restraint on construction, one reason the Obama
administration and the Federal Reserve are taking steps to
bolster the industry.  “We’re seeing some stabilization in housing, and demand
will eventually pick up,” said  Millan Mulraine , a senior U.S.
strategist at TD Securities in  New York . “While it is still a
beleaguered industry, the outlook is relatively favorable given
the decent pace of employment we’ve had recently.”  The housing starts figures are due from the Commerce
Department at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Estimates in the
Bloomberg survey ranged from 640,000 to 736,000.  Producer Prices  Also at 8:30 a.m., Labor Department data may show prices
paid to factories, farms and other producers climbed 0.4 percent
in January after decreasing 0.1 percent, according to the
Bloomberg survey median. The so-called core producer price
 index , which excludes fuel and food, increased 0.2 percent after
a 0.3 percent gain the prior month.  In a sign factories will remain at the forefront of the
economic expansion, the  Federal Reserve  Bank of Philadelphia may
report at 10 a.m. that its  general economic index  rose to a
four-month high of 9 in February from 7.3 last month, according
to the Bloomberg survey median. Readings greater than zero
indicate expansion.  Residential real estate, in contrast, is still healing.
Housing starts climbed to 606,900 last year from 587,000 in 2010
and reflecting gains in multifamily construction. They totaled
554,000 units in 2009, the lowest since record-keeping began in
1959. During the past decade’s housing boom, starts reached a
peak of 2.07 million in 2005.  Today’s report may also show building permits climbed to a
680,000 annual rate in January from 671,000 the prior month,
according to the Bloomberg survey median.  Warmer Weather  The fourth-warmest January on record probably gave
homebuilding a boost, economists said. The  National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration  reported the average temperature was
36.3 degrees Fahrenheit (2.39 Celsius), 5.5 degrees above the
1901-2000 long-term average.  Beazer Homes said orders jumped 36 percent in the final
three months of 2011 from the same quarter a year earlier, and
closings on new houses surged more than 60 percent. The Atlanta-
based builder said it expects to sell more properties this year
than last.  “While our visibility into the economic conditions for the
remainder of the year is limited, I believe that we will benefit
from a gradually improving housing market,” Allan Merrill,
chief executive officer, said on an earnings call on Feb. 2.  D.R. Horton , the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume,
reported net home orders rose to 3,794 in final three months of
2011, from 3,363 a year earlier.  ‘More Positive’  “Simply put, our business feels more positive,”  Donald Tomnitz , chief executive officer of the Fort Worth, Texas-based
company, said in a Jan. 27 conference call.  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index
of builder confidence climbed in February to the highest level
since May 2007, figures showed yesterday.  Investors also are upbeat about prospects for homebuilders
while concerns about the European debt crisis weigh on the
economy. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index (S15HOME) 
advanced 22 percent since the end of last year, outpacing a 6.8
percent gain in the broader  S&P 500 .  Builders still have to contend with a stream of distressed
houses returning to the market. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the central bank’s efforts to spur economic growth are
being blunted by impediments to mortgage lending, and called for
more steps to heal the housing industry.  “We have helped lower  mortgage rates  to the lowest point
in many, many decades,” Bernanke told homebuilders on Feb. 10
in  Orlando ,  Florida . “Yet we are not seeing as much activity as
we would like to see.”  Also today at 8:30 a.m., Labor Department figures may show
 initial claims  for jobless benefits rose for the first time in
three weeks, to 365,000 in the period ended Feb. 11, according
to the Bloomberg survey median.
