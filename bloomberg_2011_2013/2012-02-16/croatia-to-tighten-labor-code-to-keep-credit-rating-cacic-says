Croatia will tighten its labor code
to keep its  credit rating  from being cut to junk status, Deputy
Premier Radimir Cacic said, a day after  Fitch Ratings  urged the
government to continue with public-sector reforms.  The  government  is negotiating with unions to amend
“unacceptable segments” of the labor law, including collective
contracts that assure generous benefits to state employees,
Cacic told reporters in Zagreb today.  “We must respect our economic situation and collective
contracts should adapt to it,” Cacic said before the  government 
session. “This country cannot go on like this. We have to
change the labor law and I think we have a consensus with unions
on that.”  The seven-week-old Cabinet of Premier Zoran Milanovic vowed
to slash spending by approving lower subsidies to state
companies and a public wage bill that would end bonuses and
overtime as the former Yugoslav republic plans to become the
EU’s 28th member in July 2013.  Fitch said yesterday the Cabinet’s proposals still show a
“mixed picture” and urged the government to continue to work
on its “rigid labor market.” Fitch rates  Croatia  BBB-, its
lowest investment grade, and expects to conclude a review by the
end of the first quarter.  Milanovic told the Cabinet today that Fitch’s message was a
“mixed bag,” Croatia is “still on the defensive” and the
country needs to “shift gears to offensive to defend its credit
rating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
