Lack of trust in  Greece  to carry out
budget cuts and Greek leaders’ need to maintain public support
for the austerity program are colliding with efforts to stave
off a collapse, delaying a decision on a rescue,  Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK)  analysts say.  Greek leaders have no more “wiggle room” even as they
seek to maintain a “minimum” of public support going into
elections that may take place in April, Deutsche Bank economists
Gilles Moec, Marco Stringa and Mark Wall wrote in a note to
clients today.  Talks with creditors over so-called private-sector
involvement, or PSI, should be completed “very quickly” to
make the Greek crisis “more manageable,” the economists said.  “The confusion and delays in the conclusion of the second
loan package/PSI probably stem from the need to reconcile three
different types of concerns in one very unstable triangle,” the
analysts wrote in the note. They pointed to a lack of trust in
Greece, the need for internal support and the desire to avoid
contagion.  A rapid resolution in talks with private creditors could
enable European leaders to delay part of the second bailout
package in order to maintain pressure on Greek authorities, the
analysts said. Still, retaining part of the funding could spark
a “backlash” in the election, which could take place April 8,
and result in an “anti-adjustment majority” in  Athens , they
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
