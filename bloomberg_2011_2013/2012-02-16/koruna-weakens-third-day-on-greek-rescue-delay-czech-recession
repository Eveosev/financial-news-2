The koruna weakened for a third day
against the euro as an impasse in Greek bailout talks drove
investors from riskier assets worldwide and after a report
yesterday showed the Czech economy entered recession.  The Czech currency slid as much as 0.6 percent and traded
0.4 percent weaker at 25.305 per euro by 10:23 a.m. in Prague.
It was poised for its longest streak of losses in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
