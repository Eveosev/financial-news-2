Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, hired  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s
J. Nicholas McKee to help the firm lend money in the  energy
industry , said two people with knowledge of the matter.  McKee will work in Bank of America’s energy and power
corporate-banking group, said the people, who spoke on condition
of anonymity because the appointment hasn’t been announced.
McKee served as co-head of Citigroup’s corporate and investment
banking group for power companies.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan named Christian Meissner last month as Bank of America’s sole head of corporate
and investment banking, putting him in charge of units that
cater to  large companies . Corporate banking, which includes
lending and treasury services, brought $5.5 billion of net
revenue in 2011, unchanged from a year earlier. Average loans
and leases at the unit rose 29 percent in the fourth quarter.  McKee has been at New York-based Citigroup or a predecessor
since at least 1993, according to records on the website of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He was promoted to co-
head of the power group last year.  Louise Hennessy, a spokeswoman for  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Citigroup’s Mark Costiglio
said they couldn’t comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
