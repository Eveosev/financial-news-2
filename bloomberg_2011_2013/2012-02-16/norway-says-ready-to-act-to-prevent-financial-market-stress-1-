Norway’s  Finance Ministry  said the
government and the central bank remain vigilant in monitoring
financial markets for stresses after  Standard & Poor’s 
downgraded Eksportfinans ASA to junk yesterday.  “Eksportfinans and the large owners have previously stated
that the company has good liquidity and solvency and that they
expect to fulfill all its obligations,” Finance Ministry
spokesman Tor Audun Gram said in an e-mailed reply to questions
today.  The country’s authorities are ready “to take action” to
prevent any “serious consequences for the Norwegian financial
markets and the real economy” should such a situation arise,
according to the e-mail. The comments relate to stresses in
general and don’t specifically address the fallout of
Eksportfinans’s downgrade, Gram said.  The krone sank 0.6 percent against the dollar to trade at
5.8150 as of 1:58 p.m. in Oslo. Versus the euro, the krone was
little changed at 7.5523.  Eksportfinans is 15 percent owned by the Norwegian
government. DNB ASA, the country’s biggest bank, holds 40
percent, while 23.21 percent is held by  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , the
largest Nordic lender.  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen owns 8.09
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
