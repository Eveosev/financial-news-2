The court trying former Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak  will on Feb. 22 set the date that it
will issue its verdict, Egypt’s state-run Middle East  News
Agency  reported.  The court will receive final statements from the
prosecution on Feb. 20 and from the defense on Feb. 22, the
Cairo-based news agency said today.  Prosecutors have demanded the death sentence for Mubarak,
who is facing charges including complicity in the killing of
some of the protesters who ousted him from power. Mubarak has
denied all charges against him.  At least 846 people were killed during the revolt that led
to Mubarak’s ouster last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
