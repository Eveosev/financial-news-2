The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined for a second day, according to a
money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 71.9
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:25 a.m.
in London from minus 72.3 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The measure was minus 68 on Feb. 13, the lowest cost in
six months.  The one-year basis swap was 67 basis points less than
Euribor, from minus 62 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between Euribor and
overnight indexed swaps, was little changed at 70 basis points
at 8:10 a.m. in London, the lowest level in four months, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lenders reduced  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday,
placing 392 billion euros ($510 billion) with the Frankfurt-
based central bank from 524 billion euros on Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
