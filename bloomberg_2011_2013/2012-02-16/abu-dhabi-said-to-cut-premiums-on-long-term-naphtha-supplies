Abu Dhabi  National Oil Co. lowered
its offering price for a year’s supply of naphtha beginning in
April, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s
discussions with Asian buyers.  Abu Dhabi offered Pentane-Plus grade naphtha at a premium
of $25.50 a metric ton above Middle East prices, down from $27 a
ton last week, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the terms are private. Low-sulfur naphtha was offered at
a premium of $23.50 a ton, down from $26 a ton. Splitter-grade
naphtha was offered at $23.50, down from $25 a ton.  Officials at the marketing research department in Abu Dhabi
didn’t immediately return an e-mail or telephone call to the
company headquarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
