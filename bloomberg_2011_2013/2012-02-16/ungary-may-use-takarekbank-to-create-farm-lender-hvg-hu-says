Hungary plans to create an
agricultural lender and may acquire a minority stake in
Takarekbank Zrt. from  Germany ’s  DZ Bank AG (DZBK)  for the purpose, news
website  hvg.hu  reported.  The Cabinet, which has considered creating a new bank to
finance farmers and smaller businesses, is more likely to use
Takarekbank’s existing network and is in talks with  DZ Bank  on
buying its stake, hvg.hu said, citing unidentified government
officials.  Takarekbank is majority owned by savings cooperatives, the
website reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
