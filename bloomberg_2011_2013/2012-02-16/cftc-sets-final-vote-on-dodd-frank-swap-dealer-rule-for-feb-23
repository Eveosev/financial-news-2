The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission scheduled a Feb. 23 vote on final Dodd-Frank Act
regulations defining which banks,  hedge funds  and energy
companies will be designated swap-dealers.  The regulation, first proposed in 2010, would lead
companies to face higher capital and margin requirements for
some types of derivatives transactions. Energy companies have
lobbied the CFTC that they shouldn’t be designated as dealers
because they use derivatives to hedge risks rather than to
facilitate trading.  The CFTC is planning on amending the proposed rule’s
threshold for permissible dealing activity before a company is
defined as a dealer. The rule would increase the threshold to $2
billion from $100 million, according to a person briefed on the
matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the rule
isn’t public.  The regulation could still change before the final vote.
Shell Energy North America LP and Vitol Inc. are among energy
companies that have lobbied the CFTC to amend the dealer
regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
