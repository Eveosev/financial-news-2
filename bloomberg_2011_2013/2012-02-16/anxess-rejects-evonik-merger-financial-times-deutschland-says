Lanxess AG (LXS)  rejects a merger with
Evonik Industries AG as it seeks to grow alone,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Axel Heitmann.  While the German chemicals company doesn’t see a major
acquisition at the moment, it’s looking for potential targets in
the market and could handle a deal involving a business with
sales of as much as 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), the
newspaper cited Heitmann as saying.  Norbert Roemer, a politician with the  Social Democrats  in
the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, in November suggested a
merger between Lanxess and Evonik, the FTD said.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
