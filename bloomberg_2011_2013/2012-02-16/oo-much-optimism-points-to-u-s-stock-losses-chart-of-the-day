Investors are showing enough
optimism about U.S. stocks that “the risk of a short-term
pullback” is rising, according to Myles Zyblock, chief
institutional strategist at  RBC Capital Markets .  The CHART OF THE DAY displays two indicators that Zyblock
used to support his conclusion in a report yesterday. They come
from weekly surveys by the  American Association  of Individual
Investors and the National Association of Active Investment
Managers. Both appear in the top panel, and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index is in the bottom panel for reference.  “Shifts in sentiment are critical” in judging potential
stock returns, wrote Zyblock, based in Toronto. He estimated
that the swings account for two-thirds of gains or losses for
six-month periods, and added that the current survey readings
suggest prices are due to fall.  Bulls accounted for 51.6 percent of respondents in last
week’s AAII survey. The figure was the highest in 13 months.
Just 20.2 percent were bearish.  The manager  index  rose last week to 72.66, a nine-month
high. Survey responses can range between 200, signaling that a
participant is borrowing to profit from stock gains, and minus
200, showing the use of leverage to bet against shares.  Any sentiment-related decline in stocks will only interrupt
a rally that began in last year’s second half, Zyblock wrote. He
cited surveys by the Conference Board, the  Institute for Supply
Management  and the National Federation of  Independent Business 
that point to a pessimistic, though improving, outlook for the
 U.S. economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
