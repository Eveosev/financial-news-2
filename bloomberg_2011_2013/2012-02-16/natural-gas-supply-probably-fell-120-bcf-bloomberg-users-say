The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies fell 4.2 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories declined 120 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Feb. 10 to 2.768 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for March delivery rose 3.8 cents, or 1.6
