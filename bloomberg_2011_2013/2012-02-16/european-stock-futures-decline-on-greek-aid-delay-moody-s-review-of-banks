European (SXXP)  stocks were little changed,
paring earlier losses, as better-than-estimated U.S. economic
data outweighed a delay in the bailout of Greece.  Banco Santander SA led Spanish lenders lower after the
nation’s regulator removed a ban on short sales of financial
shares.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  tumbled 3.6 percent after earnings missed
estimates. Renault SA rose 4.5 percent after posting 2011 free
cash flow that exceeded the company’s target.  The Euro Stoxx 50 Index dropped 0.2 percent to 2,489.35 at
the close of trading. Stocks pared earlier losses of as much as
1.6 percent after U.S. housing, manufacturing and jobless claims
data beat estimates. The gauge has still rallied 7.5 percent
this year amid optimism that the euro area will contain its debt
crisis and as the  U.S. economy  continued its recovery.  “Greek concerns appear to be weighing down on markets,”
said  Peter Dixon , global equities economist at Commerzbank AG.
“It’s beginning to look as though the end game may be a lot
more messy than anticipated. A Greek exit is certainly no longer
off the table,” he said, referring to the possibility of the
nation leaving the currency union.  Europe’s creditor countries struggled to reach an agreement
over a rescue of  Greece , seeking more control over how future
aid is spent as the country faces the threat of default over a
bond payment due on March 20. Policy makers will discuss a
second bailout on Feb. 20.  U.S. Economy  Claims for  jobless benefits  in the U.S. fell unexpectedly
last week to the lowest level in four years, Labor Department
figures showed today. First-time applications decreased in the
week ended Feb. 11 to 348,000, less than the median estimate of
365,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.  Housing starts rose 1.5 percent to a 699,000 annual rate,
another report showed. That beat the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 675,000. A third report showed that
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in February at
the fastest pace in four months as new orders and sales picked
up.  Moody’s said it is reviewing the credit ratings of 17 banks
and securities firms with capital-markets operations, which may
result in downgrades. The announcement comes days after the
company cut the ratings of six  European (SXXP)  nations including  Spain 
and lowered its outlook on  France .  National benchmark indexes declined in 9 of the 18 western
European markets today. France’s CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent,
while  Germany ’s DAX lost 0.1 percent each. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
slipped 0.1 percent. Spain’s IBEX 35 Index fell 2.1 percent.  Debt Auctions  Spain and France today sold 14.2 billion euros ($18.5
billion) in their first auctions since the euro-area downgrades
by Moody’s, getting more demand than the amount they offered.
The yield on France’s benchmark two-year notes fell, while
Spanish borrowing costs rose.  Spain’s stock-market regulator lifted a six-month ban on
short-selling of financial stocks. France and  Belgium  also eased
restrictions this week.  Banco Santander SA lost 2.6 percent to 6.29 euros, while
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA slid 4.1 percent to 6.80
euros. Bankia SA tumbled 7.3 percent to 3.09 euros.  ABB fell 3.6 percent to 19.20 Swiss francs. The world’s
largest maker of power-distribution equipment reported less-
than-expected profit in the fourth quarter and said price
pressure may weigh in on profitability in the first quarter.  Rio Tinto, Axa  Rio Tinto  Group slid 1.3 percent to 3,633.5 pence as copper
fell a fifth straight session, heading for its longest slump
since November.  Axa,  Europe ’s second-largest insurer, declined 1.3 percent
to 12.06 euros. The company posted an 82 percent drop in second-
half profit, after it didn’t repeat a gain from an asset
disposal in the first half and witnessed lower sales of life-
insurance products.  BAE Systems Plc dropped 2.3 percent to 325.2 pence after
forecasting that sales growth will stagnate this year. Europe’s
largest defense company said the U.K. market will fail to grow
in 2012 and that U.S. defense budget cuts will create
“uncertainty” in coming years.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, climbed 2.1
percent to 55.60 francs after posting 2011 sales growth that
beat analyst estimates and forecast higher 2012 earnings as it
introduces new products.  Cap Gemini SA, France’s biggest computer-services company,
rose 7.9 percent to 31.66 euros after it forecast higher
operating profit margin this year.  Renault, France’s second-largest carmaker, advanced 4.5
percent to 37.83 euros as it reported 2011 free  cash flow  of
1.08 billion euros, exceeding its previously set target.  Natixis SA said Renault’s cash flow is a “very good
surprise” and there is a “night-and-day” difference between
the performances of Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen. Renault’s
earnings and cash flow outperformed those of Peugeot.  Peugeot declined 1.7 percent to 13.82 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
