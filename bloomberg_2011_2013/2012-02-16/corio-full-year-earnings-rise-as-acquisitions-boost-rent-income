Corio NV (CORA) , the largest Dutch real-
estate company, said full-year earnings excluding items rose by
6.4 percent as acquisitions boosted revenue.  Earnings excluding changes in asset values and deferred
tax, known as direct result, increased to 267 million euros
($349 million), or 2.91 euros a share, the Utrecht-based company
said in a statement today. A year earlier, earnings totaled 251
million euros, or 2.88 euros.  The profit exceeded 2.87 euros a share, the  average of 20
analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Corio said in November
that its direct result per share would be little changed in 2011
following a 600 million-euro share sale and dividend payments in
stock. Net asset value rose 2.5 percent from Sept. 30 to 47.15
euros a share.  The results were released after the close of trading. Corio
fell 17.5 cents to 36.525 euros in Amsterdam today. The shares
advanced 12 percent in the past three months, exceeding the 10
percent gain for the  FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index (EPRA)  of
real estate shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
