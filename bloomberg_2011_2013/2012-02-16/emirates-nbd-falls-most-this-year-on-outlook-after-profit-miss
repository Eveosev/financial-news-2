Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  tumbled the most
this year after the United Arab Emirates biggest bank by assets
reported fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts estimates
and said the outlook for the business was challenging.  The shares declined 4.7 percent, the biggest drop since
Dec. 27, to 2.86 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The
benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  retreated 0.5 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Rick Pudner said after the market
closed yesterday that the outlook for the bank remains
challenging. The bank reported a 62 percent decline in fourth-
quarter profit to 152 million dirhams ($41 million) after it
boosted bad loan provisions. The median estimate of four
analysts was for a profit of 172 million dirhams, according to
 data compiled by Bloomberg.   To contact the reporter on this story:
