Greek police have published the
names and photos of five men allegedly involved in rioting in
Athens on Feb. 12, the first time they have identified people
involved in violence at public protests.  The men, aged 18 to 39, include one born in  Germany  and
another from the  Palestinian Territories . They are being
questioned on charges including attempted bodily harm against
police officers and disturbing the peace, according to a
 statement  on the policeâ€™s website.  A police spokesman, who declined to be identified, said it
was the first time they had identified rioters.  Rioters set fire to as many as 45 buildings during street
protests in Athens against government austerity measures,
according to Greek police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
