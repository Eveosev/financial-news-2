NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of
NYSE Euronext, wants to introduce delivery limits for its London
commodity futures and options.  Buyers wouldn’t be able to take delivery of more than 7,500
contracts on cocoa and robusta coffee, 5,000 contracts on white
sugar and 2,000 contracts on feed wheat, the exchange said in an
“info flash” yesterday. The limit also applies to sellers.
Comments on the proposals are requested by March 9 for changes
to take effect for positions in November 2012 coffee, December
2012 sugar and cocoa and January 2013 for feed wheat, it said.  “The proposals are part of the continuing development of
the exchange’s existing monitoring and position management
arrangements which are designed to maintain market confidence,”
the exchange said. “In the course of discussions with market
participants it has been confirmed that many would welcome a
more formalized and prescribed position management regime which
would help them to understand more clearly the exchange’s
approach to regulation and its expectations of members and other
users.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
