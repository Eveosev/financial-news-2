Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, finished collecting oil from a
Feb. 13 spill at the Barracuda field in the Campos Basin.  Five cubic meters (31.5 barrels) of oil spilled because of
a pipe failure and Brazil’s oil regulator, known as the ANP,
will investigate the causes of the accident at the P-43
platform, the agency said today in a e-mailed statement.  Brazil has had a series of spills in recent months at a
time oil producers are increasing exploration and production in
deep waters off the country’s coast. Last year’s output by
Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known, grew
at the slowest pace since 2007 partly because of more stringent
rules by the oil regulator after BP Plc’s Macondo oil spill in
the  Gulf of Mexico .  A leak at  Chevron (CVX)  Corp.’s Frade project in the Campos Basin
off the coast of  Rio de Janeiro  on Nov. 7 spilled as much as
3,000 barrels into the Atlantic Ocean, according to the ANP.
Petrobras shut its fifth most productive well last month after
detecting a leak of 160 barrels in deep waters of the Atlantic
Ocean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
