Norwegian Air Shuttle AS (NAS) ,  Europe ’s
fourth-biggest discount carrier, said its plans for expansion
into long-haul operations envisage routes to cities including
 New York City ,  Hong Kong , Bangkok and Beijing.  Norwegian, which currently flies no further than Dubai with
a fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  737s, is also mulling routes to  Florida ,
the U.S. West Coast and  Tokyo  after ordering wide-body 787s from
the same manufacturer, Chief Financial Officer Frode Foss said.  “We’re considering all major cities,” Foss said today in a
telephone interview from Oslo, confirming that six 787s will
join its fleet starting next year, three of them leased and
three purchased outright. “We’re doing research, looking into
many destinations and how to optimize our aircraft.”  Norwegian is working on long-haul plans after last month
bolstering its short-haul fleet with an order for 222 Boeing and
 Airbus SAS (EAD)  single-aisle valued at 127 billion kroner ($21.8
billion). The Fornebu-based company, founded in 1993, switched
to a discount model in 2001, emulating  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  and
 EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , and is stepping up competition with state-backed
 SAS Group AB (SAS) , the Nordic region’s largest airline.  The carrier’s fourth-quarter loss widened to 133 million
kroner from 23.6 million kroner a year earlier, it said today,
worse than the 91 million kroner deficit expected by  analysts .
The stock fell as much as 9 percent, the most since Oct. 4, and
was down 4.7 percent at 76.5 kroner as of 11:29 a.m. in Oslo.  Fuel expenses jumped 56 percent to 793 million kroner in
the quarter, in part because Norwegian offered more flights.
Revenue advanced 18 percent to 2.54 billion kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
