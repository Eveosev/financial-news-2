What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 9 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that rains next week
will ease dry conditions for crops in  Brazil , Chad Henderson, a
market analyst with Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. Soybean-
oil futures may open 0.5 cent to 0.6 cent a pound lower, and
soybean-meal futures may open down $2 to $3 per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that demand will slow from U.S.
ethanol producers as stockpiles of the gasoline additive climb,
Henderson said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to down 2 cents a bushel on the
CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  after a government report showed U.S. export sales have
slowed, Henderson said.
