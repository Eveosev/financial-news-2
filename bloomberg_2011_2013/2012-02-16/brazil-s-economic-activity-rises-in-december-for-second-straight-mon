Brazil ’s economy grew at its second-
slowest pace since 2003 last year, after the central bank raised
interest rates in the first half of the year and European debt
turmoil spread.  Brazil’s economic activity  index , a proxy for gross
domestic product, rose 2.7 percent last year, the central bank
said in a report published on its website today. Should GDP show
a similar reading, it would be the slowest growth in eight
years, apart from 2009 when the economy contracted in the wake
of the global financial crisis sparked by the 2008 bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Growth will pick up speed in the second half of the year
and reach an annualized pace of more than 5 percent, due to
government stimulus measures, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
said today. Policy makers began a cycle of interest rate cuts in
August to shore up demand in Brazil as the world economy
deteriorated.  Traders are betting the central bank will cut borrowing
costs by half a percentage point for a fifth straight meeting in
March, to 10.00 percent, and to as low as 9 percent by August,
according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.  ‘Full Impact’  “We are going to see the effects of the monetary stimulus
that has been granted since August having its full impact in the
second half of the year,” said  Jankiel Santos , chief economist
at Espirito Santo Investment Bank, speaking by phone from  Sao
Paulo . “It’s pretty much sure that we’re going to see a more
robust pace in the second half than in the first.”  Santos expects Brazil’s economy to grow 3.5 percent in
2012.  Seasonally adjusted  economic activity rose 0.57 percent in
December from a revised 1.29 percent gain in November. The
median forecast of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.60 percent increase. The December gain marked the first time
the index has risen for two consecutive months since last March.
The seasonally-adjusted index rose 2.8 percent last year.  During a trip to  Mumbai  this month, central bank President
Alexandre Tombini said that inflation is on a downward trend in
Brazil, giving policy makers room to continue cutting  interest
rates . Mantega said yesterday that Brazil’s plan to trim 55
billion reais ($31.9 billion) from this year’s budget will also
create space for the central bank to cut rates.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.23 percent at 2:53
p.m. The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.7256 per dollar.  Retail sales  rose 0.3 percent in December, more than the
0.1 percent forecast by analysts, while unemployment fell to a
record low of 4.7 percent.  Economists covering Brazil expect the economy to grow 3.3
percent in 2012. Growth slowed to about 3 percent last year from
about 7.5 percent in 2010, Tombini said Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
