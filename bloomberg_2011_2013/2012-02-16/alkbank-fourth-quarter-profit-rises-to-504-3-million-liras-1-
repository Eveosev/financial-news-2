Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , a Turkish
state-run bank, said fourth-quarter profit rose 0.9 percent to
504.3 million liras. The share fell after earnings missed
analystsâ€™ estimates.  Net income rose from 499.6 million liras in the same period
of 2010, according to a filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange 
today. The Ankara-based bank was expected to report 512.4
million liras, the average estimate of 16 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey showed.  The fourth-quarter profit was calculated by subtracting
full-year earnings reported to the Istanbul Stock Exchange today
from nine-month net income announced earlier.  Halkbank fell 1.6 percent to 12.10 liras at 10:12 a.m. on
the main ISE National 100 index.  Net interest income gained 8.8 percent in the whole of 2011
to 3.47 billion liras, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
