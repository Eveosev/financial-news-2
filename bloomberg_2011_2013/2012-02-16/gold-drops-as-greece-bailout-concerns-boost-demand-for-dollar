Gold futures rebounded and silver
pared losses as the dollar declined against the euro, increasing
demand for the precious metals as alternative investments.  The greenback fell after Die Welt, a German newspaper, said
the  European Central Bank  is exchanging Greek bonds for new
securities, boosting speculation that  Greece  will win a second
bailout. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose as
much as 0.5 percent after sliding 0.7 percent. Gold advanced for
the second straight day.  “We are seeing people move back to equities and gold on
the Greek headlines,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery rose 30 cents to close at
$1,728.40 an ounce at 2:02 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price fell as much as 1.2 percent. In electronic
trading after the settlement, the commodity gained as much as
0.2 percent to $1,731.60.  Yesterday, gold rose 0.6 percent. The metal has gained 10
percent this year.  “From a technical perspective, gold has been well
supported on any dips toward $1,700,” Saeed Amen, an analyst at
Nomura International Plc in  London , said in an e-mail. “The
tail-risk effect related to the Greece situation should also act
as some support.”  Silver futures for March delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$33.37 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price dropped as much
as 2.3 percent. The metal climbed 20 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $696.60 an ounce, ending a
five-session slide. Platinum futures for April delivery fell 0.7
percent to $1,626.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
