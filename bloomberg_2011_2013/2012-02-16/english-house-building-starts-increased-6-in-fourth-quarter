The number of houses being built in
 England  rose in the fourth quarter as starts for privately
constructed property increased.  Housing starts rose 6 percent from the third quarter to
25,240 on a seasonally adjusted basis, the U.K.â€™s Department for
Communities and Local Government said in a report on its website
today. Private starts, excluding those by housing associations
and local governments, increased 6 percent to 20,370.  The reading was up 9 percent from a year earlier on an
unadjusted basis. The supply of new housing is about 60 percent
of levels before the economic downturn, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
