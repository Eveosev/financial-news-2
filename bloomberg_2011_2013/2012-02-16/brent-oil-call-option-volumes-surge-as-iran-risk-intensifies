Trading volumes in Brent crude-oil
call options surged as tensions worsened between  Iran  and
Western governments.  Daily volumes in options granting the right to buy Brent
for more than the current market price have risen above 25,000
on four days during the past two weeks, signaling an increase in
bets on a possible price rally.  Total volume was 39,164 lots as of 4:20 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Call volume was 31,742
contracts, which would break the record of 29,383 set on Feb. 9
according to the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Brent crude futures settled at an eight-month high of
$120.11 a barrel in  London  today, having gained 12 percent this
year on concern that the dispute with Iran over its nuclear
program may lead to a disruption in oil exports from the Persian
Gulf region.  Call options outnumbered puts, which are used to protect
against slumps in the oil price, by more than four to one as of
3:50 p.m. today in  New York .  The daily volume of Brent calls yesterday totaled 28,010,
or about six times the level for puts.  Iran said yesterday it was cutting shipments to  France  and
the Netherlands, and that it had loaded locally built fuel
plates into its nuclear research reactor in Tehran, according to
reports by the state-run Mehr news agency and Press TV,
respectively. The state-run Fars news agency reported separately
that Iran warned France and the Netherlands and four other
European Union nations without cutting exports to any of them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
