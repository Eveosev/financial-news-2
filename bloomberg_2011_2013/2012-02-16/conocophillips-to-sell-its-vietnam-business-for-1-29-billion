ConocoPhillips (COP) , the third-largest
U.S. oil company, agreed to sell its Vietnam operations for
$1.29 billion to Perenco SA, exiting the country after more than
15 years.  The Vietnam business unit sale is part of ConocoPhillips’
efforts to unload less profitable businesses and boost returns,
the Houston-based company said in a statement today. The
transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012.  ConocoPhillips is in the midst of a three-year plan to sell
$15 billion to $20 billion of assets by the end of 2012 to fund
share repurchases and position itself for future growth. The
company completed $10.7 billion in asset sales during 2010 and
2011. ConocoPhillips’ stake in  Vietnam  may not have been
meaningful enough for the company, said Pavel Molchanov, a
Houston-based analyst with Raymond James & Associates Inc.  “It’s a country where there is growth potential, but it’s
fairly difficult for Western majors to perhaps navigate it,”
said Molchanov, who has a “market perform” rating on
ConocoPhillips shares and doesn’t own any. Molchanov, speaking
in a telephone interview, called the sales price “reasonable.”  ConocoPhillips had the equivalent of about 20,000 barrels a
day of oil production from Vietnam in 2011 out of worldwide
daily output of 1.62 million barrels, according to  data  on its
website. The transaction includes a stake in two areas off the
coast of Vietnam and a 16.3 percent interest in a pipeline,
ConocoPhillips said.  Refining Spinoff  Closely held Perenco, based in Paris, produces oil and
natural gas from basins in  Brazil , Peru,  Iraq ,  Australia  and
 North Sea , according to its website.  ConocoPhillips plans to spin off its refining business in
the second quarter so it can focus on finding and producing oil
and natural gas. The new company will be known as Phillips 66.  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. said it acted as financial
adviser to ConocoPhillips on the Vietnam transaction.  ConocoPhillips  fell  1 cent to $72.78 at the close in  New
York .  Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are the largest U.S.
oil companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
