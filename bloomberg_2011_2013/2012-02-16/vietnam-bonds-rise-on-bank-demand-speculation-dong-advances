Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained for
a fourth day on speculation banks have more cash to invest in
the debt. The dong strengthened.  “Liquidity at some big commercial banks has improved as
they have been selling dollars to the central bank to get dong,
leaving them with more cash to buy bonds,” said Cao Tan Phat, a
Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at ACB Securities Inc.  The  yields  on five-year notes fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 12.24 percent as of 5:27 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.4 percent to 20,830 per dollar, according
