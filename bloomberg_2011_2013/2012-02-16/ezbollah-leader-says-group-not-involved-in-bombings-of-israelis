Hezbollah leader  Hassan Nasrallah 
said his group was not involved in bomb attacks on Israeli
diplomats in Thailand,  India  and Georgia this month.  “We’re not involved, I can confirm that,” Nasrallah said
in a speech broadcast via a video link to a rally in the
southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. The event
marked the anniversary of the killings of Hezbollah leaders
Abbas Musawi in 1992 and Ragheb Harb in 1984 and Imad Mughniyeh,
a military commander of the group, in 2008. Hezbollah blames
Israel for the killing of Mughniyeh. Nasrallah reiterated vows
to avenge his death “honorably.”  Israel has accused Iran, a main backer of Hezbollah, of
being behind all the attacks on its diplomats.  Iran  has denied
any connection to the bombing of an embassy vehicle in  New Delhi 
that injured an Israeli diplomat’s wife and a bomb planted under
an Israeli diplomatic car in Georgia that was discovered before
it could be detonated this week.  Iranians arrested after blasts on a Bangkok street aimed to
attack Israeli diplomats and the devices used were similar to
the bombs targeting Israelis in India and Georgia, Thailand’s
police chief, Priewphan Damaphong, said yesterday.  Hezbollah won popularity in Lebanon by helping to force
Israel’s military to withdraw from the country in 2000, ending a
22-year occupation. Israel fought a monthlong war against
Hezbollah in 2006.  The U.S. and Israel classify Hezbollah as a terrorist
organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
