(Corrects comments made by ALEB chief to clarify the
licensing conditions in second paragraph.)  Lynas Corp., an Australian miner,
isn’t yet allowed to start importing  rare earth  into Malaysia,
the head of the country’s licensing board said.  Lynas needs to submit a letter detailing how it intends to
fulfill five outstanding conditions before it can get a
temporary operating license, Raja Abdul Aziz Raja Adnan,
director-general of the Atomic Energy Licensing Board, said in
Selangor, near  Kuala Lumpur . The temporary permit was approved
on Jan. 30, though it hasn’t yet been issued.  To contact the reporter on this story:
