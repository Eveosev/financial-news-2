Euro-area stocks will extend their
rally since last September’s low if they climb above their next
resistance level this week, with the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index  leaving
its current trading range, according to  Danske Bank A/S. (DANSKE)   The benchmark measure will surge to 2,800 by the end of
March, a 12 percent rally from yesterday’s close, if the gauge
advances beyond its current resistance level of 2,600 this week,
a technical analyst at the Danish lender said. The Euro Stoxx 50
has traded within a band, known as a flag, from the beginning of
this month as the index consolidates its gains before resuming
its rally from last year’s low, Danske Bank said.  “The gauge may break free of 2,600 this week,” said Lars Skovgaard Andersen, a senior equity analyst who helps manage
about $107 billion at Danske Bank’s asset manager Danske Capital
in Copenhagen. “That will clear the way to move to the 2,800-
level. That’ll follow just as you say B after saying A.”  The benchmark measure has traded between 2,476.92 and 2,600
since Feb. 2. The upper limit of this band was formed on Aug. 1
when the Euro Stoxx 50 dropped below 2,600 and the lower limit
was set on Oct. 27 when the gauge rallied to 2,476.92, Andersen
said. The two values form lines that mark the top and bottom of
a rectangle known as a flag in  technical analysis .  The Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.2 percent to 2,493.96 at the
close in Paris yesterday as a report showed that the  economy of
the 17 nations  that use the single currency shrank 0.3 percent
in the fourth quarter, a narrower contraction than the 0.4
percent  median estimate  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
