United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, declined in Moscow trading as prices
for the light metal dropped to the lowest in a month.  Rusal’s Russian depositary receipts lost as much as 2.8
percent in Moscow trading, which would be the biggest fall since
Dec. 16, before trading down 2.6 percent at 257.68 rubles at
10:29 a.m.  Aluminum prices dropped 0.6 percent yesterday in  London  to
$2,187 per a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
