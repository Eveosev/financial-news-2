The share of U.S. mortgages at least
one month late declined in the fourth quarter to the lowest
level since 2008 as a better job market helped borrowers pay
their bills on time.  The  delinquency rate  for all home loans dropped to 7.58
percent from 7.99 percent in the previous three months,
according to a report today from the  Mortgage Bankers
Association . The rate peaked at 10.1 percent in the first
quarter of 2010. It was 6.99 percent in the third quarter of
2008.  The  unemployment  rate fell for a fifth straight month in
January to a three-year low of 8.3 percent. The improving
economy is also bolstering housing demand.  Sales (ETSLTOTL)  of previously
owned homes rose 5 percent in December from the previous month
to the highest level since January 2011, according to the
National Association of Realtors.  “The improvements are tied to the improvement in the
economy,”  Jay Brinkmann , chief economist of the Washington-
based trade group, said in an interview. “I think that that the
mortgage delinquencies are improving even faster than the
overall economy. At least by some measures, the total
delinquencies are halfway back to normal.”  The pre-recession average delinquency rate is about 5
percent, Brinkmann said.  The pace of new foreclosures also slowed in the fourth
quarter, according to the bankers group. Foreclosure starts fell
to 0.99 percent of all loans from 1.08 percent a year earlier.  Loans in foreclosure declined 26 basis points from the
fourth quarter of 2010, to 4.38 percent of all mortgages. Those
more than 90 days overdue -- the point at which lenders usually
begin the process of seizing a property -– dropped to 3.11
percent from 3.65 percent a year earlier.  Banks cut back on foreclosures more than a year ago after
state and federal regulators began investigating abusive
mortgage practices. A $25 million settlement with the top
mortgage lenders over the use of faulty paperwork in
foreclosures was announced last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
