The European Union may impose
tariffs on pipe fittings and ceramic tableware from  China , the
latest evidence of the Chinese threat to higher-cost EU
producers.  The EU opened inquiries into whether Chinese manufacturers
of “threaded tube or pipe cast fittings” and of ceramic
tableware and kitchenware sell them in the 27-nation bloc below
cost, a practice known as dumping. The probe into the pipe
fittings also covers imports from Indonesia and  Thailand .  The investigations will determine whether the goods are
“being dumped and whether the dumped imports have caused injury
to the union industry,” the European Commission, the bloc’s
trade authority in Brussels, said today in the  Official Journal .
The commission has nine months to decide whether to impose
provisional anti-dumping duties for half a year and EU
governments have 15 months to decide whether to apply
“definitive” levies for five years.  The pipe fittings inquiry stems from a Jan. 3 dumping
complaint by a European group representing companies that
account for more than half the EU’s output of the product,
according to the commission. The other probe results from a
complaint the same day on behalf of European manufacturers that
represent more than 30 percent of the EU’s output of ceramic
tableware and kitchenware, said the commission. It didn’t
identify any EU producers in either case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
