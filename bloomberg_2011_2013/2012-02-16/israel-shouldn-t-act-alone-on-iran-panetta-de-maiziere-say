U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
and German Defense Minister Thomas De Maiziere urged  Israel  to
coordinate its decisions on  Iran  with allies rather than
pursuing military action on its own.  “We have a common cause here with the international
community and with Israel in regard to Iran,” Panetta said at a
joint media briefing after the two met today at the Pentagon. He
cited increasing sanctions “that have made very clear to Iran”
that it should “engage with the international community” in
the dispute over its nuclear program.  De Maiziere said too much of the public discussion has
focused on the possibility that Israel may strike unilaterally,
rather than on Iran’s defiance of international demands to
curtail its nuclear activities.  “We have to use every opportunity for a peaceful
solution,” he said through an interpreter. “I hope that Israel
will join the efforts of the international community and will
not resort to unilateral action.  Germany  will also stand by
Israel.”  Resuming talks with Iran in the interest of all sides
involved, “assuming that those talks are constructive,”
Panetta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
