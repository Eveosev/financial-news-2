New York state’s largest teachers
union reached agreement with Governor  Andrew Cuomo ’s
administation on an evaluation template for firing the worst
educators, which may save $700 million in federal funding.  Cuomo, state officials and union leaders are speaking at a
briefing in  Albany , the capital.  The deal between the Education Department and the New York
State United Teachers union was reached after Cuomo threatened
to insert his own evaluation plan into the budget, which he had
until today to do. The agreement puts into action a 2010 law and
provides a framework for school districts to negotiate with
local unions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
