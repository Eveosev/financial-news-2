Ukrainian grain exports for February
will fall below January’s 1.92 million metric tons due to
freezing weather, researcher ProAgro said, citing the
 Agriculture Ministry .  About 430,000 tons of grain were exported in the first 10
days of February, ProAgro said. About 2 million tons of grain
were expected to be shipped, news website  Delo  said, citing
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk, agriculture minister, earlier this month.  Bad weather has slowed everything from transporting grain
on land to shipping, with vessels only able to move behind ice-
breakers, ProAgro said yesterday, citing Serhiy Kvasha, head of
the Agriculture Ministry’s agriculture markets department.  Shipments in the first 10 days of the month included
414,000 tons of corn and 11,000 tons of wheat, Kvasha said,
adding the country won’t be able to match January’s numbers.  Exports totaled 11.76 million tons from July 1 through Feb.
10, according to the official. Wheat accounted for 2.96 million
tons, including 1.64 million of milling wheat and 1.32 million
tons of feed wheat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
