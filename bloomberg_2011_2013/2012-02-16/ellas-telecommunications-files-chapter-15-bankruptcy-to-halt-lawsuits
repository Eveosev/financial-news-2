Hellas Telecommunications Luxembourg
II SCA filed for  Chapter 15  bankruptcy to put on hold certain
lawsuits pending against the company in New York State Supreme
Court.  The company, based in London, listed both debt and assets
of more than $100 million in documents filed today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Chapter 15 protects foreign
companies from U.S. lawsuits and creditor claims while a company
reorganizes abroad.  Hellas Telecommunications Luxembourg is asking the U.S.
court to recognize the proceeding pending before the High Court
of Justice of England and Wales as a “foreign main
proceeding,” according to court papers.  “Chapter 15 recognition of the English proceeding would
stay the pending litigation (as against the company) and prevent
the petitioners from needlessly expending time and money
defending actions in which they may be the proper plaintiffs,”
Andrew Lawrence Hosking and Carl Jackson, authorized foreign
representatives of Hellas Telecommunications Luxembourg, said in
court papers.  The case is In re Hellas Telecommunications Luxembourg II
SCA, 12-10631,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
