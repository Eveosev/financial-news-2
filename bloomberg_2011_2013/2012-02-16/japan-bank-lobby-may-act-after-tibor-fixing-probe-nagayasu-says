The Japanese Bankers Association may
take measures to improve the way it compiles the nation’s key
interbank lending rate, Chairman  Katsunori Nagayasu  said.  “If needed, based on guidance from investigators, we would
take necessary measures, but for now we have no plans to do
so,” Nagayasu said today at a press briefing in  Tokyo .  Authorities in Asia,  Europe  and the U.S. are conducting
widening inquiries into whether employees at some of the world’s
biggest banks sought to manipulate the London, Tokyo and euro
interbank offered rates, known as Libor, Tibor and Euribor,
respectively.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and UBS AG were ordered by Japan’s Financial
Services Agency in December to suspend some derivative
transactions after the regulator found that staff at the firms
attempted to influence interbank lending rates. Citigroup,  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  are among 17
reference banks that submit Euro-yen Tokyo interbank offered
rates to the association, which compiles and sets the benchmark
lending rate, according to the lobby’s website.  “We are aware that regulators are globally conducting
probes,” said Nagayasu, who is also chief executive officer of
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest publicly
traded bank. “Their investigations might have stemmed from some
skepticism over how the rates are compiled from the so-called
reference banks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
