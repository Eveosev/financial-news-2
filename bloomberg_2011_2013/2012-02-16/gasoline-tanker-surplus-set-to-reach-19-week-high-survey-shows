A glut of tankers available to haul
gasoline to the U.S. from  Europe  is set to reach a 19-week high
over the next two weeks as chartering of the ships weakens, a
survey showed.  There are 32 vessels that may be able to carry trans-
Atlantic cargoes up to March 1, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey yesterday of five shipbrokers, three
traders and one owner who specialize in shipping the auto fuel.
That’s a gain of three ships from last week’s survey and the
biggest glut since Oct. 6.  Traders and oil companies booked or probably will hire 25
ships, the survey showed, one fewer than in the two weeks to
Feb. 23. Vessels carrying gasoline on the Rotterdam-to-New York
route are  earning  $12,436 a day, according to the London-based
Baltic Exchange. That’s a 44 percent drop this year, its figures
show.  The ships, known as medium-range tankers, would be able to
haul about 7.86 million barrels of gasoline, or 562,000 barrels
a day, over the next two weeks. That’s 72 percent of the 783,000
barrels the U.S.  imported  daily over the last 12 months,
according to the  Department of Energy .  Of the vessels chartered or due to be hired, 14 have been
booked and 11 more will probably be arranged, the survey showed.
It’s based on so-called single-voyage, or spot, charters and
excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. The survey
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe. Each  tanker  would normally haul about 37,000 metric tons
of gasoline, or 315,000 barrels.  Following is a table of ships chartered and probably to be
hired for the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                             Feb. 16     Feb. 9      Change
