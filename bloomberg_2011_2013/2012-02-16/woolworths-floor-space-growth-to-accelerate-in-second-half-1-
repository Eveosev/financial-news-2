Woolworths Holdings Ltd. (WHL)  plans a
“big” acceleration in floor-space growth in the second half of
the fiscal year, as the South African food and clothing retailer
opens its first supermarkets.  “Bringing in the offering of glasses, spoons and clothes
along with our food is a no-brainer,” Chief Executive Officer
Ian Moir said in a presentation in Johannesburg today. “It
breaks my heart when I see a shopping trolley outside our store,
while customers are shopping with baskets inside. We plan to
change that.” Woolworths will open its first full-line
supermarket on April 26 in Johannesburg.  Net income rose to 1.03 billion rand ($131 million) in the
six months through Dec. 26, from 775 million rand a year
earlier, Cape-Town based Woolworths said in a stock exchange
filing today. Sales gained 11 percent to 14.2 billion rand.  The retailer reported an 12 percent gain in  food sales  in
the first half as it raised prices an average of 4.8 percent.
Sales of clothing and general merchandise rose 10 percent, as
prices increased 7 percent.  Woolworths has converted 50 franchise stores, with a
further nine to be converted in the second half. The move has
“simplified business in addition to giving more revenue and
profit,” Moir said.  The company’s shares fell 1.9 percent to 41.69 rand as of
1:01 p.m. in Johannesburg, paring the gain this year to 6.9
percent.  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP) ,  South Africa ’s largest
supermarket chain, fell 1.3 percent to 131.71 rand, while
 Truworths International Holdings Ltd. (TRU) , the country’s largest
listed clothing retailer, lost 1.1 percent to 78.65 rand.  Woolworths Holdings isn’t related to London-based
Woolworths Group Plc, which collapsed in 2008, or Woolworths
Ltd., located in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
