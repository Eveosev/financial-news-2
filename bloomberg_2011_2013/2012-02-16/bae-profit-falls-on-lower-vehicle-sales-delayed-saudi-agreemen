BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Europe ’s largest
defense company, fell the most in more than two years in London
trading after predicting sales will hardly grow this year as
governments around the world cut defense budgets.  BAE dropped as much as 20 pence, or 6 percent, to 313
pence, the biggest intra-day decline since Oct. 1, 2009. The
stock of the London-based company was down 3.9 percent as of
8:59 a.m., valuing BAE at 10.36 billion pounds ($16.24 billion).  The U.K. weapons manufacturer said its home market will
fail to grow in 2012, and that U.S. defense budget cuts will
create “uncertainty” in coming years. BAE is cutting 3,000
jobs because of falling production of fighter jets, and is
reviewing its naval operations in the U.K. Chief Executive
Officer Ian King said the company will continue to seek cost
cuts in 2012.  Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, excluding
one-time items, fell to 2.03 billion pounds, in line with the
2.02 billion-pound average analyst estimate by Bloomberg.  BAE’s business of selling and maintaining combat vehicles
has slowed as the U.S. reduces its presence in Iraq and
 Afghanistan . Sales at the unit fell 30 percent to 3.1 billion
pounds last year, which should be the baseline for the business,
said King. Overall, revenue in 2011 dropped 14 percent to
19.15 billion pounds.  The Pentagon proposed a $525 billion budget for fiscal
2013, $45 billion less than projected a year ago. Prime Minister
 David Cameron ’s government announced an 8 percent cut in defense
spending over four years in 2010.  The company is relying on its services business, which
accounted for 49 percent of sales in 2011, while also pursuing
contracts in countries including  Oman  and  Saudi Arabia . BAE
expects to wrap up negotiations with Saudi Arabia over the price
for remaining Typhoon jets in 2012, and an accord may include
additional Hawk orders, according to King.  To contact the reporter on this story:
