Cap Gemini SA (CAP) ,  France ’s biggest
computer-services company, jumped the most in four months after
predicting its operating profit margin will rise this year.  The company, which competes with  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  in helping companies with their computer network
setups, rose as much as 8.4 percent in Paris, the biggest jump
since Oct. 4. The shares were 3.6 percent higher at 30.29 euros
as of 10:45 a.m. The stock was the biggest gainer on France’s
benchmark CAC 40 Index.  “We think we can achieve margin improvement despite very
uneven hypotheses for the second half of 2012,” Chief Executive
Officer Paul Hermelin said on a conference call. He predicted
2012 sales growth “similar or higher than” in the fourth
quarter of last year, when revenue climbed 3.3 percent.  Cap Gemini  forecast higher margins amid “limited” revenue
growth expectations after beating analyst estimates in 2011. The
company, whose software engineers helped upgrade the flight
control system for German civil aviation, didn’t put a precise
figure on its forecast, citing reduced visibility and an
“uncertain” economy.  “The ‘limited’ revenue growth forecast is a starting
point,” said Milan Radia, an analyst at Jefferies. “They have
a good chance of outperforming that.” He has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock with a share-price estimate of 42
euros.  Cap Gemini said sales progress showed no sign of slowing
down in the first weeks of this year.  Analysts estimate a 2012 revenue increase of about 2
percent to 9.9 billion euros, based on 19 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The operating margin is expected at 6.7 percent of
revenue, down from 7.4 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
