Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) ,
the regional pay-as-you-go wireless provider, gained the most in
more than two months after the Wall Street Journal reported that
it has been in talks with AT&T Inc. to sell itself.  Leap, based in San Diego, rose 10 percent to $9.62 at the
close of trading in New York time  for the biggest  percentage
increase since Nov. 30.  The Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter
and didn’t identify them, said AT&T, the second-largest U.S.
wireless company, is talking to Leap as it looks for sources of
licensed spectrum for its mobile-phone network. Acquiring Leap
is “one possibility” for AT&T, according to the newspaper.  AT&T is under pressure to add wireless spectrum after its
failed $39 billion bid for  T-Mobile USA . Facing opposition from
U.S. regulators, the company in December was forced to abandon
the deal, which would have increased its fourth-generation
spectrum 62 percent.  Mark Siegel , a spokesman for AT&T, declined to comment on
the report.  Greg Lund , a Leap spokesman, also declined to
comment.  Leap Wireless will release its fourth-quarter and full-year
2011 earnings today after the close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
