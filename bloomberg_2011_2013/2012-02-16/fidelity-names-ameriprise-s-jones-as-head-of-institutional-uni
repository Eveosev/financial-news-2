Fidelity Investments named  Mike
Jones  as president and chief executive officer of Pyramis Global
Advisors, the company’s institutional asset management unit,
replacing Kevin Uebelein.  Jones will join Fidelity from Minneapolis-based insurer and
money manager  Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) , where he was head of
U.S. asset management for its Columbia unit, overseeing more
than $326 billion, the Boston-based company said today in a
statement. Jones will take the post in mid-March and report to
Ronald P. O’Hanley, president of Fidelity Asset Management. He
will also serve as chairman of Pyramis.  Uebelein, president and CEO of Pyramis since 2008, will
head a new effort to provide Pyramis customers with
multistrategy investment solutions, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
