St. John’s University  fired
associate athletic director Brian Colleary yesterday for
scalping tickets to Red Storm basketball games, the school said
in a statement.  Colleary was suspended Feb. 9 without pay pending an
internal investigation in to the “misappropriation of men’s
basketball tickets,” according to the statement. The school
said the review concluded Colleary’s actions did not involve
anyone else affiliated with the  St. John’s .  “ St. John’s University  and its Department of Athletics
expect all employees to conduct themselves with the highest
moral and ethical standards,” according to the statement. “We
will continue to be diligent in monitoring this matter as we
further strengthen our controls and policies.”  University spokesman Dominic Scianna said the Queens, New
York, school would have no further comment. An e-mail sent to
Colleary’s school address wasn’t returned.  Colleary was an employee of the 15,720-undergraduate-
student university for six years. He oversaw athletic annual and
capital fundraising and coordinated alumni and booster club
events, according to his university bio page.  He was the athletic director for  Duquesne University  in
Pittsburgh from 1990-2005, and previously served as AD at  Marist
College  and head football coach at  Iona College .  To contact the reporter on this story:
