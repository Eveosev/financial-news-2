The rand slumped to a three-week low
after stocks and commodity prices tumbled as  Europe ’s creditor
countries struggled to bridge divisions over a rescue of Greece,
damping demand for riskier assets.  South Africa ’s currency retreated as much as 1.5 percent to
7.8799 per dollar, the weakest level since Jan. 26. It traded
0.5 percent down at 7.8385 as of 3:36 p.m. in Johannesburg.
Against the euro, it slipped 0.5 percent to 10.1941 per dollar.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of raw materials declined for
a second time this week as the prices of metals including
copper, nickel and platinum dropped. Commodities account for 64
percent of South Africa’s exports, according to government data
for 2011. A decision slated for yesterday on 130 billion euros
($170 billion) of aid to  Greece  was postponed to Feb. 20, and
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said Europe’s
creditor countries are seeking more control over how aid to
Greece is spent.  “We are now solidly in a risk-off environment due to Greek
concerns,”  John Cairns  and Josina Solomons, currency
strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in e-
mailed comments. “Global markets haven’t taken these concerns
very well, with all risky assets taking a hit.”  South Africa’s benchmark stock  index  dropped for a third
day, led by raw materials exporters including Anglo American
Plac and BHP Billiton Ltd.  Bonds Decline  South African  government bonds  declined as the currency’s
retreat and stronger-than-expected retail sales growth spurred
investors to add to bets interest rates will rise. The yield on
6.75 percent bonds due 2021 climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.91 percent, the highest on a closing
basis since Jan. 25.  Retail sales rose 8.7 percent in December, compared with a
revised 7.2 percent a month earlier, Pretoria-based Statistics
South Africa said yesterday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 11 economists was 6.5 percent.  “This holds price inflation risks for the economy going in
to late 2012 and early 2013,”  George Glynos , an economist at
Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics, wrote in e-mailed comments
today. “As a result, we continue to foresee a pick-up of
interest rate expectations going into year-end.”  Three-month forward-rate agreement starting in 12 months
added six basis points to 6 percent today, implying investors
expect a 50 basis-point rate increase by February next year.
South Africa’s central bank has left its benchmark repo rate
unchanged at 5.5 percent for the past 18 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
