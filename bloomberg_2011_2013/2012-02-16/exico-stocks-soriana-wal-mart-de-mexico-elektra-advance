The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:47 p.m. local time.  The IPC  index  rose 0.4 percent to 38,040.57.       Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA*)  , the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas , increased 2.5
percent to 1,165 pesos. The company agreed to acquire the payday
lender Advance America Cash Advance Centers Inc. for $655
million, stretching Salinas’s low-income loans empire into the
U.S. Elektra said it will pay $10.50 a share for Advance America
in a statement yesterday, a 33 percent premium to yesterday’s
closing stock price.  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)  , Mexico’s second-
biggest grocery store chain, gained 1.9 percent to 33.95 pesos.
The increase in January same-store retail sales reported
yesterday by Mexico’s retail association shows “sequential
acceleration,” with increases in  consumer lending  by banks
“benefiting food retailers more than department stores,”
Joaquin Ley, an analyst at Banco Santander SA, said in an e-
mailed report today.  Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB  (WALMEXV MM),  Latin America ’s
largest retailer, increased 1 percent to 39.95 pesos. The
company was upgraded to “outperform” from “neutral” at
Credit Suisse Group AG by analyst Antonio Gonzalez, who said the
“unmatched” capacity to add new stores will help Walmex
“disproportionately benefit from a growing industry” in an e-
mailed research note sent late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
