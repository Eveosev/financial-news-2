Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 9.84 points, or 0.4 percent, to
2,356.86. The  CSI 300 Index  declined 0.5 percent to 2,536.07.  Media stocks:  Huayi Brothers Media Corp. (300027)  (300027 CH),
China’s biggest listed filmmaker, gained 1 percent to 15.17
yuan.  Zhejiang Huace Film & TV Co.  (300133 CH) climbed 3.8

 book publisher , advanced 2.1 percent to 11.73 yuan.  China will encourage listings of“culture industry”
companies, according to a five-year government plan published by
the state-run Xinhua News Agency. China will also promote
mergers and acquisitions in the industry, it said.  Pangang Group Steel Vanadium & Titanium Co.  (000629 CH),
