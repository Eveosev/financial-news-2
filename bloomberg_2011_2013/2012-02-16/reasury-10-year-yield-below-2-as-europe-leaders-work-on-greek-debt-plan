Treasuries fell for the first time
in five days after claims for U.S. jobless benefits unexpectedly
dropped last week to a four-year low, fueling speculation about
faster economic growth and damping demand for haven assets.  U.S. 10-year note yields  extended  gains after a $9 billion
auction of 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities drew
a higher-than-forecast yield even as it set an auction record
low of 0.77 percent. Haven demand was reduced as the  European
Central Bank  is swapping its Greek bonds for new ones to ensure
it isn’t forced to take losses in a debt restructuring, three
euro-area officials said. Treasury announced $99 billion of
notes auctions for next week.  “The better data is definitely accumulating,” said Daniel Dektar, the chief investment officer at  Chapel Hill , North
Carolina-based Smith Breeden Associates, which oversees $6.5
billion. “It’s the claims, mostly. We are getting to the point
where higher rates are becoming more likely.”  Yields on 10-year notes rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.98 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 fell 1/2, or $5 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 5/32. Yields earlier exceeded 2 percent for
the first time since Feb. 13. The yield has traded as low as
1.79 percent and touched a high of 2.09 percent this year.  Yields on 30-year bonds added five basis points to 3.14
percent. The yield has traded between a low of 2.88 percent and
a high of 3.23 percent this year.  Rates Evaluation  “We’re still in this trading range,” said Paul Montaquila, head of fixed-income trading in  San Ramon ,
 California , at Bank of the West. “Clearly we’re seeing better
economic data at a steady pace, but it’s been frustratingly
slow. Rates should be moving higher.”  The 21 primary dealers that trade directly with the
 Federal Reserve  held $106.3 billion in Treasuries as of Feb. 8,
the first time they have held more than $100 billion of
government debt, according to Fed data. Of that, $102.2 billion
are securities maturing in three years or less, the data shows.  Current 30-year TIPS yielded 0.75 percent today. Today’s
auction yield compared with 0.999 percent at the last auction of
the securities on Oct. 20, which was the least since the
government began issuing the securities in 1998. Investors
submitted orders to buy 2.46 times the amount of debt offered,
compared with a record 3.06 times at the previous sale.  “TIPs are less inexpensive than they were a year ago and
that’s helped them to outperform Treasuries,” Dektar said
before the auction. “We prefer TIPs to nominal Treasuries.”  Inflation Bets  Investors betting on inflation in the years ahead pushed
TIPS to an 18 percent gain in the past 12 months, based on Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Conventional Treasuries
returned 11 percent, the data show.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a
gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices during the life
of the debt, was 2.25 percentage points. The 10-year average is
2.14 percentage points.  A measure of traders’ inflation expectations that the Fed
uses to help guide monetary policy is at 2.59 percent, down from
as high as 3.23 percent last year. The five-year, five-year
forward break-even rate, which projects annual price increases
over a five-year period beginning in 2017, is below its 2.76
percent average during the past decade.  Investors demanded 2.85 percentage points of extra yield to
buy 30-year bonds, which are among the securities that are the
most sensitive to inflation, instead of two-year notes. The
spread has averaged 2.67 points during the past five years.  Fed Buys  The U.S. central bank purchased $1.8 billion of Treasuries
due from February 2036 to February 2042 today as part of its
plan to hold down borrowing costs, according to the  New York 
Fed’s  website .  The U.S. announced it will sell $35 billion in two-year
notes, $35 billion in five-year debt and $29 billion in seven-
year securities on three consecutive days next week starting
Feb. 21. The size of the two-year note has remained at $35
billion since October 2010, while the size of the five-year note
has remained at $35 billion since September 2010, while the size
of the seven-year auction has remained at $29 billion since July
2010.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which measures
price swings based on options, closed today at 80.1 basis
points, near the lowest level since July 2007. The five-year
average is 111.9 basis points.  Trading Level  Treasury market  volume  yesterday dropped. About $290.7
billion of Treasuries changed hands through ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker, above the one-year average
of $276 billion.  Germany  wants euro-area finance ministers to consider the
130 billion-euro ($170 billion) rescue for  Greece  at their
meeting Feb. 20 along with a bond swap to cut the nation’s debt
load, coalition lawmakers were told by German government
officials in a briefing today.  As long as Greece meets conditions for the aid, the finance
chiefs will probably approve the package along with the debt
exchange, three German officials involved in the telephone
briefing said. A Finance Ministry spokesman declined to comment.  Minutes of the Fed’s last policy meeting on Jan. 24-25 that
were released yesterday showed a few members of the Open Market
Committee said economic conditions may warrant more asset
purchases, or quantitative easing, “before long.” Central
bankers adopted a plan to hold  interest rates  near zero at least
through late 2014 to spur growth and reduce unemployment.  Dealer Survey  The Fed of New York’s survey of primary dealers conducted
before policy makers met last month showed the firms saw the
probability of another round of asset purchases declining from
December.  The median respondent saw a 55 percent chance that the Fed
would expand its balance sheet through securities purchases
within one year, down from 60 percent odds in the survey
conducted before the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Dec. 13
meeting, according to results released today by the New York
Fed. Dealers also became more confident the  U.S. economy  would
avoid a recession.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
13,000 in the week ended Feb. 11 to 348,000, less than the
lowest forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the
fewest since March 2008, Labor Department figures showed today.
The median survey estimate projected an increase to 365,000.  “Claims was the dominant one -- being below 350,000 shows
strong progress,” said  John Briggs , a U.S. government-bond
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“If we didn’t have the European situation going on, we would be
higher in yields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
