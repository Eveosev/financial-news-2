German 10-year bonds opened higher,
rising for a third-straight day, and pushing the  yield  down
three basis points to 1.83 percent at 7:06 a.m. London time.  Thirty-year bond yields also dropped three basis points, to
2.45 percent, reaching the lowest since Feb. 2.  French 10-year bonds opened little changed, leaving the
yield at 3.02 percent. The  additional yield  investors demand to
hold the French securities instead of benchmark German bunds
increased three basis points to 118 basis points, also the most
since Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
