Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) , which has
businesses from mining and retail to insurance, posted first-
half profit that missed analyst estimates as coal earnings
stalled.  Net income rose 0.3 percent to A$1.18 billion ($1.26
billion) in the six months ended Dec. 31 from A$1.17 billion a
year earlier, the Perth, Australia-based company said in a
statement today. The profit missed the A$1.42 billion average of
three  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings from the coal unit were unchanged as the benefit
of higher revenue was eroded by the timing of royalty payments.
Sales gained at the Coles supermarket business,  Australia â€™s
second-largest. The grocery unit has posted faster sales growth
than larger rival  Woolworths Ltd. (WOW)  for 10 straight quarters as it
revamps stores and lowers shelf prices to win customers.  Wesfarmers fell 2.6 percent to A$29.09 at the close of
trading in Sydney, erasing its gains for the year. The benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index fell 1.7 percent.  Earnings before interest and tax at Coles rose 14 percent
to A$656 million.  The coal division had profit of A$250 million, unchanged
from the previous year. Profit at the insurance unit fell to
A$17 million from A$65 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
