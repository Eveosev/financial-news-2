Farmland sales in  Texas  near the
border with Mexico have slowed because buyers may fear violence
from drug traffickers, leaving some fields idle, Texas
Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples said.  The number of National Guard troops along Texas’s 1,241-
mile (1,998-kilometer) border with Mexico should be increased to
14 agents per mile, from six currently, Staples said today in an
open letter to President  Barack Obama . Military equipment
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan also should be used to
patrol the border, he said.  “With steadily rising agricultural land values across much
of the U.S., this fertile soil should be producing crops and
contributing to the local economy,” Staples said. “Instead,
families that have nurtured the land for generations are
tragically forced to start over away from the car chases, armed
drug smugglers and cartel violence spilling over from  Mexico .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
