CBD Energy Ltd. (CBD) , an Australian
renewable energy company, agreed to buy  Westinghouse Solar Inc. (WEST) 
in a stock swap to enter the U.S. rooftop solar market.  CBD shareholders will own 85 percent of the combined
company and owners of Campbell, California-based Westinghouse
will hold the rest, the companies said today in a statement.
Terms of the deal weren’t released.  “CBD has been looking for a point of entry into the U.S.
market for some time and believes the acquisition of
Westinghouse Solar is an ideal fit,” CBD Energy Chief Executive
Officer Gerry McGowan said in the statement.  The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. CBD
last month said it purchased $1 million in Westinghouse shares
at 60 cents each.  Westinghouse Solar had a fourth-quarter loss of $1.27
million, or 9 cents a share, on sales of $3.3 million, the
company said today in a separate statement.  Westinghouse fell 6.4 percent to 71 cents a share at 11:03
a.m. in  New York . They had declined 65 percent in the past year
through yesterday. CBD, based in Double Bay,  Australia , rose 1.3
percent to 8.1 Australian cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
