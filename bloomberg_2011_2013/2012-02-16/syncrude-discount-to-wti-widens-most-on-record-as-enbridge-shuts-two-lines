Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  oil’s discount plunged the
most on record after Enbridge Energy Partners LP shut two
pipelines that help deliver oil from  Alberta  to U.S. and
Canadian refineries following a leak on one of the lines.  Enbridge closed the 491,200-barrel-a-day Line 5 after a
release yesterday near Sterling,  Michigan , that is estimated to
be less than three barrels, Lorraine Little, a company
spokeswoman in Superior,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mail. It also
shut Line 1, which delivers oil from  Edmonton , Alberta, to
Superior because of high inventories at the terminus, she said.  “Over the last 12 months, Canadian production has
increased 200,000 barrels a day, and North Dakota output by a
like amount,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “You have all this additional oil
and the pipeline infrastructure remains the same, so any
disruption is magnified in the price.”  Syncrude’s discount to West Texas Intermediate futures
weakened $16 to $17 a barrel at 12:03 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s largest single
day dip in records dating back to 2006.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS)  widened $4.50 to a discount of $29 a
barrel against the U.S. benchmark.  Bakken (USCSUHC1)  oil’s discount grew
$2.50 to $10 a barrel below WTI.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI lost 15 cents to $21.35 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
decreased 55 cents to a premium of $23.25.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI was unchanged at $20.50 and
Mars Blend’s increased 90 cents to $16.40.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
added $1.15 to $16.15 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s premium
widened 25 cents to $17.25 over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount narrowed 5 cents to $3.75 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
