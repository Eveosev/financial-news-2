The U.S. Coast Guard has re-opened a
two-mile section of the Intracoastal Waterway near  Corpus
Christi ,  Texas .  A channel was opened within the last hour after a tug with
two barges ran aground at about 6:15 a.m. local time today, said
Lt. Steven Vanderlaske. The incident occured at Port Oâ€™Connor,
Texas, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Corpus Christi.  The tug Bolivar Point was towing the barges with about
50,000 barrels of alkylate when it struck a boathouse on the
northern shore of the waterway, according a statement on the
Coast Guard website. There were no reports of injuries or
pollution in the incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
