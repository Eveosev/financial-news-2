The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for a third day as delays in delivering a second bailout
to  Greece  increased concern Russian exports to the European
Union will be threatened.  Russia’s currency lost 0.8 percent to 34.247 per dollar at
the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, its weakest closing level since Jan.
30 The ruble was little changed at 39.375 per euro and 0.5
percent lower at 34.3546 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  While “further considerations are necessary” on the
program for Greece,  Europe  is set to make “all the necessary
decisions” on Feb. 20, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude
Juncker  said yesterday. Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, lost
0.2 percent to $101.63 a barrel in New York crude futures
trading. The EU is Russia’s largest trading partner.  Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.5697
per dollar in three months’ time, compared with expectations of
30.4115 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
