Work was halted today at the World
Trade Center construction site in lower  Manhattan  after a crane
dropped steel beams that fell about 40 stories onto the truck
that delivered them, the general contractor said.  No one was injured in the accident, which happened around
10 a.m., said John P. Gallagher, spokesman for Tishman
Construction Corp., which is  building  the 72-story tower at 4
World Trade Center. The site is partially shut down pending an
investigation, he said in an e-mailed statement.  Steel was being hoisted on the south side of the skyscraper
when a cable snapped, sending the beams falling, said Rich
Viglione, a New York Fire Department spokesman. Debris from the
accident was confined to the work site, he said.  The tower is being built by developer  Larry Silverstein ,
under a lease from the  Port Authority  of New York and  New
Jersey , which owns the 16-acre site.  Work  on the adjacent
transit hub was continuing, according to Steve Coleman, the
authority’s spokesman. The nearby 9/11 Memorial remained open,
said Michael Frazier, a spokesman.  “We are investigating the matter in full cooperation with
the Port Authority, FDNY and the NYC Department of Buildings,”
Gallagher said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
