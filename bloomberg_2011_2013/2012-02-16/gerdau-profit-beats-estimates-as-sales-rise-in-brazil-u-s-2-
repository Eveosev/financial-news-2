Gerdau SA (GGBR4) ,  Latin America ’s largest
steelmaker, reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates on rising demand in  Brazil  and  North America .  Net income rose to 438.8 million reais ($252.7 million)
from 369 million reais in the year-earlier period, the  Porto
Alegre , Brazil-based company said today in a statement. Gerdau
was expected to post a 352.4 million-real profit excluding
items, the  average  of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Demand for steel used in construction increased in Brazil
as banks boosted lending for homes, while manufacturers and
energy companies drove up sales in North America, Gerdau said.  Net sales jumped 16 percent to 9.1 billion reais in the
quarter. Sales at Gerdau’s North American unit, which accounts
for about a third of revenue, increased 10 percent in volume,
while domestic sales jumped 15 percent.  Crude-steel output climbed 8 percent to 4.73 million metric
tons in the quarter, while production of rolled steel increased
9 percent to 3.98 million tons.  Gerdau rose 0.6 percent to 17.30 reais at 2:41 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . Before today it gained 19 percent, more than the 15
percent increase in the benchmark Bovespa index.  The company reported a financial loss of 82 million reais,
less than the 184 million reais it had a year ago, as it used
part of proceeds from its 5.5 billion-real share sale in April
to pay some debt in advance, it said.  Iron-Ore assets  Gerdau Chief Executive Officer Andre Gerdau Johannpeter is
still considering options to monetize the company’s mining
assets, which hold about 2.9 billion tons of iron-ore reserves.  The company hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as an adviser to
see alternatives for the company’s mining assets, Gerdau told
reporters on a conference call today.  Gerdau plans to invest 10.3 billion reais between 2012 and
2016, including the expansion of its iron-ore output and a port
in  Colombia .  The steelmaker reported earnings today before market
opened, after “instability” in the computer system of Brazil’s
securities regulator, known as CVM, prevented it from reporting
yesterday as initially planned, according to the company’s press
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
