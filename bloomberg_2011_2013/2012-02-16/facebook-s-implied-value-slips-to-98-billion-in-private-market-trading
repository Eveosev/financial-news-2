Facebook Inc.’s (FB)  implied value fell
by almost 5 percent to about $98 billion in an auction of a fund
that holds shares of the world’s biggest social-networking
company.  SharesPost Inc.  managed a Feb. 14 auction of 200,000 fund
units, each equivalent to one Facebook share, at a price of $42
apiece, according to a statement from the private-stock
marketplace yesterday. SharesPost estimates Facebook has 2.33
billion shares outstanding, including stock tied to options that
may be issued, according to its website.  The price dropped from last week, when SharesPost handled
an auction of 150,000 shares of Facebook’s Class B common stock
for $44 each, or an implied value of $102.6 billion. Facebook
filed for an initial public offering on Feb. 1, and people
familiar with the matter have said the company is considering a
sale that would value it at $75 billion to $100 billion.  “The real test of a company’s worth only occurs in the
public market,” said  Lawrence Creatura , a Rochester, New York-
based  money manager  who helps oversee $370 billion at Federated
Investors Inc. “It’s like trying to forecast an athlete’s
performance in a game by looking at historic statistics. Those
can help you make an educated guess on things, but anything can
happen on game day.”  Facebook’s Stock  Facebook jumped about 73 percent in value on the secondary
market last year to $71.2 billion, according to a report last
week by Nyppex LLC, a Rye, New York-based broker-dealer and
research firm. The biggest gainer was microblogging service
Twitter Inc., which more than doubled to $8.52 billion.
Yelp Inc., the consumer-review website that filed for an IPO in
November, rose 44 percent to $705 million.  The valuation based on private-market transactions may
change depending on the actual share count after the IPO. As of
Dec. 31, Facebook had 117.1 million Class A shares and 1.76
billion Class B shares outstanding. There also are about 379
million restricted stock units that vest later, as well as about
259 million shares that may be issued if outstanding  stock
options  are exercised, the IPO prospectus shows.  Facebook, run by Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg ,
is seeking to raise $5 billion, according to its IPO filing. At
a valuation of $100 billion, the company would trade at 26.9
times 2011 sales, more than five times higher than search-engine
operator  Google Inc. (GOOG)   Revenue at  Menlo Park ,  California-based Facebook  jumped 88
percent last year to $3.71 billion, while net income climbed by
almost two-thirds to $1 billion.  Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for San Bruno, California-based
SharesPost, confirmed the auction results. Jonathan Thaw, a
spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
