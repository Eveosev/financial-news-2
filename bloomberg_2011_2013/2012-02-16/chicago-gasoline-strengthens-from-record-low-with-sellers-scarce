Chicago  gasoline strengthened from
the lowest level more than 15 years as the record discount
attracted buyers.  The fuel had dropped or held steady for eight consecutive
sessions. Gasoline stockpiles  in the Midwest  rose last week to
57.2 million barrels, the highest level since February 2010,
according to the Energy Department.  “Basically buyers are saying ’it’s cheap enough now and I
will hold it’ and they find the sellers are done,” said Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in
 Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a telephone interview. Only small
volumes have sold, if available, he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 6 cents to 57.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:55 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday the fuel fell
to the lowest level since at least 1996. Prompt delivery rose
10.15 cents to $2.4732 a gallon.  A lower price is also limited for the fuel as the vapor
pressure change requirement for more expensive summer gasoline
starts next month, Lewis said.  Refiners have increased output as Canadian oils used in
Midwest plants have been at record discounts to West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude. Refiners in the region
 processed  3.45 million barrels a day last week, the most for
this time of year since 1992, department data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
