Oil options volatility fell as crude
advanced to a six-week high on optimism that  Greece  will get a
second bailout and as U.S. jobless claims dropped to the lowest
level since 2008.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.8 as of 2 p.m. in New York, down from
30.4 yesterday.  Crude for March delivery gained 51 cents to $102.31 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have ranged
between $92.52 and $103.74 since early November.  “We are still in that range,” Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York, said by phone.
“The fact that oil is a little bit higher naturally makes the
volatility come down a bit, so I’m not looking at it as a very
big move in volatility.”  Volatility for 25-delta calls, which gain 25 cents for each
dollar rise in futures prices, was 31.6, up from 30.9 a week
ago, while 25-delta puts were 29.8, down from 30.3.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $110 calls. They slipped 1 cent to $1.01 a barrel with
1,917 contracts trading as of 2:25 p.m. in New York. Next were
May $115 calls, which gained 13 cents to $1.55 a barrel on 1,479
lots. A contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Calls were 60
percent of the volume.  Middle East Tension  “Anything can happen, there’s more talk about tension in
the  Middle East , anything can happen there and you’re seeing a
big premium in the price of oil right now because of the
unpredictable situation with  Iran  right now,” Rigolini said.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Puts accounted for 51 percent of the volume yesterday.
April $90 puts were the most actively traded options, with 6,683
lots changing hands. They fell 8 cents to 44 cents a barrel. The
next-most active options, June $125 calls, rose 14 cents to
$1.18 a barrel on volume of 3,884 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,526
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,150 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,548.  To contact the reporter on this story:
