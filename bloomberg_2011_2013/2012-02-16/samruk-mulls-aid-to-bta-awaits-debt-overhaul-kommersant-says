State-run  BTA Bank (BTAS)  remains in a
“zone of turbulence” as bad-loan recovery was less than
expected, Kommersant reported, citing an  interview  with Umirzak Shukeyev, head of Kazakhstan’s sovereign-wealth fund.  Samruk-Kazyna, which holds the government’s stake in the
troubled lender, will consider additional capital injections if
BTA remains “viable” after its second debt restructuring in as
many years, Shukeyev was quoted as saying by the Moscow-based
newspaper.  Aid to the lender may take the form of cutting the cost of
state funding available to BTA and increasing the interest
payments it gets on the wealth fund’s notes used as collateral
in repo agreements with the central bank, Shukeyev told
Kommersant, adding that Samruk-Kazyna will make “maximum
efforts” to increase the bank’s capital.  The amount of possible injections will be decided by
creditors, and BTA needs an improved business plan to boost its
competitiveness, he said.  State-controlled lenders AO Temirbank and AO Alliance Bank
have been stabilized, Shukeyev told Kommersant. While Samruk-
Kazyna is discussing consolidating its banking assets, it’s also
prepared to divest stakes in the lenders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
