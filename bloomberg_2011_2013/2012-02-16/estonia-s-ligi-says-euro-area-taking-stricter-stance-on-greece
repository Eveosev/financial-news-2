Euro-area finance ministers are
adopting a “stricter stance” toward  Greece  as the indebted
country seeks new aid to stave off economic collapse, Estonian
Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said.  “There’s more consensus on Greece in terms of a clearly
stricter stance,” Ligi told a news conference today in the
capital, Tallinn. “Critical voices are sounding louder than
others.”  Euro-area finance ministers extracted concessions from
Greek political leaders intended to pave the way for the
endorsement a 130 billion-euro ($169 billion) aid package next
week, Luxembourg’s Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
yesterday after chairing a conference call. Greek politicians
are frustrated after ministers last week rejected a Greek
austerity package worth 7 percent of gross domestic product.  “No one is starting to expel Greece,” Ligi said, adding
that punishment “shouldn’t be expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
