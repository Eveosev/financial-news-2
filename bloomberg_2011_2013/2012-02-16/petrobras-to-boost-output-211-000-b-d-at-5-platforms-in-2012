Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-run oil company, will more than double output at five
platforms this year to offset declining production in aging
fields.  Average output from the five platforms it started
installing in 2010 will rise to 336,000 barrels a day from
125,000 barrels, Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer
is known, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Petrobras, the world’s biggest producer in waters deeper
than 300 meters (984 feet), plans to more than double output by
2020 as it develops the largest discoveries in the Americas
since Mexico discovered Cantarell in 1976.  “You have to consider the decline of old fields in the
balance,” Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said in an
interview in  Sao Paulo  yesterday.  Petrobras hasn’t released a production growth target for
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
