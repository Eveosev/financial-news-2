OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s fourth-
largest oil producer, issued a tender to sell Urals crude from
the new Baltic Sea terminal at Ust-Luga for loading from Feb. 27
to Feb. 28, said two traders who participate in the market.  The tender for 100,000 metric tons will be awarded
tomorrow, according to the people, who declined to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to speak on the matter.  This would be the first crude cargo to be shipped from the
terminal, which is the receiving point of the 100 billion ruble
($3.3 billion) Baltic Pipeline System-2 built by OAO Transneft.
Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for Transneft, declined to comment on
the start date of the BPS-2 link when contacted by Bloomberg
News today.  Opening of the Ust-Luga terminal was delayed to the first
quarter of 2012 from November because of engineering issues at
the port, Dyomin said in December. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest
oil producer, was said on Nov. 11 to award a crude tender for
loading from the port in late November, which didn’t take place,
according to two traders with knowledge of the matter.  The BPS-2 pipeline has a capacity of 30 million tons a
year, or 600,000 barrels a day, and is expected to pump 10 to 15
million tons of crude this year, Dyomin said on Feb. 13. As much
as 5 million tons each will be diverted from the Baltic port of
Primorsk,  Poland ’s Gdansk, and the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk, he said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
