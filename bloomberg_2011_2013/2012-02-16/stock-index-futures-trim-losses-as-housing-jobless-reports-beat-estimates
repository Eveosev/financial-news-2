U.S. stock-index futures pared
losses after jobless claims fell more than estimated and housing
starts topped forecasts, bolstering optimism that the economy is
weathering  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  expiring next
month slipped 0.2 percent to 1,338.8 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York 
after losing as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
13,000 in the week ended Feb. 11 to 348,000, less than the
lowest forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the
fewest since March 2008, Labor Department figures showed today.
The median survey estimate projected an increase to 365,000.  Housing starts rose 1.5 percent to a 699,000 annual rate
from December’s 689,000 pace that was stronger than previously
reported, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a rise to 675,000. Building permits, a proxy for
future construction, also climbed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
