PKN Orlen SA (PKN) , Poland’s largest oil
refiner, is starting meetings with investors today on the sale
of domestic bonds, said Chief Financial Officer Slawomir
Jedrzejczyk.  Orlen plans to collect bids for 750 million zloty ($230
million) of bonds in a bookbuilding process on Feb. 23,
according to two people familiar with the sale, who asked not to
be identified because the information isn’t public.  The company is considering a sale of either five- or seven-
year bonds, Jedrzejczyk said today in an e-mailed reply to
questions from Bloomberg News. Orlen’s previous five-year issue
matures on Feb. 27.  Polish companies will more than double bond sales this year
from 2011 to as much as 20 billion zloty, said Miroslaw
Dudzinski, Fitch Ratings’ country director, in December.
Companies, led by utilities such as Orlen and Enea SA, are
increasing bond sales as they raise power generation and oil and
gas exploration investments.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  and  ING Bank Slaski SA (BSK)  are managing the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
