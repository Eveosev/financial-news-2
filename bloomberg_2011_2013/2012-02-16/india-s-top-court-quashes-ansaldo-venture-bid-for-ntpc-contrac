India ’s top court overruled an order
that enabled Ansaldo Caldaie Boilers India Pvt. to bid for a
contract to supply equipment to  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) , the nation’s biggest
electricity generator.  The Delhi High Court’s “order to allow Ansaldo to bid for
the tender is quashed,” Altamas Kabir, one of two judges on the
panel that heard the case, said in the  Supreme Court  in New
Delhi today.  State-owned NTPC (NTPC)  sought bids for equipment valued at 110
billion rupees ($2.4 billion) for the expansion of its power
plants and rejected Ansaldo Caldaie’s bid because it wasn’t a
qualified manufacturer. Ansaldo Caldaie, a venture between
 Gammon India Ltd. (GMON) , an Indian construction company, and Italy’s
Ansaldo Caldaie SpA, contested the decision.  “The tender document did not contain provision for
acquiring equipment from a third party,” Kabir said while
reading out the judgment in the courtroom. The bidding process
will continue, he said.  The lower court ordered NTPC in March last year to allow
Ansaldo Caldaie to proceed to the next stage of price bids and
participate in the technical discussions.  NTPC is ordering 11 units of steam generators of 660
megawatts each for projects at Mouda, Solapur, Nabinagar, Meja
and Raghunathpur.  To contact the reporters on this story:
