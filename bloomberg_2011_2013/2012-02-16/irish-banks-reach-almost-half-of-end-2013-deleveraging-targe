Ireland’s three state-guaranteed
banks that remain open for business have achieved almost half
their target for selling and running down about 70 billion-euros
of loans by the end of 2013, according to the country’s  Finance
Ministry .  Dublin-based Bank of Ireland Plc,  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) ,
including its EBS Ltd. unit, and Irish Life & Permanent Plc
deleveraged 32 billion euros of loans by the end of November, a
finance ministry spokesman said in an e-mailed response to
questions.   The nation’s two largest banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied
Irish, sold almost 15 billion euros of assets last year at
“significantly better prices” than expected during stress
tests in March, the government said on Feb. 14. Ireland’s
Central Bank Deputy Governor Matthew Elderfield said on Dec 1
the country’s banks will find deleveraging “more challenging”
this year as European peers with funding pressures also sell
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
