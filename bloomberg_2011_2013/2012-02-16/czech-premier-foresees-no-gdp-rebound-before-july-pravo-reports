The Czech economy wonâ€™t rebound
significantly in the first half of this year after falling into
recession in the last quarter of 2011,  Pravo  reported, citing
Premier Petr Necas.  Worsening economic performance will have a negative impact
on the state budget, the newspaper said. The statistics office
said yesterday that gross domestic product contracted for the
second consecutive quarter in the final three months of 2011.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporters on this story:
