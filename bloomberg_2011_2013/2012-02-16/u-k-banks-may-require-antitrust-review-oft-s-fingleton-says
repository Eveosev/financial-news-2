U.K. banks may require a review by
antitrust regulators to stoke sluggish competition and encourage
retail customers to switch between financial providers, the head
of the  Office of Fair Trading  said in a speech.  John Fingleton , the OFT’s chief executive officer, said
regulators needed to see evidence that new banks were entering
the market and that customers were moving between banks,
according to prepared remarks for a speech in  London .  “Without this the obvious question is whether the
concentrated market structure of U.K. banking is the problem.
And one way to consider this question is a reference” to the
U.K.’s Competition Commission, Fingleton said.  The U.K. Parliament’s Treasury Committee in 2010
investigated possible barriers that blocked new banks entering
the market, adding to probes by the OFT into overdraft fees and
equity underwriting. Fingleton said the country’s banking
industry has become more concentrated since the financial crisis
forced the government to bail out and merge banks.  The U.K. brokered a takeover of HBOS Plc to create the
U.K.’s biggest mortgage lender. It also bailed out Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and Northern Rock
Plc.  U.K. banks have “little incentive” to innovate, reduce
costs or focus more on customers, Fingleton said.  Richard Branson ’s financial-services unit Virgin Money Ltd. and  Tesco
Bank  have “real challenges to being successful” because
customers rarely switch banks and have little information on
fees.  The OFT will examine the market for personal current
accounts later this year, Fingleton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
