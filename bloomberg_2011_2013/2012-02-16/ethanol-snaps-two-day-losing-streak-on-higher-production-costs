Ethanol futures in  Chicago  rose for
the first time in three days on signs of higher manufacturing
costs caused by corn export demand.  Prices gained after the Agriculture Department said U.S.
 exporters  sold 1.07 million metric tons of corn in the week
ended Feb. 9, the most since October. The grain is used to make
ethanol.  “Ethanol prices were able to make small gains” while
still not rising enough relative to corn to help margins, Justin Dirico, a senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates LLC in
Chicago, wrote in an emailed note to clients.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 0.6 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.202 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices are down 9.8 percent from a year ago.  Ethanol producers are losing 11 cents per gallon of
ethanol, based on current prices for corn and the biofuel and
assuming a bushel of corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.16 a gallon, in the U.S. Gulf at $2.225 and on the West Coast
at $2.285 a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slid 0.5 cent to $2.25 a gallon.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 1.4 percent to settle at
$6.3975 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $6.26, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 25.  Ethanol is blended with gasoline to augment supply and meet
federal mandates.  There are 209 ethanol distilleries in the U.S., with the
capacity to produce 14.8 billion gallons of the biofuel,
annually, according to the  Renewable Fuels Association , a
Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
