OPEC will raise shipments by 0.7
percent this month as  Libya  continues to restore production that
was halted during last year’s uprising, according to tanker-
tracker Oil Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
 export  23.38 million barrels a day in the four weeks to March 3,
up from the 23.21 million barrels in the period to Feb. 4, the
Halifax, England-based researcher said today in an e-mailed
report. The figures exclude Angola and Ecuador.  “It’s coming from Libya partly, and partly from the
Gulf,” said Roy Mason, Oil Movements’ founder, who estimates
the North African nation has restored about two-thirds of its
capacity. “But the peak in winter demand has passed, and so the
decline in shipments should happen soon. If it doesn’t, there’s
something truly remarkable happening with demand.”  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will increase 0.6 percent to 17.47
million barrels a day in the four-week period, according to Oil
Movements.  Crude on board tankers will average 473.3 million barrels
in the four weeks, up 1.8 percent from 465.02 million in the
month to Feb. 4, Oil Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-
rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
 Nigeria ,  Qatar ,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
