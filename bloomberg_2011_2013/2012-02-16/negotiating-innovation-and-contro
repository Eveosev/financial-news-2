The other day I had coffee with a friend who was complaining about her company's ability to innovate. "That  iteration-itis post  you wrote really hit home," she said. "That's just what my life is like. But you know, my leadership team is  smart . And they've been hugely successful. So  why  are they doing things that are just so obviously wrong?" The answer we came to was a simple one. The company's core control mechanisms — the means by which it decides how to allocate resources, start and stop projects, and so on — were organized to do one thing: minimize mistakes. No one would ever say it that way, but it clearly explained why even seemingly simple decisions required consensus and multiple rounds of meetings. There's nothing necessarily wrong with control mechanisms to minimize mistakes. In fact, when problems can be tightly defined, mistake-minimizing mindsets are very valuable. There have been plenty of recent examples where shareholders would have been well served by systems to curtail wild risks. Even Google, one of the poster children of a fundamentally different control mindset — call it "experimentation encouraging" — hears calls to "get its house in order." Mistake-minimizing companies have their limits, however. They particularly struggle to handle industry transitions when answers come not from the Microsoft suite of products but from somewhat disorderly discovery in the marketplace.  In those circumstances, companies need to find a way to balance mistake-minimizing approaches that ensure the core business stays in control and produces vital cash flow for growth with experiment-encouraging approaches that spur the creation of new growth. The fundamental challenge, then, is finding the right way to balance this tension. Academics offer up at least three answers: Each theory has its advocates, but each feels incomplete. The Christensen doctrine helped Dayton-Hudson create Target, Hewlett-Packard succeed in inkjet printing, and Qantas create its discount JetStar airline. But companies that follow this approach don't develop a  capability  to create new growth businesses.  Tushman and O'Reilly essentially punt: if you have a leader like Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, you can succeed; if you don't, you are in trouble.  While Govindarajan and Trimble's guidance makes sense at a high level, coloring in the details related to portfolio management, decision making, and managing distinct cultures presents challenges. 
There is an interesting idea coming out of the work my colleague Clark Gilbert is doing to transform the  Deseret News  and  Deseret Digital  (both owned by the Mormon Church). Gilbert says he has found success from creating a "modular exchange" between the old and new business. Visualize an airlock chamber on a ship. Innovators exploring new businesses enter the airlock, seal the door behind them, borrow the equipment that will help them with a tight seal from stopping unintentional contamination, and then start to explore. When they return, they can then "decontaminate" before re-entering the mother ship.  Gilbert's instincts are generally spot-on, and his early results are impressive, so I'm eager to see what he and my colleagues Matt Eyring and Dick Foster do as they continue to develop this idea. In the meantime, corporate leaders should at least step back to assess the degree to which their corporations are governed by mistake-minimizing systems. Exhorting people to be more innovative when all soft and hard systems point towards incrementalism doesn't do much good.
