Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said today that the franc is “overvalued” and
will probably weaken against the euro.  “In time the Swiss franc will have to move toward
purchasing power parity against the euro,” he told reporters at
a briefing with Polish Economy Minister  Waldemar Pawlak  in
Warsaw. “However, we’ve learned for now to live with a certain
volatility.”  Schneider-Ammann said he’s “soothed” that the European
Union is “doing everything it can” to resolve its debt crisis,
which caused the currency bloc’s economy to contract in the
fourth quarter and hurt Swiss exports, already under pressure
from the appreciating franc.  Coping with the credit crunch “is an enormous challenge
now and it will remain an enormous challenge” for policy
makers, Schneider-Ammann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
