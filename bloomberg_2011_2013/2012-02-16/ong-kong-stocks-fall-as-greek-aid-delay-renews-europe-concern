Hong Kong stocks  fell, with the
city’s benchmark index declining for the first time in four days,
as foreign direct investment in China slumped and European
leaders delayed a second aid package for Greece.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that gets most of its
revenue from  Europe , slid 1.7 percent.  China Construction Bank
Corp. (939) , the nation’s second-largest lender, fell 1.1 percent.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal, dropped
2.1 percent after metal prices declined.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a
supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., lost 3 percent after minutes
of last month’s  Federal Reserve  meeting showed U.S. policy
makers were divided on additional asset purchases to spur
economic growth.  The Hang Seng Index declined 0.4 percent to 21,277.28 at
the close. The gauge jumped 2.1 percent yesterday to a six-month
high as developers surged and China said it will help Europe
resolve its debt crisis. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong dropped 0.9 percent to
11,577.36 after commerce ministry data showed foreign direct
investment in China fell for a third month in January.  “The risk is in Europe and people are cautious on that,”
said  Alex Wong , asset-management director at Ample Capital Ltd.
in Hong Kong. “There’s some profit taking in Hong Kong, as
yesterday the rise was propelled by a short squeeze. You cannot
say this is a weak market because we’re only giving back half of
the gain yesterday. Many people are buying selectively.”  Annual Gain  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 15 percent this year as
U.S. data signaled strength in the world’s biggest economy and
amid speculation China will ease its monetary policy. Shares in
the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  traded at 10.9 times estimated earnings,
compared with 12.9 times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and
10.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Esprit slid 1.7 percent to HK$14.32, while Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd., which gets 53 percent of its sales in Europe, sank
0.8 percent to HK$77.65. Li & Fung fell 3 percent to HK$17.70
and  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a power-tool maker that counts
 North America  as its largest market, dropped 1 percent to
HK$9.80.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.3
percent today. The index slid 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday
as European officials delayed a decision on a 130 billion euro
($170 billion) bailout for  Greece  until at least Feb. 20 and
possibly until after Greek elections later in the year.  U.S. stocks also declined after the release of minutes of
the Federal Reserve’s Jan. 24-25 meeting showed a few policy
makers said the central bank may soon have to consider more
asset purchases, while others said the economic outlook would
have to deteriorate first.  Banks Fall  China Construction Bank sank 1.1 percent to HK$6.39.
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s third-biggest
lender by market value, slumped 0.8 percent to HK$3.75.  China’s four biggest banks lent about a combined 30 billion
yuan ($4.76 billion) in the first two weeks of February and
added 460 billion yuan deposits, the 21st Century Business
Herald reported today, without saying where it got the
information. That was less than a forecast by  China 
International Capital Corp. that this month’s lending by the
four banks would be about 300 billion yuan, in line with last
month, according to the newspaper.  Jiangxi Copper fell 2.1 percent to HK$21.50, while  Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s No. 1 supplier of the light
metal, retreated 2.8 percent to HK$4.17 after the London Metal
Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals including
copper and aluminum fell 0.5 percent yesterday. A measure of
materials companies had the  steepest drop  among the 11 industry
groups in the Hang Seng Composite Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month slid 0.9
percent to 21,222. The HSI Volatility Index rose 6.6 percent to
23.05, indicating options traders expect a swing of 6.6 percent
in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
