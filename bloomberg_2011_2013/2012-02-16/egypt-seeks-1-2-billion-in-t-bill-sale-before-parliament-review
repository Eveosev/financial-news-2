Egypt will offer 7 billion pounds
($1.2 billion) in local debt today before parliament reviews an
economic reform proposal for the  International Monetary Fund .
The nation’s 2020 dollar bonds fell a second day.  The North African country will seek bids for  six-month  and
 one-year  T-bills valued at 3.5 billion pounds each, according to
Central Bank of Egypt data on Bloomberg. The average yield on
one-year bills has climbed at the last 16 auctions to 15.975
percent, the highest since Bloomberg started tracking the data
in 2006. The yield on six-month notes was at 14.942 percent last
week.  The government, seeking approval from the IMF for a $3.2
billion loan, will submit an 18-month economic program to
parliament and notify the fund when the assembly approves it,
Planning Minister Fayza Aboulnaga said yesterday. Egypt needs to
secure IMF money as part of an effort to meet external financing
needs amounting to about $11 billion through to June 2013,
Minister of Finance Momtaz el-Saieed said Feb. 10.  Egypt ’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in April 2020
retreated for a second day, pushing the yield up 1 basis points,
or 0.01 of a percentage point, to 7.24 percent at 12:01 a.m. in
Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The pound
weakened less than 0.1 percent to 6.0369 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
