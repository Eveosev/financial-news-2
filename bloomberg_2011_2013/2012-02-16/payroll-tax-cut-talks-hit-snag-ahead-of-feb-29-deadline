Lawmakers on the U.S. House-Senate
panel aiming to resolve an impasse over extending a  payroll tax 
cut encountered resistance to a deal tonight, Democratic and
Republican aides said.  Two Republican aides said the dispute centers on concerns
about requiring federal workers to pay more into their pensions
to cover the cost of extending expanded unemployment benefits. A
Democratic aide said the issue stems from Republican insistence
on a provision that would allow some physician-owned hospitals
to be paid through Medicare.  A short-term extension of the two-percentage-point cut in
the payroll tax that funds Social Security is scheduled to
expire on Feb. 29. Negotiators have been involved in talks over
extending the tax break for the rest of 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
