Electricite de France SA ,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, said 2011 profit tripled on higher
French and U.K. nuclear output, and forecast spending on aging
reactors would increase over the next three years.  Net income advanced to 3.01 billion euros ($3.92 billion)
from 1 billion euros a year earlier when the utility made
provisions on Italian and U.S. operations, Paris-based EDF said
today in a statement. Adjusted for one-time items, results were
in line with analyst estimates.  The utility expects investment to reach as much as 15
billion euros in 2015, compared with 10.5 billion euros last
year, to pay for reactor equipment, safety upgrades and new
atomic plants.  Spending is rising because of stricter safety measures
after the Fukushima disaster in  Japan  and a program to keep
existing plants running for as long as 60 years.  France ’s state
auditor has estimated the utility will have to invest 55 billion
euros through 2025. EDF operates 58 reactors in France that
provide about three quarters of the country’s power output.  “The spending on safety will have to be done faster than
what we had anticipated,” Thomas Piquemal, chief financial
officer, said at a presentation today. Ten billion euros of the
total are related to safety measures ordered by the French
atomic watchdog.  The utility will stick to a previously forecast that
spending on French nuclear plants will at least double to 3.4
billion to 3.6 billion in 2015, compared with 1.7 billion euros
in 2010, he said.  EDF (EDF)  shares dropped as much as 69.5 cents, or 3.7 percent,
to 17.99 euros in Paris. The stock traded at 18.405 euros as of
4:28 p.m. local time.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization were 14.82 billion euros, an increase of 4.7
percent once the previous year’s figure is adjusted for
exceptional items. EDF had been targeting Ebitda growth of 4
percent to 6 percent in 2011.  Proposed Dividend  EDF reported non-recurring items last year of 510 million
euros for operations in  Italy , Swiss utility Alpiq and shares in
 Veolia Environnement SA. (VIE)  Proglio led that waste water utility
before moving to EDF.  EDF proposed a full-year dividend of 1.15 euros a share,
the same as 2010. The 2012 payout will be “at least stable”
compared with this year, EDF said.  Debt fell by more than 1 billion euros to 33.3 billion
euros at the end of 2011, according to today’s statement. Debt
could increase by 1.5 to 2 billion euros after the planned
takeover of  Edison SpA (EDN)  and due to higher investment, Piquemal
said today.  “The results were driven by good performance of the
generation fleet in France and the U.K.,” Per Lekander, an
analyst at UBS AG in  London , said in a note.  EDF, which is building a 1,650-megawatt EPR-model reactor
in France, increased nuclear output 3.2 percent to 421.1
terawatt-hours last year while hydroelectric production dropped
26 percent amid drier weather, according to the grid operator.
Output at EDF’s plants in the U.K. climbed 16 percent.  EDF expects French nuclear power production to be 420
terawatt-hours to 425 terawatt-hours this year. It also
forecasts higher atomic output in the U.K.  The utility said the availability of its domestic reactor
fleet last year was 80.7 percent, compared with 78.2 percent in
2010. Proglio was asked by Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  to
make raising this measure a priority when he became chief
executive in November, 2009.  Piquemal declined to confirm a previous target of making 85
percent of the country’s reactors available for electricity
production by 2015 because of “uncertainty” about major works
at reactors for safety and new equipment.  The outlook for French nuclear power output this year is
“cautious,” he said. The utility has programmed six planned
reactor outages due to 10-year safety inspections this year and
steam generator replacements on two reactors, according to an
earnings presentation.  EDF said replacing steam generators halts a reactor for 50
extra days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
