U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index near the highest level in about
three years, amid better-than-estimated economic reports and
optimism that  Greece  will receive a second bailout.  Financial (S5FINL)  shares rebounded from earlier losses as  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  rose 4 percent.  Microsoft (MSFT)  Corp. climbed 4.1
percent on a report that S&P is likely to increase its weighting
in the  S&P 500 .  General Motors Co. (GM)  jumped 9 percent after the
automaker posted the biggest annual profit in its 103-year-
history.  NetApp (NTAP)  Inc. increased 7.2 percent as the maker of data-
storage products reported revenue that beat analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 1,358.04 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The benchmark gauge for American equities is 0.4 percent
away from its  peak  nine months ago of 1,363.61, which was the
highest level since June 2008. The  Dow (INDU)  Jones Industrial Average
increased 123.13 points, or 1 percent, to 12,904.08.  “I don’t see what the case is for the market collapsing,”
Brian Barish, who helps oversee about $7 billion as Denver-based
president of Cambiar Investors LLC., said in a phone interview.
“The  U.S. economy  is doing pretty well. Taking the possibility
of a euro-Lehman type of event off the table, that has a big
effect on sentiment.”  Stocks rose as Americans filed the fewest claims for
jobless benefits since 2008 and builders  broke ground  on more
homes than forecast.  Manufacturing (OUTFGAF)  in the Philadelphia region
expanded in February at the fastest pace in four months as
orders and sales picked up.  New Bonds  Benchmark gauges  extended  gains and banks rallied as three
euro-area officials said the  European Central Bank  is swapping
its Greek bonds for new ones to ensure it isn’t forced to take
losses in a debt restructuring. European governments are
considering cutting  interest rates  on emergency loans to Greece
and using contributions from the ECB to plug a new financing gap
in the second bailout program for  Athens , two people familiar
with the discussions said.  “We’re more important to  Europe  than Europe is to us,”
Liz Ann Sonders, the New York-based chief investment strategist
at Charles Schwab Corp., said in a telephone interview. Her firm
has $1.68 trillion in client assets. “U.S. economic numbers
have been much better than expected. I’m pretty optimistic, but
I don’t think we’re going to boom. The debt overhang puts a lid
on how fast the U.S. economy can grow.”  Financial shares underperformed the S&P 500 earlier today
as Moody’s Investors Service is reviewing 17 banks and
securities firms with global capital markets operations.  Banks Rebound  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  rose 2.2 percent as all of its 24
companies gained. The gauge fell as much as 0.6 percent earlier
today. Bank of America added 4 percent to $8.09. Morgan Stanley
rose 1.2 percent to $19.19, after tumbling as much as 4 percent.  Twenty-nine out of 30 companies in the Dow gained today.
Microsoft jumped 4.1 percent, the most in the Dow, to $31.29.
The shares rose to the highest price since April 2010. S&P is
likely to increase Microsoft’s  weighting  in the S&P 500 by about
12 percent later this year because Chairman Bill Gates’s stock
sales are increasing the amount of shares available for public
trading, Adam Holt, an analyst at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , wrote in a
report today.  GM surged 9 percent to $27.17. North America earnings
before interest and taxes more than  tripled  for the year to
$7.19 billion. The automaker’s Europe business, including the
Opel brand, lost $747 million for the year.  New Customers  NetApp rallied 7.2 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$42.74. The maker of data-storage products said revenue in the
third quarter was $1.57 billion, above the average analyst
estimate of $1.56 billion. The company said it won a record
number of new customers and significantly increased the amount
of units shipped.  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  surged 5.8 percent to $29.20.  Carl Icahn 
offered to pay $30 a share in cash and give stockholders the
right to collect an additional $7 a share if any other bidder
tries to buy the oil-refining company.  Even with the stock’s  24 percent  gain since Icahn disclosed
an investment in January, a buyer could offer about a 40 percent
premium and still purchase CVR at the lowest valuation relative
to earnings of any takeover greater than $500 million in the
U.S. oil refining and marketing industry, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Icahn, CVR’s biggest investor, urged the
company this week to put itself up for sale.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  sank 2.5 percent to $179.93. The world’s
largest Web retailer fell after Morgan Stanley downgraded the
stock, citing competition from Apple Inc. and the decline of
traditional media such as CDs and video games.  Folgers Coffee  J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM)  slumped 8.4 percent to $71.60. The maker
of Folgers coffee forecast 2012 earnings excluding some items of
$4.65 a share at most. On average, the analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated profit of $5.  A gauge of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes dropped 0.8 percent.
PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
declined 1.8 percent to $8.87. The shares retreated after  David
Goldberg , an analyst at UBS AG, cut the rating to “neutral”
from “buy,” citing valuation concern.  Price swings by the S&P 500 have narrowed to a nine-month
low following the measure’s biggest rally to start a year since
1997. The distance between its intraday low and high has
averaged 0.86 percent since Feb. 2, a 10-day level last seen on
May 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Volatility (SPX)  has diminished after the S&P 500 advanced 6.8
percent in 2012. When the 10-day average swing was this low in
May, the index had just peaked on April 29 and went on to  slump 
19 percent through October. The current narrowing signals the
rally may be running out of steam, said  Katie Stockton , chief
market technician at Greenwich, Connecticut-based MKM Partners.  “It reflects a loss of momentum, which had been very
strong until last week,” Stockton wrote in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
