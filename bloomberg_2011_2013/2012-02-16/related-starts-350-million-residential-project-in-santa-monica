A unit of Related Cos., the
developer of  Manhattan ’s Time Warner Center, started
construction on a $350 million residential project near the
 Santa Monica , California, oceanfront.  The Village at Santa Monica will encompass 158 luxury
condominiums and 160 income-restricted rental apartments as well
as retail, restaurants and pedestrian plazas, Related California
said today in a statement.  The project, expected to be finished in January 2014, will
be the first large residential development on Santa Monica’s
Ocean Avenue since 1994, when a 31-unit building was completed,
according to Karen Diehl, a Related spokeswoman. The area has
been home to revitalization efforts including the $55 million
Palisades Garden Walk & Town Square recreation area, slated for
completion next year.  Santa Monica Place , an outdoor shopping
center, reopened in August 2010 after a $265 million makeover.  “The Santa Monica submarket has held up better than any
other market in Southern  California ,” Related California
President William Witte said in a telephone interview. “Santa
Monica reads more like  San Francisco  and Silicon Valley. It has
the Bay Area-type job growth in social media, entertainment and
technology, and it’s located at the coast.”  Starting prices for the condos will be about $700,000 to
$800,000, Diehl said. The rental units will be limited to
tenants whose incomes are below 60 percent of the local median,
which is currently $50,580 for a family of four, she said.  Resmark Cos. , based in Los Angeles, is working with Related
on the condominiums, while  Community Corp. of Santa Monica  is
its partner on the rental portion.  Wells Fargo & Co.  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBC)  provided a $172
million construction loan for the project. About $120 million of
the debt will be used for the condo portion, with the remainder
for the apartments, Witte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
