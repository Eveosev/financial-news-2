Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
country’s second-biggest lender by market value, gained the most
in almost two months after declaring a special divided and
announcing profit excluding one-time items increased.  The stock surged 4.8 percent to 13 shillings by the close
of trading in Nairobi, the most since Dec. 21, 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares gained as much as 12
percent today, the biggest intraday increase in almost a year.  “There are a lot of retail investors who are not too well
informed about the fundamentals of the business and mostly focus
on the dividend,” Renaldo d’Souza, a research analyst with
Genghis Capital Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi.  Barclays said it would pay a special dividend of 0.6
shillings per share in addition to a final dividend of 0.7
shillings. Including the company’s previously announced interim
dividend, the total  payout for the year increased by 10 percent
to 1.50 shillings per share, it said.  Full-year profit fell 24 percent to 8.07 billion shillings
after a one-time gain of 2.78 billion shillings a year earlier
wasn’t repeated, according to the bank. Excluding the gain and
taxes, profit rose 11 percent to 12 billion shillings, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
