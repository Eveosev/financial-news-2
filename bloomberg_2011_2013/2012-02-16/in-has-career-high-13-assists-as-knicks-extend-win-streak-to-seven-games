Jeremy Lin had a career-high 13
assists as the  New York Knicks  beat the Sacramento Kings 100-85
to extend their win streak to seven games.  Lin, who left the game near the end of the third quarter,
contributed 10 points as seven Knicks players scored at least
that many at Madison Square Garden in New York tonight. Landry Fields had 15 points and 10 rebounds while Bill Walker and
reserve Steve Novak each contributed 14 for the Knicks (15-15),
who hit 51 percent of their field goal attempts.  “It’s crazy,” Lin said in an on-court interview as the
crowd cheered “MVP.” “Thank you for the energy as always.”  Harvard University graduate Lin last night became the only
player to score more than 20 points and win each of his first
five starts since the  National Basketball Association  merged
with the American Basketball Association in 1976.  Lin, 23, wasn’t drafted after graduation from Harvard and
was cut by two NBA teams before being signed by the Knicks on
Dec. 27.  During their 8-15 start, the Knicks used  Toney Douglas ,
Iman Shumpert and  Mike Bibby  at point guard before turning to
Lin.  The 6-foot-3 Lin scored 28 points in his first career start
against the  Utah Jazz  on Feb. 6 and then had 23 points and 10
assists in a win against Washington two days later. He
contributed a career-high 38 points against the  Los Angeles
Lakers  on Feb. 10, had 20 points against Minnesota the following
day. Last night, he hit the winning three-pointer in the final
second in Toronto and totaled 27 points and 11 assists.  The Knicks, who lost 11 of 13 games prior to the Feb. 4 win
against the Nets, continue their five-game homestand against the
New Orleans Hornets Feb. 17 before hosting the NBA champion
Dallas Mavericks two days later.  Tyreke Evans scored 19 points and DeMarcus Cousins added 15
for the Kings (10-19), who succeeded with 38 percent of their
attempts from the floor. New York had a 54-36 halftime advantage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
