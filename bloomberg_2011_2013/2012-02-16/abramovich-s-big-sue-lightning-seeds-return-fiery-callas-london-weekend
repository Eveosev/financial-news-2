Tyne Daly looks nothing like  Maria Callas , despite her overuse of eyeliner. Yet she delivers a
completely convincing portrait of the superstar who died
heartbroken in Paris in 1977.  By then she had lost her voice and also Ari Onassis, the
unpleasant, rich tycoon who dumped her for Jackie Kennedy.  Terrence McNally’s 1995  “Master Class”  is based on the
diva’s famous workshops at  New York ’s Juilliard School in 1970-
71. As she coaches a trio of students, she often flashes back to
wartime Athens and her mean mom, and snipes at the competition.  At the Vaudeville Theatre, Strand, WC2. Information:

drinks. This tapas venue near the Vaudeville Theatre is popular,
so expect a crowd. Information:  http://www.operatavern.co.uk/  or

him. His daughter Jamie is at the  Barbican  Saturday co-hosting a
“Young People’s Concert” with the visiting New York
Philharmonic. The tribute to New York will include music from
Bernstein’s “West Side Story” and “On the Town.”  In a free foyer event beforehand, you can drop by to meet
New York Philharmonic players and compose your own Big-Apple-
inspired piece.  The Barbican is at Silk Street, EC2Y 8DS. Information:
 http://www.barbican.org.uk  or +44-20-7638-8891.  Saturday Night  The sounds of the soccer-stadium anthem “Three Lions”
will fill Shepherd’s Bush Empire.  The song, regularly reissued for the  World Cup , has lyrics
by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with music by Ian
Broudie, leader of the Lightning Seeds. His Liverpudlian band
has two decades of Broudie-penned pop to choose from, including
hits such as “Pure,” “Sugar Coated Iceberg” and “Perfect.”
Long-term fans will be singing along to every word.  Shepherd’s Bush Empire, Shepherd’s Bush Green, W12 8TT.

nude.  The towering entertainer Leigh Bowery and the snoozing
civil servant Sue Tilley stand out in Freud’s posthumous show at
the  National Portrait Gallery . Tilley’s picture (“Benefits
Supervisor Sleeping,” 1995) sold for a record $33.6 million in
a 2008 auction; the buyer was Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, dealers said. Freud has a field day with the folds
in her flesh, which echo the curve of the sofa.  Don’t miss his exquisite pencil drawing of  Francis Bacon 
(with trousers undone), or his last work, “Portrait of the
Hound” (2011). The latter was unfinished at the time of Freud’s
death and the whippet lying next to the naked male sitter has no
hind legs.  “Lucian Freud Portraits” is at the  National Portrait
Gallery :  http://www.npg.org.uk  or call +44-20-7306-0055.  Nopi, a 10-minute walk from the National Portrait Gallery,
is an all-day brasserie serving small dishes to share from the
 Middle East  and  Asia . Chef Yotam Ottolenghi is known for his
light touch. There’s a good range of fish and vegetarian
options, and plenty for carnivores, too. Information:
