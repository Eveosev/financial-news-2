Rangers administrators said they’ve
been contacted by several groups interested in the bankrupt
Glasgow soccer club.  There have been “several expressions of interest from
parties not connected to the club,” administrator Paul Clark
said today in a televised press conference.  The Scottish defending champion entered a form of
bankruptcy two days ago. Clark and David Whitehouse of
administrators Duff and Phelps are overseeing the operations and
are talking with U.K. tax authorities to end a dispute over
unpaid bills.  Clark said the team won’t be closed as a result of the
bankruptcy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
