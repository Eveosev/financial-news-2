Technip SA (TEC) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, reported a 33 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit and said new discoveries will bolster the
business in the coming year. The shares advanced to a record.  Net income  rose to 149.5 million euros ($195 million) from
112.2 million euros a year before, Paris-based Technip said in a
statement today. Sales gained 14 percent to 2.01 billion euros.  “Technip reported a strong set of results, some 14 percent
above our expectations,” said  Bertrand Hodee , an analyst at
Kepler Capital Markets in Paris.  The company advanced 2 percent to 79.80 euros in Paris, the
highest since its initial public offering in 1994, giving it a
market value of 8.9 billion euros.  “We continue to see opportunities in nearly all the
markets in which we operate,” Chief Executive Officer Thierry Pilenko said on a conference call. Management will recommend a
dividend increase of 9 percent to 1.58 euros a share, he said.  Higher  oil prices  spurred exploration spending, increasing
demand for Technip products such as flexible offshore pipelines.
The company, which announced a plan to expand in  Brazil  a year
ago, said on Feb. 8 it had won a five-year order from  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  to supply $2.1 billion of the pipes.  Technip is seeking revenue of 7.65 billion to 8 billion
euros in 2012, with a subsea operating margin of 15 percent and
the one for onshore-offshore of 6 percent to 7 percent. The
subsea margin was 16.4 percent in the fourth quarter, compared
with 16.2 percent a year earlier. The combined onshore-offshore
margin was 6.5 percent, up from 5.9 percent a year earlier.  The company had an order backlog of 10.42 billion euros at
the end of 2011, compared with 10.12 billion euros at the end of
September. The fourth-quarter order intake was 2.24 billion
euros, compared with 2.47 billion euros the prior year. Europe’s
largest oilfield-services company is Italy’s  Saipem SpA. (SPM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
