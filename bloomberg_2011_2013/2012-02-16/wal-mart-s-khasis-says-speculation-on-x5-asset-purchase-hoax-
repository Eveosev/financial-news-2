Speculation that  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  may acquire a Russian hypermarket chain is a “hoax,” said
Lev Khasis, a senior vice president and chief leverage officer
at the U.S. retailer.  “Wal-Mart doesn’t have any short-term plans to enter the
Russian market,” Khasis said today by phone, responding to a
report yesterday in  Delovoy Peterburg  newspaper that Wal-Mart
may buy hypermarket chain Karusel from  X5 Retail Group NV. (FIVE)  “We
currently have different priorities.”  Wal-Mart hasn’t had any negotiations with X5, said Khasis,
who was chief executive officer of X5, Russia’s biggest food
retailer by revenue, before being hired by Wal-Mart last year.
Svetlana Vitkovskaya, an X5 spokeswoman in Moscow, said
yesterday that the companies aren’t in talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
