Icade SA, (ICAD)  the company that plans to
become  France ’s largest publicly traded office landlord, said
profit before items rose 28 percent last year as completions
rose at its homebuilding unit.  Earnings excluding disposals and one-time items, known as
net current cash flow, increased to 223.5 million euros ($293
million), or 4.32 euros a share, the Paris-based company said
today in a statement. A year earlier, Icade earned 175 million
euros, or 3.43 euros a share.  Icade predicted “strong growth” in 2011 net current cash
flow a year ago as it completed construction of apartments and
homes pre-sold in 2010. The company plans to make a share offer
next month for Silic SA, a landlord specialized in business
parks in the Paris region, to become the country’s biggest
office owner. Today it completed the next step in forming a
venture with Groupama SA, Silic’s largest shareholder, that will
own the largest stake in Icade following the takeover.  Icade fell 12 cents to 62.23 euros in Paris. The stock has
gained 6.5 percent in the past three months, compared with more
than a 10 percent gain for an index of French REITs compiled by
Amsterdam-based Global Property Research.  In October, Icade said reservations and pre-sales of
apartments and houses slowed in the first nine months as less-
attractive tax breaks reduced demand from buyers of rental
homes.  Icade forecast that net current  cash flow  will grow by more
than 10 percent this year, fueled by its homebuilding arm and
rental income from property investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
