The Australian dollar rose for a
second day versus the dollar after the nation’s payrolls
increased by the most in more than a year.  New Zealand ’s dollar fluctuated against the dollar after
data showed the nation’s manufacturing industry grew at a slower
pace last month. The Aussie gained after German newspaper Die
Welt reported that the  European Central Bank  is exchanging Greek
bonds for new securities, easing concern that  Greece  will get
its second bailout.  “It looks less and less likely that we’ll see a further
rate cut” by the  Reserve Bank  of Australia, said Kara Ordway, a
foreign-exchange strategist at City Index Asia Pacific in
Sydney. “Going forward over the next 12 months, I’d expect the
Australian dollar to remain strong. Everything is pointing in
its favor.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.7 percent to $1.0770 at 1:17 p.m.
New York time. The currency surged 1.3 percent to 84.92 yen. New
Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 83.27 U.S. cents. It rose
0.6 percent to 65.73 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped 1 percent and the
S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials gained 0.6 percent after a
report the ECB is swapping its 50 billion-euro ($66 billion)
Greek government bond holdings for new Greek bonds. Die Welt
reported citing unidentified central bank officials said the
swap will be completed by Feb. 20, it said. An ECB spokesman
declined to comment on the report.  Australia ’s currency climbed after the nation’s statistics
bureau said  payrolls  increased by 46,300 last month, the most
since November 2010. The median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News was for a gain of 10,000 jobs. The
 unemployment rate  slid to 5.1 percent, whereas analysts had
forecast an increase to 5.3 percent.  Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business New Zealand said
today that the Performance of Manufacturing Index fell to 50.5
last month from a revised 51.6 in December. A reading of more
than 50 indicates that manufacturing is expanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
