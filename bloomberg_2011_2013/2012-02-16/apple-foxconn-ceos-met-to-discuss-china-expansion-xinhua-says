Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Chief Executive Officer
 Tim Cook  met with Terry Gou, chairman of its major supplier
Foxconn Technology Group, on Feb. 13, to discuss possible
expansion in China, Xinhua  News Agency  reported.  Gou was accompanying Guo Gengmao, governor of Henan
Province where Foxconn currently has factories making products
for Apple, the state-run news agency reported yesterday. Simon Hsing, spokesman for Foxconn’s Taipei-listed flagship Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., told Bloomberg News today that Gou was
scheduled to take a six-day overseas trip this week and couldn’t
confirm locations or whom he was to meet.  Foxconn employs about 1 million people in China, and has
four locations in the country that manufacture iPads, iPhones
and MacBook laptops for Cupertino, California-based Apple. The
Henan government is seeking closer cooperation with the U.S.
company, and the governor outlined the province’s abundant labor
supply and low logistics costs, Xinhua reported.  Carolyn Wu, a Beijing-based spokeswoman at Apple, didn’t
immediately return calls to her office and mobile phones seeking
comment.  Apple on Feb. 13 said the Washington-based Fair Labor
Association began inspections at Foxconn at its own request as
part of audits of labor conditions at suppliers. Hon Hai
assembles iPads and iPhones, unit  Foxconn Technology Co. (2354)  makes
metal cases for those two devices as well as MacBooks, while
affiliate  Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481)  supplies displays for the iPad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
