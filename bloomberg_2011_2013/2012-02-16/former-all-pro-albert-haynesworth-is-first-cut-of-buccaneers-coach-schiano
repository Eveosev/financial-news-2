Defensive tackle  Albert Haynesworth 
became the first player released by the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
since Greg Schiano was hired as coach last month.  Haynesworth, 30, had been taken by the Buccaneers off
waivers from the New England Patriots in November. The 6-foot-6,
320-pounder started six of seven games for Tampa Bay, making 25
tackles, including two for a loss.  Haynesworth signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with
the  Washington Redskins  in 2009 after being named a first-team
All-Pro selection during the 2007 and 2008 National Football
League seasons.  Schiano, who coached Rutgers University for 11 years, was
hired by the Buccaneers on Jan. 26 to replace Raheem Morris, who
was fired after a 4-12 season. The Buccaneersâ€™ defense allowed
the most points in the NFL last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
