Porsche SE (PAH3) , the maker of the 911
sports car, will introduce a sport-utility vehicle under the
name Macan in 2013.  The vehicle, previously known under the working title
Cajun, will be produced at Porsche’s Leipzig factory and will be
a sportier version of the best-selling Cayenne, the Stuttgart,
Germany-based manufacturer said today in a statement.  “The Macan combines all the characteristics of a sports
car with the advantages of an SUV and is a real Porsche,” sales
chief Bernhard Maier said in the statement.  The vehicle’s name stems from the Indonesian word for
tiger, Porsche said. It will be the carmaker’s fifth model line
after the 911, Boxster roadster, Cayenne, and Panamera four-door
coupe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
