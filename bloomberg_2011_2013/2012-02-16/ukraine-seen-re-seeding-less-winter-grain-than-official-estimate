Ukraine will need to re-seed 2.3
million hectares (5.68 million acres) of winter grain in the
spring after a drought in the fall and winter frosts damaged
crops, UkrAgroConsult said, less than the government’s estimate.  That includes 1.8 million hectares of wheat and 500,000
hectares of barley, the Kiev-based agriculture researcher said
today in e-mailed statement.  Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said on Feb. 10 that Ukraine
would need to re-seed 3.5 million hectares of winter crops,
raising Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk’s December
forecast of 3 million hectares.  The government increased its estimate “without any
apparent reason,” UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
