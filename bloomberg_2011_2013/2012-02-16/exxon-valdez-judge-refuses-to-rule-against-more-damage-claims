Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  failed to persuade
a federal judge to bar the U.S. and Alaskan governments from
pursuing further damage claims related to the 1989 Exxon Valdez
oil spill.  U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland in Anchorage
yesterday refused Exxon’s request to enforce a 1991 agreement,
under which the Irving, Texas-based company paid $900 million to
settle claims over damage to the environment.  “Exxon presently suffers no particular harm,” Holland
wrote in the order. “Its business is not in any fashion
disrupted or impeded because of the uncertainty of a claim by
the governments.”  The Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in 1989, dumping 11
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. Exxon agreed
in 2009 to pay $470 million in interest on a $507.5 million
judgment won by local victims of the spill, including fishermen
and small businesses. That was in addition to the $900 million
civil settlement.  The civil settlement contains a reopener clause that allows
governments to pursue additional damages.  “The possibility of a reopener claim has been ‘on the
table’ since the consent decree was finalized,” Holland wrote.  Oil from the spill is still trapped between layers of sand
on the Alaskan shoreline, according to a study published in
Nature Geoscience in 2010.  The case is  United States of America  v. Exxon Corp. 3:91-
cv-0082, U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska
(Anchorage).  To contact the reporter on this story:
