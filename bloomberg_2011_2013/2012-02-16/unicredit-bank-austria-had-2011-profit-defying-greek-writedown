Unicredit SpA (UCG) ’s Bank Austria unit
will report a profit in 2011 even as it wrote down another 100
million euros ($130 million) on Greek  government bonds  in the
fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer Willibald Cernko said.  Bank Austria, which also manages UniCredit’s eastern
European business, wrote down its Greek government bonds to 20
percent of face value, Cernko told reporters in Vienna today. He
declined to elaborate on the full-year result. Bad debt charges
“developed positively” last year, Cernko said.  The bank’s Hungarian unit also remained profitable in 2011,
a year in which the country’s government forced lenders to
swallow losses on foreign-currency mortgages, Cernko said.  Austrian banks’ “direct” exposure to eastern  Europe  is
about 110 billion euros, Cernko said. That number includes the
banks’ funding to subsidiaries, cross-border lending by the
banks’ parents and the equity invested in the region, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
