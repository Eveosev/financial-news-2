Mylan Inc. (MYL)  and a unit of  Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest drugmaker, settled patent litigation
with France’s  Sanofi (SAN)  over a device used to treat severe allergic
reactions.  Sanofi may start selling the device, the Intelliject
epinephrine e-cue auto injector, beginning Nov. 15, according to
the settlement with Pfizer’s Meridian Medical Technologies,
Mylan and Pfizer said in a statement today. The sales are
contingent upon final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.  “We are pleased with this settlement,” said Mylan Chief
Executive Officer Heather Bresch. “In addition to our
significant efforts in this area, people with life-threatening
allergic reactions will benefit from more voices in the fight”
against such reactions.  The initial lawsuit was filed in January 2011 in federal
court in Wilmington,  Delaware , by Meridian, which makes the
EpiPen, alleging the Intelliject product would infringe a U.S.
patent. Further terms of the settlement weren’t released.  Mylan is based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, and Pfizer is
based in  New York .  The case is King Pharmaceuticals v. Intelliject Inc.,
11CV65, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).To see the patent, click: 7,794,432  To contact the reporter on this story:
