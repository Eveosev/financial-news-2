Mercantile Bank Holdings Ltd. (MTL)  rose
to a record for a second day after it offered to buy minority
interests in the lender and delist from the Johannesburg stock
exchange, trumping an offer made by  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT)  in June.  The stock jumped as much as 4.2 percent to 50 cents and
traded 2.1 percent higher at the close in Johannesburg, taking
its rise over the past two days to 32 percent.  Mercantile’s board of directors, controlled by  Portugal ’s
Caixa Geral de Depositos SA, offered to buy shares held by
minority shareholders for 52 cents each. Caixa owns 91.75
percent of Mercantile. Last year, the Portuguese bank rejected
Bidvest’s offer to buy Mercantile for 35.5 cents a share.  “They are coming in at quite a premium to that,” Keith
McLachlan, senior equities analyst for small and mid-cap
companies at Thebe Stockbroking Ltd., said by phone. “For the
free float of only 8 or so percent, is it really worthwhile for
Mercantile to be listed from a minority perspective? It’s a very
generous offer and I think it’s logical for the minorities to
take it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
