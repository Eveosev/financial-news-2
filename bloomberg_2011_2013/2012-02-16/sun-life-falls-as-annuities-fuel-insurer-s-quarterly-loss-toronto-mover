Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s
third-largest insurer, fell as much as 3.3 percent after posting
fourth-quarter results that fell short of some analyst
estimates.  Shares of Sun Life dropped 1.8 percent to C$20.51 ($20.51)
at 9:50 a.m. in Toronto trading. Earlier they touched C$20.20,
the biggest one-day decline since Jan. 26.  The insurer had a fourth-quarter net loss of C$525 million,
or 90 cents a share, tied to C$635 million in costs for variable
annuity and segregated fund contracts, Toronto-based Sun Life
reported late yesterday. CIBC World Markets analyst  Robert Sedran  predicted the company to have a 69-cent-a-share loss.  “The messy quarter is a difficult one from which to glean
much information regarding underlying trends,” said Sedran in a
note to clients today.  Michael Goldberg , a Desjardins Securities analyst, put his
rating and target price on Sun Life under review today. He had a
buy rating on the company with a $30 target price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
