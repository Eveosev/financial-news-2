Singapore â€™s middle distillate
stockpiles rose to the highest in more than three months, data
from the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of  middle distillates , a category that
includes gasoil and kerosene, rose 11 percent from the previous
week to 10.79 million barrels in the seven days to Feb. 15,
 International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said
in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies are at the highest
since Oct. 26.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline, fell 13 percent to 10.55 million barrels.
 Residues (SPIVRESD) , a category that includes fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excludes bitumen, rose 1.1 percent to 19.69 million.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
