Israeli inflation-linked bonds rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in more than 13 months,
after a report showed consumer prices in January increased more
than expected as rents and energy costs climbed.  The yield on the CPI-linked bonds due in June 2013 dropped
13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 0.08 percent, the
lowest level since January 2011, at 12:32 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The
one-year breakeven rate, which reflects market expectations for
inflation over the period, rose 13 basis points to 242, the
highest since Aug. 15. That implies an average annual inflation
rate of 2.42 percent.  Consumer prices rose an annual 2 percent compared with a
2.2 percent gain in December, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said late yesterday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey 
of 12 economists was 1.9 percent. Prices were unchanged month on
month versus the median estimate for a 0.2 percent decline in a
Bloomberg  survey  of 10 economists.  “The higher-than-forecast January index was mainly a
result of increases in rental prices and energy costs,” said
Uriel Goren, head of the international clients desk at Tel Aviv-
based DS Securities & Investments. “We are expecting to see
prices on short-term inflation-linked bonds advance today.”  DS Securities, which raised its 12-month inflation estimate
to 2 percent from 1.8 percent, forecasts consumer prices to rise
0.1 percent in February and 0.2 percent in March. The yield on
the 5.5 percent bond due in January 2022 fell two basis points
to 4.54 percent.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, rose one basis point to
2.4 percent. The shekel weakened 0.5 percent to 3.7715 a dollar.
The  Tel-Bond 40 Index  of corporate bonds gained 0.1 percent to
263.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
