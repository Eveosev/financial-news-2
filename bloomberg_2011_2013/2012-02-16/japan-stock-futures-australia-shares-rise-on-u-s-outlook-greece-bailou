Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities rose after U.S. economic reports beat
estimates and optimism increased that  Greece  will get a second
debt bailout, boosting demand for riskier assets.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s
second-largest carmaker by market value that generates 44
percent of its revenue in  North America , rose 1.5 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender by market
value, gained 2.9 percent.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. , Australia’s No. 3 lender, jumped 1.8 percent after
reporting a 4.1 percent increase in underlying profit in the
first quarter.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 9,370 in Chicago yesterday, up from 9,230 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,360 in  Osaka 
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
rose 0.5 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.5
percent in Wellington.  “It’s a distinct improvement from the fourth quarter last
year from the perspective of investor confidence and risk
appetite,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1
billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “The
European news flow still seems to be determining the direction
of the markets. So, when there’s a bit of relief from the
European front, the markets can focus on fundamentals, which
seem to be improving by the day.”  U.S. Data  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index advanced 1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday
after reports showed Americans filed the fewest claims for
jobless benefits since March 2008 and builders broke ground on
more houses than expected.  Manufacturing (OUTFGAF)  in the Philadelphia
region expanded this month at the fastest pace in four months as
orders and sales rose.  Stocks also advanced as three euro-area officials said the
 European Central Bank  is swapping its Greek bonds for new ones
to ensure it isn’t forced to take losses in a debt
restructuring. European governments are mulling over cutting
 interest rates  on emergency loans to Greece and using
contributions from the ECB to plug a new financing gap in the
second bailout program for Athens, two people familiar with the
discussions said.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 10.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8 percent advance by the S&P
500 and an 8.1 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.4 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 and
10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of Chinese equities traded
in the U.S. gained 1.5 percent to a six-month high of 109.09.
The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose to a one-week high as
China Mobile Ltd. and Cnooc Ltd. jumped on speculation of more
monetary easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
