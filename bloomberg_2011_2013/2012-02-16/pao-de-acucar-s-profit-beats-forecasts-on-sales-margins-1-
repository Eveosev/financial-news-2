Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo
Pao de Acucar ,  Brazil ’s biggest retailer, announced fourth-
quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ forecasts as the company
improved profit margins.  Net income rose 43 percent to 361 million reais ($210
million), from 253 million reais in the year-earlier period, Sao
Paulo-based Pao de Acucar said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
The result beat the average estimate of 320 million reais from
six analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Synergies from Pao de Acucar’s integration with Globex
Utilidades SA’s Ponto Frio chain and Casa Bahia Comercial Ltda.,
both acquired in the last two years, had a positive impact on
profitability margins, Banco Bradesco BBI SA analysts Ricardo Boiati, Alan Cardoso and Pedro Bueno wrote in a report to
clients dated Jan. 23. They have an “outperform”
recommendation to the stock.  Margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization increased to 8.2 percent in the quarter, from
6.6 percent in the same period last year.  Consolidated net revenue rose 21 percent to 13.4 billion
reais in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year
ago, while sales in the retailer’s food operations were up 10
percent, according to the statement.  Pao de Acucar shares rose 0.2 percent yesterday to 74.94
reais on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. The shares have risen 12
percent this year, compared with a 17 percent rise in the
 Bovespa (IBOV)  benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
