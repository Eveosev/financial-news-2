Ultra Petroleum Corp. (UPL) , the oil and
natural-gas producer that has doubled production in the past
five years, fell after it cut new drilling investment in half in
response to low gas prices.  Ultra  declined  6 percent to $23.72 at the close in New
York. The shares have dropped 50 percent in the past year.  Ultra will cut spending on development drilling in 2012 to
$650 million, compared with $1.3 billion last year, the Houston-
based company said in a statement today. Total  capital spending 
will decline 38 percent to $925 million this year as the company
completes backlog work.  “It just doesn’t make any sense to grow supply in this
environment,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Watford said during a conference call today.  Gas futures reached $2.231 per million British thermal
units on Jan. 23 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , a 10-year
low. The price has declined 14 percent this year. Ultra will
sell gas at an average of 6 percent to 8 percent below the Nymex
price during the first quarter, before including any hedging
contracts, according to the statement.  Output will increase this year as much as 6 percent, to the
equivalent of 250 billion to 260 billion cubic feet, the company
said. Gas accounted for 91 percent of the  company’s revenue  in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fourth-quarter profit more than tripled to $131.8 million,
or 86 cents a share, from $37.9 million, or 25 cents, a year
earlier, the company said today. Excluding a gain from contracts
used to lock-in commodity prices, per-share earnings were 3
cents less than the average of 20  analysts’ estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
