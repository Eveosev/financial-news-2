There are about 3,500 Somali people
working as pirates, attacking and hijacking vessels in the  Gulf
of Aden  and the  Indian Ocean , according to Wayne Miller, an
official from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  The number of Somalis who have turned to piracy is greater
than the 2,000 figure commonly cited in counter-piracy
campaigns, Miller, who is based in Nairobi,  Kenya , said today at
a conference in London. His estimate was based on talks with
pirates in Somalia last November, when the end of the monsoon
season typically sees attacks rise, Miller said.  “None of them ever heard that if you work as a pirate you
might die, you might get jailed or you might get maimed,”
Miller said. “Somalis want help getting rid of what’s
destroying their country.”  There are an estimated 1,000 Somalis in custody in about 20
countries, said Miller, whose  job  involves visiting African
jails where pirates are jailed and communities in  Somalia . The
UN office’s counter-piracy program, which began in 2009, spans
six countries with a mandate to support the detention and
prosecution of suspects, according to it website.  Somali pirate attacks rose to a record 237 in 2011, with
ransoms worth $160 million paid to release 31 hijacked vessels,
according to a One Earth Future  Foundation  report released last
week.  About 42,450 vessels pass through the region annually, the
foundation said. Of these, 23,000 transit the Gulf of Aden
carrying $1 trillion of trade, the U.K. government estimates.  Piracy cost the shipping industry and governments $6.9
billion last year, including $2.7 billion in extra fuel to speed
up through the area and $1.27 billion on military operations,
according to the foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
