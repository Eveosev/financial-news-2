Corn futures rebounded from a three-
week low on signs of rising demand for supplies from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter. Soybeans fell, and wheat rose.  U.S.  exporters  sold 1.07 million metric tons of corn in the
week ended Feb. 9, the most since October, the government said.
Futures dropped in the past two days on speculation that farmers
this year may plant the most acres since 1944. The U.S. and
 China  will sign a five-year accord to cooperate on farm trade,
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said today.  “Exports have been considerably better on these breaks”
in prices,  Jason Britt , the president of Central States
Commodities  Inc., a brokerage in Kansas City,  Missouri , said in
a telephone interview. “Everyone is talking about this big
acreage to be forthcoming, but you can’t sit here and slam the
price every day when we haven’t raised one bushel yet.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 1.4 percent to settle at
$6.3975 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $6.26, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 25.  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$12.65 a bushel in  Chicago . The price has advanced 4.7 percent
this year on mounting concern that dry weather in  South America 
will erode output.  Some growing areas in  Brazil  may get rain beginning on Feb.
20, Telvent DTN said. U.S. exporters sold 614,654 tons of
soybeans in the week ended Feb. 9, down 6.6 percent from a week
earlier, the Department of Agriculture said.  “Export sales were poor, really disappointing for what was
expected,” Chad Henderson, an analyst at Prime Agricultural
Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin, said in a telephone
interview. “The South American weather forecast is calling for
some rain, so that’s negative.”  Wheat futures for May delivery rose 0.2 percent to $6.3525
a bushel in Chicago.  Egypt , the world’s biggest importer, bought
180,000 tons from the U.S. in a tender today.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
