Johnson & Johnson  and the  University
of Queensland  will co-develop drugs using components of spider
venom as a treatment for chronic pain.  The maker of Ultram painkillers will work with Queensland’s
 Institute of Molecular Bioscience  drug development program, the
university said in a statement. Financial terms of the 12-month
project were not disclosed.  Spider venoms have peptides that may “substantially reduce
or block the pain,”  Richard Lewis , professor at the institute,
said in a phone interview.  Chronic pain occurs when the nervous system continues
giving signals with no stimulus to cause hurt, and affects 1.5
billion people worldwide, according to the  statement . Annual
sales of products using University of Queensland technology and
licensed by its main research commercialization company are
running at A$3 billion ($3.2 billion), it said.  The project team includes Paul Alewood and Glenn King, who
has  studied spider toxins  for more than a decade. Johnson and
Johnson’s  Corporate Office of Science and Technology  will be
involved in the project, according to the statement.  An estimated $560 billion is lost annually in the U.S. due
to healthcare costs and reduced productivity related to chronic
pain, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
