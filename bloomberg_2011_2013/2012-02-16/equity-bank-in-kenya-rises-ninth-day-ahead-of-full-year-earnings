     Feb. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Equity Bank Ltd.,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by market value, gained for a ninth day, its longest
winning streak in almost three years, on speculation full-year
earnings will grow.  The stock advanced as much as 3.2 percent before paring its
rise to 0.5 percent at 19 shillings, the longest stretch of
gains since March 18, 2009, at the close of trading in Nairobi.  “It is in anticipation of the release of the full year
results; guys are expecting very good results,” Caleb Mutai, an
analyst at Nairobi-based Tsavo Securities Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  Profit before taxes could rise to as much as 12 billion
shillings ($144.4 million), Mutai said. For the year ending Dec.
31, 2010, the lender announced a pretax profit of 8.95 billion
shillings.  Five analysts forecast profit before taxes will grow,
ranging from 9.38 billion shillings by Exotix Ltd. to 13.6
billion shillings by African Alliance Kenya Securities Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
