Zimbabwean Mines Minister  Obert Mpofu  said there had been no human rights abuses in the
country’s Marange diamond fields.  “You won’t find any graves here, there are no human rights
violations,” Mpofu told reporters today at the site.  The minister said he hadn’t yet decided whether to allow
civil society observers to visit the gem-rich area in eastern
 Zimbabwe , denying an earlier report on the state-owned Zimbabwe
Broadcasting Corp. that cited him as saying they would be
barred.  “I received their application last night and I’ll look at
it, but they boycotted a Kimberley Process meeting in the
Democratic Republic of Congo,” Mpofu said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
