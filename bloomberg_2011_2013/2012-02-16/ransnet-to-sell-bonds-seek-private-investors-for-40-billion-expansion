Transnet SOC Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
state-owned rail company, may sell bonds and seek private
investors to operate some of its railways to fund a 300 billion
rand ($38 billion) expansion program.  The government wants to boost participation of investors to
“test how on a bigger scale this can be supportive of a massive
capex program,” Raisibe Lepule, deputy director-general at the
Department of Public Enterprises, said in a phone interview from
Cape Town today.  President  Jacob Zuma  last week announced that Transnet
plans to expand capacity to export coal,  iron ore  and other
metals to help stimulate the economy and create jobs. Public
Enterprises Minister  Malusi Gigaba  said on Feb. 14 that Transnet
will fund two-thirds of the spending from its own balance sheet.  The government is also considering a request from  South
African Airways , the national carrier for 4 billion rand to 6
billion rand in funding to buy new planes and add routes in
Africa, Lepule said. SAA will probably post a loss this year
because of high fuel costs and a decline in passenger numbers.  “It’s not a bail out,” Lepule said. “It’s funding for
their growth program.”  Africa’s biggest economy may expand less than 3 percent
this year, below the 7 percent level the government says is
needed to cut the  unemployment rate  to 14 percent by 2020. The
jobless rate of 23.9 percent is the highest of 61 countries
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
