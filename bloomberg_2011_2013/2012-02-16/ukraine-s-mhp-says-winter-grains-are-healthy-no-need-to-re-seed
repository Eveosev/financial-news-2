Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA (MHPC) , a
Ukrainian poultry producer, said its winter grain plants are
“physiologically healthy” and the company plans no re-seeding
of winter grains.  MHP planted winter wheat on 45,283 hectares for the 2012
harvest, the Kiev-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The company probably will have a good wheat harvest this
year, it said. MHP planted winter wheat on the Crimean
Peninsula, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy and Ivano-Frankivsk regions.
Plants were protected by snow pack of between 10 centimeters to
25 centimeters, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
