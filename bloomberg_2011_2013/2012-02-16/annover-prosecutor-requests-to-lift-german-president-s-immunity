The Hannover prosecutor’s office
requested lifting the immunity of German President  Christian Wulff , DPA reported, citing a statement from the prosecutor.  The prosecutor submitted a request to the president of the
Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament, DPA said.
German lawmakers have to approve lifting Wulff’s immunity before
prosecutors can start investigating, DPA said.  Wulff has been under pressure for weeks over his failure to
reveal a private home loan provided by a businessman’s wife in
2008 and his attempt to block a German newspaper from reporting
about it last month.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
