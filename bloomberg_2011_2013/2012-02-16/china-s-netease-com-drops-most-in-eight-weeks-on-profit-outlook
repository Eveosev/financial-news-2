NetEase.com Inc. (NTES) , which runs the
second-largest online games website in  China , dropped the most
in eight weeks as analysts forecast adjusted net income to
decline in the first quarter from the previous three months.  American depositary receipts of NetEase sank 5.5 percent to
$47.89 at 11:32 a.m. in New York, the most intraday since Dec.
21.  Adjusted net income at Beijing-based NetEase will be $138.1
million in the first quarter this year, according to the  average
estimate  of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That compares
with $151.9 million in the previous three months.  Fourth-quarter net income rose 26 percent from a year
earlier to 898.6 million yuan ($142.8 million), NetEase said in
a statement issued after trading closed yesterday in the U.S.  Ten analysts maintained their  recommendations  of “buy” or
“outperform” on the shares of NetEase, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
