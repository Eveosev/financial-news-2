Banks (SX7P)  should be forced to pay into
government funds that would be tapped to reimburse depositors at
failed lenders, under plans approved in a vote by European Union
lawmakers today.  The measures are part of a draft law that the EU intends
will bolster protection of savers and prevent bank runs such as
that experienced by  Northern Rock Plc (NRK)  in 2007.  The draft law would shield a depositor from losses on
savings of as much as 100,000 euros ($130,000) and set, from
2017, a reimbursement deadline of one week.  Governments should manage bank-funded reserves equivalent
to 1.5 percent of protected deposits, according to proposals
approved by the European Parliament, voting in Strasbourg.  Banks (SX7P) 
judged by regulators to be most at risk of failure would be
forced to pay higher annual contributions into the funds than
other lenders.  Today’s vote will be parliament’s negotiating position on
the draft law, which must be agreed on with national governments
before it can enter into force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
