The Orthodox Church of  Greece  paid
12.6 million euros ($16.4 million) in taxes to the state last
year, the Holy Synod of Bishops said in a statement on  its
website  today.  The church is taxed like all non-profit organizations in
Greece, according to a separate statement posted on its website
on Sept. 15. Taxes paid by the Church include a 20 percent levy
on income from real-estate rentals, a 0.3 percent tax on all
property that isnâ€™t used for educational, worship or community
purposes and regular levies on wages for staff, according to the
 Sept. 15  statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
