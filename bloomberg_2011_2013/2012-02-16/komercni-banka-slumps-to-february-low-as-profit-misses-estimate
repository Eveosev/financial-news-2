Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, declined to the lowest in two weeks after
fourth-quarter profit and the company’s proposed dividend missed
estimates.  The stock slid as much as 5.4 percent before paring losses
to 2.4 percent at 3,590 koruna by its 4:24 p.m. close in Prague.
Turnover was 174,344 shares, or almost double the daily average
over the past three months. The  PX (PX)  equity gauge, where Komercni
has a 17 percent weighting, dropped 1.1 percent today.  Net income fell to 2.43 billion koruna ($125 million) from
3.37 billion koruna a year earlier after a 1.06 billion-koruna
impairment charge on Greek bonds, the bank said today. That
missed the 3.09 billion-koruna median estimate from 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Komercni proposed to pay a dividend from
2011 profit of 160 koruna, down from 270 koruna a year earlier.
That compares with a 220 koruna  forecast  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Overall, we consider the results slightly negative,”
Milan Lavicka, an analyst at Prague-based J&T Banka AS, wrote in
a report to clients today. “The proposed dividend of 160 koruna
per share is disappointing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
