Belarus’s trade deficit in goods
 narrowed  to $5.45 billion in 2011, a 43 percent decrease from a
year earlier, the state statistics committee said.  Exports of goods to European Union countries grew the
fastest, more than doubling to $15.7 billion last year, the
committee said on its website today. That compares with an 18
percent decline in Belarusian exports to the EU in 2010.  Russia was Belarus’s main trade partner last year,
accounting for 45 percent of the former Soviet republic’s
foreign trade, according to the committee. Potash fertilizer and
petroleum products were the main export items last year, while
natural gas and crude oil comprised the biggest share of
imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
