NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) ,  Japan ’s biggest
mobile phone carrier, plans to spend about 1.5 times annual
profit to strengthen its network as it relies on a surge in
smartphone use to end a four-year decline in revenue.  The company may raise  capital outlays  to about 730 billion
yen ($9.3 billion) in the 12 months starting April 1, from a
previous plan for 700 billion yen, Chief Financial Officer
Kazuto Tsubouchi said in a Feb. 14 interview in Tokyo. The
company is maintaining its target to increase operating profit
3.4 percent to 900 billion yen in the next fiscal year, he said,
without elaborating.  DoCoMo is adding wireless capacity as more of its 58
million users stream or download video, swelling an onslaught of
data that in January contributed to a fifth service disruption
in eight months. Revenue from data transmission has  exceeded 
that for voice at the carrier since the three months ended March
31, 2011, according to figures from the company.  “Traffic is increasing beyond their initial expectation,”
said Atsuo Takahashi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Co.
“DoCoMo is lagging behind the most in dealing with network
capacity among carriers, considering the number of subscribers
they have.”  KDDI Corp. (9433) , DoCoMo’s biggest rival, said on Dec. 15 it
would spend 440 billion yen next fiscal year to expand capacity,
while  Softbank Corp. (9984) , the No. 3 carrier, said in October it
planned outlays of 500 billion yen.  KDDI was this month told by the communications ministry to
improve its service after as many as 6.2 million users were
unable to send or receive e-mails for some time on Feb. 11.  Reviving Revenue  More than half of wireless-service subscribers will use
smartphones by March 2015, Tokyo-based MM Research Institute
Ltd.  forecast  in July. They made up 8.8 percent of total 109
million accounts in March last year, the researcher said.  Rising smartphone use may help DoCoMo boost revenue this
fiscal year for the first time since 2007, according to analyst
estimates. Revenue is projected to gain 1 percent to 4.27
trillion yen in the year ending March 31, according to the
average of  20 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The carrier had cash, near cash and short-term investments
of about  907 billion yen  as of March 31, the highest at fiscal
year-end since 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Equipment makers also stand to benefit from DoCoMo’s
spending to keep up with the tide of data.  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) ,  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  and Alcatel-Lucent are
among the telecommunications gear makers supplying the company,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fujitsu is counting on
DoCoMo for about 10.5 billion yen of its fourth quarter revenue,
according to  Bloomberg estimates .  Shares Slump  DoCoMo shares rose 0.2 percent to 137,000 yen at the close
of trading in Tokyo. The stock has declined 14 percent over the
past 12 months, compared with a 13 percent drop for the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  The carrier has  forecast  net income of 474 billion in the
year ending March 31, compared with 490 billion yen in the
previous year.  Japan’s communications ministry  last month  ordered DoCoMo
to report measures taken to expand its network capacity by March
30 after a service disruption on Jan. 25 that affected as many
as 2.5 million users.  The planned improvements include installing new servers for
text messaging, expanding data capacity and inspecting all
equipment, DoCoMo said last month. Voice and data services on
DoCoMo’s network were interrupted for more than four hours on
Jan. 25, because of a surge in wireless traffic on the company’s
switching equipment, the company said that day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
