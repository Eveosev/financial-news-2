SKB d.d., a Slovenian unit of
 Societe Generale SA (GLE) , said profit last year dropped 13 percent as
increasing bad loans eroded the country’s lenders’ income.  The bank reported net income of 24.4. million euros ($32
million) for 2011 compared with 28.2 million euros in the
previous year, the Ljubljana-based lender said in a  statement  to
the city stock exchange today. The bank increased its market
share for loans to households and attracted more deposits.  Loans to households advanced 7 percent with the market
share in the segment increasing to 11 percent. Deposits gained
7.6 percent with the market share in the segment advancing to
7.3. percent, the bank said.  Slovenian banks put aside 1.1 billion euros in 2011 due to
asset writedowns and bad-loan reserves, a 35.4 percent increase
from a year earlier, the central bank said Feb. 7. The move
pushed the after-tax loss of the banking industry to 356 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
