Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest wind-turbine maker, will propose Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications AB Chief Executive Officer Bert Nordberg as
chairman when the incumbent, Bent Erik Carlsen, steps down.  The company also nominated Lars Olof Josefsson, a former
president of Sandvik Group’s mining and construction unit, as
its deputy chairman and  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ’s Eija Pitkanen as a
board member, Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas said in a statement
today to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The three need to be
elected at Vestas’s annual general meeting March 29.  Vestas is reeling from two downgrades to sales and margins
forecasts in three months and the departures announced last week
of Carlsen, Deputy Chairman Torsten Erik Rasmussen, board member
Freddy Frandsen and Chief Financial Officer Henrik Norremark.
The shares are down 17 percent this year and more than 50
percent since it first cut 2011 sales forecasts in October.  Nordberg, born in 1956, “brings strong experience from
reorganizing a global high-tech company with 7,000 employees
through a crisis while simultaneously developing the product
portfolio and increasing sales volumes,” Vestas said in today’s
statement.  -- Editors:  Alex Devine , Amanda Jordan  To contact the reporters on this story:
