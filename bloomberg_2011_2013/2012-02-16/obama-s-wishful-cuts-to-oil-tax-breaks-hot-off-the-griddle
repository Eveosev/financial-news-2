Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. President  Barack Obama ’s 2013 budget proposes  $40 billion  in cuts to fossil fuel credits. Sounds like a lot. The reductions would take place over the next decade, so it's really about $4 billion a year, or about 1 percent of oil & gas revenues. The subsidies are so convoluted, it's difficult to tell exactly how much the fossil fuel industries currently receive. The Environmental Law Institute found U.S. taxpayers chipped in more than $10 billion a year from 2002 to 2008. A  Bloomberg New Energy Finance  analysis in November showed world governments gave six times the subsidies to gasoline, coal and natural gas that they gave to wind, solar and biofuels. That came to $409 billion in fossil fuel subsidies to many of the world's most profitable companies. The generosity isn't likely to change in a divided U.S. Congress, in an election year.
