 The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development approved a 28.5 million-euro ($37
million) sovereign loan to Brcko in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina
to support road construction.  The 15-year loan, with a three-year grace period, will be
used to build a 19 kilometer (12 mile) circular road around the
town and connect the main east-west route in northern Bosnia
currently passing through the town center, the London-based
lender said on its website.  The total cost of the project is estimated at 45 million
euros. Local authorities will provide 16 million euros and the
EBRD will add a 500,000-euro grant from the Western Balkans
Investment Framework as technical assistance for the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
