Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) , owner
of the namesake cable-television channel and Animal Planet,
reported a 76 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit as
advertising and subscription revenue increased.  Net income climbed to $336 million, or 86 cents a share,
from $191 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier, the  Silver
Spring , Maryland-based company said today in a statement.  Discovery makes about  half  of total revenue from fees paid
by cable- and satellite-TV providers to distribute its channels,
with most of the rest coming from ads. The company is also part
owner of  Oprah Winfrey ’s OWN cable network, which has struggled
in the ratings. OWN averaged 216,000 prime-time viewers last
week, down 39 percent from the beginning of this year, according
to Nielsen data.  Discovery  dropped  1.8 percent to $44.94 at the close in  New
York . The stock has risen 9.7 percent this year, compared with
an 8 percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The company forecast 2012 revenue of $4.45 billion to
$4.58 billion. Analysts projected $4.47 billion, the average of
20  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Domestic ad sales rose 13 percent to $364 million in the
quarter, helped by higher ratings and more advance selling of ad
spots, known as “upfronts,” Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said on a conference call today.  Outperformed Peers  “Their national business grew better than expected,”
media analyst  David Joyce  of Miller Tabak & Co. said after the
earnings report. Joyce rates the shares “buy” and doesn’t own
any.  Discovery’s ad sales have outperformed its peers’,
according to  Paul Sweeney , media analyst for Bloomberg
Industries, “driven primarily by stronger ratings across the
board, including some of the developing networks, such as ID.”  Fourth-quarter revenue advanced 11 percent to $1.12
billion. Analysts estimated $1.11 billion on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
