The Slovenian competition regular
ruled that  Telekom Slovenije (TLSG)  Group d.d. violated competition
rules, the state-owned phone company said.  Telekom was offering its mobile retail price plan at
“unfair sales prices, because the incremental revenue from this
price plan was lower than the incremental costs incurred by the
company, which caused the possibility of pushing competitors out
of the market,” the Ljubljana-based company said in a  statement 
to the city stock exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
