Washington Mutual Inc. (WM) , the former
owner of the biggest U.S. bank to fail, began a court hearing on
a $7 billion reorganization plan that pays bondholders in full.  WaMu will try to resolve a conflict among shareholders
caused by a group of investors who voted against the proposed
reorganization plan. That vote by a minority of preferred
shareholders may make it impossible for common shareholders to
receive stock in the only part of WaMu that would survive the
bankruptcy.  The hearing today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington,
 Delaware , is WaMu’s third attempt to win court approval for its
reorganization plan, which would pay $7 billion to creditors.
That plan, which includes a settlement endorsed by a committee
of preferred and common shareholders, would give the shares’
owners new stock in the only part of the company to survive.  In court papers, WaMu outlined a legal strategy designed to
ensure that common shareholders collect something. WaMu said
that at least part of the “no” vote should be discounted
because it was cast by creditors who have “a bad-faith ulterior
motive.”  WaMu, based in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 26,
2008, the day after its banking unit was taken over by
regulators and sold to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  for $1.9 billion.
Washington Mutual Bank had more than 2,200 branches and $188
billion in deposits.  The bankruptcy case is In re  Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ) ,
08-12229, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  -- Editors: Fred Strasser, Glenn Holdcraft  To contact the reporter on this story:
