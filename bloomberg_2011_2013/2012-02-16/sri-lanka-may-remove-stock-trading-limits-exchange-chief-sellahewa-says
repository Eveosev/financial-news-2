Sri Lanka  may remove a 10 percent
price trading limit on some stocks listed on the  Colombo Stock
Exchange , according to its chief executive officer.  The bourse planned to introduce a “transparent, Sri Lanka-
centric” volatility management mechanism, CEO Surekha Sellahewa
said by phone today, without giving a timeframe.  Stocks identified using a formula designed by the exchange
are restricted from rising or falling more than 10 percent from
their previous closing levels. The Securities and Exchange
Commission of Sri Lanka imposed the price caps in September 2010
to curb speculative trading following the end of a civil war
against Tamil rebels in 2009. The Colombo All-Share Index surged
125 percent that year and 96 percent in 2010.  “We have recommended to the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it can go off if broker credit is managed,”
Sellahewa said. “It was brought in at a time when market
volatility was out of control.”  The Colombo  gauge  has slumped 13 percent in 2012, the most
among 93 major gauges tracked by Bloomberg, as the central bank
raised  interest rates , while the government scrapped a currency
trading band against the dollar to help preserve its foreign-
exchange reserves. The government also raised petroleum prices
last weekend, fanning speculation inflation will quicken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
