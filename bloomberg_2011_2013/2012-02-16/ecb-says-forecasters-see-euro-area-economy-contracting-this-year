The  European Central Bank  said
professional forecasters expect the euro-area economy to
contract this year, slashing their projections.  Forecasters predict gross domestic product will decline 0.1
percent in 2012, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in its monthly
bulletin today, citing a quarterly survey. Three months ago,
forecasters expected 0.8 percent growth. The 17-nation economy
will expand 1.1 percent in 2013, less than the 1.6 percent
forecast in November, the survey showed.  In December, the ECB forecast economic growth of 0.3
percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2013. It will publish new
projections in March.  Euro-area GDP declined 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of
2011, the European statistics office in Luxembourg said
yesterday. That was less than the 0.4 percent drop forecast by
economists as better-than-predicted performances in Germany and
 France  helped mitigate the region’s first contraction since
2009.  There are “tentative signs of a stabilization in economic
activity at low levels,” the ECB said today, echoing President
 Mario Draghi ’s Feb. 9 policy statement. While “the economic
outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and downside
risks,” the ECB dropped a January reference to the risks being
“substantial.”  European services and factory output increased in January
for the first time in five months, according to a composite
index of both industries.  Professional forecasters raised their 2012 inflation
projection to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent, the survey showed.
They lowered their 2013 projection to 1.7 percent from 1.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
