The Philippine peso weakened to a
two-week low after European leaders deferred discussions on a
financial rescue package for  Greece , sapping demand for
emerging-market assets.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks fell the most in the
week after euro-area finance ministers postponed to Feb. 20 a
meeting on 130 billion euros ($169 billion) of aid for Greece.
Ten-year  government bonds  advanced for a third day, pushing
yields to a record low. A central bank report showed yesterday
that remittances increased at a slower pace in December.  “We keep seesawing from fears to hopes for a resolution in
 Europe ,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president and head
of financial markets at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “Greece
is the main topic for now.”  The peso lost 0.5 percent to 42.835 per dollar as of 4:00
p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It fell to
42.935 earlier, its lowest level since Feb. 1.  Money sent home by Philippine citizens living abroad rose
6.2 percent in December from a year earlier to $1.8 billion,
compared with a 10.6 percent gain the previous month, according
to the central bank.  The yield on the government’s 6.375 percent bonds due
January 2022 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
4.895 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. That
is the lowest level since the bonds were first sold in July.  “Inflation is no longer a worry, but growth” is, Algarra
said. “The market feels there will be some sort of monetary
easing and this has emboldened people to be more aggressive in
buying bonds.”  Inflation declined to a 13-month low in January, with
consumer prices rising 3.9 percent from a year earlier, a report
showed this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
