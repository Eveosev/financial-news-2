Russia  exported about 250,000 metric
tons of sugar made from domestic beets in 2011, its first year
as a shipper of the sweetener, according to the country’s Sugar
Producers’ Union.  Deliveries went to 15 nations, mainly  Kazakhstan  and nearby
states, and moved by truck, rail and container, Andrei Bodin,
the group’s chairman, said in Moscow today.  Sugar imports into Russia probably will be about 450,000
tons in the current crop year through July, according to Bodin.
Inbound shipments of raw sweetener may be less than 1 million
tons in 2012 for the first time ever, the Moscow-based Institute
for Agricultural Market Studies has said. Imports are unlikely
to reach the million-ton level again, Bodin said.  “Russia left the market as a large importer today,” he
said. Sugar made from Belarusian beets will account for about
200,000 tons of the current season’s imports, with raw sweetener
comprising an equal amount and shipments of premium white, or
refined, sugar coming to about 50,000 tons, according to Bodin.  Sugar production from domestic beets will jump 89 percent
to 5.1 million tons in the current crop year, the chairman said.
Output may be little changed in the coming period, even as beet
sowing falls about 10 percent, as companies move to improve beet
yields and increase refining capacity by 5 percent, he said.  Average beet yields gained 60 percent from a year earlier
to 38.5 tons a hectare (2.47 acres) in 2011, according to
figures from the union.  The average wholesale price of sugar on Russia’s domestic
market will fall to 25.3 rubles (84 cents) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) in 2012 from 28.6 rubles last year, Bodin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
