Ecuador’s President  Rafael Correa 
said the government is negotiating a $1.7 billion loan from
China and that it had scrapped plans for a global bond sale this
year.  Ecuador’s 2012 budget plan is completely financed, Correa
said today at a meeting with the country’s foreign press
association in Quito.  The South American country that has defaulted on foreign
debt twice since 1999 is planning a 2012 budget deficit of $4.23
billion and expects to receive $4.38 billion in loans from
multilateral lenders like the Inter-American Development Bank
and the “friendly” nations of China and Russia, Finance
Minister Patricio Rivera has said.  The government received a loan commitment from China in
December for at least $1 billion, central bank President Pedro Delgado has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
