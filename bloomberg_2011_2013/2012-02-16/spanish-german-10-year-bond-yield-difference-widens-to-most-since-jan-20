Spanish 10-year bonds fell for a
third-straight day, driving the additional yield investors
demand to hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds
to the most since Jan. 20.  The yield on the 10-year Spanish debt rose five basis
points to 5.48 percent at 7:17 a.m. London time. That pushed the
yield spread with benchmark German bunds seven basis points
wider to 365 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
