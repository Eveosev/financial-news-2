A federal judge extended an order
blocking  New York ’s ban on the use of public schools for worship
services.  U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska today granted a request
from the Bronx Household of Faith that will allow its members to
continue meeting in a city public school on Sundays.  The legal battle dates to 1995, when the church sued the
city. The church argued the city was violating the First
Amendment by denying it use of a school while allowing other
community groups access to campuses for their activities.  Last year, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Manhattan,
overturning Preska’s 2007 decision in favor of the church, ruled
that the city may prohibit religious groups from using school
facilities outside of regular school hours for worship services.  Preska has since issued orders allowing churches to worship
at public schools, finding on other legal grounds that they have
a right to do so. The latest ruling came today in a 51-page
opinion.  The case is Bronx Household of Faith v. Board of Education
of the City of New York, 01-cv-08598, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
