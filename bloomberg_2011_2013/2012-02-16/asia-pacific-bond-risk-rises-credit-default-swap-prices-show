The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index jumped 7 basis points to 154
basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The gauge is set for its biggest daily rise since Dec. 9,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 6 basis points
to 151 as of 11:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit Agricole
CIB. That’s on course for the biggest daily increase since Dec.
8 and highest level since Feb. 1, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 5 basis points to 169 basis points
as of 8:36 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices show.
That’s the highest level since Feb. 2, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
