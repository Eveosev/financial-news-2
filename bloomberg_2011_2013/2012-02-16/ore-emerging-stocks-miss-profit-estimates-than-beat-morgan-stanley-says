About 44 percent of companies in
 emerging markets  tracked by Morgan Stanley have missed analysts’
fourth-quarter earnings estimates, compared with 29 percent that
have beaten them.  India, Singapore and Peru are among the top three emerging
and Asian countries that have beaten profit expectations “in
terms of magnitude and breadth,” while South Korea,  Brazil  and
Mexico have the “highest earnings misses,” Morgan Stanley
analysts Jonathan Garner and Pankaj Mataney wrote in a report
dated yesterday. Morgan Stanley reduced its weighting on
emerging and Asian stocks from the maximum “overweight’ and
boosted cash holdings to 2 percent from zero, according to a
Feb. 10 report. The MSCI Emerging-Markets Index fell 0.5 percent
to 1,053.21 at 9:12 a.m. in Shanghai, trimming this year’s gain
to 15 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
