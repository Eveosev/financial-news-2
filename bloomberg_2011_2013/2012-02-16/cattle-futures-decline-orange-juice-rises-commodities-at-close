The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities declined 0.5 percent to 679.75 at 6:01 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.6 percent to 1,597.215.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell from a five-week high in New York as European
leaders pushed back a bailout for  Greece , heightening concern
that the region’s debt crisis will damage economic growth and
curtail fuel consumption.  Oil for March delivery fell as much as 78 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $101.02 and was at $101.11 a barrel in electronic

time. The contract yesterday increased $1.06 to $101.80, the
highest close since Jan. 10. Prices are 19 percent higher than a
year ago.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in  New York  declined the most in two
weeks as forecasts for warmer-than-normal weather in the eastern
U.S. through the end of February signaled reduced demand.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoil, or diesel, swaps for March rose 25 cents, or 0.2
percent, $133 a barrel at 12:50 p.m. Singapore time, according

$1,015.50 a metric ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical
feedstock gained for the fifth day in six.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined after European leaders delayed a decision on
Greece’s bailout, boosting the dollar and eroding demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.6 percent to $1,717.25 an ounce
and traded at $1,719.63 at 3:47 p.m. in Singapore. Prices have

tons, the lowest level since Feb. 6, the data show. Palladium

poised for the longest losing run since November. May-delivery
on the Comex lost 1.1 percent to $3.7665 a pound.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans declined from the highest level in more than four
months as concerns that the European debt crisis may not be

 China , the biggest importer.  The May-delivery contract lost 1 percent to $12.56 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:25 p.m. in Singapore, after
