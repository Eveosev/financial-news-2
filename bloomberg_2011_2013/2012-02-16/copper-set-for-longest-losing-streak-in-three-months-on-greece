Copper dropped to the lowest level
in more than three weeks after  Europe  postponed a decision on a
second Greek bailout, spurring concern the nation may default.
Aluminum, zinc and lead fell.  Three-month copper retreated as much as 1.6 percent to
$8,233 a metric ton, the lowest price since Jan. 23 on the
London Metal Exchange, and traded at $8,267.75 by 3:55 p.m.
Shanghai time. The contract retreated for a fifth day and was
poised for the longest losing run since November. May-delivery
on the Comex lost 1.1 percent to $3.7665 a pound.  Concern  Greece  will miss a debt payment next month grew as
a decision on 130 billion euros ($171 billion) of aid was
postponed until at least Feb. 20 and possibly until a full-time
Greek government emerges from elections later this year.  “Copper is suffering a double whammy from the delay of an
effective resolution in Europe and weak Chinese demand,” said
 Li Ye , an analyst at Shanghai Jiuheng Futures Co. The metal
gained 9.5 percent in January, ending a two-month decline.  World copper production exceeded demand by 69,100 tons last
year, compared with a shortage of 175,000 tons in 2010, the
World Bureau of Metal Statistics said yesterday. The May-
delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 2
percent lower at 59,210 yuan ($9,395) a ton.  Peru’s largest copper producers, including Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc., Southern Copper Corp. and Xstrata Plc, face
the risk of blackouts next year because of power line delays in
the southern Andes, Mark Hoffmann, vice president at the
National Society of Mining, Petroleum & Energy, said in an
interview in  Lima .  On the LME, aluminum fell 1.1 percent to $2,175 a ton, zinc
dropped 0.9 percent to $1,993.50 a ton and lead lost 1.4 percent
to $2,032.75 a ton. Nickel declined 0.7 percent to $19,945 a ton
and tin retreated 0.8 percent to $24,400 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
