Chile ’s peso snapped a four-day
losing streak as better-than-forecast economic data from the
U.S. countered a drop in copper prices, boosting demand for
emerging-market assets.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 484.95 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading in Santiago, after earlier dropping as much as
1 percent. The currency has gained 7.1 percent this year.  “Things looked quite glum earlier but fairly good numbers
from the U.S. changed the mood in the market,” Sergio Tricio,
an analyst at ForexChile, said in a phone interview from
Santiago.  The U.S. reported claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly
dropped to the lowest level in four years. Other reports showed
that  consumer confidence  increased and housing starts climbed.  The  Standard & Poor’s  500 index rose 1 percent as of 1:31
p.m. in New York, the euro strengthened 0.3 percent and copper,
Chile’s main export, was little changed after an earlier drop of
as much as 2 percent.  The yield on a basket of 10-year central bank bonds in
pesos was 5.17 percent and 2.28 percent on the inflation-linked
equivalents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
