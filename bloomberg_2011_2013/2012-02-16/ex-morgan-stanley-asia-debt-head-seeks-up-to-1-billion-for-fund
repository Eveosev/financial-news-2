Ranodeb Roy,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s former
head of fixed income for Asia-Pacific, is raising as much as $1
billion for a hedge fund focused on interest rates, credit and
foreign exchange.  RV Capital Management Pvt., which Roy is setting up with
Vickram Mangalgiri, a former adviser at Pacific Investment
Management Co., will start trading in April or May and plans to
manage $500 million to $1 billion once it’s fully funded, Roy
said in an interview in Singapore yesterday. He declined to say
when the target may be reached.  Asian  hedge funds  had net inflows of $6.6 billion last
year, bringing total assets to $82.1 billion as the total number
of funds increased 4 percent to 1,100, according to Chicago-
based Hedge Fund Research Inc. Roy says Asian funds can generate
gains against the backdrop of a “zero- interest-rate  world” in
developed economies.  “There is an opportunity for investors to get returns from
liquid Asian fixed-income products if one has a ‘private equity’
type mindset, with a longer-term view,” Roy said. “Regular
global dislocations often give amazing entry points for Asia,
and by sticking to the most liquid of products, one can get
decent returns.”  Roy and Mangalgiri hired Rajesh Mahadevan, previously head
of interest rate and foreign exchange structuring in  South Asia 
for BNP Paribas SA, as head of trading strategy, and will set up
a research team in India, bringing total staff to as many as 10
in the first phase.  Roy recently returned from a trip to the U.S and  Europe ,
where he marketed the fund to investors including family
offices, funds-of-funds and endowments, he said, without giving
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
