Cotton production in 2012-13 will
exceed demand by 1.9 million metric tons, Birkenhead, England-
based researcher Cotlook said.  Output will drop 3.7 percent to 25.7 million tons in the
season starting in August as consumption climbs 4.1 percent to
23.7 million tons, Cotlook said in its first estimate for the
new season. The surplus was 3.9 million tons a year earlier, it
said. Plantings will drop 3.3 percent this year, it said.  “The statistics indicate a substantial net surplus,”
Cotlook said.  Cotton futures dropped 37 percent last year on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  Planted area expanded by 11 percent in the 2011-12
marketing year and production jumped 14 percent, Cotlook said.  Output in  China , the world’s biggest cotton producer, will
fall 10 percent to 6.4 million tons, Cotlook said. Consumption
in China will rise 3.4 percent, it said. Output in India, the
second-largest producer, is forecast to decline 4.3 percent in
2012-13 as usage in the Indian subcontinent gains 6.9 percent,
