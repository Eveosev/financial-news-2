Mexico ’s central bank will leave
 interest rates  unchanged at 4.5 percent in 2012, according to
Barclays Plc economist Marcelo Salomon.  “The  Federal Reserve ’s guidance remains that rates should
stay exceptionally low through late 2014, which means Banxico
should follow suit,” Salomon wrote in an e-mailed report.
Salomon had previously predicted that interest rates in Mexico
would be 4 percent at year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
