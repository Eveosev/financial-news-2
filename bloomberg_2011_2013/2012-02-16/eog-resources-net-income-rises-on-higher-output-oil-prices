EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) , the third-
largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by market
value, said fourth-quarter profit more than doubled after
production of petroleum liquids surged.  Net income climbed to $120.7 million, or 45 cents a share,
from $53.7 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier, the Houston-
based company said in a statement. Excluding certain gains and
losses, per-share profit was 28 cents more than the 87 cent
average of 29 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  EOG said it may be able to recover the equivalent of 1.6
billion barrels of oil from  Texas ’ Eagle Ford Shale, up from a
previous estimate of 900 million barrels. The company based its
assessment on data from well production and greater output
expected because of more closely spaced wells.  Crude and condensate volumes rose 54 percent from a year
earlier to 135,300 barrels a day in the fourth quarter as
average prices climbed 20 percent, EOG said.  “The growth in U.S. oil production was even greater than I
had anticipated,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at  Edward
Jones  in  St. Louis  who has a “buy” rating on EOG shares and
doesn’t own any. “The company’s definitely running on all
cylinders.”  Output Climbing  Total output is expected to climb 5.5 percent this year
with liquids production from existing properties set to rise 30
percent, which is higher than an earlier 27 percent forecast,
EOG said today.  Revenue rose 55 percent from a year earlier to $2.77
billion in the fourth quarter. The company expects to get about
84 percent of its North American revenue from petroleum liquids
in 2012, according to a slide presentation. That’s higher than a
previous estimate of 75 percent, and quadruple the 21 percent
share in 2006.  North American gas production is expected to drop 11
percent this year. EOG said it plans to invest the minimum
amount of capital needed to hold certain gas acreage amid low
prices and a push to increase higher-profit production of
petroleum liquids such as crude.  The company said it plans to sell about $1.2 billion of
assets this year, including some $340 million already sold, as
it seeks to plug a funding gap between estimated cash flow and
spending. Cash proceeds from asset sales in 2011 totaled about
$1.43 billion, according to the company.  E&P Spending Plans  Exploration and production spending this year is estimated
to be $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, EOG said. The company also
boosted its quarterly common stock dividend to 17 cents from 16
cents a share.  EOG began to shift toward more crude output in 2007 and has
acquired acreage in oil-saturated shale formations including the
Bakken in  North Dakota  and the Eagle Ford.  Oil futures traded in New York rose 10 percent from a year
earlier to average $94.06 a barrel in the fourth quarter. Gas
futures averaged about $3.48 per million British thermal units
in the quarter, a decline of 13 percent from a year earlier.  Today’s earnings report was issued after the close of
regular trading on U.S. markets. EOG fell 0.8 percent, to
$116.65 at 7:22 p.m. in New York.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and  Apache Corp. (APA)  are the largest
U.S. independent producers by market value. Such companies focus
on oil and gas exploration.  (EOG will hold an earnings conference call tomorrow at 9
a.m.  New York  time. To listen, go to
