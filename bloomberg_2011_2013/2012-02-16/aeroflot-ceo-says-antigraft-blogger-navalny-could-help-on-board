Alexey Navalny’s experience fighting
corruption may benefit OAO Aeroflot, Chief Executive Officer
Vitaly Savelyev said, commenting on the nomination of the lawyer
and blogger to the board of  Russia ’s biggest airline.  “Alexey Navalny has experience, including in corporate
governance and anti-corruption efforts,” Savelyev told
reporters in Moscow today. “This could be applied at
Aeroflot.”  Billionaire  Alexander Lebedev , who controls about 15
percent of Aeroflot, put forward 35-year-old Navalny as an
independent director for the state company’s board, according to
the businessman’s blog. Navalny confirmed the move on his own
Web page.  “Those who fear Navalny are the ones that have something
to fear,” Savelyev said. Aeroflot has nothing to hide, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
