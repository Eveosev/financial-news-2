Yuan forwards dropped by the most
this month after the central bank weakened the reference rate
for a fourth day and European leaders postponed a decision on a
bailout for  Greece .  The People’s Bank of  China  set the daily fixing 0.05
percent weaker at 6.2991 per dollar, the biggest decline since
Jan. 31. A decision slated for yesterday on offering 130 billion
euros ($169 billion) of rescue funds to Greece was delayed to
Feb. 20 and may be pushed back until after a still-unscheduled
Greek election. Capital flows into China have rebounded this
year, the PBOC said in a quarterly report posted on its website
yesterday. The yuan strengthened 4.7 percent in 2011.  “Because of  Europe  and the concerns over global growth,
the yuan fixing has lagged behind its theoretical 5 percent
appreciation path,” said Cliff Tan, the Hong Kong-based head of
global currency research for  East Asia  at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “But I don’t see any changes in China’s
exchange-rate policy. Once capital inflows accelerate, the
appreciation will be faster later this year.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.21 percent,
the most since Jan. 30, to 6.2919 per dollar as of 5:10 p.m. in
Hong Kong, a 0.15 percent premium to the onshore spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan slipped 0.03 percent to close at 6.3016 in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on either side of
the fixing. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan dropped
0.12 percent to 6.3025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
