Givaudan SA (GIVN) , the maker of fragrances
for Gucci Guilty and Bombshell by Victoria’s Secret, plans to
increase prices further after higher raw-material costs hurt
profitability.  The gross margin fell to 42.6 percent last year from 46.1
percent a year earlier, the Vernier, Switzerland-based company
said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Gilles Andrier reiterated a mid-
term forecast to maintain industry-leading operating profit
margins, a challenge for the manufacturer as price increases lag
behind cost inflation. Andrier is targeting expansion at double
the pace of the 2 percent to 3 percent growth expected for the
wider market by taking customers from smaller rivals.  “The sharp and broad-based increase in raw-material
costs” caused decline in margins, the company said in the
statement. Givaudan said it “successfully implemented price
increases” that started to “become effective in the course of
the second quarter.”  Full-year net income dropped to 252 million Swiss francs
($272 million) from 340 million francs a year earlier, the
company said today. Sales fell to 3.9 billion francs. Both
figures are in line with analyst estimates, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
