Canopy Financial Inc. co-founders
Anthony Banas and Jeremy Blackburn were each sentenced to more
than 13 years in prison after pleading guilty to what U.S.
prosecutors said was a $93 million investment fraud scheme.  Canopy was a provider of financial processing services for
the health-care industry. Prosecutors alleged the men used false
information about the Chicago-based company’s financial
condition to raise about $75 million from private equity
investors. They were also accused of stealing almost $19 million
from clients’ health savings and flexible spending accounts.  Each man pleaded guilty to a single count of  wire fraud  in
2010. Blackburn said in court papers that he had schemed with
Banas and others to defraud Canopy investors and clients in 2008
and 2009, using that money to pay for vacation expenses and for
luxury automobiles.  U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo in Chicago today
sentenced Banas, 34, of Homer Glen,  Illinois , to 160 months in
prison. Banas had been Canopy’s chief technology officer.  Blackburn, 38, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, was the company’s
president and chief operating officer. He received a 15-year
term from Castillo on Jan. 24.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Blackburn, 09cr976, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
