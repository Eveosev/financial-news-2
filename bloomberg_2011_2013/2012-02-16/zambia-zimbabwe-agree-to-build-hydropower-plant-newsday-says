Zambia  and  Zimbabwe  agreed in
principle to build the 1,650 megawatt Batoka hydropower plant on
the Zambezi River,  Newsday  reported, citing Zambian Energy
Minister Christopher Yaluma.  The plant is estimated to cost more than $4 billion, the
Harare-based newspaper said on its website. The project is
subject to Zimbabwe paying a $70 million debt owed to Zambia, it
said.  The Zambezi River Authority and Zesa Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.,
Zimbabweâ€™s power utility, will do a feasibility study of the
plant, which will be downstream from Victoria Falls, Newsday
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
