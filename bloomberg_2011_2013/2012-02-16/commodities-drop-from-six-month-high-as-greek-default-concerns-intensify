Commodities fell from a six-month
high, paced by declines in copper and crude, after European
leaders delayed a decision on  Greece ’s bailout, boosting the
dollar and eroding demand for raw materials.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index  lost as much as 0.3
percent to 680.79 after reaching 687.80 yesterday, the highest
level since Aug. 2. The gauge was at 680.84 at 1:37 p.m. in
 Singapore . Three-month copper fell as much as 1.6 percent to
$8,233 per metric ton in London, set for the longest losing run
since Nov. 10. Crude dropped as much as 0.4 percent in New York.  Concern that Greece will miss a debt payment next month
grew as a decision slated for yesterday on 130 billion euros
($169 billion) of aid was postponed to Feb. 20. Ratings for
global banks may be cut as lenders face risks of rising funding
costs amid  Europe ’s debt woes, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “Europe is far off from reaching a solution,” said
Dominic Schnider, global head of commodity research at UBS AG’s
wealth management unit, said by phone from Singapore. “That’s
the drag that we have, which will hurt demand for commodities.”  Commodities have gained 5.6 percent this year, bolstered by
data that shows the world’s largest economy may be recovering.
Factories in the U.S. boosted production in January, capping the
biggest two-month increase in more than two years, according to
Federal Reserve figures. The jobless rate fell to the lowest
level in three years last month, while  consumer credit  racked up
the biggest two-month gain in a decade at the end of 2011.  Oil for March delivery was at $101.45 per barrel, down 0.3
percent on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange after ending
yesterday at the highest close since Jan. 10. Prices have been
supported by reports that  Iran  halted shipments to Europe.  Copper futures traded at $8,250.50 per ton on the London
Metal Exchange, as aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead and tin prices
dropped. Spot gold declined 0.4 percent to $1,720.68 an ounce as
silver and platinum weakened.  The euro lost 0.3 percent to $1.3026 as of 1:35 p.m. in
 Tokyo  after earlier sliding to $1.3008, the lowest level since
Jan. 25. France and Spain are scheduled to auction as much as
14.3 billion euros in bonds today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
