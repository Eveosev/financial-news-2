Ethiopian rebels said the country’s
army killed 16 civilians when they opened fire on a gathering of
residents at a town in the southeastern Ogaden region.  At least 20 people were killed in the Feb. 12 attack at the
Gunagado district in Degahbur, about 540 kilometers (335 miles)
southeast of the capital,  Addis Ababa , the Ogaden National
Liberation Front said in an e-mailed statement today. Residents
were meeting to discuss the killing of an elder and the district
commissioner the night before, it said.  Communications Minister Bereket Simon didn’t answer his
mobile phone when Bloomberg called him seeking comment today.
The government routinely rejects ONLF statements as false.  “Troops detained more than 100 people from the town and
took them to unknown destinations,” the ONLF said. “The
Ethiopian army has cut off all communication to the area.”  The ONLF has been fighting for self-determination in
 Ethiopia ’s ethnic Somali region since 1984. The rebels regularly
accuse the government of atrocities and claim military
victories. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi’s administration signed a
cease-fire with a faction of the group in October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
