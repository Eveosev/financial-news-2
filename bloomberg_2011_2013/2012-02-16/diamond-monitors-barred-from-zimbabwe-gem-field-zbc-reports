(Corrects to exclude  Global Witness  from Kimberley Process
Civil Society Coalition in second paragraph.)  Members of the Kimberley Process
Civil Society Coalition have been barred from visiting
Zimbabwe’s Marange diamond fields, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp.
said, citing Mines Minister  Obert Mpofu .  The coalition, which includes Partnership Africa Canada,
won’t be allowed into the area because it boycotted a Kimberley
Process meeting in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year,
state-owned  ZBC said .  Marange diamonds are mined by four companies, all in
partnership with the state-owned Zimbabwe Mining Development
Corp. Global Witness and other human rights organizations have
accused the Zimbabwe government of abusing people living in
Marange and of gem smuggling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
