Malaga Inc. (MLG) , the Canadian mining
company, will build a hydroelectric plant with 20 megawatts of
capacity at its Pasto Bueno tungsten mine in northern Peru.  Malaga may start building the project in the first quarter
of next year, the Montreal-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The project, which may be expanded to 38 megawatts, will be
developed with Hidropesac, a joint venture between Malaga and
Swiss companies Emerging Power Developers and Stucky SA,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
