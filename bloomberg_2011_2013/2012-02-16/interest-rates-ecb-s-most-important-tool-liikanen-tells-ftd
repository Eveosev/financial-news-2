European Central Bank Council member
Erkki Liikanen said  interest rates  remain the ECB’s most
important tool and suggested exiting the others as soon as
conditions allow,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  “Interest rates are our most important instrument,”
Liikanen told the newspaper in an interview. “The other
measures remain only as long as they’re needed.” He added that
the ECB should think about how to exit them “as soon as
conditions allow,” the FTD reported.  Liikanen suggested the ECB could cut the benchmark rate
below 1 percent if required, the newspaper said. If the bank
needed to ease policy further as room to move on rates
diminished, there would be no technical hurdles to taking that
course, he told the FTD. He however added that that was
“currently not on the agenda,” the newspaper said.  Liikanen also said he was satisfied with the way inflation
was developing development and didn’t see a deflation risk for
the  euro zone , the newspaper reported.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
