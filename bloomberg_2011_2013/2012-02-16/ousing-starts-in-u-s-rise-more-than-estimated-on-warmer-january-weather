Builders  broke ground  on more homes
than forecast in January, helped by warmer weather and adding to
signs the U.S. residential real estate market is stabilizing.  Starts rose 1.5 percent to a 699,000 annual rate from
December’s 689,000 pace that was stronger than previously
reported, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington.
The  median  estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise
to 675,000. Building permits, a proxy for future construction,
also climbed.  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZ)  and  D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI)  are among
builders reporting more orders as a pickup in hiring, cheaper
properties and borrowing costs close to a record low attract
buyers. At the same time, the glut of foreclosed houses remains a
restraint on construction, one reason the Obama administration
and the  Federal Reserve  are taking steps to bolster the industry.  “The numbers are genuinely getting better,” said  Brian Jones , senior U.S. economist at  Societe Generale  in New York, who
projected a rate of 700,000 starts. Multifamily  home construction 
“has a ways to run. We should be seeing a pop in single-family
starts by late spring.”  Estimates of the 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged
from 640,000 to 736,000. The prior month was revised from a
657,000 pace.  Jobless Claims  Jobless claims  unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest
level in four years, a report from the Labor Department showed
today. First-time applications for  unemployment benefits 
decreased 13,000 in the week ended Feb. 11 to 348,000, the fewest
since March 2008.  Stock-index futures trimmed losses after the reports. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next month
dropped 0.1 percent to 1,340.7 at 8:44 a.m. in  New York  after
losing as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  Construction of multifamily units such as apartment
buildings led the January gain. Starts of single-family homes
eased after surging in December for a third month.  The fourth-warmest January on record probably gave
homebuilding a boost, economists said. The  National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration  reported the average temperature was
36.3 degrees Fahrenheit (2.39 Celsius), 5.5 degrees above the
1901-2000 long-term average.  Last Year  The January homebuilding data compare with 609,200 housing
starts last year, up from 587,000 in 2010 and reflecting gains in
multifamily construction. They totaled 554,000 units in 2009, the
fewest since record-keeping began in 1959. During the past
decade’s housing boom, starts reached a peak of 2.07 million in
2005.  Permits increased to a 676,000 annual pace, today’s report
showed. They were projected to rise to a 680,000 annual rate,
from 671,000 the prior month, according to the survey median.  Construction of single-family houses fell 1 percent to a
508,000 rate after jumping 12 percent in December to a 513,000
pace.  Work on multifamily homes that include townhouses and
apartment buildings last month climbed 8.5 percent to an annual
rate of 191,000 after a 28 percent slump in December.  Three of four regions had an increase in January starts, led
by the South and West. In the South, construction jumped 18
percent to a 388,000 annual rate, the fastest since October 2008.
Starts in the West increased 12 percent. The Midwest posted a 41
percent drop, led by fewer starts of single-family dwellings.  Beazer Homes Orders  Beazer Homes said orders jumped 36 percent in the final
three months of 2011 from the same quarter a year earlier, and
closings on new houses surged more than 60 percent. The Atlanta-
based builder said it expects to sell more properties this year
than last.  “While our visibility into the economic conditions for the
remainder of the year is limited, I believe that we will benefit
from a gradually improving housing market,” Allan Merrill, chief
executive officer, said on an earnings call on Feb. 2.  D.R. Horton , the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume,
reported net home orders rose to 3,794 in final three months of
2011, from 3,363 a year earlier.  “Simply put, our business feels more positive,” Donald Tomnitz, chief executive officer of the Fort Worth, Texas-based
company, said in a Jan. 27 conference call. “We are cautiously
optimistic for the remainder for 2012.”  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index
of builder confidence climbed in February to the highest level
since May 2007, figures showed yesterday.  More Foreclosures  Builders still have to contend with a stream of distressed
houses returning to the market and limiting prices. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank’s efforts to spur economic
growth are being blunted by impediments to mortgage lending, and
called for more steps to heal the housing industry.  “We have helped lower  mortgage rates  to the lowest point in
many, many decades,” Bernanke told homebuilders on Feb. 10 in
 Orlando ,  Florida . “Yet we are not seeing as much activity as we
would like to see.”  Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and three other
U.S. banks reached a $25 billion settlement with 49 states and
the U.S. government to end a probe of abusive foreclosure
practices prompted by the collapse of the housing price bubble.
President  Barack Obama  said the agreement, announced Feb. 9, is a
“major step” in reviving housing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
