Qatar’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in a month amid investor concern dividend payments in
the Persian Gulf nation aren’t reflecting companies’ earnings.  Masraf Al Rayan (MARK) , an Islamic bank, fell the most in almost a
month.  Doha Bank QSC (DHBK) , Qatar’s third-largest lender by total
loans, declined the most since October. The benchmark  QE Index (DSM) 
retreated 1 percent, the most since Jan. 19, to 8,544.18 at the
close in Doha. It dropped 1.7 percent this week. The Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index, which tracks the 200 biggest companies in the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, fell 0.2 percent.  Qatari banks are benefiting from a pickup in lending as the
country invests in infrastructure to prepare for the 2022 soccer
World Cup. Doha Bank, which reported an 18-percent jump in 2011
profit, announced a  lower dividend  for 2011 than for 2010.  Qatar
National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the country’s largest lender, said last month
its acquisition of Turkey’s Denizbank AS wouldn’t be possible if
the dividend it distributes is too high.  “Considering the growth that Qatar companies have had, the
dividends weren’t impressive,” said Musa Haddad, head trader at
the  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC ’s asset-management group in
 Abu Dhabi . “This has put investor sentiment down.”  Qatar’s stock market, the best performer in the GCC in
2011, has fallen 2.7 percent this year, trailing benchmark
indexes in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which have gained 12 percent and
3 percent respectively.  Greece Delay  Emerging-market stocks fell today, with the  MSCI Emerging
Markets Index (MXEF)  declining 1.3 percent at 10:56 a.m. in London
after a decision on a second bailout for Greece was delayed and
foreign investment into China declined.  Masraf Al Rayan lost 2.1 percent, the most since Jan. 22,
to 26.2 riyals. Doha Bank dropped 3 percent, the biggest decline
since Oct. 4, to 62 riyals. Qatar National Bank retreated 0.7
percent to 133.6 riyals.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  declined 0.5 percent and Abu
Dhabi’s measure fell 0.6 percent. Kuwait’s gauge advanced 0.3
percent. Bahrain’s BB All Share Index climbed 0.1 percent and
Oman’s measure rose 0.3 percent. The Saudi stock market is
closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
