McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
biggest restaurant chain, said third-quarter profit gained 8.6
percent as lower-priced items boosted U.S. store sales.  Net income climbed to $1.51 billion, or $1.45 a share, from
$1.39 billion, or $1.29, a year earlier, the  Oak Brook ,
Illinois-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
expected $1.43 a share, the average of 24 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner has sought to draw
American diners with low-priced menu items, such as the $1
McDouble burger, as the nation’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate
saps  consumer confidence . Sales in the U.S. were driven by fruit
smoothies, Chicken McNuggets and breakfast foods, the company
said.  “They continue to gain market share,” Brian Bittner, an
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in  New York , said in an interview.
“Consumers are searching for value more than they ever really
have.” Bittner rates the shares “outperform.”  McDonald’s rose 3.7 percent to $92.32 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 20 percent this year.  McDonald’s increased its food inflation forecast for this
year to as much as 5 percent in the U.S. and  Europe  from a
previous estimate of as much as 4.5 percent. The restaurant
chain expects 2012 U.S. commodity inflation to be “similar to
this year’s,” Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said during
a conference call today.  Food costs in the U.S. may gain as much as 4 percent in
2011, the Department of Agriculture predicted in September.  Restaurant Sales  Global sales at stores open more than 13 months climbed 5
percent during the quarter. Analysts expected a gain of 4
percent, on average. Those sales rose 4.4 percent in the U.S.,
4.9 percent in Europe, and increased 3.4 percent in  Asia , the
 Middle East  and  Africa .  September same-store sales climbed 6.6 percent globally,
McDonald’s said in a filing. That topped analysts’ 3.9 percent
average estimate. Same-store sales may rise as much as 5 percent
in October, Skinner said in the statement.  Comparable, or same-store sales, are an indicator of growth
because the numbers only include older restaurants. Second-
quarter same-store sales increased 5.6 percent worldwide.  Revenue climbed 14 percent to $7.17 billion in the quarter.
Analysts had estimated $7.04 billion.  McDonald’s had about 14,000 stores in the U.S. and more
than 18,500 overseas at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
