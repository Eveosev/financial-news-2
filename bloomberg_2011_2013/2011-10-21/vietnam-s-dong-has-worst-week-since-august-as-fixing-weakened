Vietnam ’s dong had its worst week in
two months as the central bank set the currency’s fixing lower
in an attempt to narrow the gap between the official and
unofficial exchange rates.  Government bonds  fell.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam lowered the  reference rate  four
times this week, setting it at the weakest level since at least
2005 yesterday. Policy makers have been trying to stem downward
pressure on the dong caused by a widening trade deficit and
maturing dollar loans. The shortfall jumped to $1 billion last
month from a revised $396 million in August, official data show.  “Despite continuous adjustments of the official dong-
dollar exchange rate, the gap between market rates and the
official upper trading band continues to expand,” Marc Djandji
and Doan Thi Thu Hoai, analysts at  Viet Capital Securities
Joint-Stock Co.  in  Ho Chi Minh City , wrote in a research note
released yesterday.  The dong fell 0.5 percent this week to 20,953 per dollar as
of 3:24 p.m. in  Hanoi , the steepest decline since the five days
ended Aug. 12. It dropped 0.1 percent today and touched 20,963,
the weakest level since Bloomberg began collecting data on it in
1993.  The central bank set its reference rate at 20,738 today,
unchanged from yesterday, according to its website. The dong is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  In the so-called black market, the currency traded as low
as 21,630 per dollar at gold shops in Hanoi today, compared with
21,410 on Oct. 14, according to a telephone information service
run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &  Telecommunications.  The yield on Vietnam’s five-year bonds gained six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to 12.41 percent,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
