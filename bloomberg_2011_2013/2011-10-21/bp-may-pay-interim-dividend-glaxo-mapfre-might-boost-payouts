BP Plc,  Europe ’s second-largest oil
company, may pay out its first third-quarter interim dividend to
shareholders since 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BP will probably pay 7 cents in its first interim payout in
the third quarter since the 2010 explosion at its Macondo oil
well, which led to the world’s largest accidental oil spill.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s largest drugmaker, will
increase its dividend to shareholders by 6.3 percent to 17 pence
a share, according to Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts that factor
in earnings and options prices.  Mapfre SA (MAP) , the Spanish insurer,
might raise its interim payout by 7.2 percent to 7.5 euro cents.  Companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index may boost
shareholder payouts by 18 percent over the next 12 months,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share
are forecast to grow 19 percent over the same period.  The Stoxx 600 has risen 0.1 percent this week as concern
eased that the euro area’s leaders are far from agreeing on a
plan to end the region’s debt crisis. The gauge jumped 2.5
percent to 238.85 at 3:51 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
