European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the weaknesses evident in the euro area
are down to political failings.  “The weaknesses in the euro area are clear,” Trichet said
during a speech in Warsaw today. “It is a question of
governance.”  Trichet said as a whole the euro area was correcting the
imbalances in its public finances faster than other major
advanced economies.  “The problem is that that is only true as a whole, when
you observe individual countries you have differences,” Trichet
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
