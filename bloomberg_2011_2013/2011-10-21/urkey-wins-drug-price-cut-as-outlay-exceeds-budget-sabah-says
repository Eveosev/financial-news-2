Turkey â€™s government won a price
reduction from pharmaceuticals makers that will help limit a
likely overspend this year on drugs, Sabah newspaper reported.  The price of drugs retailing for more than 10 liras ($5.40)
will fall as much as 10 percent, the Istanbul-based newspaper
reported.  The state-run healthcare purchaser requested the reduction
after spending on pharmaceuticals reached 16.6 billion liras,
compared with a year-end target of 15.6 billion liras, Sabah
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
