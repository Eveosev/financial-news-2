Adam McCabe, a Singapore-based
portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, spoke at a
forum today about the outlook for Asian currencies, including
 Indonesia ’s rupiah.  “On a relative basis,  Asia  still has very sound
fundamentals, which will drive decent earnings to capital. Even
in the last couple of months, Asian currencies have outperformed
Latin American ones. Why is that? Primarily because of
structural differences, primarily because of the role of central
banks in terms of controlling the extent to which currencies
have appreciated and indeed how much they can depreciate.  “Interestingly, if you look at the rupiah, the one-year
non-deliverable forward is trading at 9,500. It structurally has
a pretty sound economy. No one is talking about the likelihood
of Indonesia being upgraded but it is still likely that
Indonesia’s sovereigns are upgraded to investment grade. That
can actually change the game for Indonesia. So there’s some
interesting opportunities and shorting the dollar/IDR at 9500 or
higher is very attractive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
