BTA Bank, Kazakhstan’s biggest
lender before it defaulted in 2009, said its first-half net loss
rose by 54 billion tenge ($365 million) in the final report
compared with the  preliminary results  for the same period as
income-tax expenses increased.  The bank had a loss of 102.6 billion tenge in the first
half compared with a preliminary loss of 48.4 billion tenge in
the same period reported in August, the bank said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “The increase of the loss in the  final report  compared to
the preliminary one is related to review of the deferred income
tax, which was earlier recognized in the 2010 report,” the
Almaty-based lender said. The lender’s corporate income-tax
expense rose to 62.7 billion tenge in the final report for the
first half compared with 3.3 billion tenge reported as
preliminary results for the same period, the bank said.  BTA Bank’s capital shortfall widened to 216.7 billion tenge
in the final report for the first half compared with 162.5
billion tenge in the preliminary results. The bank said it lost
82.5 billion tenge in the first half of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
