A Senegalese political activist was
jailed for two years after being found guilty of writing a death
threat to judges,  Seneweb  reported.  Malick Noel Seck had been charged with offending President
Abdoulaye Wade and sending a death threat to members of the West
African nation’s Constitutional Council, according to the
website.  In a letter, Seck told members of the council they would be
“held accountable” if they allow Wade to run for a third term
in presidential elections scheduled for February 2011, Seneweb
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
