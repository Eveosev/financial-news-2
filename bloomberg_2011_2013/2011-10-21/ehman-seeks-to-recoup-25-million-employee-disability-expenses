Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  said
it would ask the U.S. Department of Labor if it could be
reimbursed for $25 million of expenses paid for former employees
and retirees. The money would be set aside under a health-care
trust and wonâ€™t be available to pay premiums for employees on
long term disability, the defunct firm said in a court filing
today.  The healthcare trust currently has $37 million left to pay
premiums, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
