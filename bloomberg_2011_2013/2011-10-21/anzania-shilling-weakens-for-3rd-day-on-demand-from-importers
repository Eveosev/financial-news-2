Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a
third day, extending its weekly loss against the dollar on
increased demand from oil importers for the U.S. currency.  The shilling traded down 0.3 percent at 1,715 per dollar by
12:21 p.m. in Dar as Salaam, the commercial capital, taking its
weekly loss to 1.1 percent.  “ Oil companies  have been making inquiries on demand for
dollars, and buying a little,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with
National Bank of Commerce Ltd., ABSA Group’s Tanzanian unit,
said by phone from  Dar es Salaam . “Supply of dollars is coming
in from the tourism sector mainly.”  Tanzania’s central bank this week introduced restrictions
on the amount of foreign currency that lenders can buy, in an
attempt to halt a 14 percent slide in the shilling this year.
The country’s inflation rate climbed to 16.8 percent in
September, on higher energy and food costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
