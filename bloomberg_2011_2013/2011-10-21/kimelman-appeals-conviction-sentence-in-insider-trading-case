Michael Kimelman, the co-founder of
Incremental Capital LLC, appealed his conviction and sentence
for  insider trading .  Kimelman, sentenced Oct. 12 to 2 1/2 years in prison,
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, according to
a court filing dated yesterday.  A jury found Kimelman guilty in June in a scheme to bribe
two lawyers at the Boston-based law firm Ropes & Gray LLP to
disclose secret information about companies including 3Com Corp.
and Hilton Hotels Corp. Also found guilty were brothers Zvi and
Emanuel Goffer.  Kimelman was sentenced a day before Raj Rajaratnam, the
founder of Galleon Group LLC, received an 11-year sentence for
insider trading. Kimelmanâ€™s lawyers include  Michael Sommer .  The case is USA v. Goffer, 10-00056, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
