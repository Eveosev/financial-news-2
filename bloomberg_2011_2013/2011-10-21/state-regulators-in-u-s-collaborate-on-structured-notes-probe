A group of about 10 states is
examining whether structured notes, securities that package debt
with derivatives that are typically offered to individual
investors, were improperly sold.  States including  Florida  and Texas are seeking to determine
if brokers sold the debt instruments without adequately
disclosing the risks, Franklin L. Widmann, head of the
structured products working group for the North American
Securities Administrators Association, said today in a telephone
interview.  Widmann, who’s also director of securities for Florida’s
Office of Financial Regulation, declined to comment further
because the investigation is ongoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
