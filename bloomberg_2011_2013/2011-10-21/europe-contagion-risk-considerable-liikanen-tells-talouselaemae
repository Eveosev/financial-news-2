Europe ’s debt crisis may spread
“fast” across the single currency area, European Central Bank
council member  Erkki Liikanen  told magazine Talouselaemae.  “Everyone who monitors the financial markets knows the
contagion risk now is considerable,” Liikanen said in an
interview published today by the Helsinki-based magazine.
“Events since the spring 2010 show that the crisis is spreading
fast from one market to the next.”  The Frankfurt-based central bank, which has bought Italian
and Spanish bonds on the secondary market to ease pressure on
their yields, has called for voluntary debt arrangements and
warned enforced investor losses may endanger the stability of
the 17-member euro area.  European leaders meet on Oct. 23 in Brussels to discuss a
plan to avoid a Greek default, bolster banks and curb contagion.  “It’s good that central banks have learned to cooperate
and work together to safeguard sufficient liquidity for the euro
and the dollar,” Liikanen said. “Debt problems aren’t
downplayed anymore and banks are better capitalized.”  Even so, increased sovereign debt leaves governments less
room to maneuver, he said.  Asked whether it’s possible that the euro area might break
up as a result of the crisis, Liikanen said: “It is not. Full
stop.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
