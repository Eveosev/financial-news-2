Germany  needs a national economic
growth pact to stabilize expansion in the crisis, the Free
Democrats’ parliamentary leader  Rainer Bruederle  said in a
Handelsblatt interview.  Such a pact should include budget cuts, tax cuts and
boosted investment, he is cited as saying. Yesterday, the
government of  Europe ’s biggest economy cut its 2012 economic
growth forecast to 1 percent from 1.8 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
