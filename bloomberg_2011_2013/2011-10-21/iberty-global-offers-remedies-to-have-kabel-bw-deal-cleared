Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA)  has offered
remedies to counter possible antitrust concerns of German
regulators over its plans to buy Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH.  The German Federal Cartel Office, the nation’s antitrust
regulator, received an offer from Liberty Global, its spokesman
Kay Weidner said by phone today. He declined to comment on the
details. The regulator also extended the deadline for it to
probe the combination to Dec. 15, he said. Originally the review
was scheduled to end Nov. 11.  “We will also submit our preliminary view of the issue to
the companies next week,” said Weidner.  U.S. billionaire  John Malone ’s Liberty Global in March
agreed to buy Kabel BW, Germany’s third-largest cable-
television operator, for about 3.16 billion euros ($4.4
billion.)  The Cartel Office took over the review of the purchase
after European Union regulators decided  Germany  may be better
placed to probe possible harmful effects of the deal.  Liberty Global remains confident that the outcome of the
review will be “positive” and is continuing its
“constructive" dialogue with the regulator, company spokeswoman
Hanne Wolf said in an interview. She declined to comment
further.  Kabel BW’s press office didn’t immediately reply to an e-
mail seeking comment after business hours.  -- Editor: Christopher Scinta  To contact the reporter on this story:
