Federal Reserve Bank of  New York 
President William C. Dudley said that while “considerable
progress” has been made since the credit crisis began, there’s
“still much to do” to reduce risks in the financial system.  “In particular, transparency into risk management
practices remains poor,” Dudley said in the text of remarks
given yesterday in New York and released today. “Investors have
little information by which to assess the competencies of firms
as risk managers or how well firms will likely do in adverse
economic circumstances.”  For example, investors are trying to assess banks’ exposure
to the European crisis and “are uncertain about how to think
about” banks with “huge books of business that net down to
more modest net exposures,” Dudley said. “We need to figure
out better ways to present these exposures and risks in the
firm’s disclosures.”  Dudley didn’t comment on the outlook for monetary policy or
the economy in the remarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
