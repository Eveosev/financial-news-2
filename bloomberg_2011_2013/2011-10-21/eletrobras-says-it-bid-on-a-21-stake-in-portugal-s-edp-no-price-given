Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras
SA (ELET6) , Latin America’s largest publicly traded power company,
bid for a 21 percent stake in EDP Energias de Portugal that
the Portuguese government is selling.  Eletrobras, as the company is known, didn’t disclose
the financial terms of the offer in a statement to Brazil’s
regulator today. Portuguese state holding company
Parpublica said earlier it had received six expressions of
interest in the stake. It didn’t identify the companies
involved.  China Three Gorges Corp. may have made a higher offer
than Eletrobras for the stake held by Portuguese state
holding company Parpublica, Lisbon newspaper Diario
Economico reported, citing unidentified people. Brazilian
rival Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais, known as Cemig, and
Germany’s E.ON AG may also bid for EDP,  Diario Economico 
said.  Portugal is selling the stake as one of several
measures pledged in exchange for a 78 billion-euro ($108
billion) bailout from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  earlier this year.  Lisbon-based EDP, which has a market value of 8.82
billion euros, is Portugal’s largest power company.  Eletrobras rose 3.2 percent to close at 23.45 reais in
 Sao Paulo . The statement was released after the close of
regular trading in Brazil. EDP gained 0.7 percent to 2.414
euros in Lisbon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
