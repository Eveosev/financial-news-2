The yuan completed its first weekly
decline in a month on signs the world’s second-largest economy
is slowing as the central bank seeks to tame inflation and
 Europe ’s debt crisis saps export demand.  The economy may continue to slow in the final quarter of
the year and in the first half of next, National Business Daily
reported today, citing  Chen Dongqi , deputy director of the
National Development and Reform Commission’s Chinese Academy of
Macroeconomic Research. Gross domestic product increased 9.1
percent last quarter, the smallest gain since 2009.  “The yuan’s appreciation will likely slow modestly,” said
 Robert Minikin , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Standard
Chartered Plc in  Hong Kong . “We expect to see more two-way
variability and the moves will be less one-sided.”  The yuan fell 0.1 percent this week to 6.3840 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the  China  Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency rose 0.02 percent today.  The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference
rate 0.04 percent stronger at 6.3628 per dollar. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either side of the daily
reference rate.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent this
week to 6.4120 per dollar, a 0.4 percent discount to the onshore
spot rate. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan depreciated
0.1 percent today to 6.4265 and rose 0.2 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
