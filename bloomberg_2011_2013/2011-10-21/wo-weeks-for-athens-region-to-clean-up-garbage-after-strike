Greek garbage collectors may take as
long as two weeks to collect 120,000 tonnes of trash in the
Attica region, which includes  Athens , after a three-week strike
by city workers,  Ta Nea  said, without citing anyone.  Garbage collectors are expected to return to work after the
government issued a civil mobilization order on Oct. 18, the
Athens-based newspaper said. Around 300 workers out of more than
8,000 have received notification to return to work so far, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
