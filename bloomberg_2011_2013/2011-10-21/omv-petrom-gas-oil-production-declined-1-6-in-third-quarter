OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s largest oil
company, said third-quarter oil and natural-gas production
declined 1.6 percent from the previous three months.  Output fell to 184,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from
187,000 in the second quarter as “new wells could not fully
compensate outages caused by bad weather,” the Bucharest-based
company’s majority owner,  OMV AG (OMV) , said today in a statement.  Third-quarter gas sales volumes dropped 20 percent to 840
million cubic meters from 1.05 billion cubic meters in the
previous quarter as higher import prices weakened margins in
Romania, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
