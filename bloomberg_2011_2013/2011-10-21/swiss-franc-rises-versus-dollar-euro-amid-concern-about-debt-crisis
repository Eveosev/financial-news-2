The Swiss franc climbed against the
euro and the dollar as investor confidence ebbed in the ability
of European leaders to resolve the euro region debt crisis,
increasing demand for safer assets.  The franc advanced 0.6 percent from yesterday to 88.87
centimes per dollar at 10:36 a.m. in  Tokyo . It rose 0.5 percent
to 1.2253 francs per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
