Glencore International Plc has hired
Andrew Kelleher, recently a managing director at  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM) , to head up its U.S. oil group, according to a person
familiar with operations at the company.  Kelleher will start in the new position by the start of
2012, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information isnâ€™t public.  Kelleher joined JPMorgan in August 2009 after serving as
the president of supply and trading at  ConocoPhillips. (COP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
