DLF Ltd. (DLFU) ,  India ’s biggest real
estate developer, fell in Mumbai trading after the nation’s
market regulator said it will investigate a complaint against an
affliate company.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the nation’s
capital market regulator, said it will probe a complaint by an
investor claiming a company associated with DLF cheated him of
about 340 million rupees, according to an order on the
regulator’s website.  “This is an old commercial dispute between the complainant
and an erstwhile affiliate of DLF,” Sanjey Roy, spokesman at
DLF said in a phone interview today. “The complainant is not an
investor in the company. We are studying the order.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
