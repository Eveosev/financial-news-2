The European Union’s statistics
office Eurostat said today it has withdrawn its reservation
about the quality of  Romania ’s budget-deficit and government-
debt data reported in April, according to a statement on its
website.  “Eurostat has withdrawn the reservation expressed on the
data reported by Romania in the April 2011 notification due to
uncertainties on the impact of some public corporations on the
government deficit,” Eurostat said in the statement.  “Eurostat has confirmed that in the October 2011
notification the above mentioned items have been recorded
according to ESA95 methodology and the related manuals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
