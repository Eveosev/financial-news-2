Asian stocks swung between gains and
losses, heading for a weekly drop, on speculation European
policy makers will struggle to reach a resolution on how to
fight the region’s debt crisis.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a Japanese manufacturer of industrial robots
that gets 75 percent of its sales abroad, rose 2.4 percent after
an index of manufacturing in Philadelphia unexpectedly
increased.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-largest
maker of computer memory chips, rose 10 percent in Seoul after a
research company said Apple Inc. used the company’s NAND-flash
chips in the iPhone for the first time. Mitsui & Co. led losses
in Japanese traders as commodity prices headed for the first
weekly loss in three weeks.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent to 115.40 at
7:34 p.m. in  Tokyo  after falling as much as 0.3 percent. About
half of the stocks on the benchmark gauge rose ahead of a
European debt summit this weekend. The measure has dropped 1.3
percent this week.  “It looks like European leaders are making progress, but
there’s still a long way to go,” said  Stephen Halmarick ,
Sydney-based head of investment markets research at Colonial
First State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “The market remains very vulnerable.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3
percent today. The index rose 0.5 percent yesterday in  New York 
after a report that  Europe  may combine temporary and permanent
rescue funds to make as much as 940 billion euros ($1.3
trillion) available to fight the crisis, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  Second Summit  Gains were limited on concern European policymakers will
struggle to reach a resolution at the Oct. 23 summit. German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said in a joint statement they want agreement on a
“comprehensive and ambitious” plan as the European Union
prepares for a second summit within three days of this weekend’s
meeting.  “There’s a lot of information and a lot of uncertainty
whether this weekend’s meeting will come out with a definitive
plan or there’s more to come after that,” Colonial’s Halmarick
said.  Factory-machinery makers rose after the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index increased to 8.7
from minus 17.5 last month, the biggest one-month rebound in 31
years.  Fanuc gained 2.4 percent to 12,170 yen. Mitsubishi Electric
Corp., which makes 25 percent of revenue from factory automation
equipment, rose 2.7 percent to 712 yen.  Samsung, Hynix  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average closed little changed
after rising as much as 0.2 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
lost 0.1 percent.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 0.2 percent,
erasing losses of as much as 0.3 percent.  South Korea ’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  climbed 1.8 percent on
speculation the nation’s earnings will withstand a slowdown in
the global economy. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-
biggest handset maker, rose 1.1 percent to 917,000 won on a Wall
Street Journal report that its smartphone shipments beat Apple
Inc’s in the last quarter.  Hynix Semiconductor rose 10 percent to 23,200 won in Seoul
after research company IHS iSuppli said Apple used the company’s
NAND-flash chips in the iPhone for the first time. LG Display
Co., the world’s second-largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, jumped 7.8 percent to 24,250 won after analysts from
LIG Investment & Securities Co. and Hyundai Securities Co. said
losses will narrow in the current quarter.  STX Slides  STX Pan Ocean Co., South Korea’s largest bulk-shipping
line, fell by as much as the daily limit in  Seoul  trading and
affiliates tumbled on speculation group companies may sell stock
to help pay debt. STX Pan Ocean dropped as much as 15 percent
and fell 10 percent to 6,640 won at the close.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 16 percent this year
through yesterday amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will damage
the banking system and U.S. growth is sputtering. That compares
with slides of 3.4 percent by the  S&P 500  and 16 percent by the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued
at 11.7 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.2
times for the S&P 500 and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Japanese trading companies fell after the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials fell 1 percent
yesterday, set for a 3 percent weekly loss. Mitsui & Co. dropped
3.3 percent to 1,057 yen, while  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  slid 2.5
percent to 1,478 yen, while  Itochu Corp. (8001)  lost 1.8 percent to 731
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
