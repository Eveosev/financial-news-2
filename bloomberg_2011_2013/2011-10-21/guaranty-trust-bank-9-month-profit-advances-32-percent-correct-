(Corrects analyst comment in third paragraph on weaker
quarter-on-quarter earnings in story published yesterday.)  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc,  Nigeria ’s
second-largest lender by market value, posted a 32 percent
increase in profit for the nine months through September.  Net income climbed to 37.9 billion naira ($243 million)
compared with 28.8 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based
lender said in a statement published on the website of the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange  today. Revenue advanced 18 percent to
126.1 billion from 107.2 billion from a year earlier.  The lender has made a “steady rebound in credit”  which
supports its future earnings potential, Adesoji Solanke, a
Lagos-based banking analyst at  Renaissance Capital , wrote in an
e-mailed note.  The Lagos-based bank’s loans and advances rose 18 percent
to 666.6 billion naira from 563.4 billion naira a year earlier.
Deposits jumped 25 percent to 888.8 billion naira from 713.1
billion naira.  Guaranty Trust’s shares declined for the first day in four,
retreating 30 kobo, or 2.2 percent to 13.2 naira at the close of
trading in Lagos, the commercial capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
