Dutch financial markets regulator
AFM said a European Union proposal to curb high-frequency
trading is a “bad plan,” Het Financieele Dagblad reported,
citing an interview withRene Maatman, an AFM board member.  The proposals to overhaul the EU’s Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive, or Mifid, will drive high-frequency
traders out of  Europe , Maatman was cited as saying. The AFM and
the Dutch  finance ministry  will try to have the proposal
revised, the  Dutch newspaper  said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
