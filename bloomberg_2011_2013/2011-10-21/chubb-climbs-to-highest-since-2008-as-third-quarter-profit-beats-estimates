Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, rose to a record after
earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  Chubb, based in Warren,  New Jersey , climbed $3.36, or 5.1
percent, to $68.71 at 4:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, its highest closing price. It reached $68.78
earlier in the day.  Third-quarter operating profit was 88 cents a share, the
company said in a statement yesterday after the close of regular
trading. That beat the 77-cent average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We believe its premium valuation is warranted based on
its strong franchise, excess capital and our outlook for Chubb
to generate among the highest return on equity of property and
casualty insurers,”  Jay Gelb , senior analyst at Barclays Plc,
said in a statement yesterday. He rates Chubb “overweight.”  Net income fell to $298 million from $572 million a year
earlier as pretax catastrophe costs surged to $420 million from
$58 million. Hurricane Irene pounded the U.S. East Coast in
August with flooding rains and high winds. The storm may cost
insurers as much as $5.5 billion, modeling firm Risk Management
Solutions Inc. said in a September  statement .  Chubb posted its smallest profit since it had net income of
$246.4 million for the third quarter of 2005, when Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita slammed the U.S. Gulf Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
