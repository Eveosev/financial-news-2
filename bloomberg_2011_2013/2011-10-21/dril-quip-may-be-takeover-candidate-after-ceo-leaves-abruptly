Dril-Quip Inc. (DRQ) ’s “surprising”
announcement of the immediate retirement of its chief executive
officer increases the possibility that the oilfield-equipment
maker will be viewed as a takeover target, analysts said.  J. Mike Walker, a co-founder of the company, stepped down
from his role as chairman and CEO effective immediately,
Houston-based Dril-Quip said in a statement yesterday.  “With the last of three original founding co-CEOs leaving,
M&A discussion rightfully heats up,” Tudor, Pickering, Holt &
Co., a Houston-based investment bank, said in a note to clients
today, referring to the merger and acquisition potential.  Dril-Quip rose as much as 8.4 percent, the biggest intraday
increase since May 2010. The shares gained 5.6 percent to $63.23
at 9:35 a.m. in  New York . Before today, Dril-Quip had declined
23 percent this year.  Walker co-founded the company in 1981 and it began trading
publicly in 1997, according to its website. Blake DeBerry, who
was senior vice president of sales and engineering, will take
over as CEO and John Lovoi, managing partner of JVL Advisors LLC
and a board member since 2005, will take over as chairman, the
company said.  The announcement was “a surprising development” at a
company that “has often been considered (and reported to be) an
acquisition target,” according to a note today from J.  David Anderson , Samantha Hoh and William S. Thompson, analysts with
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Jerry Brooks, chief financial officer of Dril-Quip, didn’t
immediately respond to a voicemail message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
