Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-
largest maker of  luxury vehicles , will increase investment in
its U.S. car factory to $2.4 billion as it adds new Mercedes-
Benz models at the site.  An unidentified new Mercedes vehicle will be built at the
factory in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama , starting in 2015, the Stuttgart,
Germany-based company said today in a statement. Investment in
production facilities for the vehicle will total $350 million,
adding to the planned spending of more than $2 billion at the
site, Daimler said.  “This new model from the Tuscaloosa plant is an important
element of our growth strategy,” Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said in the statement. “It is one of the ten additional
models which we will introduce within the next four years.”  Mercedes aims to overtake  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  as
the luxury-car leader by 2020. The company is working to boost
sales by rolling out new models, including a line of five small
cars. Mercedes also plans to expand its lineup of high-end
luxury cars with new variations of the S-Class flagship model
after the vehicle is overhauled in 2013, two people familiar
with the situation said last month.  The Tuscaloosa plant, Mercedes’s only factory in the U.S.,
currently has capacity to build about 160,000 cars a year. The
planned investment between 2010 and 2014 includes adding
facilities to produce the best-selling C-Class sedan as of 2014
and buying equipment for new versions of the M- and GL-Class
sport-utility vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
