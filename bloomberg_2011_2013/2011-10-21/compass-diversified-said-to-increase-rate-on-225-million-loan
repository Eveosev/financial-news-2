 Compass Group Diversified Holdings
LLC, an owner of manufacturing and staffing companies, increased
the  interest rate  it will pay on $225 million of loans it’s
seeking to refinance debt and fund future acquisitions,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  A $225 million last-out term loan B maturing in six years
will now pay 6 percentage points more than the London interbank
offered rate compared with 5.25 percentage points to 5.5
percentage points initially offered, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms are private. A Libor
floor will remain unchanged at 1.5 percent. In a liquidation
lenders in first-out debt are repaid before last-out creditors.  The company is proposing to sell the loan at 96 cents on
dollar, compared with 97 cents to 98 cents initially proposed,
reducing proceeds for the company and boosting the yield to
investors.  A five year first-out revolving line of credit was
increased to $290 million from $275 million, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is arranging the deal for the
Westport, Connecticut-based company is expected to distributed
the debt to investors early next week, the person said.  Alan Offenberg, chief executive officer of Compass, didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  A term loan B is mainly bought by non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank-loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
