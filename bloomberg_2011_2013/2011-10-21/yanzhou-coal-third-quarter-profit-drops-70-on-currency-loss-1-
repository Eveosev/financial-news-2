Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.,  China ’s
fourth-biggest producer of the fuel, posted a 70 percent drop in
third-quarter profit from a year earlier because of foreign-
exchange losses.  Net income dropped to 1.1 billion yuan ($172 million) from
3.7 billion yuan a year earlier, the Shandong-based company said
in a statement to the  Hong Kong  Stock Exchange today.  Yanzhou, which bought Australia’s Felix Resources Ltd. for
A$3.1 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2009, reported a 1 billion-yuan
foreign-exchange loss in the third quarter after the Australian
dollar fell 10 percent against the U.S. currency during the
period. The Chinese coal producer posted a 1.8 billion-yuan
foreign-currency gain a year earlier.  “It’s payback for what it gained from last year,” said
 Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based mining analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd.
“Everyone in the market had been expecting the exchange loss.”  Production of raw coal rose 9.2 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier to 14.4 million metric tons, the
company said in the statement. Output gained 11 percent in the
first nine months to 40.1 million tons.  The shares have slumped 24 percent in Hong Kong trading
this year, compared with the 22 percent drop in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index . Yanzhou rose 0.7 percent to close at HK$18.10
today, before the earnings announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
