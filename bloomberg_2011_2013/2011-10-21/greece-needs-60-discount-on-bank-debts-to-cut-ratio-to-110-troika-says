Greek debt would fall to just above
120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 by using 6 percent
discount bonds with 50 percent discounts and no collateral, the
European Commission,  International Monetary Fund  and  European
Central Bank  said.  It would take a 60 percent face value reduction and more
official financing to cut the debt below 110 percent of GDP by
2020, according to the report, which was obtained by Bloomberg
News.  “The ECB does not agree with the inclusion of these
illustrative scenarios concerning a deeper PSI in this report,”
according to a footnote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
