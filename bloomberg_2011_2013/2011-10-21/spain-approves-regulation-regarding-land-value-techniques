Spain â€™s Cabinet approved regulation
regarding land valution techniques in order to improve
efficiency and transparency and avoid speculative practices in
the market, the Ministry of Development and Public Works said in
an e-mailed statement.  Rural plots of land will no longer be valued on a
comparative basis to other similar plots, according to the
statement. Urban land will be valued by comparing it with
similar peices of land using current market prices, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
