Austria  revised down its 2010
deficit to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product after the
European statistics office told it to book a writedown on a
nationalized bank this year rather than last.  Austria booked a 700 million-euro ($1 billion) writedown on
its stake in Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG last year as
the lender prepared for a capital decrease it announced May 30.
The government was told by Luxembourg-based Eurostat to rebook
the charge in this year’s budget because the measure was
executed in 2011, Harald Waiglein, a Finance Ministry spokesman,
said in a telephone interview today.  While the revision will increase this year’s deficit,
Austria will still beat its plan to report a deficit of 3.9
percent of GDP, Waiglein said. Based on current trends, the
deficit will probably stand at 3.6 percent at the end of this
year including the Hypo Alpe charge, he said.  Hypo Alpe reduced its capital to wipe out 814.6 million
euros of accumulated losses, it said in May. The measure
canceled 69 percent of Hypo Alpe’s share capital and of non-
voting participation capital injected in 2008 and 2009, causing
a loss of about 700 million euros for the Austrian government as
well as losses for the non-voting capital owned by former
shareholders including BayernLB.  To contact the reporters on this story:
