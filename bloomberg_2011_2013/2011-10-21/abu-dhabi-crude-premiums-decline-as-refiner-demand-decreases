Premiums for Middle East crude oil
fell for the first time in eight days on concerns that refinery
demand may slow.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., dropped 8
cents to a premium of 23 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Lower Zakum, also produced in the emirate, declined 8
cents to a premium of 15 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Refinery demand for crude in the  spot market  is starting to
wane, said two traders who participate in the market. Companies
were still offering cargoes of Murban at premiums of about 30
cents a barrel, the traders said.  The Dubai swaps premium for November widened today compared
with January to $1.61 a barrel from $1.51, according to data
from PVM. This market situation known as backwardation suggests
demand is greater for immediate shipments.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose 15 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $106.26 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in December climbed 0.1 percent to $105.63. Murban
for spot delivery increased 0.1 percent to $110.45.  Oman futures for December delivery fell 15 cents to $107.90
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:25 p.m. Singapore
time with 1,455 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$107.75 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The December Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 20 cents to $5.30 a barrel, said PVM. The exchange for
swaps for January rose 13 cents to $4.79.  To contact the reporter on this story:
