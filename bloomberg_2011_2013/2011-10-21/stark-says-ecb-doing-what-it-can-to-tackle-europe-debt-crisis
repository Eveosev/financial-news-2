European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the institution is playing its
part in fighting  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  “We do what we can at the side of the ECB to tackle the
crisis as far as the mandate is concerned,” Stark said during
an event in Warsaw today. “Some are concerned that we have gone
beyond the mandate and are at least close to the red line.”  Stark added that the “logic of the Maastrict Treaty”
which set up the single currency is still correct, in that it
prohibits the monetary financing of states by the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
