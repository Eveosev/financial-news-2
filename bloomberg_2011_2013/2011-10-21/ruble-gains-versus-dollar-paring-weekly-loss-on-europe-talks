The ruble climbed, paring its first
weekly drop in three, as the possibility of a $1.3 trillion
deployment to fight  Europe ’s debt crisis buoyed appetite for
riskier assets.  The Russian currency strengthened 1 percent to 31.0350 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, paring its first weekly
drop in three to 0.5 percent. The ruble weakened 0.5 percent to
43.16 per euro.  Euro-area leaders will meet twice next week to discuss
their response to the debt crisis, including a plan to provide
$1.3 trillion. Crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, added
2.3 percent to $88.05 a barrel, while Urals, the country’s main
export blend, slipped 0.2 percent to $109.53 a barrel after a
1.1 percent jump yesterday.  Investors pared bets the ruble will weaken further, with
non-deliverable forwards showing it at 31.5533 per dollar in
three months’ time. The ruble’s movements against the euro and
the dollar left it 0.2 percent stronger at 36.4912 against the
central bank’s dollar-euro basket, which the regulator targets
to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations that can hurt exporters.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble against a so-called floating
corridor that currently stands at 32.70 to 37.70 against the
basket, First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  told reporters in
Moscow Oct. 10. Ulyukayev reiterated the weaker end of the band
in comments to reporters in Moscow yesterday.  Russian dollar bonds due 2015 rose, pushing the yield down
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.326 percent.
Dollar debt due 2020 yielded seven basis points less than
yesterday, at 4.639 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
