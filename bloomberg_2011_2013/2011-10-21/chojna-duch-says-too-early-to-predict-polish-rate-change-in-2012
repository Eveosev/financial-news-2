It’s too early to say if Polish
 interest rates  will change next year and whether the next move
will be a cut or an increase, Elzbieta Chojna-Duch of the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Council said today in Warsaw.  There are “possibilities” that  Poland ’s economy may grow
as fast as 3.5 percent next year, Chojna-Duch told reporters on
the sidelines of a central banking conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
