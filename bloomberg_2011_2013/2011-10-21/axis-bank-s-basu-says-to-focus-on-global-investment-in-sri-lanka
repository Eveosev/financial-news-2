Ashok K. Basu, chief executive
officer of  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB) ’s Sri Lankan unit, comments on the
island nation’s economic prospects after India’s third-largest
private lender opened its first branch in the capital, Colombo.
He spoke by telephone.  On  Sri Lanka ’s economic prospects:  “We have a very strong medium and longer-term outlook on
Sri Lanka. There is a local aspiration to grow rapidly now that
the strife is over.”  On Axis Bank’s plans in Sri Lanka:  “We believe foreign investment will definitely come in and
that will be our critical focus area. Now mostly it’s government
to government but we want to bring business from India and
wherever we have a presence internationally.  ‘‘There will be a need for infrastructure financing and
syndication, as the country builds roads, ports and railways.
There is a critical requirement to create a solid base for Sri
Lanka’s services industry to take off.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
