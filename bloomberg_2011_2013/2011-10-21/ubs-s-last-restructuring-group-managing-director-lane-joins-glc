Doug Lane, a former managing
director in the restructuring group at  UBS AG (UBS) , is leaving the
Swiss bank to join  GLC Advisors & Co. , the advisory arm of
merchant bank Global Leveraged Capital.  Lane, 41, will be based in  San Francisco  and will join
former UBS bankers at GLC including Thomas Benninger, who was
global head of restructuring, and Soren Reynertson, who was
previously a managing director in the group and headed its
European team. Lane was the last managing director at UBS
dedicated to restructuring, according to Torie von Alt, a
spokeswoman for Zurich-based UBS.  “Doug will be an important addition to our franchise as we
expand our business,” said Reynertson. “We believe the absence
of economic growth, lack of credit available to middle-market
borrowers and continued global market volatility will inevitably
lead to increased defaults.”  UBS,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, is shrinking its
investment bank amid market turmoil that curbed client activity.
The lender’s restructuring effort, which had been a standalone
business for about two years, has been moved under leveraged
finance, where it previously resided, according to von Alt.  Steven Smith , the former head of restructuring at UBS, left
the bank last month and is in talks to join private-equity firm
Aurora Capital Group, people familiar with the matter said at
the time. Smith, Benninger and Lane joined UBS about a decade
ago and worked previously at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.,
which was acquired in 2000 by  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   To contact the reporters on this story:
