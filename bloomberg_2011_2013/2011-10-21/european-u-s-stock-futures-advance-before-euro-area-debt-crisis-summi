European stocks advanced, with the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index completing its longest stretch of weekly
gains this year, as policy makers discussed deploying $1.3
trillion in funds to help contain the euro area’s debt crisis.  Banks and mining companies rebounded from their biggest
selloffs in more than two weeks.  Valeo SA (FR)  rose 6.6 percent after
reporting an increase in sales. Lundin Petroleum AB surged 9.8
percent after Statoil ASA doubled its estimate of an oil
discovery in the North Sea.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 2.5 percent to 238.93 at the close
in London. The benchmark measure extended gains after  Fitch
Ratings  said it has no plans to change France’s AAA sovereign
credit rating. The gauge rose 0.2 percent this week, its fourth
week of gains for the longest weekly winning streak since last
December.  “The markets want a three- or four-point plan that is
credible and offers a long-term solution to the crisis,” said
Sailesh Bhundia, a London-based senior portfolio manager at EFG
Asset Management, which oversees about $6.5 billion. “People
want to feel bullish, but they can’t with this political
overhang.”  U.S. stocks erased losses in late afternoon trading
yesterday and the euro rose after two people familiar with the
matter said the euro area may combine its  temporary  and
permanent rescue funds to pool as much as 940 billion euros
($1.3 trillion).  That option may be one way out of the impasse between the
euro region’s two biggest economies. Finance ministers are
meeting in Brussels today to lay the groundwork for the Oct. 23
meeting of government leaders.  Second Summit  A second summit for Oct. 26 was set yesterday after Germany
and France said the European Union needs more time to seal a
“global and ambitious” accord. In Greece, Prime Minister
 George Papandreou  won a parliamentary vote on further austerity
measures designed to secure more aid under the 2010 bailout.  The Stoxx 600 completed its fourth week of gains as concern
eased that Europe’s leaders remain far from agreeing on a
strategy to contain the crisis. France and Germany disagree over
the role of the  European Central Bank  and  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  canceled a speech to German parliament scheduled for
today.  “Investors are finding it difficult to model the behavior
of politicians,” said EFG’s Bhundia. “There is still a lot of
cash on the sidelines. People are holding tight to see where
Europe leads.”  National benchmark indexes rallied in every western-
European market, except Luxembourg. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) 
climbed 1.9 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index increased 2.8 percent
and Germany’s DAX Index jumped 3.6 percent.  UniCredit, Santander Gain  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  surged 6.6 percent to 90.2 euro cents,  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  rose 2.9 percent to 6.03 euros and Societe Generale
SA gained 5.6 percent to 18.97 euros as a gauge of Europe’s
lenders rebounded from yesterday’s 4 percent selloff which was
the biggest decline since Oct. 4.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  added 3.1 percent to 856.5 pence, Rio Tinto
Group climbed 4.5 percent to 3,151 pence and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) 
increased 5.5 percent to 1,096 pence as copper rose for the
first time in five days in London. Zinc and lead also climbed. A
gauge of commodity companies tumbled 3.6 percent yesterday, its
steepest retreat since Oct. 4.  Valeo advanced 6.6 percent to 35.85 euros after France’s
second-largest auto-parts maker confirmed its 2011 guidance and
reported a 14 percent increase in third-quarter revenue to 2.66
billion euros. Chief Executive Officer Jacques Aschenbroich said
the company forecasts continued growth in 2012.  Lundin, Neste Oil  Lundin surged 9.8 percent to 156.20 kronor after Statoil
doubled its estimate for a North Sea discovery. The Aldous Major
South find may hold 900 million to 1.5 billion barrels of
recoverable oil equivalent, twice as much as Statoil’s previous
estimate. Combined with Lundin’s neighboring Avaldsnes, the
field holds as much as 3.3 billion barrels of recoverable
resources.  Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V)  rallied 5.7 percent to 7.83 euros after
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation for the Finnish
oil refiner to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) , Europe’s second-largest tour
operator, soared 13 percent to 51.5 pence after the company’s
banks relaxed loan conditions and agreed to provide additional
short-term funds.  Scania Rises  Scania AB (SCVB)  gained 5 percent to 107.60 kronor after the
Swedish truckmaker reported a 2 percent increase in third-
quarter profit to 2.34 billion kronor ($356 million), beating
analysts’ estimates. Sales rose 14 percent.  Safran SA (SAF)  plunged 8 percent to 22.20 euros, for the biggest
drop in the Stoxx 600, after demand for spare parts came in at
the bottom end of its forecast for the full year of 10 percent
to 15 percent. The maker of  jet engines  today reported a 5.2
percent gain in third-quarter sales to 2.73 billion euros.  Ericsson AB lost 2 percent to 66.75 kronor after Evolution
Group Plc lowered its recommendation for the world’s largest
maker of wireless networks to “neutral” and Svenska
Handelsbanken AG said Ericsson’s shares lack “meaningful
upside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
