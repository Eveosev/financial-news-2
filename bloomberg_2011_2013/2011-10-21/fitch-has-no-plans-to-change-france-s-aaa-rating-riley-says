Fitch Ratings  has no plans to change
France’s AAA credit rating, according to  David Riley , the
company’s head of sovereign ratings.  “Our rating is AAA, our stable outlook indicates we don’t
have any plans to change that rating,” Riley said in an
interview at the AFME European Government Bond Conference in
Brussels today. “We don’t think the changes to the EFSF put
France’s AAA at risk,” he said, referring to the European
Financial Stability Facility bailout fund.  The yield premium investors demand to hold French
government 10-year bonds rather than similar-maturity German
debt has soared this month on mounting concern that contagion
from the sovereign debt crisis has leeched into Europe’s larger
economies. The spread was at 113 basis points at 2:38 p.m.
London time, from 71.5 basis points at the end of September.  Even so, Riley said  France  faces the challenges of
“bringing the  budget deficit  down, stabilizing the level of
public debt and, like the U.K. and the U.S., the room for
maneuver that France has on public finances is diminishing.”  A Standard & Poor’s report today said France is among euro-
region sovereigns likely to be downgraded in the event of a
stressed economic scenario. Moody’s Investors Service earlier
said the nation’s ranking was under pressure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
