Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co.,  China â€™s second-biggest wind-turbine maker, said
profit declined 75 percent in the third quarter and warned of a
50 to 100 percent slump in full-year net income as selling
prices drop.  Net income was 190.4 million yuan ($30 million) compared
with 759.2 million yuan a year earlier, Goldwind said in a
filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange today. Sales fell 9
percent to 4.2 billion yuan.  The Urumqi, Xinjiang province-based company attributed the
decline in profit to slower growth in the wind energy industry,
increasing market competition, and falling average selling
prices of wind turbines, Goldwind said.  Goldwind and other Chinese turbine producers are struggling
with slower sales in their home market after the government
tightened criteria for approving new projects, prompting the
manufacturers to seek orders overseas.  The company is targeting opportunities in  North America ,
 Europe , Australia, South America and Africa, Vice President Ma Jinru said last month.  The stock rose 0.1 percent to close at 9.20 yuan in
Shenzhen trading. The Hong Kong-listed shares gained 3.6 percent
to HK$4.04.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
