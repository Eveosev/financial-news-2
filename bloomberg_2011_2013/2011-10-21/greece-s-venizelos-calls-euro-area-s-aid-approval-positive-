Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said the euro area’s approval of the sixth
disbursement of funds under last year’s rescue was a “positive
step” that justified budget cuts and would lead to better aid
terms in a new financing package.  “The sacrifices of the Greek people and the implementation
of tough, but nationally imperative, rescue measures are the
basis not only of the sixth tranche but also of the new program
that secures the long-term sustainability of Greek public
debt,” Venizelos said in an e-mailed statement today after the
endorsement by euro-area finance chiefs in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
