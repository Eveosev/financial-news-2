earnings. It also downgraded  MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings (8725)  Inc.

loss of 250 million yen ($3.3 million) for the six months
through September, compared with its forecast for a 450 million

Enplas cited the yen’s appreciation for the result, and said it
had yet to factor in the effects of flooding in Thailand.  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270)  (7270 JT), a maker of passenger
cars and buses, gained 3.2 percent to 484 yen. JPMorgan Chase &

yen. The automaker’s operating profit quadrupled to 28 billion

advanced 2.6 percent to 560 yen. The company said net income
beat its forecast by 36 percent, surging to 3 billion yen for
the six months through September, attributing the results partly
to demand for temporary housing. The need for such accommodation
has risen since the March earthquake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
