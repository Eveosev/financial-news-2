Transgene SA (TNG) ’s experimental drug
TG4010 combined with chemotherapy helped more  lung-cancer 
patients live without the disease progressing than standard
treatment alone, researchers found.  Six months after receiving the treatment, tumors had been
kept at bay in 43 percent of patients who received TG4010 plus
chemotherapy, compared with 35 percent of those on chemotherapy
alone, according to a study published today in The Lancet
Oncology.  Researchers led by Elisabeth Quoix the University of
Strasbourg in France treated 148 patients with advanced non-
small-cell lung cancer, the most-common form of the cancer, in
the mid-stage clinical trial, according to the study.  In advanced lung cancer, tumor cells alter and overproduce
a protein known as MUC1, according to a statement from the U.K.
medical journal. TG4010 is a so-called therapeutic vaccine
designed to trigger the body’s immune system and mount a
response against MUC1.  Patients with a normal number of a certain type of white
blood cells called lymphocytes benefited even more, the
researchers found. The level of those lymphocytes in the blood
may be used as a so-called biomarker to help identify which
patients will benefit, they said.  Transgene, based in Illkirch,  France , near Strasbourg,
funded the study. An additional mid-stage trial has begun to
confirm the findings, according to the researchers.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
