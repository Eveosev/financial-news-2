LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , the port company
controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, rose the most
in a week after it signed a rental contract that may imply
higher valuations for future agreements.  The stock climbed 3.1 percent to 3.68 reais at 12:38 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. The Bovespa index increased 2.5 percent. LLX is
down 5.6 percent this week, compared to the benchmark’s 0.6
percent gain.  LLX signed a rental agreement with NKT Flexibles I/S for
the Acu port it’s building in Rio de Janeiro state, with annual
revenue estimated at about 8 million reais ($4.5 million),
according to a regulatory filing yesterday after the market
closed. The deal with NKT, which makes flexible pipes for
offshore oil and gas and chemicals companies, implies a rental
price 2.1 times higher than UBS AG’s estimates, Sao Paulo-based
analyst Victor Mizusaki said in a note to clients today.  “Announcing new contracts with offshore companies, and
confirming that higher rental prices can also justify a
reduction in the execution risk for this project, could provide
upside potential to our price target,” Mizusaki wrote,
referring to a 12-month share forecast of 8.20 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
