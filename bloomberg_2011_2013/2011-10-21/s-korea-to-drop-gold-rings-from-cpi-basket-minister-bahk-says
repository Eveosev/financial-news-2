South Korea  will drop gold rings
from the basket of goods comprising its consumer-price index in
November, trimming the inflation rate, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said.  “Many people aren’t buying gold rings any more as they’re
expensive,” Bahk told lawmakers in parliament in Seoul today.
“Taking out gold rings, inflation may be below 4 percent.”  Higher gold prices have skewed inflation figures in Asian
nations including India and  Indonesia . A 29 percent jump in the
cost of gold rings pushed South Korea’s inflation past 5 percent
for the first time in three years in August.  South Koreans are buying gold as an investment asset rather
than a consumer product, Bang Tae Kyoung, deputy director of the
statistics agency, said last month. The nation has a tradition
of giving what is called a “Dol” ring as a gift for a child’s
first birthday.  Consumer prices rose 4.3 percent last month, still above
the central bank’s target ceiling of 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
