The budget committee in  Germany ’s
lower house of parliament approved guidelines for the region’s
rescue fund that exclude proposals on how to leverage its
firepower, said Ulrich Scharlack, spokesman of the parliamentary
group of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic Union .  “We assume that the leveraging” of the European Financial
Stability Facility “will be decided at the Brussels summit on
Oct. 23,” Scharlack said by telephone today, adding that this
decision would then have to be presented to the budget committee
in Berlin for approval before Merkel could return to Brussels
for a second European summit on Oct. 26.  European leaders will hold two summits in four days in an
effort to break a deadlock on how to tackle the region’s debt
crisis. The budget committee called on Merkel to ensure there is
no EFSF leveraging via the  European Central Bank  and that the
fund isn’t allowed to operate as a bank.  Germany’s guarantees to the EFSF of as much as 211 billion
euros ($292 billion) must not be exceeded, the committee said.  “These things have to be decided before Merkel goes to
Brussels” for the Oct. 26 summit, Scharlack said, adding that
such decisions could not be taken retroactively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
