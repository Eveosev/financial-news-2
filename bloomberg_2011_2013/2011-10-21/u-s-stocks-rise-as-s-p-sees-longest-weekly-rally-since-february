U.S. stocks rose this week, driving
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest winning streak
since February, amid optimism  Europe ’s leaders will announce a
plan to contain the debt crisis and after  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) 
joined companies beating profit estimates.  Financial shares in the S&P 500 added 3.9 percent as
European finance ministers began negotiations to prevent a Greek
default and shield banks. McDonald’s rose 2.7 percent, while
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed more
than 4.3 percent after their quarterly reports. PulteGroup Inc.
jumped 11 percent as data showed sentiment among homebuilders
improved more than forecast.  El Paso Corp. (EP)  soared 28 percent
after Kinder Morgan Inc. agreed to buy it.  The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 percent to 1,238.25, the highest
since Aug. 3, and has risen three straight weeks. It has surged
13 percent since Oct. 3, when it closed within 1 percent of a
 bear market , or 20 percent plunge, from its high in April. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose a fourth straight week,
gaining 164.30 points, or 1.4 percent, to 11,808.79.  “We’ve had a combination of good economic news, better
news out of Europe and third-quarter corporate earnings are
coming along pretty well,”  Philip Orlando , the New York-based
chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said
in a phone interview. His firm oversees about $355 billion.  Equities rose yesterday as European finance ministers
approved a 5.8 billion euro ($8.1 billion) loan to Greece, and
France retreated in a clash with Germany over expanding the
bailout fund. Talks continue through Oct. 26. The  S&P 500  also
gained after 74 percent of companies that reported quarterly
results topped the average analyst projection.  JPMorgan Tops BofA  Financial stocks rallied the most out of 10 groups in the
S&P 500 this week following gains in European lenders. Bank of
America, which has dropped 52 percent this year for the worst
performance in the Dow, jumped 4.4 percent to $6.46. It posted
third-quarter net income of $6.23 billion because of higher
revenue, better credit quality and one-time gains.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  added 4.8 percent to $33.42. It topped
Bank of America as the largest U.S. bank by assets and posted
the most third-quarter trading revenue among Wall Street firms
that has reported results so far, leading for a fourth
consecutive period.  Goldman Sachs climbed 5.5 percent, the most since November,
to $102.09 as investors looked past the bank’s second quarterly
loss since 1999, focusing on gains in trading revenue and
prospects for a rebound in underwriting and takeovers.  Morgan Stanley (MS)   Morgan Stanley gained 12 percent, the most since July, to
$17.02. The owner of the world’s largest brokerage reported
profit that beat analysts’ estimates on a $3.4 billion
accounting gain and higher revenue from stock trading.  McDonald’s rose 2.7 percent to a record $92.32. The world’s
biggest restaurant chain reported third-quarter earnings of
$1.45 a share, beating the $1.43 average analyst estimate, as
lower-priced items boosted U.S. sales.  Profit for S&P 500 companies climbed 16 percent in the
third quarter and will rise 18 percent to a record $99.25 for
all of 2011, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The earnings so far have implied that we’re not in a
recession,”  Ralph Shive , the South Bend, Indiana-based manager
of the $1.65 billion Wasatch-Large Cap Value Fund, said in a
telephone interview. “They were pretty stable and a slight
positive as opposed to falling off the cliff.”  Builders Rise  Homebuilders advanced as data showed the U.S. industry was
less pessimistic than forecast in October as near record-low
borrowing costs and price decreases raised hopes the market will
improve in the next six months. PulteGroup rallied 11 percent to
$4.90. D.R. Horton Inc. increased 8.7 percent to $10.83.  Companies most-tied to the economy gained this week as the
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index advanced 1.8 percent to its
highest level since Aug. 31.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  added 6.1 percent to
$12.26. Sears Holdings Corp., the largest U.S. department-store
chain, increased 4.8 percent to $74.95.  Leon Cooperman , the chairman of hedge fund Omega Advisors
Inc., said the  U.S. economy  will avoid a recession and American
equities offer “appealing valuations.”  “Stocks are cheap relative to history, relative to
inflation, relative to  interest rates ,” he said during a
presentation at the Value Investing Congress in  New York  on Oct.
18. “The recent facts suggest the economy is accelerating
moderately.”  Highest Since 2002  El Paso Corp. surged 28 percent to $24.99, its highest
price since May 2002. Kinder Morgan agreed to buy the company
for $21.1 billion, the energy industry’s biggest transaction in
more than a year, to create the largest natural-gas pipeline
network in the U.S. Kinder Morgan gained 8.7 percent, the
biggest weekly gain since its initial public offering in
February, to $29.22.  Technology stocks lost the most in the S&P 500, slipping
2.2 percent, after  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  missed profit forecasts and
flooding in  Thailand  caused the worst supply disruptions since
the March earthquake that crippled  Japan .  Apple slipped 6.9 percent, the most since July 2010, to
$392.87. The maker of iPhones and iPads missed the average
analyst profit estimate for the first time since at least 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Western Digital Corp. (WDC)  lost 8.4 percent to $25.97. The maker
of disk drives expects a loss this quarter and forecast sales
below analysts’ predictions as the worst flooding in five
decades hobbles production in Thailand.  Seagate Technology Plc surged 31 percent, the most since
March 2009, to $15.42. The company may gain market share from
Western Digital because Seagate will recover from the flooding
two quarters faster, according to ThinkEquity LLC’s Rajesh Ghai.  “Seagate’s capacity does not appear to be as severely
impaired,” Ghai wrote in a report yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
