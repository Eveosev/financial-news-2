French business confidence fell for
a fourth month in October amid concern that slowing global
growth and  Europe ’s debt crisis will crimp demand.  Confidence among factory executives fell to 97 from 99 in
September, national statistics office Insee said today in Paris.
Economists expected a reading of 98, according to the median of
14 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News.  Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said this week that France
will probably not achieve the 1.75 percent growth he has been
predicting for next year and pledged further deficit-reduction
efforts to protect the nation’s credit rating. European leaders
gather in Brussels in coming days in a bid to end the region’s
debt crisis.  “The doom and gloom” is affecting sentiment, said
 Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris. “The
situation in Europe has yet to stabilize.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
