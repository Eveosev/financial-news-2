Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  workers may
go on strike starting Nov. 16 depending on wage talks with the
state-run oil producer, the Brazilian oil workers union known as
FUP said on its  website .  The union will hold a work slowdown starting on Oct. 27,
and it set a Nov. 10 deadline to conclude negotiations with the
Rio de Janeiro-based producer. Petrobras will hold meetings with
the union next week, Petrobras’s press office said in an e-
mailed statement today.  FUP is demanding a 10 percent wage raise over inflation and
better work and security conditions, the union said Oct. 4.
Petrobras, which produces about 90 percent of Brazil’s oil,
granted a 9.4 percent increase in 2010.  Petrobras rose 2.4 percent to 19.27 reais at the close in
 Sao Paulo  and has declined 29 percent this year, compared with
the 20 percent slump in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
