It’s too early for  Poland  to relax
monetary policies because curbing inflation to the central
bank’s 2.5 percent target has an overriding priority and all
other considerations are “secondary,”  Andrzej Kazmierczak  of
the Monetary Policy Council said today in Warsaw.  “First we need to fight inflation and get back to the
target, and only then think about stimulating the economy,”
Kazmierczak told reporters on the sidelines of a central banking
conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
