Nicolas Eyzaguirre, a director at
the  International Monetary Fund  and a former finance minister in
 Chile , called on Chileâ€™s government to raise taxes to finance
increased spending on education, Diario Financiero reported.  The South American nation has a higher level of inequality
than countries of similar income per capita and its education
system is classist and discriminatory, Eyzaguirre said in an
interview with the Santiago-based newspaper.  The increased spending required to solve the problem needs
to be financed through higher taxes or Chile would risk
disrupting its solid macroeconomic policy, Eyzaguirre said,
according to the paper.  Chilean students have been protesting for five months in
support of demands for improved education, with almost weekly
riots in Santiago and thousands of high school pupils missing
months of classes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
