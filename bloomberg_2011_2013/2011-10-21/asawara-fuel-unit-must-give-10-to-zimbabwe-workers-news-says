FMI Energy (Pvt) Ltd., a unit of
London-listed  Masawara Plc (MASA) , must cede a 10 percent stake to
former employees of BP & Shell Marketing Services (Pvt) Ltd.,
the Daily News said, citing Zimbabwe’s Indigenization Minister,
Saviour Kasukuwere.  Kasukuwere said FMI Energy had promised to set up an
employee share-ownership trust by the end of the month, the
 Daily News  said.  Masawara bought BP Plc’s and Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s
Zimbabwe units last year, including 73 fuel outlets and 60
million liters (15.9 million gallons) of  storage tanks  across
the southern African nation. The company is 63.4 percent owned
by Zimbabwean businessman Shingai Mutasa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
