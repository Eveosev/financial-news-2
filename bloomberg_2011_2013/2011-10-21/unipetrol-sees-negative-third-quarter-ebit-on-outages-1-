Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the largest Czech
refiner, will report negative earnings before interest and tax
in the third quarter as petrochemical sales dropped and an
outage at its Litvinov refinery curbed production.  The loss will wipe out second-quarter earnings, the company
said  today  in a trading statement posted on its website.
Unipetrol, controlled by Polski Koncern Naftowy Orlen SA, will
book a charge of 230 million koruna ($12.7 million) from a fine
it has to pay the European Commission.  Crude oil throughput dropped 15 percent in the quarter when
compared with the previous three-month period, and declined 20
percent from the year-ago period, according to the statement.  Sales of petrochemicals fell 10 percent in the quarter from
the previous three-month period, the company said. PKN holds 63
percent of Unipetrol.  The Brent-Urals differential, or the difference between
prices of higher-quality Brent crude and Urals oil which
Unipetrol uses as a profitability gauge, narrowed to 0.7 from
2.9 in the previous quarter, curbing profits from refining.  Sales of fuels fell 1 percent in the quarter and declined 9
percent from the year-ago period as high gasoline and diesel
prices prompted more Czechs to buy fuels in neighboring
countries, Unipetrol said.  Unipetrolâ€™s expenditures in the third quarter rose to 800
million koruna because of repair costs during the refinery
outage, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
