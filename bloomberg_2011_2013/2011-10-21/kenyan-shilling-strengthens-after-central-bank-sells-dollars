Kenya ’s shilling headed for a second
week of gains after the central offered to sell an unspecified
amount of dollars.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.8 percent to 99.30 per dollar and was trading 0.3
percent stronger at 99.85 by 12:58 p.m. in Nairobi, taking its
gain this week to 0.4 percent. Yesterday was a public holiday.  An official at the  Central Bank  of Kenya, who declined to
be identified in accordance with bank policy, wouldn’t disclose
how much U.S. currency was sold.  “The shilling has strengthened on the back of central bank
continued sale of dollars in the foreign exchange market,”
Duncan Kinuthia a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of
Africa Ltd., said by phone today.  Kenya’s government reduced commercial banks foreign
exchange exposure limit to 10 percent of core capital from 20
percent, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  told reporters in
Nairobi on Oct 13.  The central bank will “intensify” auctions of repurchase
and reverse  repurchase agreements , or repos, to manage
liquidity, Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said, also on Oct. 13  The shilling has depreciated 19 percent this year, making
it the world’s worst performer against the dollar. Inflation
accelerated for the eleventh consecutive month in September to
17.3 percent from 16.7 percent in August, more than triple the
government’s target.
