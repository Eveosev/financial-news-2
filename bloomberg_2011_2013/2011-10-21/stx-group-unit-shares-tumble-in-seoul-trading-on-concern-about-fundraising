STX Pan Ocean Co.,  South Korea ’s
largest bulk-shipping line, fell by as much as the daily limit
in  Seoul  trading and affiliates tumbled on speculation group
companies may sell stock to help pay debt.  “There were rumors about the group planning to sell shares
and bonds because they may be short of funds,” said Um Kyung A,
an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. Um said STX
officials told her the rumors were untrue. No one was
immediately available for comment when Bloomberg News called STX
Group’s media relations office today.  STX Pan Ocean dropped as much as 15 percent and was down
7.6 percent to 6,840 won at 11:22 a.m. on the Korea exchange.
STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. lost as much as 11 percent and
STX Corp. fell as much as 12 percent. The benchmark Kospi Index
rose 1.3 percent.  The three companies and STX Engine Co. have 1.45 trillion
won ($1.3 billion) of debt and loans due before the end of next
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Seoul-based STX
Pan Ocean, the largest of the group companies by market
capitalization, had a first-half loss of $27.7 million as
overcapacity in the global commodity-shipping fleet depressed
rates.  In Singapore trading, STX Pan Ocean fell as much as 10
percent, the largest intraday drop since March 2010, and  STX OSV
Holdings Ltd. (SOH) , which makes oil-rig support vessels, declined as
much as 9.3 percent. STX Engine dropped as much as 15 percent in
Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
