Merck KGaA (MRK)  returned global rights to
the experimental drug safinamide to  Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA (NWRN) ,
Newron said in a statement.  Merck made the decision because of “strategic
considerations,” not because of any new efficacy or safety
findings on the drug, Newron said in a statement today.
Safinamide is in clinical trials as a treatment for Parkinson’s
disease. Newron will assess all opportunities for the drug,
including finding a new partner, the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
