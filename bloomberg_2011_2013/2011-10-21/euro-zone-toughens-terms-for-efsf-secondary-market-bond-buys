Euro-area officials toughened the
conditions for bond buying by the European Financial Stability
Facility, making it possible to halt the purchases when
countries miss economic and financial targets.  A new version of the EFSF guidelines foresees the possible
“termination of the secondary market purchases” of the bonds
of countries that deviate from targets, according to a document
obtained by Bloomberg News.  An earlier draft didn’t spell out the “termination”
option. Instead, it foresaw a full macroeconomic adjustment
program and a monthly review of the continuation of the
purchases.  The new draft, prepared by senior officials late yesterday,
will be discussed by euro finance ministers in Brussels today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
