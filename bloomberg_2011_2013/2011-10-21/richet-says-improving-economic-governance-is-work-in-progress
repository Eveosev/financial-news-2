European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said Europe’s weakness is its failure to
implement adequate economic governance.   “Europe’s weakness is governance, and it’s a work in
progress,” Trichet said in Warsaw today. “We will see in the
next meetings precisely this improvement in governance” and the
so-called six-pack of rules will lead to an “immediate
improvement,” he said.  He also said the fiscal measures being implemented in
 Greece  “are the best way to progressively put the people of
Greece in a better situation in terms of growth and in terms of
jobs.”  It’s “obvious that adjustment is necessary,” he said.
“It’s an ongoing adjustment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
