Taiwan’s dollar fell for a second
day after data showed export orders rose at the slowest pace in
two years, leading to a sell-off of local stocks.  Government
bonds  were steady with yields at the lowest level this week.  Overseas orders, an indication of shipments in the next one
to three months, grew 2.72 percent last month from a year
earlier, the government reported toward the end of  currency
trading  yesterday. The median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 3.46 percent increase. Global funds
sold $69 million more local shares than they bought today,
taking net sales for the year to $10.1 billion, according to
exchange data.  “The weak export orders data just adds to more and more
evidence that Taiwan’s economy will slow,” said  James Wang , a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.
“Looking forward,  Taiwan  yields will go down.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$30.299 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$30.351 earlier, the lowest level this week. The currency was
little changed this week.  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 gained one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today and by the same
amount this week to 1.049 percent, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.390 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
