Following is a summary of the October
German business confidence report from the Munich-based Ifo:  NOTE: Index levels are based at 2005=100. Ifo polls about 7,000
companies which can characterize their situation as good, more
favorable, unchanged or more unfavorable. The current business
situation is the difference between the good and poor responses
while the expectations is the difference between the more
favorable and more unfavorable responses. The business climate
index is the average of the current and expectations components.  SOURCE: Leibniz Institut fuer Wirtschaftsforschung (Ifo) - Munich  To contact the reporter on this story:
