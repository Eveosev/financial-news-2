President  Barack Obama  will announce
that all U.S. troops will be out of Iraq by the end of the year,
an administration official said.  Obama will make a statement at the White House following a
video conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in
which they agreed this was the best course of action for the
relationship between the two countries, according to the
official who wasnâ€™t authorized to speak publicly.  The president is set to make his remarks about 12:45 p.m.
Washington time.  The U.S. has been negotiating the terms of an agreement
with the government of Iraq on keeping some U.S. forces there
past the end of the year to help train Iraqi security forces. A
sticking point has been U.S. insistence that its troops have
immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts.  The existing U.S. agreement with  Iraq  for keeping troops in
the country expires at the end of this year. Units have been
steadily pulling out of the country. There are about 41,000
troops in Iraq, down from a peak of about 170,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
