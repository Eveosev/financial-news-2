Shareholders of PT Bumi Resources
approved today the Indonesian coal producer’s plan to buy back
shares, Corporate Secretary Dileep Srivastava said in Jakarta.  Bumi’s immediate objective is to buy back about 200 million
shares for about $60 million or $70 million to allow them to
settle convertible bonds next year, Srivastava told reporters.
During the 18-month buyback period, Bumi may decide to buy back
more shares, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
