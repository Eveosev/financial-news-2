Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) ,  Canada ’s largest drug-maker, got $2 billion
in loans to refinance debt.  The financing will be used to repay $615 million in bridge
loans and $200 million in revolving loans, according to a
 statement  distributed by PR Newswire.  Valeant’s new facility maturing in 2016 was increased to $2
billion from $1.7 billion and will pay 2.5 percentage points to
3 percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pricing will open at
2.75 percentage points more than the lending benchmark, the data
show.  The deal consists of a $1.225 billion term loan A, a $275
million revolving line of credit and a $500 million delayed-draw
 term loan .  “We are pleased to be able to complete our new $2 billion
senior secured credit facilities at a favorable  interest rate 
that has now lowered our overall borrowing cost from
approximately 6.9 percentage points  to 5.8 percentage points,”
J. Michael Pearson, chairman and chief executive officer of
Valeant, said in an e-mailed statement. “Our ability to upsize
this debt demonstrates that Valeant continues to have ready
access to the debt markets.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. arranged
the deal for the Mississauga, Ontario-based company.  A term loan A is sold mainly to banks. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed once it’s repaid; in a
term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
