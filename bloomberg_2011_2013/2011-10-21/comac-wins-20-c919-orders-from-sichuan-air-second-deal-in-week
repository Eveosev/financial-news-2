Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China 
won an order for 20 C919 aircraft from Sichuan Airlines, its
second contract for the plane this week.  The deal increases the backlog for the single-aisle plane
to 165, Shanghai-based Comac said in an e-mailed statement today.
The planemaker announced an order for 45 C919s from Industrial &
Commercial Bank of  China  Ltd.’s leasing arm on Oct. 19.  The agreements end an almost yearlong order drought for
state-backed Comac, which is trying to compete with  Boeing Co. (BA) 
and Airbus SAS’s bestselling models. China will need as many as
5,000 new aircraft through 2030, of which 71 percent will be
narrow-body planes, Boeing said last month.  Existing customers for C919 include  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s
leasing arm and China’s three major airlines,  Air China Ltd. (753) ,
China Southern Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp.
 Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , Europe’s biggest discount airline, said in
June that it’s exploring a requirement for at least 200 single-
aisle jets with Comac.  The planemaker expects the C919 to make its first flight in
2014 and to enter commercial service two years later.  The company is working with overseas suppliers on the
aircraft. CFM International Inc., a GE-Safran SA venture, is set
to supply the engines, while  Honeywell International Inc. (HON) ,
United Technologies Corp. and Parker Hannifin Corp. have agreed
to provide other components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
