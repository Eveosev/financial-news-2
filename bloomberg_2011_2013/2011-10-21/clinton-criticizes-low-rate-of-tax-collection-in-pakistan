Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
criticized  Pakistan ’s low rate of tax collection, saying more
citizens should contribute to national revenue.  “In a country of 180 million people only 2 million people
pay income tax,” Clinton said at a town hall meeting in
Islamabad today.“You can’t fix the electric grid and do all
things necessary if people are not paying taxes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
