Federal Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis 
President Narayana Kocherlakota said the central bank would have
to respond in an “appropriate fashion” should  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis worsen.  Kocherlakota, responding today to questions after a speech
in Minneapolis, also said that the U.S. recovery “has been
distressfully slow, and that’s a frustration, frankly, I
share.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
