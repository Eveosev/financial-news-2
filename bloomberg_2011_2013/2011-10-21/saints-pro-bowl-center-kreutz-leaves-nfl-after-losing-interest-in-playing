New Orleans  Saints center Olin Kreutz is leaving the National Football League team after losing
his interest in playing, his agent told a  Chicago  radio station.  Mark Bartelstein, Kreutz’s agent, told ESPN 1000 radio in
Chicago that the six-time Pro Bowl selection told him he was no
longer “feeling it.”  Kreutz, 34, is listed as out of this weekend’s game against
the Indianapolis Colts for a non-injury-related reason. Saints
spokesman Greg Bensel didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment. Kreutz was making $2 million this season,
according to the players union.  ESPN reported on its  website  that Kreutz will be placed on
the left-team list and eventually released. Kreutz was in his
14th NFL season and had been battling a left knee injury,
according to ESPN.  He signed a one-year contract with the Saints in August
after being unable to reach agreement with the  Chicago Bears ,
where he had played his previous 13 seasons.  Matt Tennant, a second-year player from  Boston College , is
listed as Kreutz’s backup.  The Saints, 4-2 in the NFC South Division, play
Indianapolis Colts (0-6) in New Orleans on Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
