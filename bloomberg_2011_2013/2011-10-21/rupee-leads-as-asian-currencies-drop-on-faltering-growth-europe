Asian currencies were poised for the
biggest weekly decline in a month, led by  India ’s rupee, as
concern the region’s economic growth is faltering prompted
global funds to pull funds.  Data this week showed  China ’s gross domestic product rose
at the slowest pace in two years. Bank of  Thailand  Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said yesterday the Thai economy may
contract this quarter as the worst floods in five decades
disrupt production. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
fell 0.5 percent, the most since the week ended Sept. 23, before
 Europe ’s finance ministers meet in Brussels Oct. 23. The rupee
fell past 50 per dollar for the first time since 2009.  “Growth outlook has weakened and inflation remains
stubbornly high” in the region, said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
Singapore-based senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking
Corp. “European investors had invested a lot of capital in  Asia 
when the 2008 financial crisis eased and now there is concern
they will pull this back to the continent.”  The rupee slumped 2.2 percent this week to 50.1150 per
dollar as of 9:32 a.m. in Mumbai and touched 50.1825 earlier,
the weakest level since April 2009. Thailand’s baht retreated
0.9 percent to 31.06, and Malaysia’s ringgit lost 1 percent to
3.1608.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares extended
this week’s decline to 1.7 percent after foreign investors sold
$479 million more Indonesian, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Thai
stocks than they bought yesterday, according to exchange data.  China Slows  China’s economy, the world’s second-largest, expanded 9.1
percent last quarter from a year earlier, less than the 9.5
percent gain in the previous three months, according to
government figures released Oct. 18. Food inflation in India
accelerated to 10.6 percent in the week ended Oct. 8 from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since April, government data showed
yesterday.  European governments may release as much as 940 billion
euros ($1.3 trillion) to fight the debt crisis, seeking to break
a deadlock between Germany and  France  that is forcing leaders to
hold two summits within four days. A summit for Oct. 26 was set
yesterday after Germany and France said the EU needs more time
to seal a “global and ambitious” accord.  Thailand may cut its growth estimate by more than 1
percentage point from a targeted 4.1 percent when policy makers
meet next week, Governor Trairatvorakul said in Bangkok
yesterday.  Flood Impact  “There is concern that the impact from the floods on the
economy will become much bigger as the waters are nearing the
capital,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “Sentiment for the baht may continue
to be weak.”  The floods have affected 14,254 factories and businesses in
20 provinces, according to the Labor Ministry. Thailand’s
central bank, which left the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
this week at 3.50 percent, signaled yesterday it is willing to
consider cutting rates as the disaster threatens to slow growth.  China’s yuan lost 0.1 percent during the five-day period to
6.3823 per dollar. The economy may continue to slow this quarter
and in the first half of 2012, National Business Daily reported
today, citing  Chen Dongqi , deputy director of the National
Development and Reform Commission’s Chinese Academy of
Macroeconomic Research.  “The yuan’s appreciation will likely slow modestly,” said
 Robert Minikin , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Standard
Chartered Plc in  Hong Kong . “We expect to see more two-way
variability and the moves will be less one-sided.”  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah slipped 0.4 percent this week
to 8,885 per dollar,  Taiwan ’s dollar declined 0.1 percent to
NT$30.332 and the Philippine peso retreated 0.2 percent to
43.44. South Korea’s won appreciated 0.5 percent to 1150.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
