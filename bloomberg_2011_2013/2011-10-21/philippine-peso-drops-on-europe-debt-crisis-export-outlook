The Philippine peso dropped for a
second day, completing a weekly loss, as a protracted debt
crisis in  Europe  bolstered demand for dollars.  The nation’s central bank refrained from raising its
benchmark interest rate yesterday, citing a “significantly more
uncertain” outlook for the global economy owing to Europe’s
debt woes. Exports slid the most since 2009 in August and the
government cut its economic growth forecasts for this year and
next on Oct. 12.  “With the Europe issues around, the peso probably won’t be
much stronger than current levels,” said Catherine Bautista, a
senior trader of sovereign bonds at Union Bank of the
 Philippines . “There’s definitely going to be a slowdown in the
local economy before we see some pickup by the first quarter
next year.”  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 43.443 per dollar in  Manila ,
after declining 0.4 percent yesterday, according to Tullett
Prebon Plc. It lost 0.2 percent this week. The currency reached
a one-month high of 43.115 on Oct. 17 and Bautista said it may
reach 43 by year-end.  France  and  Germany ’s finance ministers meet in Brussels
today to lay the groundwork for an Oct. 23 summit, a deadline
for a solution to the debt crisis. Another summit for Oct. 26
was set yesterday after Germany and France said the EU needs
more time to seal a “global and ambitious” accord.  Stimulus Package  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will likely keep its current
 policy  on hold through 2012 as economic growth eases to 4.4
percent this year and 4 percent in 2012, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said in a research note. “Well-anchored” inflation
provides room for an accommodative policy setting, it said.  President  Benigno Aquino  announced on Oct. 12 a $1.7
billion stimulus program to spur growth, a day after an official
report showed overseas sales contracted at an annual rate of
15.1 percent in August, the most since September 2009.  Government bonds  declined. The yield on the 6.125 percent
security maturing in September 2020 rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 5.90 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
