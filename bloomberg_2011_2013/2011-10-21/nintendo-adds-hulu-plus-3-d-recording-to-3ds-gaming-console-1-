Nintendo Co. is adding features to
its 3DS handheld device including the ability to record 3-D
video and access to Hulu Plus to compete with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
Xbox 360 and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation 3.  3DS and Wii console owners will be able to view television
shows and movies through  Hulu Plus  by the end of the year, the
Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a statement today.  Nintendo currently offers  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  subscribers the
option to stream movies and TV episodes on the 3DS and Wii.
Adding Hulu Plus is another step for gaming manufacturers to
challenge cable and satellite-TV providers with video content.
Sony began offering Hulu Plus to PlayStation 3 customers last
year, and Xbox 360 users have had access to Hulu Plus since
 April .  Users will be able to stream thousands of TV episodes on
Hulu Plus for a subscription fee of $7.99 per month. A system
update at the end of November will allow 3DS users to record up
to 10 minutes of 3-D video and create 3-D animation videos,
according to the statement.  Hulu LLC is owned by  News Corp. (NWSA) , Walt Disney Co.,  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal and  Providence Equity Partners .  To contact the reporter on this story:
