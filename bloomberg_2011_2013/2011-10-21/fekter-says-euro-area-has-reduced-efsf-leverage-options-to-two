Austrian Finance Minister Maria
Fekter said the euro area has reduced the number of options
under consideration for leveraging its temporary bailout fund to
two.  Asked if euro-area finance ministers had made progress on
the issue of leveraging the European Financial Stability
Facility in a Brussels meeting today, she said they were “down
to two options.” She declined to elaborate on the remaining
options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
