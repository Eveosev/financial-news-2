Cepheid Inc. (CPHD) , the maker of a rapid
test for a drug-resistant staph infection known as MRSA,
declined after saying research costs will rise in 2012.  Cepheid dropped 3.2 percent to $37.32 at the close of
trading in  New York . The shares have gained 64 percent this
year.  Clinical trial expenses next year are expected to be about
three times 2011’s levels, the Sunnyvale, California-based
company said on a conference call after releasing third-quarter
earnings yesterday. Dan Leonard, an analyst at Leerink Swann in
 Boston , reduced his earnings estimate for 2012 to 24 cents a
share from 41 cents in part because of the higher costs.  Cepheid “sounded more cautious regarding the macro
outlook,” Leonard wrote in a note to investors. “But
utilization of its test menu continues to broaden, and its
pipeline is progressing per plan.”  Leonard, who has a “market perform” on the company, also
cut his 2011 earnings estimate to 9 cents a share from 11 cents.  Cepheid also said it is terminating a DNA test license with
 Roche Holding AG (ROG)  because the patents under the agreement aren’t
“pertinent to Cepheid’s future business plans.” The company
expects to have a one-time charge of $5.4 million, or 8 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter.  Third-quarter net income was $1.9 million, or 3 cents a
share, Cepheid said in a statement yesterday. Revenue jumped 25
percent to $70.2 million on demand for its Xpert tests, 11 of
which are available in the U.S. and 12 that are available
elsewhere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
