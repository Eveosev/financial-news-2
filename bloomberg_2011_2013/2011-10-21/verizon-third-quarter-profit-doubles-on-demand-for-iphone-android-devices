Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. phone company, reported third-quarter profit
doubled as consumers snapped up iPhones and Android devices.  Net income rose to $1.38 billion, or 49 cents a share, from
$659 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, New York-based
Verizon said today. Earnings, excluding some items, rose to 56
cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts predicted
55 cents, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The popularity of Android smartphones running on Verizon’s
new higher-speed long-term evolution, or LTE, network helped
give Verizon an edge on subscriber growth over rival  AT&T Inc. (T) 
Still, customer gains missed some analysts’ estimates as
consumers waited for the latest version of the  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone, which became available this month.  “Subscribers dramatically slowed purchases of smartphones
in September in anticipation of the new iPhone,” said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS AG in  New York .  Verizon Wireless , jointly owned by Verizon and  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD) , added 882,000 contract, or postpaid, subscribers in
the quarter. The gain compared with the 584,000 new signups a
year earlier and the 1.04 million average of six analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Verizon shares closed up 0.9 percent to $37.42 in New York.
The stock has advanced 4.6 percent this year.  Gaining Share  Sales climbed 5.4 percent to $27.9 billion, matching the
average analyst projection. Revenue at the wireless business
jumped 9.1 percent to $17.7 billion, while sales the fixed-line
unit declined 1.3 percent to $10.1 billion.  “Verizon continues to take postpaid market share from
everyone,” said Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in
Baltimore, who recommends buying Verizon shares. “They are
ahead on LTE and this was the first full quarter when they sold
LTE phones.”  Verizon is expanding its LTE network after starting the
service in some markets last year. AT&T, which is starting
limited LTE service this year, yesterday reported it gained
319,000 postpaid subscribers last quarter.  Of the 5.6 million smartphones Verizon sold in the quarter,
1.4 million were LTE devices. Smartphones, which allow consumers
to browse the Web and watch video, helped push average monthly
revenue per contract subscriber to $54.89, up 2.4 percent from a
year earlier.  Strike Impact  Verizon sold 2 million iPhones in the quarter, compared
with the 2.7 million AT&T activated in the period. Verizon
gained access to the top-selling device this year, ending AT&T’s
exclusivity for the handset.  Verizon said 20 percent of its iPhone customers came from
other carriers, and 80 percent were existing customers
upgrading. The company sold out of the new iPhone 4S on the
first day of sales on Oct. 14 and has been on allocation from
Apple since then, filling backorders.  The wireless growth helped Verizon offset some of the costs
caused by storms and a strike by about 45,000 employees at its
fixed-line business. The storms, including  Hurricane Irene ,
combined with the strike cost it $250 million last quarter.  Verizon added 131,000 FiOS TV subscribers, more than the
118,000 analysts estimated. The company gained 20,000 broadband
customers. Analysts projected a gain of 4,000 on average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
