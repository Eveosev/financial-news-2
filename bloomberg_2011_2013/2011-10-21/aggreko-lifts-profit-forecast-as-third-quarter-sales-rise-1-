Aggreko Plc (AGK) , the world’s largest
provider of mobile power-supplies, lifted its pretax profit
forecast and said underlying third-quarter revenue rose at a
faster pace than in the first half.  Pretax profit this year will be at least 320 million pounds
($504.7 million), the Glasgow-based company said in a statement
today. That compares with a previous forecast in August of
around 315 million pounds and with an average estimate of 317.5
million pounds from 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have had a strong third quarter,” Chief Executive
Officer Rupert Soames said in a telephone interview. “ North
America  had a very strong September, while  Europe  and the  Middle
East  came in 20 percent ahead of last year.”  Aggreko is benefiting from the increasing gap between
demand for power and the permanent infrastructure available to
provide it, especially in emerging markets. It won a major
industrial contract in  Iraq  in the period to provide 40
megawatts of power in Basra.  Underlying revenue, which excludes the effects of one-off
sporting events, fuel costs and currency movements, rose 22
percent in the third quarter, compared with 21 percent in the
first half.  “The underlying sales growth is impressive,” Peel Hunt
analyst Andrew Nussey, who has a “hold” recommendation, said
in a note to clients. “Aggreko remains a quality proposition
but this is largely in the price.”  The shares fell as much as 4.9 percent, before recovering
to close up 0.4 percent at 1,710 pence in London trading, giving
a gain this year of 15 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
