Russia ’s central bank may leave
 reserve requirements  for lenders unchanged, according to Alexei
Simanovsky, the deputy chairman responsible for bank oversight.  “As of today, I don’t see the necessity of changing
reserve requirements,” Simanovsky told reporters today in
Moscow. He declined to comment on possible decisions at the
regulator’s Oct. 28 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
