Janice Eberly, a finance professor
at Northwestern University’s  Kellogg School of Management , was
confirmed by the Senate to be the Treasury Department’s chief
economist.  Eberly will be assistant secretary for economic policy and
lead the office responsible for analyzing U.S. and global
economic developments, the Treasury said in a statement today.
She replaces Alan Krueger, who left in November and has since
been nominated to lead the White House  Council of Economic
Advisers .  Eberly, 48, joins the Treasury as the Obama administration
tries to reduce an  unemployment rate  that has been stuck close
to 9 percent or higher for 30 months. Republicans in Congress
have blocked President Barack Obama’s $447 billion package of
tax cuts and government spending aimed at reigniting growth and
hiring.  At Kellogg, where she has been a faculty member since 1997,
Eberly focused on finance and macroeconomics, including studies
on investment decisions by businesses and families, according to
the school’s website. She also researched the difficulties of
reallocating capital across sectors.  Eberly was previously a staff member on the Council of
Economic Advisers and on advisory panels of the Bureau of
Economic Analysis and the Congressional Budget Office. She has a
bachelor’s degree from the  University of California , Davis, and
a Ph.D. in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
