The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell on speculation lawmakers may
unleash as much as 940 billion euros ($1.3 trillion) to fight
the region’s debt crisis.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined
30.5 basis points to 727, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at
4:30 p.m. in  London .  Policy makers are considering combining the European
Union’s temporary and planned permanent rescue funds as of
mid-2012, while scrapping a ceiling on bailout spending, two
people familiar with the discussions said. Finance ministers
meet in Brussels today to lay the groundwork for meetings of
government leaders.  “We have another three days to wait before the ‘Grand
Plan’ becomes apparent,”  Jim Reid , head of fundamental strategy
at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a note to investors.
“We will still watch out for any fresh European headlines over
the weekend but markets will have to wait a little longer before
a deal is agreed.”  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 7.5 basis points to 175.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 15 basis points to 239 and
the subordinated index was 23 lower at 472.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell nine basis points to 324. A decrease signals
improving perceptions of  credit quality .  Credit-default swaps protecting French debt fell three
basis points to 186, contracts on  Germany  declined one basis
point to 90, Italy narrowed 15 basis points to 441, and  Portugal 
was 43 basis points lower at 1077, according to CMA.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
