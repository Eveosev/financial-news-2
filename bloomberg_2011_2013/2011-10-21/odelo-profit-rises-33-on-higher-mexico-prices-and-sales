Grupo Modelo SAB, the brewer of
Corona beer, said third-quarter profit rose 33 percent on higher
prices and demand in  Mexico .  Net income increased to 3.3 billion pesos ($240 million)
from 2.5 billion pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said today in a  statement  to the nation’s stock
exchange. Sales climbed 1.4 percent to 23.6 billion pesos.  Mexico’s economy grew 3.9 percent in this year’s first half
on gains in exports and jobs, helping spur beer demand and
letting Modelo increase prices.  The profit beat the 3.11 billion-peso estimate of Fernando Olvera, an analyst at the Mexican unit of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA. Olvera predicted sales of 24.6 billion pesos.  Sales in Mexico rose 9.6 percent to 12 billion pesos on a
3.7 percent gain in shipments and a 5.7 percent price increase.  Export shipments fell 4.1 percent from 2010’s third
quarter, which followed the end of a strike at Modelo’s plant in
Oaxaca that had crimped deliveries outside Mexico. Export
revenue fell 7.6 percent to 9.7 billion pesos.  Modelo, which is half-owned by  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) ,
reported cash and marketable securities of 29.4 billion pesos at
the end of September, up from 22.5 billion pesos a year earlier.  Modelo rose 2.6 percent to 80.98 pesos in Mexico City at
11:02 a.m. New York time. The shares have gained 18 percent in
the past 12 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
