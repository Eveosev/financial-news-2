Peru ’s sol rose for the first day
this week on optimism European policy makers are moving closer
to containing the debt crisis, spurring demand for higher
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol advanced 0.2 percent to 2.7200 per U.S. dollar at
12:21 p.m. Lima time, from 2.7245 yesterday. The currency is
unchanged this week.  “Unfortunately for  Latin America , it has become European-
headline dependent,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin
America fixed-income research at IDEAGlobal in New York.  European finance ministers started a six-day negotiation
among the region’s leaders over how to save Greece from default,
shield banks from the fallout and build more powerful defense
against the debt crisis. As much as 940 billion euros ($1.3
trillion) might be deployed, two people familiar with the
discussions said yesterday.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.72 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.16 centimo to 114.45 centimos
per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
