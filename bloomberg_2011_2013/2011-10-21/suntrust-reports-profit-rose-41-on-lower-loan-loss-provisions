SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  fell the most
among the biggest U.S. banks in New York trading after reporting
higher mortgage-repurchase costs and operating expenses.  SunTrust dropped 3.3 percent, the biggest decline in the
81-company Standard and Poor’s 500 Financials Index, to $18.57
at the close of trading after falling as much 6.6 percent
earlier today. The index slipped 3.3 percent.  “Operating losses related to mortgage services continues to
be elevated, and even outside that increase, you still had total
expenses higher,” Stephen Moss, an analyst at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia, who rates the stock “neutral,” said
in a phone interview. “Bank investors are looking for operating
efficiencies. Outlook is not that good in the short-run here.”  SunTrust, the 10th-biggest bank by assets, said third-
quarter profit climbed 41 percent as it made lower loan-loss
provisions. Revenue declined 5 percent to $2.2 billion from $2.3
billion, the Atlanta-based lender said today in a statement.  Operating losses related to mortgage servicing increased
by $45 million in the third quarter compared with a year
earlier. Mortgage repurchase costs were $117 million, an
increase of $27 million over the prior quarter.  Net income rose to $215 million, or 39 cents a share, from
$153 million, or 17 cents, in the same period a year earlier,
according to statement. The average estimate of 32 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 35 cents.  SunTrust Chief Executive Officer William H. Rogers, who
succeeded James M. Wells III in the post on June 1, announced a
plan in July to cut expenses $300 million by 2013.  Expenses Increase  Non-interest expenses increased 1 percent to $1.56 billion
in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, and rose
4 percent from the year-earlier period on higher mortgage-
related costs, $41 million more for compensation and additional
hiring, according to the statement.  SunTrust plans to bolster mobile and automated teller
machine banking while reducing the number of branches to cut
expenses, Rogers said in a conference call after results were
announced. “This is not a widespread branch reduction exercise,
though it will include some branch rationalization and core
changes to our branch staffing model.”  Credit-loss provisions fell 44 percent to $347 million from
$615 million in the year earlier. Net charge-offs fell 29
percent to $492 million from $690 million and nonperforming
loans were down $1.1 billion, or 26 percent. Net charge-offs
fell 29 percent to $492 million from $690 million and
nonperforming loans were down $1.1 billion, or 26 percent.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income increased 1 percent to $1.29 billion in
the third quarter from the previous quarter because of one more
day in the third quarter, the bank said. Net interest income
rose 2 percent from the year earlier as the bank paid lower
rates on deposits, according to the statement.  Non interest income fell to $903 million for the third
quarter from $1 billion in the year earlier due to lower net
gains on the sale of investment securities, and lower
investment-banking and mortgage-related income.  The net interest margin, the difference between what a bank
pays in deposits and charges for loans, narrowed to 3.49 percent
from 3.53 percent in the second quarter and widened from 3.41
percent the year earlier.  Tier 1 capital ratio fell to 11 percent from 14 percent in
the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
