European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said EU contracts may make it
difficult to establish a direct connection between European
Central Bank refinancing and the region’s European Financial
Stability Facility bailout fund, he told  Handelsblatt  in an
interview.  Asking for assistance from countries like Russia, China or
 Brazil  would have “far-reaching political consequences”
because it would give them negotiating power within the euro
zone, the newspaper said, citing Rehn.  France and Germany must cooperate among themselves and with
the other euro-zone governments to find a “comprehensive
solution” for the region’s debt crisis because a “piecemeal”
approach is no longer enough, Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
