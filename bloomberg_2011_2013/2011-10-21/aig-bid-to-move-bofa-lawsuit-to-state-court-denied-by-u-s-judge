American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
request to move a $10 billion lawsuit against  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  to state court from federal court was denied by a U.S.
judge.  AIG in August sued Bank of America in New York state court
over $10 billion in losses on mortgage-bond investments.
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America then moved the
case to federal court.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in  Manhattan  denied New
York-based AIG’s request to return the case to state court in an
order dated yesterday.  The case is American International Group Inc. v. Bank of
America Corp., 11-06212, U.S. District Court. Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
