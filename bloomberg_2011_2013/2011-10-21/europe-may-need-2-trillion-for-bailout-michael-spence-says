Europe  may need $2 trillion in its
rescue fund to fight the debt crisis, more than the 940 billion
euros ($1.3 trillion) that governments are said to be seeking,
said  Michael Spence , the Nobel Prize-winning economist.  “The Europeans have to make a real commitment to provide
resources to stabilize the situation,” Spence, a professor at
 New York University  and a Nobel laureate in economics, said in
an interview with Bloomberg Television in  Hong Kong  today. He
said the most likely outcome is there will be “very difficult,
slow growth” in Europe and the U.S.  European governments may make the 940 billion euro
available by combining the temporary and planned permanent
rescue funds, said two people familiar with the discussions.

Europe will struggle to resolve the looming threat on global
economy.  Apart from the fiscal bailout package, policy makers in
Europe need “a commitment to recapitalize the banks” and “the
 European Central Bank ’s stamping on contagion” to overcome the
crisis, Spence said.  The chance the global economy will slip into a recession is
“a bit less than 50 percent” as there is a “better than 50/50
chance Europe will resolve” the crisis, said Spence, academic
board chairman at the Fung Global Institute, a think-tank funded
by William and Victor Fung, who run the world’s biggest supplier
of clothes and toys, Li & Fung Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
