Crude oil rose for the first time in
three days on hopes that European leaders will reach a deal to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  Futures gained 1.6 percent as European finance ministers
met in Brussels today to lay the groundwork for an Oct. 23
gathering of government leaders on a solution to the debt
crisis. Oil also rose after  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  and  Honeywell
International Inc. (HON)  reported profits that beat analyst estimates.  “There is some positive sentiment that  Europe  is going to
be able to accomplish something this weekend,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford,  Connecticut . “Earnings reports suggested that the
 U.S. economy  doesn’t seem to be slowing down considerably.”  Crude for December delivery rose $1.33 to settle at $87.40
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Oil gained 0.7
percent this week, the third weekly increase in a row.  Brent oil for December settlement fell 25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $109.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The North Sea crude’s premium to the U.S.
benchmark narrowed to $22.11 amid speculation that  Muammar Qaddafi ’s death will increase Libyan output. The spread reached
a record of $27.88 on Oct. 14.  European finance ministers started a six-day negotiation
over how to save  Greece  from default, shield banks from the
fallout and build more powerful defenses against the debt
crisis. As much as 940 billion euros ($1.3 trillion) might be
deployed, two people familiar with the discussions said
yesterday.  A further summit was scheduled for Oct. 26 after Germany
and France said the European Union needs more time to seal a
“global and ambitious” accord.  U.S. Equities Gain  U.S. stocks rose after McDonald’s said earnings rose 8.6
percent and Honeywell raised its full-year forecast. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.2 percent to 1,229.85,
and  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 1.7 percent to 11,732.47.
The S&P’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials increased 0.8 percent
to 629.41.  “We are still correlating highly with the equity market,”
said  Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates, a
Galena, Illinois-based consulting company. “It’s another
injection of risk appetite across the financial and commodity
space.”  Demand Increase  U.S. fuel demand rose 2.5 percent in September as growth in
manufacturing bolstered distillate fuel consumption, according
to the  American Petroleum Institute .  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, climbed to 19.9 million barrels a day last month from
19.4 million a year earlier, the industry-funded group said
today in a report. Total demand for distillate fuel, a category
that includes diesel and heating oil, rose 9.3 percent from a
year earlier to 4.25 million barrels a day, a record high for
September.  Consumption of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, climbed 11 percent to 3.78 million barrels a day.
Demand for gasoline gained 0.3 percent to 9.14 million.  “The fundamentals are far tighter than they were in
2008,” said Amrita Sen, an oil analyst at Barclays Plc in
 London . “The current geopolitical context creates significant
tail risks in a world with such limited spare capacity.”  Qaddafi’s Death  Muammar Qaddafi’s death isn’t likely to expedite the return
of  Libya ’s oil output or lure back foreign companies as quickly
as the interim government hopes, according to analysts  Daniel Yergin  at IHS-CERA and Edward Morse at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc.  Oil workers and foreign companies fled Libya this year amid
a rebellion that erupted in February against Qaddafi’s 42-year
rule. He was deposed earlier this year and died yesterday during
fighting in his hometown of Sirte.  The rebellion caused oil output from Libya, holder of
Africa’s largest crude reserves, to drop 97 percent to 45,000
barrels a day by August, according to Bloomberg News estimates.
Production rebounded to 100,000 barrels a day last month.  U.S. crude oil inventories fell 4.73 million barrels to
332.9 million in the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since
February 2010, the Energy Department reported Oct. 19.  Gasoline supplies declined 3.32 million barrels to 206.3
million, the lowest level since May, the report showed.
Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, decreased 4.27 million barrels to 149.7 million,
the biggest drop since November.  Oil may fall next week, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Twenty of 40 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast oil will
decline through Oct. 28. Eighteen predicted a gain, and two said
there will be little change. Last week, 68 percent of the
surveyed analysts projected a drop.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 431,143
contracts as of 2:38 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 629,779
contracts yesterday, 6.1 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.40 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
