The rand rose against the dollar,
snapping four days of losses and paring its first weekly decline
in four, as European leaders prepared for two summits in five
days to resolve the region’s debt crisis. Bonds rose.  South Africa ’s currency strengthened 1.3 percent to 8.1069
per dollar as of 4:12 p.m. in Johannesburg, trimming its drop
this week to 3.3 percent. Against the euro, it gained 0.3
percent to 11.2286.  Stocks advanced, commodity prices rallied and the dollar
slumped against most of the more than 20 emerging-market
currencies monitored by Bloomberg as investor appetite for
riskier assets improved. European finance ministers are meeting
today, starting a six-day negotiation over how to save  Greece 
from default, shield banks from the fallout and build more
powerful defenses against the debt crisis.  “The danger in persisting with a long-dollar strategy
heading into a weekend where both an emergency finance
ministers’ meeting and European Union Summit are taking place is
high,” Tradition Analytics strategists led by Quinten Bertenshaw said in e-mailed comments. Tradition advised clients
to sell dollars and hold neutral currency positions over the
weekend.  South Africa’s 6.75 percent securities gained for a third
day, driving the yield down three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.061 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
