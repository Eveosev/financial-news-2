Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  jumped
the most in 17 months after raising its full-year forecast amid
a recovery in commercial aerospace and increasing sales of auto
turbochargers.  Honeywell, based in  Morris Township ,  New Jersey , rose 5.8
percent to $51.28 at the close in  New York , the biggest gain
since May 10, 2010. The stock had dropped 8.8 percent this year
before today.  Aerospace sales gained 8 percent in the third quarter as
commercial equipment offset declining military and government
services sales, the company said. Honeywell, also the maker of
chemicals and fire systems, joined U.S. manufacturers  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX)  and Parker Hannifin Corp. in raising
forecasts this week.  “We’re well-positioned for growth across all four of our
business segments again next year,” Honeywell Chief Executive
Officer  David Cote  said today during a conference call with
analysts. “While we’re not denying the potential for another
recession, we think the high probability outcome is a slow-
growth economic environment.”  Earnings for 2011 will rise to $4 to $4.05 a share, up as
much as 35 percent from 2010, the company said in a statement.
Analysts projected $3.95 on average, and Honeywell earlier
predicted $3.85 to $4 a share.  The company also increased the low end of its full-year
sales forecast, now $36.5 billion to $36.7 billion, compared
with a previous minimum of $36.1 billion.  44% Profit Gain  Third-quarter net income rose 44 percent to $862 million,
or $1.10 a share, from $598 million, or 76 cents, a year
earlier, Honeywell said. Sales increased 14 percent to $9.3
billion.  The aerospace profit margin advanced 120 basis point to
18.2 percent from a year earlier, Honeywell said.  Honeywell “delivered on the big Aerospace incremental
margin improvement, which is a positive following the
disappointment around this issue” in the second quarter, Julian Mitchell, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in New York,
wrote in a report today. He has a “neutral” recommendation on
the stock.  The  U.S. economy  is forecast to expand 1.7 percent this
year, according to the median of 82 economists’ estimates, down
from 3 percent growth last year.  Slowing Economy  Honeywell and other U.S. manufacturers have posted rising
earnings this year amid a slowing economy by keeping costs in
check and expanding abroad.  The company expects earnings to expand at a rate two to
three times greater than sales growth next year, Cote said on
the call.  Honeywell will achieve that earnings growth even in a
“sub-par GDP growth environment,” said Chief Financial Officer
 David Anderson .  “We’ve got a relatively robust aerospace, both original
equipment and after-market environment,” Anderson said in a
telephone interview today. “We’ve got the benefit of continued
growth, albeit more spotty and more challenging, in the emerging
regions.”  The company also will gain from a large backlog of projects
for the refining and petrochemical industries, Anderson said.
Honeywell sees savings of about $150 million in 2012 from
repositioning its operations, giving the investment in the
restructuring a return of more than 60 percent, he said.  Honeywell’s earnings included a gain of 23 cents a share
from the July sale of the Consumer Products Group, the maker of
Fram filters and Prestone antifreeze, for $950 million. The gain
helped offset costs of 33 cents a share from repositioning its
businesses mostly in  Europe .  The company’s automation and control systems unit had sales
of $3.95 billion, up 14 percent from a year ago, and Specialty
Materials sales rose 25 percent to $1.47 billion. Sales at the
Transportation Systems rose 22 percent to $960 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
