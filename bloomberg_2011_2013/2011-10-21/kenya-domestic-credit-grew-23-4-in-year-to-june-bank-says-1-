Domestic credit in Kenya, east
 Africa ’s biggest economy, increased 23.4 percent in the year
through June, the central bank said.  Total credit jumped to 1.34 trillion shillings ($13.4
billion) from 1.09 trillion shillings a year earlier, the
Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya said in its June economic
report received by e-mail today.  “The stronger growth in credit to the private sector
reflected increased demand for loans to finance economic
activities in the productive sectors of the economy,” it said.  About 16.4 percent of the credit went to trade, followed by
real estate at 14.9 percent and private households which
received 13.5 percent, the report said.  Kenyan imports rose to 136.1 billion shillings in August
from 73 billion shillings a year earlier, according to the  Kenya 
National Bureau of Statistics. Exports increased to 46.3 billion
shillings during the month from 30.3 billion shillings in August
2010, the statistics agency said Oct. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
