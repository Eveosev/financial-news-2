Portugal ’s securities regulator said
Brazilian companies Votorantim Participacoes SA and Camargo
Correa SA informed it that news reports about their interest in
buying all the stock of Lisbon-based cement maker Cimpor-
Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA have no ground.  The Portuguese securities regulator, known as CMVM,
commented in an e-mailed statement today.  Camargo Correa declined to comment beyond an Oct. 20
statement distributed by Portuguese public relations firm Imago
that “there’s no change on its position in Cimpor.” An official
at Votorantim in  Sao Paulo  declined to comment to Bloomberg News
on Oct. 19 and today. Mafalda Correia, a spokeswoman for Cimpor,
also declined to comment yesterday and on Oct. 19.  Bloomberg News reported Oct. 19 that Votorantim and Camargo
Correa are in talks to buy a remaining stake in Cimpor, citing
two people familiar with the negotiations.  Lisbon-based Diario Economico reported Bank of America
Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. may be willing to finance a
possible offer from Votorantim for shares of Cimpor, citing
unidentified people in the financial industry in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
