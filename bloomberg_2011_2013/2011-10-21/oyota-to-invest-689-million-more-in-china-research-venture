Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the biggest
carmaker in  Asia , will invest an additional $689 million in a
research and development venture in China as it aims to expand
in the worldâ€™s largest car market.  The Toyota City, Japan-based automaker will build test
tracks to aid development of environmental technologies in
China, it said in an e-mailed statement today. The research and
development facilities will open in 2013.  As governments worldwide roll out new fuel-economy
standards, Toyota, maker of the Prius hybrid, is introducing its
technology for fuel-efficient cars worldwide. The carmaker sees
hybrid technology as key for the future success of the
automotive industry, Katsuaki Watanabe, a Toyota adviser and
former chief executive officer, said Oct. 11 in Chengdu,  China .  Toyota initially invested $234 million when the venture
with China FAW Group Corp. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co.
was established in November 2010, according to the statement.  Shares of Toyota fell 0.3 percent to 2,547 yen at the 3
p.m. close of Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
