German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  denied that a rift between  Germany  and  France  is
holding up an agreement on how to boost the firepower of the
euro area’s rescue fund.  “France and Germany are not at all stuck in their
positions” on leveraging the European Financial Stability
Facility, Schaeuble told reporters today in Brussels as he
arrived for a meeting of euro-area finance ministers. “France
and Germany acted very closely together, so we advanced a lot in
the negotiations on the guidelines. That was a Franco-German
proposal which brought movement into the whole affair.”  “The fact that we need a summit next week is linked to the
fact that under German law we first need agreement of the
Parliament on the use of instruments of the expanded EFSF,”
Schaeuble said. “And if decisions aren’t prepared to a certain
degree in advance, we can’t decide and we told our partners
this; everyone understands this.”  Schaeuble said today’s meeting will address the latest
evaluation on  Greece ’s progress in meeting its budget goals.   “We will first tackle the troika report as a basis for the
preparation of the next Greek tranche which is an important
decision,” he said.  For the euro area as a whole, “the situation is serious
and we have a great responsibility; everyone knows that,”
Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
