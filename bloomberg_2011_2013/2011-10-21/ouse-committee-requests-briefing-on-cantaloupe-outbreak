Republicans and Democrats on the
House Energy and Commerce Committee requested a briefing from
officials at the  Colorado  cantaloupe farm linked to the outbreak
of listeria that killed 25 people.  The lawmakers also requested Jensen Farms of Grenada,
Colorado, preserve documents and communications connected to the
U.S. investigation of the outbreak.  The disease sickened 123 people in 26 states and is the
deadliest U.S. food outbreak in more than a quarter-century. The
committee request was signed by Energy and Commerce Chairman
Fred Upton, a Republican from  Michigan , and the panel’s senior
Democrat Henry Waxman of  California .  “The committee has a long bipartisan history of conducting
food safety oversight and is very concerned about these recent
developments,” according to the letter requesting the staff
briefing with Jensen Farms. Lawmakers will also consult with the
 Food and Drug Administration  and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, according to the letter.  Jensen Farms didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking
comment.  Health inspectors found widespread contamination and poor
sanitary practices at the packing facility owned by Jensen
Farms, according to an Oct. 19 letter to the company from the
FDA. Family members of those stricken by the outbreak sent a
letter Oct. 7 to the committee calling for public hearings to
“seek answers to this tragedy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
