Efforts by the South African sugar
producers to invest in renewable energy generation are being
stymied by a lack of government policy, said Trix Trikam,
executive director of the  South African Sugar Association .  The industry “could contribute 1,000 megawatts of power to
the national grid,” he said yesterday in an interview in  Port
Louis , Mauritius, were he is investigating the Indian Ocean
island nation’s power-generation industry.  South Africa ’s sugar industry, which already generates
electricity to run its mills, is willing to invest between 15
billion rand ($1.8 billion) and 20 billion rand to generate
renewable energy, which would create more than 18,000 jobs,
Trikam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
