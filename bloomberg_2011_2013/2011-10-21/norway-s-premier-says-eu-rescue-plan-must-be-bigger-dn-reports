Norway’s Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said the European Union needs to increase the size
of its 440 billion-euros ($606 billion) rescue package to
prevent the European sovereign debt crisis from worsening,
Dagens Naeringsliv reported.  Greek debt will need to be restructured and banks will need
to raise additional capital to prevent contagion in Spain and
 Italy , he told the Oslo-based newspaper after a meeting with
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  European states need not lose money in the rescue package
if the measures are convincing, Stoltenberg told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
