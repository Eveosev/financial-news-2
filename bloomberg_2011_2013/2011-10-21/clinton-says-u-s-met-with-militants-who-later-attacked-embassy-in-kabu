Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said the U.S. has spoken with representatives of the Islamic
militant Haqqani network, which has been carrying out attacks on
Americans in  Afghanistan .  Clinton, speaking in Pakistan today, said there was one
meeting with the Haqqani network. It was held a few months ago,
prior to attacks on the Intercontinental Hotel and the U.S.
embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, that the U.S. says were carried
out by the Haqqanis, operating from Pakistan.  “We have reached out to the Taliban, we have reached out
to the Haqqani network, to test their willingness and their
sincerity,” Clinton said. “We don’t know whether this will
work. But we believe strongly that we must try it.”  The desire for talks doesn’t mean that U.S. forces will
stop hunting down the militants. “In order to get to the
talking, we have to be fighting,” she said.  Clinton spoke publicly following closed-door discussions
between top U.S. officials, also including Central Intelligence
Agency Director David Petraeus and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman, General Martin Dempsey, and  Pakistan ’s leadership
including Prime Minister  Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani , General Ashfaq
Parvez Kayani, the chief of army staff, and Ahmad Shuja Pasha,
head of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
