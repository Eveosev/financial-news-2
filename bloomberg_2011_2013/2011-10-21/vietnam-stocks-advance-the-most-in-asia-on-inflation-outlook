Vietnam ’s stocks rose, pushing the
benchmark index up the most in Asia, on speculation inflation
may slow after prices eased in the country’s biggest cities.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s VN Index gained 1.8
percent to 411.03 as of the 11 a.m. close, paring a weekly loss
to 0.8 percent, a fifth consecutive decline. Bao Viet Holdings,
the biggest insurer, jumped by the maximum 5 percent to 63,000
dong, the most since Jan. 19. Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial
Bank for Industry & Trade, the second-largest lender by market
value, rose 4.9 percent to 23,500 dong.  Month-on-month inflation in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi
and in Ho Chi Minh City, the nation’s biggest city, slowed in
October, the government said in a statement posted late
yesterday on its website. Hanoi’s consumer price index rose an
estimated 0.13 percent in October from last month, compared with
0.2 percent a month earlier.  Ho Chi Minh City ’s prices climbed
0.18 percent, from 0.88 percent in September, according to the
statement.  “The slowdown of CPI growth in the two largest cities
helped the stock market experience a strong rebound today,”
said Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst Nguyen Duy Phong of ACB
Securities Co. “It signaled that inflation for the whole nation
will be slower and  interest rates  may have a chance to come
down,” he said.  The VN Index has dropped 15.2 percent this year on concern
higher borrowing costs will crimp corporate earnings and
economic growth. The  State Bank  of Vietnam earlier this month
increased its refinancing rate to 15 percent from 14 percent in
an attempt to cool inflation.  Consumer prices in Vietnam increased 22.42 percent in
September from a year earlier. The nation’s inflation rate
remained the fastest among a basket of 17  Asia  Pacific economies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
