Yields on  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac
mortgage securities that guide home-loan rates narrowed relative
to Treasuries after a Federal Reserve official signaled the
central bank may consider expanding its holdings of the bonds.  Fannie Mae’s current-coupon 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
securities declined about 0.02 percentage point to 1.08
percentage points more than 10-year  U.S. government debt  as of
8:48 a.m. in New York, the least in three days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Governor  Daniel Tarullo  called yesterday for a
resumption of large-scale purchases of mortgage bonds, boosting
chances the central bank will start a third round of asset
buying aimed at reviving U.S. growth. The Fed began a program
this month in which the central bank reinvests proceeds from its
holdings of $1.4 trillion housing debt into the more than $5
trillion market for government-backed mortgage bonds.  Policy makers should move the tool of mortgage-bond buying
“back up toward the top of the list” because it would help the
economy through lower mortgage costs that would boost house
purchases and spending by people who refinance their home loans,
Tarullo said late yesterday in a speech in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
