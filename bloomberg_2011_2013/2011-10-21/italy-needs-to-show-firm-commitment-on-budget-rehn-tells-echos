Italy needs to present “a firm
commitment” at a meeting of government leaders this weekend to
eliminating its budget deficit with “precise objectives,”,
European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli
Rehn  said,  Les Echos  reported.  “The goal of a return to a balanced budget in 2013 is
good,” Rehn said in an interview, according to the Paris-based
daily. “The manner of getting there on the other hand isn’t yet
clear enough. We think that if Italy shows a firm commitment
with a calendar and some precise objectives, that will
facilitate greatly the negotiations among member states
Sunday.”  Government leaders meet Oct. 23 in Brussels to work on a
solution to the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
