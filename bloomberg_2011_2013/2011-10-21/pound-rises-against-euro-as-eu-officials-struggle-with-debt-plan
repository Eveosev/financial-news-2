The pound strengthened to a six-week
high against the dollar after a government report showed the
nation’s budget deficit narrowed in September more than
economists forecast.  Sterling appreciated for a third day versus the dollar and
the yen as U.K stocks were boosted by optimism European policy
makers are moving closer to agreement on a plan to help contain
the region’s debt crisis. U.K. government bonds fell.  “The pound is trading stronger since the release of the
public borrowing figures this morning, which proved
encouraging,”  Neil Jones , London-based head of European hedge-
fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., a unit of  Japan ’s
third-largest bank, wrote in an e-mailed note.  The pound rose 0.8 percent to $1.5949 at 4:54 p.m. in
London, after rising to $1.5962, the strongest since Sept. 9.
The currency climbed 0.1 percent to 121.42 yen, and appreciated
0.2 percent to 87.06 pence per euro.  The U.K.’s net borrowing excluding support for banks shrank
to 14.1 billion pounds from 15.4 billion pounds a year earlier,
the  Office for National Statistics  said today in London. A
shortfall of 15 billion pounds was predicted by economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Revenue rose 4.2 percent and spending
climbed just 0.5 percent.  The pound has advanced 1.2 percent in the past month and
1.7 percent over the previous quarter, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which measure a basket of 10
developed-market currencies.  Sentiment Slips  The U.K. currency rallied even after a gauge of British
consumer sentiment slipped for a fourth month.  Nationwide
Building Society  said its sentiment index dropped to 45 in
September, the lowest since April, from 48 the previous month.  Gilts dropped as stock gains damped demand for safer
investments. The FTSE 100 Index added 1.9 percent and the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index climbed 2.5 percent.  The 10-year yield rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.53 percent. The 3.75 percent security due
September 2021 dropped 0.725, or 7.25 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 110.585.  European governments may unleash as much as 940 billion
euros ($1.31 trillion) to fight the debt crisis, seeking to
break a deadlock between Germany and  France  that is forcing
leaders to hold two summits within four days, people familiar
with the discussions said.  U.K. government debt has returned 12 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
7.2 percent and Treasuries rose 7.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
