Lenders increased overnight deposits
at the  European Central Bank  to the most since Oct. 10, while a
measure of banksâ€™ reluctance to lend to one another rose for
second day.  Banks parked 188 billion euros ($258 billion) at the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 182 billion euros on Oct.
19. That compares with a year-to-date average of 61 billion
euros.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was 76 basis
points as of 9:35 a.m. in  London , from 75 yesterday. The
difference reached 89 basis points on Sept. 23, the widest since
March 2009.  The cost for European banks to fund in dollars rose, with
the three-month cross-currency basis swap -- the rate they pay
to convert euro payments into dollars -- at 93 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate, from 92 yesterday.  The one-year  basis swap  was at 68 basis points under
Euribor, from 67. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
