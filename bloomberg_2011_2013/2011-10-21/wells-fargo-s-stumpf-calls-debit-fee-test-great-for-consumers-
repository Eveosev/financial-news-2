(Corrects headline to show CEO referred to new fees as
part of effort to find balance that’s good for customers.)  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ’s new fees on
debit-card customers are a “test” as the firm seeks the best
way to replace revenue cut by federal limits on transaction
fees, Chief Executive Officer John G. Stumpf told CNBC.  “We’ll find that right balance,” Stumpf said today in an
interview with Maria Bartiromo. “It’ll be great for consumers
and great for our shareholders.”  The San Francisco-based bank is imposing a $3 monthly fee
for debit-card users in five states in response to the Durbin
Amendment, which required the  Federal Reserve  to cap the amount
lenders can charge retailers for processing transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
