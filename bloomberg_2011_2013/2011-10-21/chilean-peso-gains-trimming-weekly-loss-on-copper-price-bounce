Chile ’s peso advanced, ending a
four-day losing streak, as copper also gained for the first day
in five amid speculation that European policy makers were moving
closer to a deal to contain the euro-area debt crisis.  The peso rose 1.2 percent to 513.15 per U.S. dollar from
519.17 yesterday. The currency posted a weekly decline of 2.6
percent, after two weeks of gains.  Copper, which makes up half of Chile’s exports, rose as
much as 6 percent on the Comex in  New York  to $3.2405 a pound
for December delivery. The 120-day correlation between copper
price moves and gains and losses in the Chilean peso is at the
highest level this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Chile has been a copper correlation story,” said Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a currency strategist at RBS Securities Inc.
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The moves in copper prices have been
pretty brutal and when copper volatility picks up you tend to
get an increase in correlation because of funds running systems
or models. At the moment it’s just trading on headlines, which
makes it hard to take a position.”  Copper had dropped 11.5 percent in the first four days of
this week. The metal is still heading for a 5.3 percent decline
from $3.4085 on Oct. 14, even after today’s rally.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market cut
their net long position in the  U.S. dollar  to $4.9 billion on
Oct. 19 from $5.2 billion on Oct. 18. The one-month Chilean peso
non-deliverable forward contract rose 1.2 percent to 515.455
pesos per dollar. The three-month contract rose 1.2 percent to
519.2562 pesos per dollar.  The pace of consumer price inflation priced into the
forwards market for Chile’s inflation-linked currency unit the
unidad de fomento fell four basis points to 0.15 percent for
this month and three basis points to 0.08 percent next month,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  The inflation forwards market is pricing in 2.44 percent
inflation in the 12 months through October 2012, up from 2.3
percent a week ago. Traders are pricing in faster price rises
from November on.  To contact the reporter on this story:
