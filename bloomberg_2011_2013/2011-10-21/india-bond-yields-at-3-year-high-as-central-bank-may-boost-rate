India ’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing
yields to a three-year high, on concern accelerating inflation
will spur the central bank to boost borrowing costs next week.  The central bank will raise the repurchase rate by 25 basis
points to 8.50 percent on Oct. 25, according to 13 of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Six predict no change. Food
inflation accelerated to 10.6 percent in the week ended Oct. 8
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since April, data showed
yesterday. Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime
Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said yesterday authorities
should use  interest rates  and fiscal measures to curb prices.  “Inflation is still high and the central bank may raise
rates by 25 basis points,” said  Anubhuti Sahay , a Mumbai-based
economist at Standard Chartered Plc. “The local currency’s
weakness may also add to pressure on inflation.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.82 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
was the highest level for a benchmark 10-year bond since August
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The rupee weakened past 50 per dollar today for the first
time since May 2009. The wholesale-price Index rose 9.72 percent
in September from a year earlier after a 9.78 percent increase
in August, the most since July 2010, government data show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose six basis point to 8.32 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
