Joan Fleming, a resident of 
Princeton Township, and Mary Beth Shippole, a resident of 
Princeton Borough, talk with Bloomberg's Terrence Dopp about New
Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 's proposal to merge the towns.  Residents of the municipalities that share the name 
Princeton associated with the Ivy League university will decide 
Nov. 8 whether to combine. Voters have rejected consolidation at
least three times in the past 60 years, most recently in 1996.
