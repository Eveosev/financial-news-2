Josh Hamilton  and Michael Young hit
sacrifice flies in the ninth inning and the Texas Rangers beat
the  St. Louis  Cardinals 2-1 tonight to even the World Series at
one game apiece.  The visiting Rangers had been shut out on three hits until
the ninth inning before getting back-to-back singles from Ian
Kinsler and Elvis Andrus, both of whom scored, off St. Louis
reliever Jason Motte.  Neftali Feliz pitched the ninth for Texas to get the save.
Mike Adams, who pitched the eighth, got the win.  St. Louis got its only run when pinch-hitter Allen Craig
hit a tie-breaking single for the second straight night. Craig,
who won Game 1 with a run-scoring single to break a 2-2 tie in
the sixth inning, broke up a scoreless game tonight in the
seventh inning. Both hits came off  Texas  reliever Alexi Ogando.  Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is Oct. 22 in Arlington,
Texas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
