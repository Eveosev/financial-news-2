Asia  refining margins for naphtha
rose this week. BP Plc sold fuel oil in Singapore at the biggest
premium to spot prices since February.  Light Distillates  BP sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline to Trafigura
Beheer BV at $120 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window. That price
was $1.50 a barrel higher than that paid for similar cargoes
yesterday. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 25,000 metric tons of
naphtha for second-half December delivery from Itochu Corp. at
$884 a ton.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
at $57.10 a ton at 5:36 p.m. Singapore time, up from $54 a ton
on Oct. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack
spread, a measure of refining profit, was at $57.57 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur to Hin Leong Trading Pte at 50 cents a barrel
over benchmark quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey. That’s
the largest premium since Oct. 12. Shell,  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, also sold a jet-fuel cargo to BP at 20 cents over
November quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 36 cents
to $17.78 a barrel at 2:09 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, has widened 9 percent so far this
week, after narrowing the previous two.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after falling to
$2.65 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade is up 16 percent from
last week, indicating it is profitable to produce  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  Fuel Oil  BP sold 25,000 tons of 380-centistoke  fuel oil  to
PetroChina Co. in Singapore at $12 a ton over benchmark quotes,
according to the Bloomberg survey. That’s the biggest premium
since Feb. 16. The cargo is for loading from Nov. 13 to Nov. 17.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed $1.28 to $4.20
a barrel at 2:09 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. The
difference has narrowed 23 percent so far this week, after
widening the previous two weeks, signaling reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products are growing.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade fell 50 cents to $5.50 a ton, PVM data showed. This
viscosity spread has widened 11 percent from last week, meaning
bunker, or marine fuel, gained less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
