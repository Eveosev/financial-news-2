Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, advanced in  Sao Paulo  as global pulp
inventories dropped in September, signaling robust demand for
the commodity.  Fibria jumped 4.1 percent to 15.07 reais at the close of
trading and gained 2.4 percent since Oct. 14. The benchmark
Bovespa index rose 2.3 percent and had a weekly advance of 0.4
percent.  “World pulp inventories fell in September by three days of
supply to 38 days, which indicates demand is heated,” Luiz Otavio Broad, an analyst at Agora CTVM SA brokerage, said in a
telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro . “That’s positive for
Fibria as pulp is its main product.”  The BHKP global pulp price index fell to the lowest since
February 2009 this month.  The drop in inventories “could be an indication that
current pulp prices are close to a bottom,” analysts from Itau
BBA including Marcos Assumpcao wrote in a note to investors
today.  Klabin SA (KLBN4) ,  Latin America ’s biggest paper maker, gained 5.7
percent to 6.15 reais today, while Suzano Papel & Celulose SA
rose 2.8 percent to 8.15 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
