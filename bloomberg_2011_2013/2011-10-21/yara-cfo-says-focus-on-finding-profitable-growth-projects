Yara International ASA (YAR) ’s Chief
Financial Officer Hallgeir Storvik said today the company is
focusing on finding “profitable” growth projects.  “At this stage we are not excluding at all that we are
going to be as successful on finding profitable projects to the
benefit of our shareholders, the same way as we have done in the
past,” the executive said at the company’s third-quarter
earnings conference in Oslo. “That is our priority. If we
should arrive at the situation where we think we are not able to
fulfill those expectations, then we will be more than happy to
pay cash to our shareholders either in the way of dividends or
in the form of buybacks.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
