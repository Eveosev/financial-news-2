France  is preparing to cut its 2012
growth forecast of 1.75 percent, daily Le Figaro reported,
citing an unidentified person in the government.  A reduction to below 1.5 percent would leave the government
needing to either cut spending or raise taxes in order to meet
its 2012 budget deficit target of 4.5 percent of gross domestic
product, the newspaper said.  The government may announce new moves to reduce spending by
the end of the year, according to Le Figaro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
