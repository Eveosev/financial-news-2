The  U.S. Senate  adopted a measure
that would raise the maximum size of a home loan backed by
mortgage companies Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac  and the Federal
Housing Administration to $729,750.  Senator  Robert Menendez , a New Jersey Democrat, offered the
increase as an amendment to a spending bill today. The measure
was approved less than a month after the limit on so-called
conforming loans was automatically reduced to $625,500.  “If we want to get the economy moving, the housing market
has to be part of it,” Menendez said tonight on the Senate
floor.  The Senate adopted the amendment 60-31. The amendment
required 60 votes for approval and was offered during the
chamber’s consideration of a package of spending measures. If
the Senate passes the underlying bill, the House would then have
to vote for it to become law.  The higher limits, should they be signed into law, would
apply until Dec. 31, 2013. Lawmakers would pay for the cost of
the higher limits by imposing an annual fee on the loans of 15
basis points of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage.  The limits, which vary by locale, apply to loans backed by
the FHA and government-controlled mortgage companies  Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, which together buy or guarantee about 90
percent of all residential home loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
