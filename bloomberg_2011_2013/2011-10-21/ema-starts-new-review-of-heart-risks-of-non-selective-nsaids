The European Medicines Agency said
it will start a new review of evidence to determine the heart
risks associated with painkilling medicines known as non-
selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  The drugs, known as NSAIDs, have been the subject of
several European reviews relating to gastrointestinal and
cardiovascular safety, the agency said today in a statement on
its website. The agency plans to update its 2006 opinion that
overall the benefits of NSAIDs outweighed the risks, though the
possibility of a small increased chance of heart attacks or
strokes couldnâ€™t be ruled out.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
