Mauritius’s rupee slipped the most
in more than two weeks against the dollar on concern that
European leaders won’t break a deadlock over its debt crisis,
curbing demand for riskier, frontier-market assets.  The Indian Ocean Island nation currency lost 0.9 percent to
29.05 per dollar by 11:28 a.m. in  Port Louis , the capital,
taking its drop this week to 0.3 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the euro, the rupee declined 0.6
percent to 39.706, taking the increase this week to 0.4 percent.  Europe ’s two biggest economies have yet to break the
impasse on a solution to the sovereign debt crisis. Finance
ministers meet in Brussels today to lay the groundwork for an
Oct. 23 meeting of government leaders that had been the deadline
for a solution to the crisis.  “The much-awaited summit on Sunday, where it was hoped
that  France  and Germany will come up with a plan to stem the
sovereign debt crisis and stabilize markets, will fail to meet
expectations,” analysts at  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
country’s largest lender by market value, wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
