Payrolls fell in 25 U.S. states in
September, led by North Carolina and  Ohio , a sign the weakness
in the job market is broad-based.  Employers cut staff by 22,200 in North Carolina last month
and by 21,600 in Ohio, according to Labor Department data issued
today in Washington. The report also showed the jobless rate
decreased in 25 states.  Nevada  continued to lead the nation in
unemployment with a rate of 13.4 percent.  The economy needs to generate faster sustained job growth
to lower unemployment and spur the  consumer spending  that makes
up about 70 percent of the economy. A Labor Department report on
Oct. 7 showed employers added 103,000 payrolls last month,
almost half of them telecommunications workers returning from a
strike, and the jobless rate was 9.1 percent for a third month.  “The majority of states will likely continue to grapple
with a high unemployment for the foreseeable future as economic
activity stagnates,” Anika Khan, an economist at Wells Fargo
Securities Inc. in Charlotte,  North Carolina , said before the
report. “A genuine recovery will not likely begin until
employment and income growth stabilize.”  After Nevada, the jobless rate was highest in  California  at
11.9 percent and  Michigan  at 11.1 percent.  The biggest job gains last month occurred in  Florida , where
employers boosted payrolls by 23,300. Employment in  Texas  rose
by 15,400 workers and increased in  Louisiana  by 14,100.  Over the past 12 months, 47 states gained jobs, while two,
Delaware and  Georgia , showed a decline.  Elevated Unemployment  Unemployment has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009,
the longest stretch of such elevated joblessness since monthly
records began in 1948. Through September, the economy had
recovered about 2.09 million of the 8.75 million jobs lost as a
result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  Payrolls grew an average 96,000 a month in the July-to-
September period, about the same as in the second quarter and
down from 166,000 in the first three months of the year.  Sustained increases of around 200,000 a month are needed to
bring unemployment down about a percentage point over a year,
according to  Eric Green , chief market economist at TD Securities
Inc. in  New York .  Political infighting over the budget and mounting fear of a
default in  Europe  caused the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to
plummet 16 percent from July 22 to Aug. 22, prompting companies
and consumers to cut back. The  Federal Reserve  last month
announced more unconventional measures to boost growth while
President  Barack Obama  is campaigning to get Congress to approve
elements of a new jobs proposal the Senate shelved last week.  Cutting Payrolls  Businesses slashing staff include Bank of America Corp. The
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based lender is cutting 30,000 jobs,
including at its unit servicing mortgages.  Some companies will see more hiring. Ford Motor Co.’s U.S.
hourly workers this week voted 63 percent in favor of a four-
year contract that creates 12,000 new jobs and gives each as
much as $10,000 in payments this year, according to the  United
Auto Workers .  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.
