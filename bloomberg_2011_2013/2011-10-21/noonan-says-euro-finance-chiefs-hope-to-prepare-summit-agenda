Irish Finance Minister  Michael
Noonan  said euro area finance chiefs seek a “comprehensive
solution” to the debt crisis and to “make decisions about
Greece.”  Asked whether it was worrying that a second summit is
needed to get a deal, the minister referred to the German
supreme court judgement on the need for Germany’s parliament to
be consulted.  “I’m not too surprised at that,” he said of the decision
to hold an Oct. 26 summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
