An 18th century French commode and a
17th century German ivory cup from the collection of billionaire
banker Edmond J. Safra and his wife Lily helped raise $45.9
million at  Sotheby’s  New York this week.  The auction was expected to bring more than $40 million.  The top lot of the four-day marathon, “Property from the
Collections of Lily and Edmond J. Safra,” was a Louis XVI-era
ormolu-mounted Japanese lacquer commode with secretaire that
fetched $6.9 million, barely missing the top estimate of $7
million.  Another ebonized ormolu-mounted Japanese commode from the
reign of Louis XV sold for $3.4 million, within the presale
estimate range of $3 million to $5 million.  This was the second round of sales from the Safras’ homes
in the U.S.,  Switzerland  and  France . The first took place in
2005 and totaled $48.9 million.  Born in  Beirut , Edmond J. Safra founded Republic New York
Corp. and Safra Republic Holdings SA. In 1999, he sold his
holdings in both companies to London-based HSBC for $10 billion.
He supported educational, cultural, religious and medical causes
around the world. He died in a fire in  Monaco  in 1999.  Items that combined exquisite craftsmanship with appealing
provenance and conservative estimates did well.  Ivory Cup  A delicate, elongated ivory cup made in South Germany in
the first half of the 17th century surged past its top estimate
of $150,000 to fetch $614,500. The prices include buyer’s
commission; the estimates do not.  A pair of Victorian gilt-bronze tables by Holland & Sons,
which belonged to Prince of Wales Albert Edward, the future King
Edward VI, sold for $1.1 million, seven times above the low
estimate of $150,000.  A group of 12 neoclassical bronze busts, including Roman
emperors Caligula,  Julius Caesar  and Augustus, brought $398,500,
almost five times its top estimate of $80,000.  Buyers also competed for colorful 18th century bird figures
made of porcelain. Magpies and cockatoos flew past their
estimates. A pair of golden orioles fetched $314,500, more than
three times its top estimate of $100,000. A duo of green
parakeets went for $386,500 against the presale estimate of
$120,000 to $180,000.  Big-ticket paintings were less successful. A canvas by
James-Jacques-Joseph Tissot, “Sur la Tamise (Return from
Henley),” depicting an attractive woman stepping off a boat,
failed to sell. It was estimated to bring $1.5 million to $2.5
million.  Another large painting by the 19th-century Frenchman, “The
Princesse de Broglie,” with a $500,000 to $700,000 estimate,
also went unsold.  To contact the reporter of this story:
