Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  has
an approval rating of 71 percent, according to a poll by the
Insituto Venezolano de Analisis de Data, or IVAD,  El Universal
reported , a day after Chavez said he had recovered from cancer.  About 25 percent of Venezuelans think Chavez’s health is
worse than he is revealing, while 44 percent expect him to
recover the October 2012 presidential election, the Caracas-
based newspaper said, citing the poll.  Henrique Capriles Radonski is the favorite to win an
opposition primary to choose a single candidate to face Chavez
in next year’s vote, El Universal reported. About 26 percent
said they would vote for the governor of Miranda state, while
Zulia state Governor Pablo Perez has 16.2 percent, according to
the poll.  The survey of 1,200 people, taken between Oct. 11 and Oct.
17, had a margin of error of 2.37 percentage points, El
Universal reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
