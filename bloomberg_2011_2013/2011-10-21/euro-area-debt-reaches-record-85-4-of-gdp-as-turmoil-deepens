Government debt in the euro area
swelled to a record last year, complicating the efforts of
nations in the region to stem  Europe ’s fiscal crisis.  All 16 countries that were using the euro last year
increased their debt load, boosting the region’s average to 85.4
percent of gross domestic product from 79.8 percent in 2009, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The
reading exceeded an 85.1 percent estimate published in April.  Budget deficits and bank-recapitalization costs may push
government borrowing “significantly higher” in an environment
of low economic growth or a recession,  Standard & Poor’s  said in
a report today. European leaders have pushed out an Oct. 23
deadline for deciding on how to bolster the firepower of the
region’s rescue fund after France and  Germany  said more time was
needed for negotiations.  Officials are discussing merging the 440 billion-euro ($604
billion) European Financial Stability Facility with the European
Stability Mechanism, which had been intended to replace the EFSF
in 2013, according to two people familiar with the talks. The
EFSF, which is funded by bonds guaranteed by governments, has
already spent or committed about 160 billion euros, including
loans to Greece due in up to 30 years. The ESM will operate with
paid-in capital.  Euro-area countries pared their overall  budget deficit  to
6.2 percent of GDP in 2010 from 6.4 percent in the prior year.
The region’s largest deficits were in Ireland, at 31.3 percent,
and Greece, at 10.6 percent.  The countries with the highest ratios of government debt to
GDP were Greece at 144.9 percent, and  Italy  at 118.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
