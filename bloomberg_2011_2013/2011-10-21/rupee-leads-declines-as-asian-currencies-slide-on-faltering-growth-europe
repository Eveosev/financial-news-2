Asian currencies completed the worst
week in a month, led by  India ’s rupee, as concern the region’s
economic growth is faltering prompted global funds to withdraw
cash.  Data this week showed  China ’s gross domestic product rose
at the slowest pace in two years. Bank of  Thailand  Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said Oct. 20 the Thai economy may
contract this quarter as the worst floods in five decades
disrupt production. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
fell 0.4 percent, the first decline since the week ended Sept.
30, before  Europe ’s finance ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow.
The rupee fell past 50 per dollar for the first time since 2009.  “Growth outlook has weakened and inflation remains
stubbornly high” in the region, said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
Singapore-based senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking
Corp. “European investors had invested a lot of capital in  Asia 
when the 2008 financial crisis eased and now there is concern
they will pull this back to the continent.”  The rupee slumped 2 percent this week to 50.0250 per dollar
in Mumbai and touched 50.3238 earlier, the weakest level since
April 2009. Thailand’s baht retreated 0.7 percent to 31.01, and
Malaysia’s ringgit lost 0.6 percent to 3.1498.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares slipped 0.7
percent this week as foreign investors sold $319 million more
Indonesian, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Thai stocks than they
bought yesterday, according to exchange data.  China Slows  China’s economy , the world’s second-largest, expanded 9.1
percent from a year earlier last quarter, less than the 9.5
percent gain in the previous three months, according to
government figures released Oct. 18. Food inflation in India
accelerated to 10.6 percent in the week ended Oct. 8 from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since April, government data showed
Oct. 20.  European governments may release as much as 940 billion
euros ($1.3 trillion) to fight the debt crisis, seeking to break
a deadlock between Germany and  France  that is forcing leaders to
hold two summits within four days. A summit for Oct. 26 was set
on Oct. 21 after Germany and France said the EU needs more time
to seal a “global and ambitious” accord.  Thailand may cut its growth estimate by more than 1
percentage point from a targeted 4.1 percent when policy makers
meet next week, Governor Trairatvorakul said in Bangkok on Oct.
21.  Flood Impact  “There is concern that the impact from the floods on the
economy will become much bigger as the waters are nearing the
capital,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “Sentiment for the baht may continue
to be weak.”  The floods have affected 14,254 factories and businesses in
20 provinces, according to the Labor Ministry. Thailand’s
central bank, which left the benchmark interest rate unchanged
this week at 3.50 percent, signaled Oct. 21 it is willing to
consider cutting rates as the disaster threatens to slow growth.  China’s yuan gained 0.1 percent during the five-day period
to 6.3840 per dollar. The economy may continue to slow this
quarter and in the first half of 2012, National Business Daily
reported yesterday, citing  Chen Dongqi , deputy director of the
National Development and Reform Commission’s Chinese Academy of
Macroeconomic Research.  “The yuan’s appreciation will likely slow modestly,” said
 Robert Minikin , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Standard
Chartered Plc in  Hong Kong . “We expect to see more two-way
variability and the moves will be less one-sided.”  Rupee Rebound Predicted  The rupee, the worst-performing currency in Asia this year,
will rebound more than 3 percent from a 2 1/2-year low touched
yesterday as India’s central bank raises  interest rates ,
according to Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB.  Investors should buy the currency once it falls to 50.30
per dollar, targeting a “near-term” advance to 48.60, the
Swedish lender said in a research note yesterday. The  Reserve
Bank  of India will raise its benchmark rate to 8.50 percent from
8.25 percent at a meeting on Oct. 25, according to 13 of 19
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Six predicted no change.  The monetary authority lifted borrowing costs six times so
far in 2011 to cool inflation, boosting the yield advantage on
local assets. Rates on 10-year sovereign notes closed at 8.82
percent yesterday, widening the extra yield over Treasuries to
6.6 percentage points.  Elsewhere,  Indonesia ’s rupiah slipped 0.2 percent this week
to 8,863 per dollar, Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at
NT$30.299 and the Philippine peso retreated 0.2 percent to 43.44.
 South Korea ’s won appreciated 0.8 percent to 1,147.50.  To contact the reporters on this story:
