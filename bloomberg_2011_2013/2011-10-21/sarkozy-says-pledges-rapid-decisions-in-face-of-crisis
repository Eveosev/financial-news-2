President  Nicolas Sarkozy  promised
to act quickly to battle  Europe ’s debt crisis and said that
global public opinion will aid the implementation of a financial
transactions tax.  “Crisis is opportunity, not a pretext to refuse
decisions,” Sarkozy said today in a speech in Paris. “It’s
because there is crisis that we’ll take decisions rapidly”  “Who will dare to say that the legitimacy of the financial
transactions tax is questionable?” he said. “It’s global
public opinion will bring anger” at governments that reject
such a tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
