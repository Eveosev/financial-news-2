Growth in German tax revenue
accelerated in September, led by tax collection at the federal
level, the  Finance Ministry  said, cautioning that economic
growth will slow.  Tax revenue jumped 7.3 percent to 48.8 billion euros ($66.9
billion) after growing 4 percent in August, the Berlin-based
ministry said in its monthly report. The government aims to
collect 4.4 percent more tax for the year as a whole.  “The economic upswing in  Germany  gained momentum during
the summer months after the pause in the second quarter,” the
ministry said. Still, as sentiment worsens because of the euro-
region debt crisis, the economy will expand at a “clearly
slower pace” in the second half of the year, it said.  German investor confidence fell to the lowest in almost
three years in October, the ZEW Center for European Economic
Research in Mannheim said Oct. 18, citing its index of investor
and analyst expectations. That’s consistent with a recession
starting in the final quarter, said  Christian Schulz , an
economist at Joh Berenberg Gossler & Co. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
