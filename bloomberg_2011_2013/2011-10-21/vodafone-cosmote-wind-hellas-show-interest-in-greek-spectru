Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO) ’s Cosmote mobile unit, and
Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA filed requests to participate
in a planned spectrum auction, Greece’s telecom regulator said.  The  Hellenic Telecommunications & Post Commission  will
announce the official list of auction participants on Oct. 25,
according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based
regulator. The mobile providers will bid on spectrum in the 900-
MHz and 1800-MHz frequency bands with the auction expected to
take place in mid-November.  Greece could raise as much as 380 million euros ($528
million) in the spectrum auction if all blocks available are
taken. The auction is part of a wider plan to sell state assets
and raise 50 billion euros by the end of 2015, one of the
conditions in exchange for continued financial aid from the
 International Monetary Fund  and European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
