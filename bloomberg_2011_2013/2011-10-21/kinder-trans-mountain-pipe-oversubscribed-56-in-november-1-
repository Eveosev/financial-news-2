November shipment requests for the Trans Mountain oil pipeline
system exceeded capacity by 56 percent, according to a bulletin
to shippers.  Subscriptions on the portion of the system delivering to
refineries in British Columbia and  Washington  were 64 percent
over capacity, the Houston-based company said the bulletin.  The Trans Mountain mainline system is expected to carry
280,920 barrels a day in November, down less than 1 percent from
estimated October shipments of 281,000, according a notice
received Sept. 21.  The Puget Sound line will carry 145,790 barrels a day next
month, according to the bulletin.  The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) Trans Mountain system runs
from Edmonton, Alberta, to marketing terminals and refineries in
central British Columbia, the Vancouver area and the Puget Sound
region in Washington, according to the company’s website.  Products also move to  California , the U.S. Gulf Coast and
overseas through the Westridge marine terminal in Burnaby,
British Columbia.  Nominations for “advanced timing” shipments to the
Westridge dock were oversubscribed by 3 percent, according to
the bulletin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
