The entire  New Hampshire  salaried
staff of Republican presidential candidate  Michele Bachmann  has
quit, according to a local television station, undercutting her
candidacy in the state that traditionally conducts the nation’s
first primary.  Bachmann, a Minnesota congresswoman, had five paid staff
members in the state, all of whom in announcing their
resignation cited frustration with her lack of commitment to
campaigning in New Hampshire, said the report yesterday by
Manchester, New Hampshire-based WMUR.  Bachmann’s national campaign manager, Keith Nahigian, said
in e-mail yesterday that “we have not been notified that anyone
is leaving the campaign.”  Nahigian also said that while Bachmann intends to spend
more time in New Hampshire, “our campaign has emphasized that
our main focus is the first-in-the-nation caucus state of  Iowa 
and we are continuing to build efforts there.”  Bachmann’s polling number nationally in the Republican race
have steadily declined since she won the Iowa Republican Party’s
straw poll on Aug. 13. Her path to the nomination is premised on
winning the Iowa caucuses, which traditionally kick off the
nomination process.  The caucuses are scheduled for Jan. 3; no date has yet been
set for the New Hampshire primary.  The staff exodus is the latest in a series of departures
from the campaign since her straw poll win.  Campaign manager Ed Rollins and deputy manager David
Polyansky quit in early September, followed by pollster Ed Goeas. Longtime aide Andy Parrish also left the campaign’s Iowa
office to return to work in Bachmann’s congressional office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
