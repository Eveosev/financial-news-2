Metro AG (MEO)  co-owners, the Schmidt-
Ruthenbeck family, pressured Chairman Juergen Kluge to announce
his resignation this week following Kluge’s actions surrounding
the failed contract extension of Chief Executive Officer Eckhard Cordes, Platow Brief said, without citing anyone.  Franz Haniel will probably take over as Metro’s chairman,
while Erich Greipl, a confidante of company founder Otto Beisheim, is unlikely to get enough backing from the owners,
Platow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
