South African farmers may plant 18
percent more cropland with corn in the 2011-12 production season
as prices rise, according to a survey of traders.  The government’s Crop Estimates Committee may say on Oct.
25 that farmers aim to sow 2.8 million hectares (6.9 million
acres), up from 2.37 million hectares last season, according to
the median estimate of nine traders surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Estimates ranged from 2.65 million to 2.9 million hectares.  White corn has increased 64 percent this year on the South
African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The grain for December
delivery closed at 2,364 rand ($292) a metric ton today. The
country is  Africa ’s largest corn producer. The U.S. and
 Argentina  are the world’s biggest exporters of the grain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
