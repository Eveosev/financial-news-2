LG Display Co., the world’s second-
largest maker of flat screens, rose to the highest in more than
two months in  Seoul  trading on speculation the worst might be
over for the company after it posted a record loss.  The shares jumped 7.8 percent to 24,250 won at the close in
Seoul, the stock’s highest level since Aug. 4, while the
benchmark Kospi index rose 1.8 percent.  LG Display, a supplier of panels to Apple Inc., had a
third-quarter net loss of 687.5 billion won ($597 million)
because of slowing demand for displays and a foreign-exchange
loss linked to a weaker won, the Seoul-based company said
yesterday after the market closed. Losses at the company may
narrow starting in the fourth quarter as demand for new
televisions recovers, according to Hana Daetoo Securities Co.  “It’s time for the stock to reflect the view that
quarterly earnings have bottomed out and will improve, no matter
how little,” Lee Ka Keun, a Seoul-based analyst at Hana Daetoo,
said in a report today. “The shopping season to last until the
end of the year will boost TV demand, and it will be a direct
factor improving LG Display’s earnings.”  Further declines in panel prices will likely be limited,
and the industry will probably turn around in the second half of
next year, LG Display Chief Financial Officer James Jeong said
at a briefing yesterday.  The average price of LG’s panels fell 10 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier, according to the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
