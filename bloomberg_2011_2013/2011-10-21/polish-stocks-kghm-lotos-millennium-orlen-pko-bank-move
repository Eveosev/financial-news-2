Poland ’s WIG20 Index gained 23.42,
or 1.1 percent, to 2,245.51 at 1:18 p.m. in Warsaw, rebounding
from the steepest one-day drop in a month. The measure has lost
2.4 percent this week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, gained 1.8 percent to 136.4 zloty,
snapping a four-day drop, as the price of the metal rebounded.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)   rose 2.1 percent to 4.46 zloty,
climbing for the first time in four days. The Banco Comercial
Portugues SA unit said third-quarter net income rose to 125
million zloty ($39 million) from 76.3 million zloty a year
earlier. That exceeded the 121.9 million-zloty average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Investors interested in buying Millennium will meet with
the bank’s management next week as part of due diligence
process, Parkiet reported, citing a person close to one of the
foreign bidders it didn’t name.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank,
increased 1.5 percent to 34.14 zloty, its first gain in three
days. JPMorgan Chase & Co. kept its “overweight”
recommendation for the stock, saying PKO remains its
“preferred” bank in Poland.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW) declined for a fourth day, losing 1.2
percent to 37.07 zloty after Poland’s largest oil refiner said
its earnings before interest and taxes were at about 750 million
zloty in the third quarter of the year. The preliminary earnings
are “very weak,” Monika Kalwasinska, a Warsaw-based analyst at
PKO Bank, wrote in a research note today.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest oil
refiner, gained 1.9 percent to 26.81 zloty, trimming this week’s
decline to 0.7 percent. Oil rose before European leaders meet
Oct. 23 to decide on a rescue fund to ease the debt crisis
threatening the region’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
