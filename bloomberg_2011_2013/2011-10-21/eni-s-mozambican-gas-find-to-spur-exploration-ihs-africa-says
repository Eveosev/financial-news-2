  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s natural-gas find off
Mozambique, its largest operated discovery, will probably boost
the region’s energy supply and attract more offshore
exploration, IHS Global Insight said.  The Rome-based company yesterday announced a find of at
least 15 trillion cubic feet of gas, equivalent to about 340
million metric tons of the fuel, or enough to supply the U.K.
for more than four years.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  on Oct. 5
revised its reserves estimates for gas fields off Mozambique to
10 trillion cubic feet.  The discoveries “are bound to turn both the country’s and
the region’s energy outlook around,” IHS said in an e-mailed
statement from London today. “Eni’s discovery will also have
far-reaching consequences, making it more likely that other
international companies will follow suit with deep-water
exploration, particularly elsewhere in  Mozambique  but also in
Tanzania and Kenya.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
