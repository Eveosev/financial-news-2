The  Czech Republic ’s PX equity index
advanced 0.7 percent to 921.9 by 3:13 p.m. in  Prague , reducing
this week’s losses to 1.5 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   advanced
2.2 percent to 180.9 koruna, paring this week’s decline to 0.3
percent. The television broadcaster partly owned by Time Warner
Inc. is “comfortable” with analysts’ full-year earnings
estimates, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Sarbu said.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, rose
2 percent to 736.1 koruna, snapping a five-day rout. Electricity
for next-year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its
output, rebounded from the lowest in seven months, rising 0.7
percent to 55.1 euros per megawatt-hour.  New World Resources Plc (NWR CP), the biggest coking-coal

headed for its lowest close in more than two months. The biggest
Czech oil refiner, a unit of  Poland ’s PKN Orlen SA, said it will
have a third-quarter loss before interest and taxes, wiping out
profit from the previous three months as sales contracted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
