Bank of England Deputy Governor
 Charles Bean  said inflation will “come down sharply” in 2012
as an increase in sales taxes and a rise in commodity prices
will have less of an impact next year, the Manchester Evening
News reported, citing a interview. There is “light at the end
of the tunnel,” Bean said, according to the newspaper.  “The corporate sector is in a reasonable good financial
state and that has helped to make it more resilient and meant
unemployment hasn’t risen as much as it could have done,” Bean
said, the newspaper reported. “We probably do need some
slightly stronger consumption to help generate the extra demand
to get investment going.”  Any increase in  interest rates  is “difficult to time,”
Bean told the paper.  Among companies, there is “increased nervousness around
what is happening” in  Europe , “which makes businesses more
inclined to put investment plans on hold, to see how things pan
out,” Bean said, the Manchester Evening News reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
