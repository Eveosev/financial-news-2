Markit Group Ltd. agreed to settle a
lawsuit against two former employees in  Singapore  after they
pledged not to compete with the firm for one year.  Zhibo Li, previously a vice-president of sales, and Shiyang
Cui, who was an associate vice-president, are permanently banned
from using or disclosing information obtained from  Markit ,
according to a filing with the Singapore High Court this month.  Markit, a swap prices data provider, sued Li and Cui last
month, accusing them of breaching their employment contracts and
misusing the firm’s trade secrets to set up rival Fundamentrix
Pte. Li and Cui are also banned from soliciting clients of the
London-based company for one year.  Caroline Lumley, a spokeswoman at Markit, declined to
comment yesterday on the agreement. Both Li and Cui didn’t reply
to two e-mails seeking comment.  Markit, with more than 2,200 employees, provides derivative
and bond data to customers, according to its website. Bloomberg
LP, the owner of Bloomberg News, competes with Markit in selling
information to the financial-services industry.  The case is Markit Asia Pte. & Ors v Zhibo Li & Ors
S628/2011 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
