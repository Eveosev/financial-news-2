U.S. President  Barack Obama 
nominated Thomas Hoenig, the former Federal  Reserve Bank  of
Kansas City president, to be vice chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.  The nomination went to the U.S. Senate today, according to
an e-mailed statement from the White House. That would almost
complete an FDIC board that has been reduced to just three of
five voting members because of departures and membership changes
required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Hoenig, 65, stepped down as president of the Kansas City
Fed on Oct. 1 and would replace Martin J. Gruenberg as vice
chairman. Gruenberg was nominated by Obama to be the agency’s
chairman and is currently its acting leader. The Senate Banking
Committee has approved the nominations of Gruenberg, Thomas J. Curry for comptroller of the currency and  Richard Cordray  to
lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The full Senate
hasn’t acted on any of the three nominations.  Hoenig, who was president of the Kansas City Fed for 20
years, repeatedly urged the  Federal Open Market Committee  to
tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from accelerating
and asset-price bubbles from emerging.  As a voting member of the FOMC last year, Hoenig opposed
the Fed’s pledge to keep rates “exceptionally low” for “an
extended period,” the decision to reinvest proceeds from
maturing mortgage-backed securities, and a $600 billion round of
bond purchases. His eight straight dissents tied former Governor
Henry Wallich’s record in 1980 for most in a single year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
