Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest tour operator, rose the most ever in London
trading after the company’s banks relaxed loan conditions and
agreed to provide additional short-term funds.  The shares gained as much as 24 percent to 56.5 pence,
trimming their decline this year to 71 percent.  The new loan arrangements buy time for management to
complete a 200 million-pound ($315 million) disposal program and
restructure the U.K. tour business, Karl Burns, a London-based
analyst at Shore Capital, said in a note.  “Today’s announcement is likely to be taken well, given
the main concern surrounding Thomas Cook was the group’s ability
to stay within its banking covenants in December 2011 and
beyond,” Burns wrote. He has a “hold” rating on the stock.  This year’s political unrest in North Africa and a squeeze
on  consumer spending  in the U.K. have hurt holiday bookings at
London-based  Thomas Cook . Chief Executive Officer Manny Fontenla-Novoa stepped down in August after the company reduced
profit guidance three times in a year.  The new banking arrangements, including a 100 million-pound
short-term loan facility, provide “greater financial
flexibility,” Thomas Cook said in a statement.  The tour operator has an 850 million-pound revolving credit
facility and a 150 million pound term-loan, both of which are
due to mature in May 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
