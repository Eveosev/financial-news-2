Gold rose the most in more than a
week as a drop in the dollar and renewed optimism that  Europe 
will act to tame the debt crisis boosted investor demand.  The greenback slumped as much as 0.9 percent against a
basket of six major currencies, declining for the fourth
straight day. European leaders meet this weekend in Brussels as
they seek to contain the region’s fiscal crisis. Gold has
dropped 11 percent since the end of August as escalating debt
woes threatened global growth and commodity demand.  “The weaker dollar and physical buying is supporting
gold,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “People want to know what Europe
plans to do to stem the crisis.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained 1.4 percent to
settle at $1,636.10 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest advance since Oct. 10. Still, the metal
dropped 2.8 percent this week, the first weekly loss in three.  Bullion slipped to $1,604.70 yesterday, the lowest since
Oct. 5.  “The price drop definitively offers an attractive buying
opportunity,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt . “Gold is still seen as a safe haven or a store
of value, at least in the mid to long term.”  Bullion is in the 11th year of a bull market and futures
reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6 as investors sought to
diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal has
advanced 15 percent this year.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 3 percent to
$31.193 an ounce, the biggest gain since Oct. 10. The metal has
gained 3.7 percent this month.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery advanced 1.3 percent to $1,509.20 an ounce,
rising for the first time this week. Palladium futures for
December delivery jumped 5.8 percent to $618.25 an ounce, the
biggest gain since Nov. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
