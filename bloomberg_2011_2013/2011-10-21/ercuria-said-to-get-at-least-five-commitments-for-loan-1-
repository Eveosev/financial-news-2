Mercuria Energy Trading SA, a
Geneva-based oil trader, has received at least five commitments
in general syndication to potentially increase its $480 million
loan, said a person familiar with the matter.  Those commitments total more than $50 million, a second
person with direct knowledge of the deal said. Both people
declined to be identified because the details are private.  The lending was fully subscribed by the arranging group of
eight banks prior to its being marketed to other lenders, a
person familiar with the matter said earlier this month. BNP
Paribas SA, DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc,
Industrial & Commercial Bank of  China , ING Groep NV, Societe
Generale SA, Standard Chartered Plc and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. arranged the loan and are so-called bookrunners, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks were invited to join the loan in general syndication
on Sept. 12. The loan is expected to be increased from the
initial $480 million target, one of the people said today.  Mercuriaâ€™s borrowing comprises a three-year tranche of $160
million and a one-year portion of $320 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
