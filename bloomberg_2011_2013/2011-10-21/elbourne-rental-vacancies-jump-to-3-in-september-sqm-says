Melbourne’s rental vacancy rate,
which jumped in September, is likely to continue to increase as
the supply of properties grows, according to  SQM Research Pty.   The number of homes available for rent climbed to 3 percent
in the city, from 2.2 percent a year ago, SQM said in an e-
mailed release. The national rate rose to 1.9 percent from 1.5
percent a year earlier, the figures show.  “It is very possible we will see Melbourne vacancies
continue to rise from here as there is, even at this point in
time, new stock still just being completed now,” SQM Managing
Director Louis Christopher said in the release.  Canberra had the lowest vacancy rate at 0.7 percent, up
from 0.6 percent a year ago. SQM’s vacancy rate calculations are
based on online rental listings advertised for three weeks or
more compared with the total number of established rental
properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
