Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker
said the euro area’s inability to agree on a comprehensive
response to the sovereign-debt crisis has given the region a
“disastrous” image.   “We’re not really giving a great example of a high
standing of state governance,” Juncker, who leads the so-called
eurogroup, told reporters in Brussels today before a ministerial
meeting. He said divisions between  Germany  and  France  aren’t the
only obstacles to an agreement on tackling the debt crisis.  “There isn’t just a problem between Germany and France,”
Juncker said. “Germany isn’t the only country with a parliament;
others have them too.”  Juncker said today’s meeting is expected to agree on the
next disbursement of international aid for  Greece  and the
ministers also will discuss options for leveraging the euro-area
rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.  “We will discuss in detail the leverage of the aid
mechanism without taking final decisions, but so as to provide
the heads of state and government with a principled explanation
that we want to do this indeed,” Juncker said. “They will then
try to get as much as possible and needed detail” for the dual
summits on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26.  “I would have preferred anyway that there hadn’t been two
stages, Sunday and Wednesday, but that on Sunday we could have
agreed on overall solutions,” Juncker said. “One has to see
how far this all goes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
