Rates to hire capesize vessels
advanced for a third day on signs of increased demand to
transport  iron ore , used to make steel.  Daily rates for the ships rose 0.2 percent to $30,975, for
a 4.4 percent gain in three days, according to the  Baltic
Exchange  in London. Seven capesizes were booked today for
spot, or single-voyage, loadings, up from one on Oct. 19,  Omar Nokta , a New York-based analyst at investment bank Dahlman Rose
& Co., wrote in an e-mailed report today.  “World iron-ore exports are set to record a new all-time
high in the fourth-quarter 2011,” SSY Consultancy & Research
said in an e-mailed report today. The company is part of
Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd., the world’s second-largest
shipbroker.  Capesize rates more than tripled since Aug. 1. Four ships
were booked to haul iron ore today on the Western Australia-to-
China iron-ore route, Nokta said. China produced 47 percent of
the world’s crude steel in August, according to World Steel
Association figures.  Fourth-quarter forward freight agreements decreased 2.2
percent to $26,125 a day, according to data from Clarkson Plc,
the world’s largest shipbroker. Traders use FFAs to bet on or
hedge future shipping costs.  Capesizes are the biggest vessels tracked by the Baltic Dry
Index, a broader gauge of commodity-shipping rates, which
declined 0.4 percent to 2,153 points. It’s up 21 percent this
year while capesizes climbed 55 percent.  Daily rents for panamax ships, the largest that can
navigate the Panama Canal, decreased 1.6 percent to $16,215.
That’s up 10 percent this year. Supramaxes declined 0.3 percent
to $16,804. Handysize ships, the smallest tracked by the index,
decreased 0.2 percent to $11,901.  To contact the reporter on this story:
