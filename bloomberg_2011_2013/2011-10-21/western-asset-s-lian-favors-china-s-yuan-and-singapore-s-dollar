Chia Liang Lian, Singapore-based
head of  investment management  for Asia excluding  Japan  at
Western Asset Management Co., spoke at a forum today about the
outlook for Asian markets and monetary policy.  On Asian debt and currencies:  “It’s interesting that the Korean won, the Malaysian
ringgit, and some other currencies such as the Philippine peso
are considered risky assets when fundamentally elements of these
countries are superior to the U.S. We are quite convinced about
superior fundamentals in Asia. Asian debt remains under-
appreciated.  “Our recommendation is staying defensive and staying
nimble. My general sense is that the next three months are going
to be somewhat downbeat, bearish but in a year from now when we
next meet, my suspicion is that we are perhaps a happier
audience.  “In terms of specific currencies, the yuan and the
Singapore dollar are appropriate from a fundamental
perspective.”  On policy outlook:  “I’m personally surprised by the move in  Indonesia . I
didn’t expect Indonesia to ease. Perhaps with the exception of
 India , I think we are probably done with monetary tightening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
