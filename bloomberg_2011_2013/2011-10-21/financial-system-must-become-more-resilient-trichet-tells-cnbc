European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the financial system needs to become
“much more resilient,” when calling for “bold” reforms.  “It’s work in progress,” Trichet, who will retire at the
end of the month, told CNBC in an interview broadcast today.
“The paradox of  Europe  is that Europe is quite solid in terms
of fundamentals if you take Europe as a whole.”  He also said that governments and central banks have taken
“very important decisions” to contain the crisis, which is
“hitting specifically the advanced economy and the financial
system in the advanced economies.” It’s “something which calls
for very profound lessons to be drawn,” he told CNBC.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
