The  European Central Bank  must step
up purchases of government bonds to contain the euro region’s
debt crisis and prevent contagion from spreading, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, citing Paul De Grauwe.  “The ECB is the only bazooka; everything else is small
guns,” De Grauwe, a professor at the  Catholic University  of
Leuven in  Belgium , told the Zurich-based newspaper in an
 interview  published today. “The ECB should say that it’s
throwing all its unlimited tools into the balance. That would
impress financial markets and, in the end, the ECB wouldn’t have
to buy as much.”  Investors “know that they can win a battle against the
rescue fund and that they don’t stand a chance against the ECB
with its unlimited means,” De Grauwe told Tages-Anzeiger. “If
the ECB buys  government bonds  on secondary markets,” the
central bank “creates confidence and the necessary liquidity
for banks. That would mean the question of bank recapitalization
wouldn’t be quite so pressing.”  De Grauwe said that he expects the Oct. 23 summit of
European leaders to produce “insufficient results.” If
investors don’t accept losses of as much as 60 percent on Greek
debt, “the country won’t be able to make it.”  “We have no interest in waiting any longer,” the
newspaper cited De Grauwe as saying. “We’ve hesitated too long
with the haircut. That has been the reason for the uncertainty
on markets. Euro countries must act, ideally on Sunday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
