Belgian Finance Minister  Didier
Reynders  urged the  European Central Bank  to work with the euro-
area rescue fund to support banks in the region.  “There are certainly a number of European banks that will
need to be recapitalized,” Reynders told reporters today in
Brussels. “And if we’re heading toward a stronger participation
of the private sector in some national programs, a further
effort will probably be needed. This is where we would like that
the European Central Bank could work in partnership with” the
bailout fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
