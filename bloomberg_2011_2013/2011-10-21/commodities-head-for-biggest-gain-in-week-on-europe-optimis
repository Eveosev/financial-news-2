 Commodities capped their biggest
gain in a week as industrial metals and energy rebounded on
speculation that European leaders are moving closer to a deal to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose 1
percent to close at 630.63 at 15:45 p.m. New York time, after
slipping to a one-week low yesterday. Copper jumped as much as
7.2 percent, and crude oil rose for the first time in three
days. The dollar fell to a post-World War II low against the yen
and dropped versus most currencies.  “Optimism is driving the dollar lower and boosting all
commodities,” Scott Gardner, the chief investment officer at
Verdmont Capital SA in  Panama , said in an e-mail. He helps
manage $450 million in client assets.  European finance ministers began a six-day negotiation in
Brussels over how to save  Greece  from default, shield banks from
the fallout and build more powerful defenses against the debt
crisis. As much as 940 billion euros ($1.3 trillion) might be
deployed, two people familiar with the discussions said
yesterday.  Still, the GSCI gauge was down 1.1 percent for the week on
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will cripple global economic
growth, curbing demand for raw materials.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 5.4 percent to
settle at $3.223 a pound on the Comex, the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since June 1, 2009.  Crude-oil futures for December delivery jumped 1.6 percent
to $87.40 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporters on this story:
