Polish companies are less confident
about their business prospects for the fourth quarter, even
after output and capacity utilization remained high in the
third, the Warsaw-based  Narodowy Bank Polski  said.  The business-outlook index dropped to 8.9 points, down 3.3
percentage points from both the previous month and a year
earlier, the central bank said today on its website. The bank
surveyed 1,227 companies, of which 75.1 percent called their
situation “very good, or good,” down from 75.5 percent in the
second quarter.  Weakening demand, unpredictable commodities prices and a
volatile zloty exchange rate “were mentioned most often as main
the reasons for difficulties,” the bank said, adding that
“growing concern about the future economic situation” also
played a big role.  European leaders, due to meet in Brussels on Oct. 23, are
racing to find a solution to a debt crisis that has pushed
 Greece  to the brink of default and is now threatening banks
across the 17-nation euro area, which buys 55 percent of Polish
exports. German business confidence fell to a 16-month low in
October, the Munich-based Ifo institute said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
