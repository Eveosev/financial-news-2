The amount the  European Central Bank 
borrowed from the  Federal Reserve ’s dollar swap facility rose to
$1.9 billion, the most in 17 months, as U.S. prime money market
funds cut lending to the region’s banks.  The ECB took out an 84-day loan of $1.35 billion at an
interest rate of 1.09 percent and rolled over an existing $500
million seven-day loan at 1.08 percent that it first took in
September, the U.S. central bank said yesterday. The interest
rates are about 67 basis points higher than the three-month
dollar London interbank offered rate.  U.S. prime money market funds reduced lending to European
banks by 14 percent on a dollar basis in September from August,
cutting their exposure to French banks alone by 42 percent,
according to a Fitch Ratings report yesterday. Lending levels
are the lowest since the second half of 2006, when Fitch started
recording the data, as the euro-region battles to contain the
debt crisis.  “The ECB is doing weekly and monthly U.S. dollar
operations to provide liquidity to European banks because U.S.
money market funds are reducing their exposure to European
banks,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior  interest-rates 
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam.  The dollar swap facility is designed to increase liquidity
in global money markets by ensuring that foreign central banks
are able to deliver U.S. dollar funding to lenders in their
regions.  Central Banks  The central banks of  Canada , U.K.,  Japan  and  Switzerland ,
which also have access to the facility, have no loans currently
outstanding. The ECB’s loan is the largest since May 2010, when
it borrowed $6.4 billion from the facility.  In Europe, lenders increased overnight deposits at the ECB
to the highest since Oct. 10. Banks parked 188 billion euros
($258 billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 181
billion euros on Oct. 19. That compares with a year-to-date
average of 61 billion euros.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  rose for second day.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was 76 basis
points as of 10:39 a.m. in London, from 75 yesterday. The rate
reached 89 basis points on Sept. 23, the widest since March
2009.  Basis Swap  The cost for European banks to fund in dollars rose. The
one-year basis swap, the rate banks pay to convert euro payments
into dollars, was 69 basis points below the euro interbank
offered rate, from 67 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap widened to 93
basis points under Euribor from 91 yesterday. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.585 percent from 1.584
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor was unchanged at 1.158
percent.  Three-month dollar Libor rose for the 31st day to 0.418
percent from 0.405 percent, according to the British Bankers’
Association. That’s the highest since Aug. 4, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, held at 40
basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
