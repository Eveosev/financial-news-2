Any increase in Libyan oil
production after the death of Muammar Qaddafi, the country’s
former leader, may help pave the way for lower prices at U.S.
gas pumps.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the possibility exists
because gasoline futures tracked  Europe ’s benchmark grade of
crude oil more closely than the U.S. benchmark during the past
12 months.  Gasoline jumped 28 percent in the period on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The gain approached the 31 percent advance
in  Brent crude , which trades on ICE Futures Europe, and dwarfed
a 4.3 percent increase in West Texas Intermediate oil futures on
the Nymex.  “The Brent price is the closest thing we have to financial
discovery for what’s going on with gasoline,” Tom Kloza, chief
oil analyst for Oil Price Information Service LLC in Wall, New
Jersey, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  That’s the case because Brent is more in line with global
oil and oil-product prices than WTI, Kloza said. The European
crude traded at a record $28.08 a barrel more than its U.S.
counterpart a week ago.  “There may be some relief in the spread and ultimately
gasoline prices” as Qaddafi’s death spurs  Libya  to produce more
oil, according to a blog  posting  yesterday by Bespoke Investment
Group LLC, a research firm based in Harrison, New York. Libya’s
daily output will jump 74 percent by year-end, National Oil
Corp. Chairman Nuri Berruien said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
