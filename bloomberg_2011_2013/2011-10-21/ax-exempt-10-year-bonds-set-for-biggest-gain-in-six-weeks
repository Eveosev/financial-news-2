Municipal bonds are set for their
biggest rally since early September as issuance slowed following
the busiest sales week of the year.  Yields on top-rated 10-year bonds were 2.42 percent today,
down 15 basis points from last week, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest drop since the week ending
Sept. 9, when yields fell 16 basis points. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices,
dropped this week because investors grabbed tax-exempt bonds for
their relative value compared with Treasury debt, Chip Peebles,
head of retail trading at Morgan Keegan Inc. in  Memphis ,
 Tennessee , said in a telephone interview. The ratio between tax-
exempt rates and federal bond yields was 111 percent, above this
year’s average of 95 percent, as of Oct. 20.  “Between the confluence of absolute yields and the
percentage to Treasuries, the market became very attractive,”
Peebles said. “So we got both traditional and crossover buyers
coming in this week with a somewhat limited supply.”  While states and municipalities are set to borrow $7.6
billion of debt this week, California and the Hudson Yards
Infrastructure Corp. took up about $3 billion of that total.
Muni issuers sold $8.9 billion of debt in the week ended Oct. 7,
the most of any week in 2011.  “Apart from the Hudson Yards and  California  deals, the
calendar was extremely manageable and was not overwhelming at
all,” Peebles said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
