Gold gained for the first time in
five days, trimming its worst weekly performance in a month, as
optimism that European leaders have a plan to fight the region’s
debt crisis drove commodities higher.  Bullion for immediate delivery advanced as much as 0.6
percent to $1,630.30 an ounce and traded at $1,625.88 at 2:55
p.m. in Singapore. The metal is down 3.3 percent this week, the
biggest drop since the week ending Sept. 23. December-delivery
gold also gained for the first day in five, climbing as much as
1.2 percent to $1,631.50 on the Comex in  New York .  “Uncertainty in the gold market has led to shifts from day
to day as the yellow metal moves with base metals on risk-off,
trading more like a commodity, and then moves with U.S. dollars
as investors seek safe-haven assets,” James Steel, an analyst
at HSBC Securities USA Inc., wrote in a note. “This could
continue in the short term.”  Asian stocks gained and three-month copper on the  London 
Metal Exchange advanced for the first time in five days as two
people familiar with the matter said that European governments
may pool as much as 940 billion euros ($1.3 trillion) to stem
the crisis. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said in a joint statement yesterday that they
want leaders to agree on an “ambitious” plan.  Gold is in the 11th year of a bull run, the longest rally
since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek to diversify
away from equities and some currencies, as well as hedge against
accelerating consumer prices.  Chinese Gold  December-delivery bullion on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
advanced for the first day in four, gaining 0.8 percent to
335.37 yuan a gram ($1,633 an ounce). Immediate delivery gold of
99.95 percent purity, the benchmark cash contract, gained 0.7
percent to 336.80 yuan a gram on the Shanghai Gold Exchange.  “Chinese buyers have been quite active these few days,”
said Liu Yangyi, a manager at  China  National Pearl Diamond Gem &
Jewelry Import & Export Corp. The company is a member of the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, China’s largest physical market.
“Higher prices this year haven’t deterred them,” Liu said.  In China, the world’s second-biggest gold consumer, demand
typically picks up during the National Day holidays at the start
of October and lasts through the Lunar New Year in January.  Cash silver climbed as much as 1.3 percent to $31 an ounce
before trading at $30.72 an ounce. Spot platinum gained as much
as 0.9 percent to $1,508 an ounce and last traded little changed
at $1,494 an ounce. Palladium rose 1.5 percent to $596.25 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
