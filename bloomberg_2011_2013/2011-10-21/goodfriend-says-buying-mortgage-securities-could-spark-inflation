A proposal by a Federal Reserve
governor to resume purchases of mortgage-backed securities to
bolster economic growth could lead to inflation, said economist
Marvin S. Goodfriend, former research director at the Federal
Reserve Bank of Richmond.  “It’s a risky venture” and “not advisable at this
time,” Goodfriend said of the proposal made by Federal Reserve
Governor Daniel K. Tarullo during a speech yesterday in  New
York . Goodfriend suggested Tarullo’s speech could have been a
“trial balloon.”  A new round of so-called quantitative easing would need to
be done on a “huge scale,” which would be “taking risks with
higher inflation” and could ultimately weaken the economy,
Goodfriend said. It’s like drinking too much wine, he said,
“you can’t tell at the moment that you are overdoing it.”  Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon
University, spoke today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s
“Hays Advantage with  Kathleen Hays .” He was attending a
meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee in New York.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
