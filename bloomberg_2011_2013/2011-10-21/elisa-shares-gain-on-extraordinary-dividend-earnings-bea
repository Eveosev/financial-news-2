Elisa Oyj (ELI1V) , a Finnish
telecommunications company, gained as much as 2.2 percent to
15.66 euros at the start of trading in Helsinki.  Elisa will pay an extraordinary dividend of 40 cents per
share, with an ex-date of Oct. 24. The Helsinki-based companyâ€™s
third-quarter net income of 56.9 million euros beat the 50.8
million-euro mean net-income estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Elisa had net income of 50.7 million euros in the same
period a year ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
