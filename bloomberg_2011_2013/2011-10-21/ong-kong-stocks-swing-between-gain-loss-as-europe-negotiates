Hong Kong  stocks rose after a report
 Europe ’s leaders are considering a $1.3 trillion package to
fight the region’s debt crisis ahead of a summit this weekend.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates container facilities at
Greece’s Piraeus port, added 2.9 percent. Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. gained 2.3 percent after saying it will buy coking
coal from  Mongolia  over the next three years. PetroChina Co.
lost 0.5 percent after the Xinhua News Agency said the largest
Chinese oil producer may lose more than $7.8 billion due to a
rising resources tax.  The Hang Seng Index swung between gains and losses at least
15 times before closing 0.2 percent higher at 18,025.72. The
gauge completed its biggest weekly loss in a month after  China 
reported its slowest economic growth since 2009 and German
officials said before a summit on Oct. 23 there won’t be a quick
fix to Europe’s crisis.  “Looks like European leaders are making progress, but
there’s still a long way to go and the market remains very
vulnerable,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “There’s a lot
of information and a lot of uncertainty whether this weekend’s
meeting will come out with a definitive plan, or there’s more to
come after that.”  Mainland Companies Slip  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
listed in Hong Kong advanced 0.3 percent to 9,219.73 today. The
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has tumbled 22 percent this year amid concern a
U.S. recovery is stalling, and as Europe’s leaders grope for
ways to maximize the firepower of a European Financial Stability
Facility as the debt crisis threatens Italy and Spain.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. The index rose 0.5 percent yesterday in  New York 
amid speculation Europe may combine temporary and permanent
rescue funds to make as much as 940 billion euros ($1.3
trillion) available to fight the crisis, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  Gains were limited on concern European policy makers will
struggle to reach a resolution at the Oct. 23 summit. German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said in a joint statement they want agreement on a
“comprehensive and ambitious” plan as the European Union
prepares for a second summit within three days of this weekend’s
meeting.  Cosco Pacific gained 2.9 percent to HK$9.55.  Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd. (293) , Asia’s largest international carrier, advanced 2.3
percent to HK$13.32. Aluminum Corp. gained 2.3 percent to
HK$3.60.  Declining Stocks  Among stocks that fell, China Mobile Ltd., the world’s
biggest phone carrier by users, dropped 0.9 percent to HK$74.55.
The company yesterday reported third-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates. China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the
mainland’s second-largest mobile carrier, slid 1.9 percent to
HK$14.88.  PetroChina slumped 1.1 percent to HK$9.35. Spokesman Mao
Zefeng later confirmed the Xinhua report, saying the company’s
annual resource tax bill will rise.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.6 percent to 17,957.
The HSI Volatility Index gained 0.4 percent to 37.97, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 11 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
