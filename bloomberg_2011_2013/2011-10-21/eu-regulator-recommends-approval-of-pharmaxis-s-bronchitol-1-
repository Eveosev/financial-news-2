Pharmaxis Ltd. (PXS) , the Australian
developer of an experimental treatment for cystic fibrosis, won
a recommendation from a regulatory panel of the European
Medicines Agency to market the company’s most-advanced drug.  The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use
recommended Bronchitol as an add-on therapy for adult cystic
fibrosis patients, reversing an earlier decision, the agency
said today in a  statement .  Bronchitol is an inhaled treatment designed to treat cystic
fibrosis, an inherited disorder that causes build-up of sticky
mucus in the airways, leading to lung damage and infections that
can kill patients before they turn 40. Australian regulators
approved the drug in February.  Pharmaxis shares were placed on a trading halt in  Australia 
on Oct. 17 ahead of the recommendation. The stock fell 74
percent on May 25 after the European panel initially voted
against approval of Bronchitol.  To contact the reporters on this story:
