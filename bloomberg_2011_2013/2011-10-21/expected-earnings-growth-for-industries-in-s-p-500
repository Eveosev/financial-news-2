The following table details the expected
quarterly and annual year-over-year share-weighted earnings growth for
industry groups in the Standard and Poorâ€™s 500 Index.  Percentages are calculated using Bloomberg earnings estimates for
the current period compared with actual figures from a year ago.
Companies are then grouped together by industry and summed for each
period to calculate the percentage growth.  * -- Fiscal year EPS from each company was used to calculate the growth,
it might not add up from the quarterly EPS.  NM -- The calculations of percentage changes between profit
and loss and vice versa are not meaningful, hence not calculated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
