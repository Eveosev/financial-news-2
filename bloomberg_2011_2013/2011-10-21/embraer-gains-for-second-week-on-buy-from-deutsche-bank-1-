Embraer SA, the world’s fourth-
largest plane builder, advanced in  Sao Paulo , adding to a second
weekly gain, after it was rated “buy” in new coverage at
Deutsche Bank AG.  Shares rose 2.3 percent to 12.34 reais at the close of
trading, extending this week’s advance to 4.5 percent. The
benchmark Bovespa index rose 2.3 percent today and posted a 0.4
percent weekly gain.  Embraer’s commercial jets unit is poised for a “prolonged
period of growth,” Deutsche Bank’s analyst Myles Walton wrote
in a note to clients today. The company could also “increase
production of its regional jets by 15 percent without adding any
direct labor costs,” which would help to boost its profit
margin, Walton wrote.  Separately, Royal Jordanian Airlines said it intends to
expand its fleet of Embraer and Airbus SAS planes, according to
Chief Executive Officer Hussein Dabbas. “We are just waiting
for the right time,” he said.  The carrier doesn’t plan to order any new planes this year
or next, according to Dabbas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
