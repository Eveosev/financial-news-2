European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said it is “essential” to
leverage the euro area’s temporary rescue fund,  De Tijd 
reported, citing an interview.  “We must multiply our effective lending capacity to avoid
contagion,” the newspaper quoted Rehn as saying. In addition,
“support is growing” for proposals to accelerate the
introduction of a permanent bailout fund, the European Stability
Mechanism, to 2012, Rehn told the newspaper.  Referring to an EU summit on Oct. 23, Rehn said leaders
“must reach an agreement on Sunday over a coordinated approach
to increase the capital buffers” at European banks “via a
temporary increase in ratios and via careful evaluation of the
sovereign debt held,” according to  De Tijd . “These talks are
making good progress.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
