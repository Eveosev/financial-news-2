Commodity investor outflows of
almost $10 billion in September were the most since at least the
beginning of 2009 as prices slumped,  Barclays Capital  said.  The outflow was double the amount for the third quarter of
2008, when the worst global recession since World War II cut raw
materials demand, the bank said in a report e-mailed today.
Commodity assets under management fell to $393 billion last
month from $447 billion in August. The drop includes the outflow
plus price depreciation. Investments fell for consecutive
quarters for the first time since 2008, Barclays said.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities slid 12
percent last month, the most in almost three years, and about $5
trillion was wiped off the value of global stocks on speculation
growth was slowing. Traders have cut wagers on higher prices
by 48 percent since the end of August. Still, commodity prices
are up 7.5 percent this month.  The outflow “was a reflection of jittery market sentiment
and investors’ rather fickle mood,” New York-based analyst  Suki Cooper  wrote in the report. The “contrast between bearish
sentiment, but positive macro-economic and fundamental trends in
many commodities suggests that if the financial market gloom
does clear, a swift rebound in most commodity prices is
likely.”  Metals Assets  Precious metals assets under management fell to $174
billion in September, when gold futures touched a record
$1,923.70 an ounce, from $192 billion the previous month,
according to Barclays. Industrial metals assets declined to
$17.8 billion from $21.5 billion, agriculture assets slipped to
$92 billion from $103 billion and energy assets were at $110
billion compared with $130 billion in August.  Money managers cut combined net-long positions across 18
U.S. commodity futures and options to 656,691 contracts in the
week ended Oct. 11, from 1.272 million in the period to Aug. 30,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  Raw materials  rose 0.5 percent this year, heading for the
weakest annual performance 2008, as Europe’s debt crisis curbed
demand. While gold is up 16 percent, copper has slipped 26
percent on the London Metal Exchange. The MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities declined 9.8 percent and Treasuries returned
7.8 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  “Copper could benefit most from an improvement in the
financial market outlook as prices are trading a long way below
fair value,” Cooper wrote. “We also continue to favor
crude oil, corn and aluminum as commodities with the most
constructive medium-term fundamentals, while gold looks set to
benefit from the renewed concerns over inflation and currency
debasement that any cure for  Europe ’s ills will inevitably
fuel.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
