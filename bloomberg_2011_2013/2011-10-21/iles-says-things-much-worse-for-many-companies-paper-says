Bank of England  policy maker  David
Miles  said the situation for many businesses has deteriorated,
the Westmorland Gazette newspaper reported, citing an interview.  “Over the last six months things have got much worse for
many companies,” he told the paper in an interview published
late yesterday. “It was one of the main reasons our committee
decided on a round of quantitative easing across the U.K.”  He said consumers’ disposable income “has been squeezed”
and that their “shrinking income” is restraining spending.  Still, companies “should all see an improvement over the
next 12 months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
