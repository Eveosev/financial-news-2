Italy’s public debt amounted to
118.4 percent of gross domestic product last year, down from a
previous estimate of 119 percent, national statistics institute
Istat said.  Last year’s budget deficit amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP,
Rome-based Istat said today in an e-mailed report, confirming a
previous reading. Istat put out the report after revising GDP
figures earlier this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
