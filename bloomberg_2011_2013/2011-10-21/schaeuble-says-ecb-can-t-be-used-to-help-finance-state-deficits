German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said the European Central Bank cannot be used to help
finance government budget deficits.  “We have all recognized by now that it’s clear first of
all that we stick with the agreed guarantee total as it is, and,
as is written in the treaties, that the central bank is not
available for state financing,” Schaeuble told reporters today
in Brussels as he arrived for a meeting of euro-area finance
ministers.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
