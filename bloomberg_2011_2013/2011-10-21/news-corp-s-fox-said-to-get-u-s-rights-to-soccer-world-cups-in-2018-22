News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox won the U.S.
television rights to soccer’s World Cup in 2018 and 2022, taking
the tournament away from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN.  Telemundo, part of  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal unit, won
the Spanish-language rights for the tournaments, set for Russia
in 2018 and Qatar four years later.  The decision was announced yesterday by FIFA, soccer’s
international governing body, in its headquarters city of
Zurich, Switzerland.  The U.S. television rights also cover the 2015 and 2019
Women’s World Cups.  Financial details weren’t disclosed by FIFA. Sports
Business Daily, citing unidentified people, said Fox would pay
$450 million to $500 million, with Telemundo paying $600
million. ESPN paid $100 million for English-language U.S. rights
and Univision $325 million for Spanish-language rights to the
2010 and 2014 World Cups, Sports Business Daily reported.  FIFA considered rights bids from Fox, ESPN and NBC
Universal.  Lou D’Ermilio, a Fox spokesman, didn’t immediately return
an e-mail seeking comment.  ESPN said in a statement that it “made a disciplined bid
that would have been both valuable to FIFA and profitable for
our company, while continuing to grow our unprecedented coverage
of the  World Cup  and Women’s World Cup events. We were
aggressive while remaining prudent from a business
perspective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
