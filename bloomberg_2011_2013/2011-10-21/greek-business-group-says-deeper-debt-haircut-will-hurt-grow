The Hellenic Federation of
Enterprise,  Greece ’s biggest business group, said increasing
losses for holders of Greek debt to as much as 50 percent would
do “great damage to Greece and place  Europe  at great risk.”  Increasing losses from 21 percent agreed at a July 21
European Union summit would have little impact on net Greek debt
reduction and a great impact on the economy, growth and
investments, the Athens-based organization said in an e-mailed
statement today, citing a study it conducted last month.  European Union officials are weighing deeper losses for
Greek bondholders in a revamp of the July accord that provided
bondholders with a 21 percent loss in a voluntary swap.  The federation said a 50 percent writedown would be imposed
on about 201.9 billion euros ($281 billion) of eligible Greek
debt, after removing the 78 billion euros of loans from the EU
and International Monetary Fund, 62 billion euros held by the
 European Central Bank , and 23.7 billion euros of Treasury bills
and securitised loans.  The writedown would result in a debt of 101 billion euros.
The organization calculates 40 billion euros would be needed to
recapitalise banks and another 13 billion euros for pension
funds, while the  Bank of Greece (TELL)  would have a loss of 3.4 billion
euros and insurance companies another 1 billion euros. The net
benefit of a 50 percent cut would be 43.6 billion euros,
according to the group.  “The Greek government must fight to avoid a scenario in
which the haircut on debt diverges much from the terms of the
July 21 agreement,” the organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
