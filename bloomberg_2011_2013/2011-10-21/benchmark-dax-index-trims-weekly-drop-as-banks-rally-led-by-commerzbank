German stocks advanced, with the
benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  erasing a weekly decline, amid speculation
euro-area governments may deploy as much as $1.3 trillion to
fight the region’s debt crisis.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  followed a rally in
European banking shares. Steelmakers  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and
 Salzgitter AG (SZG)  rose with metal prices.  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  MAN SE (MAN) 
climbed more than 3.5 percent.  The DAX advanced 3.6 percent to 5,970.96 at the close in
Frankfurt, bringing this week’s gain to 0.1 percent. The gauge
has still fallen 21 percent from this year’s high on May 2 amid
concern global economic growth is slowing and policy makers are
struggling to contain Europe’s debt crisis. The broader  HDAX
Index (HDAX)  climbed 3.4 percent today.  “Financial markets worldwide remain almost exclusively
governed by efforts to fight  Europe ’s debt crisis,” said Ansgar Krekeler, a sales analyst at WGZ-Bank AG in Dusseldorf, Germany.
“What will come out of government leader meetings is still
open. We recommend having a neutral position on the DAX.”  Negotiations on combining the euro area’s temporary and
planned permanent rescue funds from mid-2012, while scrapping a
ceiling on bailout spending, accelerated this week after efforts
to leverage the  temporary fund  ran into European Central Bank
opposition and provoked the French-German clash, two people
familiar with the discussions said. They declined to be
identified because political leaders will have to decide.  Finance ministers met in Brussels today to lay the
groundwork for an Oct. 23 meeting of government leaders. A
summit for Oct. 26 was set yesterday after  Germany  and  France 
said the European Union needs more time to seal a “global and
ambitious” accord.  Business Confidence  German stocks gained even as a report showed the country’s
business confidence fell to a 16-month low in October. The
Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 106.4, the lowest reading
since June 2010, from 107.4 in September. Economists had
predicted a decline to 106.2, according to the median forecast
of 42 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, Germany’s biggest banks,
gained 6.9 percent to 27.83 euros and 7.4 percent to 1.70 euros,
respectively. Lenders posted the third-best performance among 19
industry groups in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index today,
rising 3.8 percent.  ThyssenKrupp and Salzgitter, Germany’s largest steelmakers,
climbed 3.5 percent to 19.96 euros and 3 percent to 38.57 euros,
respectively, as copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all advanced
on the London Metal Exchange.  Daimler, the world’s third-biggest maker of luxury cars,
added 5 percent to 36.72 euros, its first advance this week.
MAN, the truckmaker that Volkswagen AG is seeking to control,
rose 3.7 percent to 59.70 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
