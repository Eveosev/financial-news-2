Merck KGaA (MRK)  will return all rights
for safinamide to Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., the company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Merck had acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop,
manufacture and commercialize safinamide in Parkinson’s disease
and other therapeutic applications.  The agreement termination will become effective in April
2012 and will result in about 40 million euros of additional
costs for the Merck Serono division in the fourth quarter. The
costs will be excluded from both the division’s and the Merck
Group’s fourth-quarter underlying operating result, the company
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
