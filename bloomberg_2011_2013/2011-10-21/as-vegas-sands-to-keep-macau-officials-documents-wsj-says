Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  told employees
to retain documents regarding transactions with Macau government
officials, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an internal
memo from the general counsel.  The memo also lists some employees and contractors about
whom documents are to be kept, the newspaper said, citing the
memo.  The company said in March the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the  Justice Department  have sought documents
related to the Macau unit’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.  Founder and Chief Executive Officer  Sheldon Adelson  has
said Las Vegas Sands is cooperating with U.S. investigators and
he is sure it will be cleared of wrongdoing. Adelson said the
U.S. probes stem from allegations in a lawsuit filed by former
 Sands China Ltd. (1928)  CEO Steven Jacobs, who claims the company
breached his employment contract.  Las Vegas Sands spokesman Ron Reese said today the company
is cooperating fully with the investigation and declined further
comment.  Shares of Sands China Ltd., the Macau unit of Las Vegas
Sands, fell 2.7 percent to HK$18.72 at 9:41 a.m. in Hong Kong
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
