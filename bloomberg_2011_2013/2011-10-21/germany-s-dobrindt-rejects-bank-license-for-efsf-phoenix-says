Giving the European Financial
Stability Facility a bank license would be a “diabolical
solution” to resolve the euro region’s sovereign debt crisis,
Alexander Dobrindt, general secretary of the Christian Social
Union, the Bavarian sister party of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
 Christian Democratic Union , said on Phoenix television.  He rejected any widening of risks for  Germany  from its
guarantees to the EFSF, Phoenix said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
