The number of Spanish mortgages
issued for home purchases fell for a 16th month in August as
banks rein in lending amid a surge in borrowing costs and bad
loans.  The number of home loans fell 41.7 percent from a year
earlier after a 47 percent drop in July, the National Statistics
Institute said in an e-mailed statement today in  Madrid . Total
capital lent on all mortgages fell 40.9 percent, it said.  Spain  is working through an excess of 700,000 unsold homes
after a decade-long building boom collapsed, prompting a three-
year economic slump that has pushed the  unemployment rate  to the
highest in the euro region.  Banco Espanol de Credito SA (BTO) , the
Spanish retail unit of Banco Santander SA, said on Oct. 11 its
loan book shrank 7 percent from a year earlier, and its bad-loan
ratio rose to 4.65 percent from 3.8 percent a year ago.  In the industry overall, the bad-loan ratio rose to 7.15
percent in August, the highest since 1994, according to the Bank
of Spain.  Home prices  fell 5.5 percent from a year earlier in
the third quarter, the 12th decline, the Public Works and
Housing Ministry said on Oct. 18. Still, prices remain out of
reach for many with the unemployment rate at 21.2 percent,
rising to 46 percent among young Spaniards.  As part of efforts to reduce the stock of unsold homes, the
government has lowered value-added tax on new homes to 4 percent
from 8 percent for the remaining four months of the year. The
move is the second attempt to spur purchases with tax incentives
after a plan to give Spaniards a year to buy homes and lock in
tax breaks prompted an eight-month increase in home purchases.  People’s Party leader  Mariano Rajoy , the favorite in
opinion polls to win the general election on Nov. 20, has
pledged to bring back tax rebates for mortgage holders. The PP
may win as many as 190 seats in Spain’s 350-seat Parliament, a
poll by El Pais newspaper showed on Oct. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
