Bolivia’s President  Evo Morales 
amended a proposed law so as to reroute a government-backed
highway that would have bisected a national park and indigenous
territory.  Morales spoke at a press conference this afternoon, two
days after more than 1,000 people completed a 66-day, 250-mile
trek from the lowlands to the government seat of La Paz to
protest the highway, which is largely funded by Brazil and will
run between the cities of Cochabamba and Trinidad.  Anger at a police crackdown on the marchers in September
led Interior Minister Sacha Llorenti to resign, while the
country’s Defense Minister quit in solidarity with the Indians.  Morales said the amended text prohibits  road construction 
across the National Park and Indigenous Territory Isiboro-
Secure. The Senate will review the changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
