Argentina ’s Pluspetrol SA agreed to
sell liquefied petroleum gas from its Camisea fields to Peruvian
state oil company Petroleos del Peru SA, daily  El Comercio 
reported.  The deal will enable Peru’s President  Ollanta Humala  to
fulfill a campaign pledge to cut LPG prices by selling more of
the fuel on the domestic market, the newspaper said, citing
Pluspetrol country manager German Jimenez.  The companies haven’t set the volume of gas or sale price
yet, El Comercio said. Petroperu seeks to control a 40 percent
share of the local LPG market, the newspaper reported.  Petroperu President Humberto Campodonico and Pluspetrol
spokesman Daniel Guerra didn’t immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
