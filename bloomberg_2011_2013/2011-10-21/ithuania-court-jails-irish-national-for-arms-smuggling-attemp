A Lithuanian court sentenced an
Irish national to 12 years in prison for trying to purchase and
smuggle weapons for the paramilitary group Real IRA,  Baltic News
Service  reported, citing Prosecutor Gedgaudas Norkunas.  Michael Campbell was arrested in Vilnius in January 2008
after purchasing weapons from an undercover agent, the newswire
said. Prosecutors had asked for a prison term of 16 years for
Campbell, while judge said a shorter term was justified as his
actions were controlled and caused no actual damage, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
