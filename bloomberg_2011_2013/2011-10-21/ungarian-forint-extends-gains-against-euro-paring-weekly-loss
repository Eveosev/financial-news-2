The forint extended gains against
the euro, rebounding from yesterday’s 2 1/2-year low, as euro-
area leaders intensified negotiations to boost rescue funds to
be used to end the region’s debt crisis.  Hungary’s currency advanced 0.7 percent to 298.3 per euro
by 2:04 p.m. in Budapest, paring its decline this week to 1.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
