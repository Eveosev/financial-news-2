Canada’s dollar was little changed
against its U.S. counterpart after a government report showed
that consumer prices increased more than forecast last month.  The  consumer price index  increased 3.2 percent in September
from a year earlier, compared with an August pace of 3.1 percent
and a May peak of 3.7 percent,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted a 3.1
percent reading according to the median of 25 estimates.  Canada’s currency traded at C$1.0146 per U.S. dollar at
7:02 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 98.56U.S. cents.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
