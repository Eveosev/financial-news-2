Japanese stocks fell, extending
losses for the week on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average, as European
leaders mulled a $1.3 trillion bailout fund ahead of a summit on
the region’s debt crisis this weekend.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender
by market value, dropped 0.6 percent.  Tokio Marine  Holdings Ltd.
led declines among Japan’s biggest non-life insurers after
Jefferies Group Inc. cut ratings to “underperform.”  Enplas
Corp. (6961) , a producer of plastic parts used in cars and electronics,
jumped 8.6 percent after posting a narrower loss than forecast.  The Nikkei 225 was little changed at 8,678.89 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, ending the week 0.8 percent lower. The broader
Topix index fell 0.2 percent to 744.21 ahead of a meeting of
European leaders this weekend in Brussels. The gauge has dropped
17 percent this year amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
spread to banks.  “There’s a lot of information and a lot of uncertainty
whether this weekend’s meeting will come out with a definitive
plan,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment
markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management,
which oversees about $150 billion. “The market is still very
unsure.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4
percent today. The index rose 0.5 percent yesterday in  New York .
Stocks rose after a report that Europe may combine temporary and
permanent rescue funds to make as much as 940 billion euros
($1.3 trillion) available to fight the crisis, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  Another Summit  Japanese stocks fluctuated before finishing down today on
concern European policy makers will struggle to reach a
resolution at the summit on Oct. 23. German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said in a joint
statement they want euro-region leaders to agree on a
“comprehensive and ambitious” plan as the European Union plans
a second summit within three days of this weekend’s meeting.  “It looks like Europe is gradually getting its act
together on a rescue plan for the debt crisis,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.
“Still, investors are going to keep sitting on the fence and
trading is going to be light.”  Mitsubishi UJF lost 0.6 percent to 335 yen. Mizuho
Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s third-biggest lender, dropped 0.9
percent to 110 yen. Resona Holdings Inc., the fourth-largest,
fell 1.5 percent to 330 yen.  Insurers, Steelmakers  Non-life insurers declined after Jefferies cut their
ratings to “underperform’ on concern natural disasters in
Thailand and Japan will hurt earnings. Tokio Marine, Japan’s
biggest casualty insurer, slumped 4.1 percent to 1,763 yen.
MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc. sank 3.7 percent to 1,518
yen. NKSJ Holdings Inc. fell 2.7 percent to 1,551 yen.  Japan’s biggest steel producers declined. The nation’s
shipbuilders will ask domestic  steel mills  to cut prices for
plate used to construct vessels or be replaced by rivals from
 South Korea  or  China  as the yen strengthens, three people
familiar with the matter said.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , the nation’s
No. 1 producer by sales, slipped 1.3 percent to 1,402 yen.
 Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  fell 1.4 percent to 210 yen.  Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. (5405)  lost 0.7 percent to 152 yen.  Among stocks that rose, Enplas Corp. jumped 8.6 percent to
1,561 yen. The company had a net loss of 250 million yen ($3.3
million) for the six months through September, compared with a
forecast for a 450 million yen loss, according to a preliminary
earnings statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  PanaHome Corp. (1924) , a builder of prefabricated houses, advanced
2.6 percent to 560 yen. The company said profit beat its
forecast by 36 percent, surging to 3 billion yen for the six
months through September, as demand for temporary housing
increased in the aftermath of the March earthquake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
