European Central Bank  governing
council member Ewald Nowotny said  he welcomed that Austrian
lender  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  had cleaned up its balance sheet.  “Of course you can ask: why now and not earlier, but it’s
good that it is like that now,” he said at an investor
convention in Vienna today.  He also said there had been many wrong developments in the
banking industry, and that stronger regulation and supervision
was necessary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
