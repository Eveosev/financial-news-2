The European Union said  Italy 
“urgently” needs to move to boost economic growth in the
country.  Italy has undertaken an “ambitious” program of deficit-
cutting measures that “go in the right direction,”  Amadeu
Altafaj , spokesman for EU Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn , told reporters today in Brussels. “Now
they need to be followed urgently by bolder action to relaunch
Italy’s growth.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
