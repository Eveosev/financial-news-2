Southeastern Asset Management Inc. ,
the third-largest shareholder of  Olympus Corp. (7733) , sent a letter
yesterday to the company’s board seeking more information about
acquisitions including that of Gyrus Group Plc.  The Memphis, Tennessee-based asset management company that
has invested in Olympus since 2004, requested answers from the
endoscope maker by Nov. 16, according to Josh Shores, a London-
based principal for Southeastern, which manages about $30
billion in assets.  Southeastern joins Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Harris
Associates LP in urging Olympus to respond to allegation made by
the company’s former chief executive officer Michael C. Woodford
who commissioned a report that said the company may face
regulatory and legal scrutiny because of payments made to
advisers in the acquisition of Gyrus in 2008.  “We have been disappointed by the development that
resulted in Mr. Woodford’s removal and subsequent public
allegations that have come out that cannot be ignored,” Shores
said in a phone interview today. “ We are very disturbed and
frustrated. We don’t have answers to those public allegations so
these are very serious issues.”  A letter was also sent to Tokyo-based Olympus’ auditors and
regulators including  Japan ’s Financial Services Agency and the
 Tokyo  Stock Exchange, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
