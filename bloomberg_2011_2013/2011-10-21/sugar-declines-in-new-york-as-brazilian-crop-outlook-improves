Sugar prices in New York fell for
the third straight day on prospects for higher output in  Brazil ,
the world’s biggest exporter.  The country’s Center South, the main growing region, may
produce 135.5 kilograms of sugar per metric ton of cane, up from
a forecast of 134.5 kilograms, Caio Carvalho, a director at
Canaplan, a consulting company, said today in the city of
Guaruja. Earlier, futures rose as much as 2.1 percent on
speculation that European policy makers are moving closer to
resolving debt woes.  “Seeing higher yields and larger supply will quell buying
interest,” Sterling Smith, an analyst at Country Hedging in  St.
Paul ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone interview. “That’s pushing
buyers to the sidelines.”  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to 26.55
cents a pound at 12:15 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Before today, the price dropped 26 percent from a 30-year high
of 36.08 on Feb. 2.  Traders and analysts are the most bearish in almost three
months on mounting speculation that supplies will outpace demand
for the first time in four years, a Bloomberg survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
