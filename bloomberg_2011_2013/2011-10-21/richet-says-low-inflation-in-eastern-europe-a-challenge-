European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said anchoring low inflation in central and
eastern European countries remains a “challenge” and sound
fiscal policies are needed as they converge with Western  Europe .  “While all countries have reduced inflation to moderate
levels, the entrenchment of a low inflation environment still
constitutes a challenge in many economies,” Trichet said at an
event in Warsaw today, according to a text of his remarks.  Countries in central and eastern Europe have seen budget
deficits widen and inflation accelerate following the global
financial crisis. In  Poland , the region’s largest economy,
inflation has stayed above the central bank’s 2.5 percent target
for the past 12 months.  Trichet added that countries ultimately wishing to join the
euro need to pursue sound fiscal and economic policies.  “Achieving sustainable convergence requires the conduct of
sound economic policies, both before and after adoption of the
euro,” he said. “The present global crisis is demonstrating,
once again, to which extent continuous resolute sound macro
policies are the best way to improve economic and financial
resilience in times of unexpected challenges and shocks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
