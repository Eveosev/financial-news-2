Ghana ’s cedi climbed the most in
more than two weeks against the U.S. currency and headed for the
biggest five-day advance in eight months as the central bank
sold dollars to stem the local currency’s drop.  The cedi strengthened 1.4 percent to 1.5919 per dollar, the
biggest increase since Oct. 4, as of 12:25 p.m. in Accra, the
capital. The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa
producer has appreciated 3 percent this week, making it the
world’s best performer in the period among more than 170
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The cedi is set for the best
weekly increase since the five days through Feb. 11.  The central bank sold $98 million on Oct. 17 and about $50
million yesterday, Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury and Collins
Antwi, an assistant director said in separate interviews when
the actions were taken. The bank had earlier sold $565 million
this month, governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur said Oct. 19. There
was no one available for comment today when Bloomberg News
called the department, according to a a woman who answered the
call and declined to be identified.  “Clearly,  Bank of Ghana  support is behind strong rally,”
Coura Fall, a Johannesburg-based analyst at Citigroup Inc., said
by e-mail today. “Most emerging-market currencies have rather
depreciated this week on the strong dollar.”  The cedi has strengthened 3 percent since Oct. 17, when it
reached 1.6411 per dollar, the weakest since at least 1994, when
Bloomberg started compiling the data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
