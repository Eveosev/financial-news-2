During World War I, Allies wanting
to open a supply route to  Russia  made a plan to attack the
Dardanelles.  After a failed naval attempt, ground troops were sent to
take on the Ottoman forces. The invasion began in April 1915,
lasted 8 months and turned into an unmitigated disaster.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Allied forces were pinned down by Turkish snipers occupying
the high ground. Corpses were everywhere: in the trenches, dug
into parapets and, worst of all, decomposing in the hot sun.
Bloated cadavers bred millions of flies, dysentery and
paratyphoid fever, and an inescapable, nauseating stench.  On the beaches, crabs feasted on the dead -- touching a
stray boot would cause its contents to come scuttling out. The
men of the French Foreign Legion made the best of a bad
situation by harvesting the crustaceans to make a tasty
bouillabaisse.  In the end, the Allies evacuated.  I spoke with Peter Hart, author of “Gallipoli,” on the
following topics:  1. Tragic Folly  2. Wholesale Slaughter  3. Rife With Disease  4. Incompetent Command  5. Long-Term Consequences  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
