STX Group said it had no financial
troubles after shares of units tumbled amid concerns about its
funding.  “There is no financial problem at STX,” the group said in
an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg News queries. “Business is
normal.”  STX Pan Ocean Co., the group’s shipping arm, earlier today
fell by the 15 percent daily limit in Seoul trading. STX
Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. dropped as much as 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
