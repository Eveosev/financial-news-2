The company said it will pay a dividend of 2.23 Singapore cents

support vessels by sales, tumbled 9.3 percent to S$1.02 even as
parent STX Group rejected speculation the companies may sell
shares.  “There were rumors about the group planning to sell shares
and bonds because they may be short of funds,” said Um Kyung A,

officials told her the rumors were untrue. “There is no
financial problem at STX,” the group said in an e-mailed reply
to Bloomberg News queries.  Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR)  , the budget carrier
