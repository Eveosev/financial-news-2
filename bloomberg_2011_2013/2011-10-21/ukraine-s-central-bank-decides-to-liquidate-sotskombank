Ukraine’s central bank said it
decided to liquidate PAT KB Sotskombank after it failed to
restore financial stability following the 2008 global credit
crisis.  The Kiev-based Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy appointed Nataliya Khorolenko as a temporary administrator to assume control at
Sotskombank in order to stabilize it in March 2009. She will now
supervise the liquidation process, the central bank said today
on its website.  Ukrainian banks were shaken by the global financial crisis,
which dried up credit and weakened regional currencies. The
former Soviet republic was forced to seek an International
Monetary Fund bailout to support its financial industry.  Ukraine was in the process of liquidating 20 banks as of
Oct. 5, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
