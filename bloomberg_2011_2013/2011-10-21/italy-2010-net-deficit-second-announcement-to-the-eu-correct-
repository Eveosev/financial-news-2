(Corrects the 2007, 2008 and 2009 balance and debt
percentage of GDP.)  Following is a table of the 2010
budget deficit figures submitted to the European Commission by
the Italian Statistics institute in Rome.  Istat revised figures for  Italy â€™s debt and deficit as a
percentage of GDP for the years 2007 to 2010, due to an earlier
revision of the GDP statistics.  The data on general government debt were previously
released by the  Bank of Italy .
