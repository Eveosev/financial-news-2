California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  fell for a fifth straight day amid speculation crude
prices will fall with the return of output from Libya.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles fell 4 cents to 13 cents a gallon above gasoline
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:11 p.m.
East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
premium for the fuel narrowed by almost two-thirds this week,
reaching the lowest level since Sept. 21.  Brent crude  on the ICE Futures Europe exchange fell 20
cents to $109.56 to drop 4.5 percent for the week as analysts
predicted Libyan oil output would increase. California’s Energy
Department said yesterday that crude oil input at state
refineries rose 2.2 percent to 11.2 million barrels in the week
ended Oct. 14.  “Now that the Libyan conflict has been resolved and more
oil from the Canadian  tar sands  is coming online, crude supply
is looking good,” said Bob Van Der Valk, an independent fuel-
pricing analyst in Terry, Montana.  San Francisco Carbob slipped 4 cents to a premium of 10
cents over gasoline futures, the lowest level since Sept. 21.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland, Oregon, fell 0.38 cents to 29.5 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
