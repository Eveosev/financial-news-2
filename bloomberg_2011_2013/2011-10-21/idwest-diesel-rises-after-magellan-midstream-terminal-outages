Diesel in the Midwest rose to the
highest level since June as demand by farmers and  North Dakota 
oil operations dried up supplies at some Magellan Midstream
Partners LP terminals.  Recent demand for diesel “at our terminals in North Dakota
has been very high,” said Bruce Heine, a spokesman for the
company. “As a result, we have encountered some short-term
outages. The outages can last a few hours or in some cases, a
few days.”  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Midwest, or
Group 3, gained 0.87 cent to 8 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:35 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
0.08 cent to $3.1005 a gallon.  “Between the oil fields,  road construction , mining, and
the harvest,” demand in North Dakota has grown, said Mike Rud,
executive director of the state’s Petroleum Marketers
Association.  The  oil fields  use 2 million to 3 million gallons of diesel
a day for drilling and trucking, he said. North Dakota has
surpassed the billion gallons it consumed last year, according
to Rud.  Magellan was loading diesel in Fargo, North Dakota, today
and the company’s pipeline and terminals are operating normally
from a mechanical standpoint, Heine said.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  Chicago  rose 0.5
cent to 5 cents a gallon versus futures, the highest level since
Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
