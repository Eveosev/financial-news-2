(Corrects list of banks in the second paragraph.)  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Latin
America’s largest company by market value, plans to sell bonds
denominated in euros and pounds, according to three people
familiar with the matter.  The state-run oil producer, based in  Rio de Janeiro , hired
banks including Banco Bradesco SA, Deutsche Bank AG and Banco
Santander SA to manage the bond offering, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the plans haven’t been
announced publicly. The sale will take place when market
conditions improve, the people said.  A Petrobras official declined to confirm or deny the bond
plans when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said on
Sept. 9 that Brazil’s top oil producer would consider “jumbo
deals” in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  “There is no hurry for us, we do not need to accept higher
yields because we have $30 billion in cash,” Barbassa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
