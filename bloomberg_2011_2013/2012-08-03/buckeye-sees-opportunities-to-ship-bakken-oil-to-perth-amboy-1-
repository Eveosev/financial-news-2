Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  has identified
potential opportunities for the handling and storage of Bakken
crude oil from North Dakota at a New Jersey terminal, Chief
Executive Officer Clark Smith said in an earnings call.  There has been “strong customer interest” for Bakken
crude at the company’s Perth Amboy facility, which is “well-
suited” to handle rail shipments of the grade, he said.  Buckeye on July 26 completed the purchase of the Perth
Amboy Marine terminal from Chevron for $260 million, Smith said.
The site includes 4 million barrels of storage, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
