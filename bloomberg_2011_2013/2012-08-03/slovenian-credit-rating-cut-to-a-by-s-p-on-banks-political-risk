Slovenia had its sovereign  credit
rating  lowered by one level by Standard and Poor’s, which cited
political risks to the implementation of an economic overhaul
and deteriorating asset quality at banks.  S&P cut Slovenia’s rating to A, five steps below the top
investment grade, from A+, assigning a negative outlook that
indicates it’s more inclined to cut its assessment further than
raise it or leave it unchanged, according to a statement today.
The grade is the same as Slovakia’s and one step above Poland’s.  “There are still significant policy implementation risks
to planned budgetary, pension, health care, labor, and state
administration reforms,” S&P said. “Coupled with growing asset
quality problems in public- and private-sector banks, we believe
policy implementation uncertainty has contributed to financial
sector external funding contracting sharply, government funding
costs increasing, and the domestic economy weakening.”  Slovenia may become the sixth euro-region member after
 Greece , Ireland,  Portugal ,  Spain  and Cyprus to require a rescue
as the 17-nation currency area grapples with a deepening debt
and banking crisis. Moody’s Investors Service cut Slovenia’s
rating three levels yesterday to Baa2, two levels above
investment grade, because of soaring funding costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
