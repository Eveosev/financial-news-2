Boeing Co. (BA)  said it was told by Air
India Ltd. that the carrier will start making plans next week to
take delivery of its first 787 Dreamliners after winning
government approval for the new planes today.  The state-owned airline isn’t refusing the jets after last
weekend’s engine failure, Boeing India President Dinesh Keskar
said in an interview. Airline executives want an update on the
investigation into the incident as they prepare to receive the
first three planes that are ready for them, Keskar said.  “They want to know what the issue is, just like anybody
would,” Keskar said of the incident, when debris spewed from
the back of an engine on July 28 on an  Air India  787 that was
preparing for its first flight. “We’ve worked with them for 60
years, and they know we’re not going to give them something
that’s not right. But they certainly want to know what’s going
on and told us to let them know by Monday if we have any
insight.”  Airline executives called Keskar today to tell him about
the successful Cabinet committee meeting they’d been up all
night preparing for, he said. The government approved a
compensation agreement for delays to the plane, paving the way
for deliveries to start. Boeing has three 787s waiting for the
carrier at its South Carolina plant.  Air India had asked for $840 million after Chicago-based
Boeing’s struggles to adopt new materials and production
techniques for the 787 set the composite-plastic plane’s entry
into  service  back more than three years. Keskar declined to
discuss the compensation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
