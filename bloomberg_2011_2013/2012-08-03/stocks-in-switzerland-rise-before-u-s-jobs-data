Stocks in Switzerland  rose for a
second day, with the benchmark Swiss Market Index completing its
third week of gains, after a report showed that U.S. payrolls
climbed more than forecast in July.  OC Oerlikon Corp AG (OERL) , the world’s largest maker of textile
machinery, added 0.9 percent after saying its profit margin will
increase this year.  Givaudan (GIVN)  SA, the biggest manufacturer of
flavors and fragrances, declined 3.6 percent as first-half
earnings missed analysts’ projections.  The  SMI (SMI)  advanced 0.9 percent to 6,461.54 at the close in
Zurich, finishing a weekly rally of 1.6 percent. The gauge has
jumped 13 percent since its 2012 low on June 4 as policy makers
eased repayment terms for Spanish lenders and central banks took
steps to boost economic growth. The broader Swiss Performance
Index rose 0.9 percent today.  “In the current environment, the world is flying only on
one engine and this engine is the  U.S. economy ,” said Didier Duret, who helps manage about $200 billion as chief investment
officer at ABN Amro Private Banking. “That’s why it is so
important to look at these numbers coming out from the U.S.,”
he said in a Bloomberg TV interview with  Maryam Nemazee .  The volume of shares changing hands on SMI companies today
was 2.2 percent above the average of the past 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Unemployment Rate  In the U.S., payrolls increased 163,000 last month,
following a revised 64,000 jump in June that was less than
initially reported, Labor Department figures showed. The median
estimate of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a gain of 100,000. Unemployment rose to 8.3 percent.  The  Federal Reserve  has repeatedly said it will take
additional steps “if needed” to support the economy.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday said
the ECB is working on a plan to re-enter bond markets and that
new purchases in the secondary market would only complement
buying by the European Union’s rescue fund in the primary
market, to which strict conditionality is attached.  Oerlikon advanced 0.9 percent to 7.99 francs. Earnings
before interest and taxes, excluding a one-time gain from the
disposal of property at the textiles unit, will increase by half
a percentage point to about 11.5 percent of sales this year,
Chief Executive Officer Michael Buscher said.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Switzerland ’s largest
lenders, rose 3.6 percent to 10.50 francs and 4.6 percent to
16.74 francs, respectively. A gauge of bank shares was the  best
performer  on the Stoxx 600 Europe Index, gaining 5.1 percent.  Adecco SA, the largest supplier of temporary workers, rose
4.5 percent to 44.15 francs.  Givaudan tumbled 3.6 percent to 920 francs, the biggest
slide since Aug. 10. First-half earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of 428 million francs ($435
million) missed the average analyst estimate of 451.7 million
francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
