OAO Novatek rose after Chief
Executive Officer Leonid Mikhelson said Russia’s second-largest
natural-gas producer is raising its output growth forecast for
the year percent on strong first-half performance.  Novatek gained 1 percent to 349.47 rubles by 3:01 p.m. in
Moscow, reversing an earlier decline. The stock has slumped 11
percent this year.  Gas production will probably rise 7 percent to 11 percent
on average from last year, Mikhelson, a billionaire shareholder
in the company, told reporters today in Moscow.  “We said in the beginning of the year that growth would be
about 6 percent to 7 percent,” Mikhelson said. “First-half
growth was significantly higher.”  Gross natural-gas output jumped 12 percent to 28.7 billion
cubic meters in the first half, Novatek said July 11. OAO
Gazprom, the world’s biggest producer of the fuel, cut output
about 6.3 percent in the period to 252.4 billion cubic meters,
according to data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. The
companies together produce about 80 percent of the country’s
natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
