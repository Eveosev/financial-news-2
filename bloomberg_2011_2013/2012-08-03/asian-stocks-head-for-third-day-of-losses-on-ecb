Asian  stocks  fell for a third day as
after the  European Central Bank  failed to deliver immediate
action to stem the debt crisis and after  China ’s central bank
affirmed current policies.  Sharp (6753)  Corp. led technology shares
lower after it forecast a wider loss.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  and  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306)  paced declines among lenders after surging bond
yields in Spain and  Italy  stoked concern Europe’s debt crisis
may hamper the global financial system. Sharp, Japan’s largest
maker of liquid-crystal displays, plunged 28 percent after
widening its full-year loss forecast. ResMed Inc., the world’s
second-biggest maker of machines to regulate breathing for
people with sleep disorders, jumped 9.3 percent in Sydney after
earnings beat analyst estimates.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.8 percent to 117.12 as
of 8:08 p.m. in Tokyo, poised to drop a third day. More than
three stocks declined for each that rose. The measure has gained
1 percent this week. Investors are awaiting U.S. jobs data
today, which may give clues to prospects for further easing from
the  Federal Reserve .  “The trouble in Europe is nothing immediately takes
place,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “It’s true to say China has scope to
do more both in terms of monetary policy and fiscal policy, but
it’s not doing much. On one hand, China doesn’t feel as
pressured as the Fed and ECB.”  Policy Response  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 8.5 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern policy
makers won’t do enough to counter Europe’s debt crisis and
slowing economic growth in the U.S. and China. The regional
benchmark traded at 12 times  estimated earnings , compared with
13.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.1 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) , South Korea’s Kospi Index
and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 all slid 1.1 percent. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index lost 0.5 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.1 percent. The
Shanghai Composite Index rose 1 percent and Singapore’s Straits
Times Index gained 0.5 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rose 1 percent today. The gauge fell
0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday after ECB President  Mario
Draghi  demanded euro-zone governments turn to existing rescue
funds before the central banks intervenes.  Surging Yields  Yields on Spain’s 10-year government bonds surged 43 basis
points to 7.17 percent yesterday. Comparable yields in Italy
jumped 40 basis points to 6.33 percent.  Banks accounted for 19 percent of the decline on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  fell 1.1
percent to A$55.98, while Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 1.3 percent to
370 yen in Tokyo.  China will conduct policy fine-tuning at an appropriate
time and consumer inflation may rebound after August, the
People’s Bank of China said in a quarterly monetary-policy
report on its website yesterday. China’s non-manufacturing
industries expanded at a slower pace in July, the government
reported.  “A slowdown in growth has been relatively controlled and
it’s in line with what policy makers wanted,” said AMP
Capital’s Oliver. “That explains why they are moving in a very
slow, deliberate way rather than the shock-and-awe approach they
used in 2008.”  U.S. Jobs  The Fed’s Aug. 1 pledge to provide additional support for
the economy disappointed investors anticipating a more
definitive sign of further monetary easing. A government report
today may show U.S. payrolls increased by 100,000 workers in
July, following an 80,000 gain in June, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
 unemployment rate  is projected to hold at 8.2 percent.  About 55 percent of the 293 companies on the Asian
benchmark index that reported earnings since July and for which
Bloomberg had estimates failed to meet expectations. Earnings
per share at companies on the index are expected to grow 21
percent this fiscal year.  Sharp forecast an annual loss of 250 billion yen ($3.2
billion) yesterday as demand for its Aquos TVs slumped, while
 Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
reduced its full-year net income forecast by a third to 20
billion yen. Sharp also announced its first job cuts since the
1950s.  Sharp plunged 28 percent to 192 yen, the biggest drop since
1974. Sony fell 7 percent to 897 yen. Hon Hai Precision Industry
Co. lost 3.8 percent to NT$81.60 and Foxconn Technology Co.
declined 7 percent to NT$100 in Taipei. The two companies
announced in March plans to buy stakes in Sharp.  Among stocks that rose, ResMed soared 9.3 percent to A$3.30
in Sydney. Fourth-quarter net income jumped 31 percent to $76.8
million in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier.
That compares with the $68.6 million average of eight analysts
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
