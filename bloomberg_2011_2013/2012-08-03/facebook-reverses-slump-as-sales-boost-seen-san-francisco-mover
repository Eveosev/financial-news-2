Facebook Inc. (FB)  climbed the most in
seven weeks after  Brian Wieser , an analyst at Pivotal Research
Group, said the world’s largest social-networking website could
step up revenue growth with ad sales.  The  shares  of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook
increased 5.2 percent to $21.09 at the close in New York, and
earlier touched $22.16 for the biggest intraday gain since
trading began on May 18. The stock has slumped 48 percent since
the company’s May 17 inital public offering.  “Revenue acceleration is almost certainly in the cards for
Facebook,” Wieser said in a research report. Facebook’s plan to
introduce real-time bidding for advertising on its site, a
technology used by  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and other Web companies to more
effectively target consumers, would add $400 million to
advertising revenue in 2012 if it was used for the entire year,
Wieser said. Mobile advertising will also contribute to sales
growth, he said.  Before today, Facebook shares had slumped for five straight
trading sessions after the company reported earnings that showed
slowing growth.  Facebook, which hasn’t closed above the $38 IPO price since
its first trading day, on July 26 reported second-quarter sales
growth of 32 percent, down from 45 percent in the previous three
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
