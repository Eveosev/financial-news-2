Total Global Steel Ltd.  is no longer
a Category 5 member of the London Metal Exchange, the bourse
said in a notice e-mailed today.  The London-based company specializes in “physical metal
trading, futures and hedging, online trading and LME
brokerage,” according to its website. Category 5 members have
no trading rights except as customers, according to the website
of the exchange, which said Total Global Steel doesn’t satisfy
its rules.  The steel trader was expelled from the Balancing and
Settlement Code, the legal mechanism governing settling of
electricity trading in the U.K., according to a circular dated
July 14 from Elexon, the London-based company that administers
the code. Total Global Steel was in default after failing to pay
charges, it said.  Total Global Steel did not immediately respond to requests
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
