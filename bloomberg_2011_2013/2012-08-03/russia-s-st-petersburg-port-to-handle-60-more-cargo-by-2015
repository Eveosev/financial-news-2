St. Petersburg port will handle 93
million tons of cargo by 2015, 60 percent more than the 60
million tons that went through the port last year, said Georgy Poltavchenko, the governor of  Russia ’s second-largest city.  Cargo handling will rise to 140 million tons in 2025,
Poltavchenko said today at a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation transportation ministers.  Stevedore companies are developing capacity especially in
Bronka and Lomonosov, new port regions around St. Petersburg,
which itself handles 55 percent of the country’s container
cargo, said Poltavchenko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
