UniCredit (UCG)  Bank Austria AG, which
manages most of the Italian lender’s business in the developing
economies of  Europe , said there are signs that credit growth in
central Europe is slowing down again.  “There are some signs of a slowdown in demand for credit
in central Europe in particular,” Bank Austria’s Chief
Financial Officer Francesco Giordano told journalists in Vienna,
referring to the region including  Hungary  and the Czech and
Slovak republics. “However, we are maintaining or increasing
market share.”  In  Turkey , where Bank Austria part-owns  Yapi ve Kredi
Bankasi AS , a slowdown in the economy is likely to result in
more bad debt, forcing banks to set aside more reserves,
Giordano said.  “It is likely that we and the rest of the banking system
will see some moderate deterioration in credit charges,” he
said. “But you have to keep in mind this starts from an
exceptionally low level, so this is more a normalization than a
sign of increased tension.”  Bank Austria said second-quarter net income declined 17
percent 247 million euros, from 298 million euros a year
earlier, as revenue fell slightly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
