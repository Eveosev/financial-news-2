Bolivia’s Movement Toward Socialism
party, or MAS, wants Evo Morales to run for a third term as
president in elections in 2014, La Razon reported.  MAS announced the decision this week at a meeting in the
central city of Sucre, the La Paz-based daily said. Morales
later asked the assembly to postpone discussion of the issue and
focus on his current mandate, according to La Razon.  Morales came to power in 2006 before winning a second
election in 2009 after changing the county’s constitution. He
won both elections with more than 50 percent of the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
