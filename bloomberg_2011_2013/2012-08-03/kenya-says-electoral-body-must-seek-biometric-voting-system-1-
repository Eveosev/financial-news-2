Kenya’s Cabinet said the country’s
electoral authority should use a biometric voter-registration
system to build confidence in the electoral process, two days
after the body canceled a tender for the equipment.  “The Cabinet advised the Independent Electoral and
Boundaries Commission to pursue the matter of the biometric
system,” according to a statement e-mailed from the presidency
today in Nairobi, the capital.  Kenya is due in March to hold its first general elections
since a disputed presidential vote in December 2007 triggered
ethnic clashes, leaving 1,133 people dead in  East Africa ’s
largest economy. The IEBC had pledged to use biometric
technology in the next election to make the voting process more
secure and boost confidence in the accuracy of the results.  On Aug. 1, the commission said it terminated the process of
acquiring the biometric system and will use an optical mark
reader to register voters. Biometric technology can be used to
store unique physical characteristics including fingerprints and
facial scans of voters in a database for identification.  Registration of Kenyan voters is expected to begin on Sept.
17, according to the IEBC.  The Cabinet at its meeting today also approved construction
of a “high-speed, high-capacity” rail line running on standard
gauge from the port city of  Mombasa  through the western town of
Kisumu to Kampala, the capital of  Uganda , according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
