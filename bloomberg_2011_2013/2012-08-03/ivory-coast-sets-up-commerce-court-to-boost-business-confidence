Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa producer, will open a special court to hear legal
complaints from the country’s business community in a bid to
improve investor confidence in the West African nation.  “Our role will be to give hope so investors feel more
comfortable putting their money in Ivory Coast,” Francois
Komoin, president of the court, said in Abidjan, the commercial
capital where the body will be based, today. Improving the
business climate in the West African nation is “something
crucial for the recovery” of the country, he said.  Ivory Coast, the biggest economy in West Africa’s monetary
union, has forecast growth of 8.2 percent this year after a 4.7
percent contraction in 2011. The country is recovering from
post-election violence last year that left at least 3,000 people
dead after ex-president Laurent Gbagbo’s refusal to cede power
to  Alassane Ouattara .  “It is important that investments be secured by the law
and by judges charged with implementing it,” Komoin said.  The court will start operating on Oct. 1 and comprise about
75 judges. About 15 of them will be professional judges while
about 60 will come from the business community, Komoin said.
Judges haven’t been named yet, he said.  The court of commerce in Abidjan is a pilot project, Komoin
said. The country should open more courts in the future, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
