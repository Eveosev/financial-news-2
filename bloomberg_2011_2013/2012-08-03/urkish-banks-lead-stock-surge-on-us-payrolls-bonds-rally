Turkey ’s  banks  including  Turkiye Halk
Bankasi AS (HALKB)  and  Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK)  led the country’s
benchmark gauge to the highest in more than a year after U.S.
payrolls rose more than forecast. Bond yields plunged.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  climbed 2.4 percent to
65,303.64, the highest since May 2011, at the close in Istanbul
as the banking  measure  surged 3.4 percent. Yields on benchmark
two-year  government bonds  dropped 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 7.49 percent, the lowest in more than 1 1/2
years. The lira appreciated 1.3 percent to 1.7793 against the
dollar, the biggest gain this year.  Gains were led by state-run lender Halkbank, which surged
5.9 percent, the most in almost a year, to a record high 16.25
liras. Payrolls in the U.S. climbed a more-than-forecast 163,000
in July, according to data released today, sending stocks in the
U.S. and across  Europe  higher. Turkey led gains in eastern
Europe, where 13 of 17  stock exchanges  tracked by Bloomberg
gained.  “Turkish banking sector fundamentals have been improving
and it looks like the third quarter will not be as bad as we had
forecast, necessitating an upward revision to full-year earnings
forecasts,” Funda Afacan, a banking analyst at brokerage BGC
Partners in Istanbul, said by e-mail. A drop in the central
bank’s effective funding rate will boost the banks’ earnings,
she said.  The average cost of central bank funding fell to 7.52
percent today from an average of 9.02 percent in June as central
bank Governor Erdem Basci has provided more financing from the
lower end of his so-called interest rates corridor, which allows
him to vary rates on a daily basis between 5.75 percent and 11.5
percent.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkey’s largest lender by
market value, rose 3.1 percent, and  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS, the
largest bank by assets, increased 3.9 percent. Yapi Kredi, part-
owned by  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , added 4.6 percent, the most in more than
a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
