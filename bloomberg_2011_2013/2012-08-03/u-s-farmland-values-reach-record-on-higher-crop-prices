U.S.  farmland values  rose 11 percent
to a record this year as crop and livestock prices surged and
export demand remained high, the Department of Agriculture said.  The average value of all land and buildings on farms and
ranches in the 48 continental states was $2,650 an acre,
according to a June survey of farmers, the USDA said today in an 
annual report , up from a revised $2,390 a year earlier. The
sample was taken before the worst drought since the 1950s spread
through the Corn Belt and Great Plains, which may make investors
shy away in the short term, said Brent Gloy, an agricultural
economist at  Purdue University  in  Indiana .  From an economic viewpoint, “one year shouldn’t have a big
impact,” Gloy said in a telephone interview before the report.
“From a psychological impact, people won’t be as aggressive
buying land in places that didn’t have a crop.”  Farm income  may reach $91.7 billion this year, second only
to 2011, according to a USDA forecast made before the drought.
Corn traded in Chicago has soared 60 percent since June 15,
while soybeans climbed 24 percent and cattle gained 6.6 percent.
The USDA’s next profit forecast will be at the end of this
month.  The most expensive farmland in the U.S. was in New Jersey
at $12,200 an acre, followed by  Rhode Island  at $12,000,
according to the USDA. The cheapest land was in  New Mexico  and
 Wyoming , each at $560 an acre. The Corn Belt was the most
expensive of the 10 regions tracked by the USDA, averaging
$5,560 an acre after gaining 18 percent from the previous year,
surpassing the Northeast, the most expensive area in 2011. The
Mountain region was cheapest at $974 per acre.  Prices rose across the Corn Belt, the heart of this year’s
drought, with values in  Iowa , the largest corn, soybean and
ethanol producer, rising 23 percent to $7,000 an acre. The
biggest jump among regions -- 27 percent -- was in the Northern
Plains, where  Nebraska  had a 34 percent jump, tops in the
nation.  The Southeast was the only region where prices fell, 4.1
percent to $3,310 an acre.  South Carolina  had the biggest drop,
at 7.9 percent to $3,500 an acre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
