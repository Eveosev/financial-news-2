Sharp Corp. (6753)  plunged the most in more
than three decades and  Sony Corp. (6758)  declined in Tokyo trading
after the Japanese consumer-electronics makers cut full-year
forecasts amid slumping demand for TVs and a strengthening yen.  Sony,  Japan ’s biggest consumer-electronics exporter,
dropped 7 percent, the most in almost nine months, and Osaka-
based Sharp plunged 28 percent, its most since at least
September 1974.  American Depositary Receipts  of Sony tumbled in
 New York  trading yesterday.  Sharp, the maker of Aquos TV models, forecast an annual
 loss  of 250 billion yen ($3.2 billion) yesterday while Sony
reduced its full-year net income forecast by a third to 20
billion yen. Sharp also announced its  first layoffs  since 1950s
as Japan’s electronics makers shed staff to return to profit
amid competition with Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.  “I can’t be bullish on the Japanese consumer electronics
makers,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, a  fund manager  at Tokyo-based
Bayview Asset Management Co., which manages $2 billion. “I want
to know whether this is the beginning of the end. It will take
time and I don’t see any promising products enough to spur their
sales.”  Sony closed at 897 yen, valuing the company at 901 billion
yen. Sharp closed at 192 yen, with a market value of 213 billion
yen. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei Index was down 1.1 percent.  Sharp had a  net loss  of 138.4 billion yen in the three
months ended June 30,  widening  from 49.3 billion yen a year
earlier, the company said. The average of four analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was a loss of 76 billion yen.  Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded
their ratings on Sharp, and Barclays Plc analyst Yuji Fujimori
cut his target price for Sony 8 percent to 1,100 yen.  Net income at Sony, the maker of Walkman music players,
will probably be 20 billion yen in the year ending March 31, the
Tokyo-based company said yesterday, lowering its May projection
of 30 billion yen. Sony cut its sales projections for TVs,
handheld game players, compact cameras and personal computers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
