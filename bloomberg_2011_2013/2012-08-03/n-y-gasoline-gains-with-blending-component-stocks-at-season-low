New York  gasoline strengthened for a
third consecutive day as blending components used to make the
fuel were at the lowest seasonal level in at least eight years.  Inventories of gasoline blending components other than
reformulated and conventional blendstock, or RBOB and CBOB, fell
to the lowest level for this time of year since at least 2008,
Energy Department data showed Aug. 1.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor increased 0.75 cent to 1.25 cents a gallon versus
futures trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:44
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the
strongest level in seven weeks. Prompt delivery rose 8.27 cents
to $2.9573 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  weakened 0.75 cent to a
discount of 4.25 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
