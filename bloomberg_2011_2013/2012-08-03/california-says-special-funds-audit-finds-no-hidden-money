California Governor  Jerry Brown ’s
budget office said an audit of more than 500 special funds used
by state agencies found no hidden money, though it uncovered
accounting discrepancies of $415 million.  Brown ordered the audit after the Sacramento Bee reported
last month that the state parks department had squirreled away
$54 million in special funds, even as lawmakers and the governor
were seeking to close 70 parks to balance the budget.  “Parks was an anomaly,” Finance Director Ana Matosantos
told reporters at a briefing. “There are no other hidden pots
of money.”  The parks department revelations threatened to derail a
campaign by Brown, a 74-year-old Democrat, to temporarily raise
income taxes and sales levies through a ballot initiative in
November.  The total amount in special funds reported by the state
controller’s office as of June 30, 2011, after adjustments, was
$8.4 billion, while the budget office reported $8.8 billion, a
difference of 4.7 percent, according to a Finance Department
 statement .  “Differences are primarily due to methodology and
timing,” the budget office said. “Human error also contributed
to the differences.”  Under Brown’s plan, the statewide sales levy, already the
highest in the U.S., would go to 7.5 percent from 7.25 percent.
Income-tax rates would rise on earnings of more than $250,000 a
year. Those making $1 million or more, now paying 10.3 percent,
would be assessed at 13.3 percent.  If the higher taxes are rejected by voters, $6.1 billion
will be automatically cut from state spending -- $5.5 billion
coming from schools, enough to pay for 15 days of classes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
