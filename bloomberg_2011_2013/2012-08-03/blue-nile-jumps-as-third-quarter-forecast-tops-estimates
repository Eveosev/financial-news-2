Blue Nile Inc. (NILE) , an online retailer
for diamonds and fine jewelry, rose the most since its initial
public offering after forecasting sales for the third-quarter
that topped analysts’ estimates.  The shares  jumped  35 percent to $32 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since its IPO in May 2004. The stock has
fallen 22 percent this year.  Net sales for the quarter ending Sept. 30 will be $87
million to $91 million, the Seattle-based company said in a
statement yesterday. Analysts had projected $84.7 million, the
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “We see significant and improving growth in the number of
new customers to Blue Nile, building our user base and gaining
greater scale for future growth,” Chief Financial Officer David Binder said on a conference call yesterday.  Sales in the second quarter rose 13 percent to $91 million,
helped by an increase in demand for engagement rings in the
U.S., according to the statement.  Net income fell 44 percent to $1.58 million, or 11 cents a
share, from $2.84 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier,  Blue
Nile  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
