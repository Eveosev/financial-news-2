United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
reached a tentative contract agreement with union pilots, moving
the world’s largest airline closer to integrating its workforce
after the 2010 merger that formed the company, two people
familiar with the matter said.  Pilot negotiators are briefing union leaders on the accord
tonight, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. They said they couldn’t elaborate on the
terms.  Approval by rank-and-file members of the Air Line Pilots
Association would bring together work groups from the former
 United Airlines  and Continental Airlines Inc., which closed
their merger in October 2010. The combined company flies as
United Airlines and kept that carrier’s Chicago headquarters.  The tentative agreement removes the threat of a potential
strike, a step approved by pilots on July 17 to protest the lack
of progress toward a single contract after more than two years
of bargaining. United had to negotiate a unified accord because
pilots’ previous contracts differed over matters such as pay,
benefits and scheduling.  Rahsaan Johnson, a spokesman for United, and Lisa Cohen, a
spokeswoman for the pilots, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
