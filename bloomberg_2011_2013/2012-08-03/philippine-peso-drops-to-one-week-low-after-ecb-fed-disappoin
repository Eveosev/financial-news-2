Philippine bonds gained this week on
speculation the central bank will reduce  interest rates  further,
and after the government said it is considering swapping debt
for shorter-dated securities. The peso rose.  Governor Amando Tetangco said Aug. 1 the nation’s inflation
outlook allows more room for policy action, if needed. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas cut the benchmark rate last week to a
record low of 3.75 percent from 4 percent. The government plans
to swap debt this year and is considering offering seven-, 10-,
15-, 20- and 25-year securities in exchange, Deputy Treasurer
Eduardo Mendiola said this week.  “The anticipation of another cut at the next policy
meeting and the bond exchange should put more pressure on bond
yields to go down, especially the shorter-dated ones,” said
Jonathan Ravelas, Manila-based chief market strategist at  BDO
Unibank Inc. (BDO)   The yield on the Philippine government’s 4.75 percent bonds
due July 2019 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 4.7 percent today, matching the decline for the week,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  The peso gained 0.1 percent this week to 41.855 per dollar
as of the close in Manila, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show.
The currency was unchanged today. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 6 percent today. The gauge dropped 25 basis points
this week.  The  Philippines  will probably sell 60 billion pesos ($1.4
billion) to 70 billion pesos of 25-year debt to individuals in
October, Mendiola said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
