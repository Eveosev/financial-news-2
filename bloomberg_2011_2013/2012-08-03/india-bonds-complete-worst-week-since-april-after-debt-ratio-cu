India ’s bonds completed the worst
week in four months on concern demand from banks will slow after
the central bank cut their debt-investment requirements.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered the  proportion  of
deposits lenders must hold in fixed-income securities this week
to 23 percent from 24 percent with effect Aug. 11, the first
reduction since 2010. The monetary authority also left the
repurchase  rate  unchanged at 8 percent, while increasing its
inflation forecast for the year through March 2013 to 7 percent
from 6.5 percent.  “The bond-reserve ratio reduction has hurt demand,” said
R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of currencies and fixed-
income at  State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur. (SBBJ)  “The revision of
inflationary expectations has also reduced the scope for any
immediate monetary-policy easing.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent securities due June 2022 rose
14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, this week to 8.26
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate was rose four basis points today.  Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last cut the repo
rate by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, after raising it
by a record 375 basis points through 2010 and 2011.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose 12 basis
points this week to 7.76 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
