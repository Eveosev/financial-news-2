Wheat and corn gained for the first
time in four days as the lightest Indian monsoon in three years
may curb global production already hurt by dry weather in the
U.S.,  Russia  and  Australia . Soybeans also rose.  Monsoon rains may be 85 percent of a 50-year average, the
 India Meteorological Department  said today. Rainfall in the
country, the world’s second-biggest wheat producer, is 20
percent below normal this season, the department said. U.S. corn
yields may fall as low as 118 bushels an acre, Deutsche Bank
said today. That’s below a government forecast of 146 bushels an
acre.  “That Indian monsoon is going to be disappointing,” Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting
in Lafayette,  Indiana , said by telephone. “Some of the
northwestern provinces are having a drought, and that’s bringing
a lift to the market.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 3 percent to
settle at $8.9125 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price fell 0.8 percent this week.  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 1.5 percent to
$8.075 a bushel in  Chicago , capping a 1.8 percent weekly
increase.  Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 0.8 percent
to $16.2875 a bushel on the CBOT, leaving the oilseed up 1.7
percent this week.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
