Colombia ’s peso bonds declined,
cutting into a fifth consecutive weekly gain, on speculation
that policy makers will continue to reduce benchmark borrowing
costs to boost flagging economic growth.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 6.62 percent at 10:52 a.m. in Bogota, according to the
central bank. The yield is down 15 basis points in the past five
days, the biggest rally since the week ended April 13. The price
rose 1.372 centavos to 127.319 centavos per peso this week.  “Investors are taking some profits after the strong
rally,” William Florez, an analyst at Helm Bank SA’s brokerage
unit in Bogota, said by phone. “This week’s central bank report
lowered growth expectations and that benefits the TES ’24s,” as
the bonds are known, he said.  Florez expects the yield on the notes to fall to 6.5
percent by the end of this quarter, if not sooner.  Bonds extended their rally after the central bank
unexpectedly cut  interest rates  a quarter percentage point to 5
percent on July 27.  Annual inflation  slowed to 3.11 percent in
July from 3.2 percent the previous month, according to the
median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
national statistics agency is slated to release figures
tomorrow.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent today to 1,785.56 per  U.S.
dollar , rising 0.3 percent on the week as well. The peso has
appreciated 8.5 percent this year, the second-best performance
among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg behind the Hungarian
forint.  Colombia’s currency will probably end the year at 1,750 per
dollar, Morgan Stanley analyst  Daniel Volberg  wrote in a report
released from  New York  today. Previously, he had expected it to
end the year at 1,800.  Volberg expects the central bank to cut its key lending
rate to 4.75 percent by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
