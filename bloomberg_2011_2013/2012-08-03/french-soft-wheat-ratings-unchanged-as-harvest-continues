French soft wheat rated “good” or
“excellent” was unchanged in the week ended July 30 while the
harvest accelerated, crop office FranceAgriMer said.  Seventy-one percent of the soft  wheat  crop received the top
ratings, the same as a week earlier, the Montreuil-sous-Bois,
France-based office wrote on its website today. About 81 percent
of the  harvest  was complete, up from 25 percent in the week
ended July 23, according to the report.  The  corn  crop was 76 percent good or excellent, dropping
from 77 percent a week earlier. Ninety-eight percent of the crop
was  flowering , compared with 61 percent the previous week,
FranceAgriMer said.  Durum  wheat harvesting was 99 percent complete as of July
30, compared with 72 percent a week earlier. Seventy-one percent
of the  spring barley  crop had been collected, up from 12 percent
a week earlier, while  conditions  of the crop were stable at 80
percent, FranceAgriMer said. Farmers have finished  harvesting 
winter barley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
