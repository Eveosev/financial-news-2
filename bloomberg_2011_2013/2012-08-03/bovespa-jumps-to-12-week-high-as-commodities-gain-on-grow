The  Bovespa (IBOV)   index  rose to the highest
since May as a gain in commodities prices lifted Brazilian
producers after a report showed U.S. payrolls increased more
than forecast in July.  Oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA and steelmaker  Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  followed crude and metals
higher. Usiminas’s competitor Gerdau SA, which generated 38
percent of its 2011 revenue in  North America , rose to the
highest since March. Gafisa SA led homebuilders higher as
concern eased that the global slowdown will curb the recovery in
Latin America’s biggest economy.  Brazil’s benchmark equity measure added 3.1 percent to
57,255.22 at the close in Sao Paulo, the highest since May 14.
The gauge is up 1.2 percent this week. Sixty-one stocks gained
on the index today while five dropped. The real rose 1 percent
to 2.0284 per  U.S. dollar . The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of
24 raw materials advanced 2.8 percent. Commodities producers
account for about 42 percent of the Bovespa index’s weighting.  “The payroll figures in the U.S. were positive and pushed
stocks higher,” Hamilton Moreira, an equity strategist at  Banco
do Brasil SA (BBAS3) , said by phone from Sao Paulo. “In Brazil,
economic growth should pick up soon,  interest rates  are falling
and inflation seems to be under control. If there’s a more
favorable external outlook, the equity market should post a full
recovery.”  Payrolls in the U.S. increased 163,000 following a revised
64,000 rise in June that was less than initially reported, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
estimate of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a gain
of 100,000.  Petrobras Discovery  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, added 1.7
percent to 19.94 reais. The producer said in a regulatory filing
that it found “good quality” oil at the third well it drilled
in a field in deep waters of the  Santos Basin  where the company
found a layer of oil 93 meters (305 feet) thick.  Usiminas jumped 9.1 percent to 7.90 reais. Gerdau gained
3.1 percent to 18.90 reais.  The Bovespa has dropped 16 percent from this year’s high on
March 13 as the debt crisis in  Europe  worsened and growth in
Brazil faltered. The index trades at 10.9 times analysts’
earnings estimates for the next four quarters, which compares
with the 13.4 ratio for India’s Sensex Index, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Mexico’s IPC Index trades at a 16.1 ratio after
rising 11 percent this year.  “The Bovespa looks cheap,” Otavio Vieira, a partner at
hedge fund Fides Asset Management, said by phone from  Rio de
Janeiro . “It’s not an absolute bargain, but it’s cheaper than
most of the biggest  emerging markets . There’s room for a
rebound.”  Homebuilders Rally  Gafisa, Brazil’s sixth-biggest homebuilder by sales, surged
14 percent to 2.88 reais. Larger competitor Brookfield
Incorporacoes SA jumped 8.7 percent to 3.39 reais. Real estate
companies benefit from lower borrowing costs in Brazil and could
outperform once the equity market in general rebounds, Vieira
said.  Apparel retailer Marisa Lojas SA declined 0.4 percent to
22.36 reais after reporting adjusted net income of 47.6 million
reais ($23.5 million) in the second quarter, trailing analysts’
estimates.  Trading volume was 6.53 billion reais in stocks in  Sao
Paulo  today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with
a daily average of 7.2 billion reais this year through Aug. 2,
according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
