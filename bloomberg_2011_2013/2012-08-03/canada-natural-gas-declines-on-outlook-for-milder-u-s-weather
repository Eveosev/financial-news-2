Canadian natural gas dropped on
forecasts of cooler weather in the U.S. that may reduce demand
for imports of the fuel for electricity generation.  September gas in Alberta  slid 3.4 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted normal temperatures
on the East Coast and in the northern Midwest from Aug. 8
through Aug. 17. A 72 percent rally to a seven-month intraday
high of $3.277 per million British thermal units on July 31 from
$1.902 on April 19 was overdone, said  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor
of the Energy OverView newsletter in  New York .  “With cooler temperatures right around the corner, and
economics favoring coal again, gas had extended far into
overvalued territory,” Fitzpatrick said in a note to clients
today. The increase in gas prices may prompt  power plants  to
switch to less-costly coal, he said.  Alberta gas for September delivery fell 7.5 cents to
C$2.1575 per gigajoule ($2.05 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:15 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for September delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  dropped 4.3 cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle
at $2.877 per million Btu. The futures have declined 3.7 percent
this year.  Weather Outlook  The high in New York on Aug. 14 may be 76 degrees
Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 7 below the usual reading, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high in
Chicago may be 82 degrees, the norm for the day.  Electricity producers account for about 36 percent of U.S.
gas consumption, Energy Department data show.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.2 billion cubic
feet at 2 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.02 billion cubic feet
at Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.05 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 107 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.91 billion cubic feet today, compared with the
estimated capacity of 2.018 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
