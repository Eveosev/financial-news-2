ElringKlinger AG (ZIL2) , a German car-parts
maker, reiterated targets for the year after second-quarter
sales beat analyst estimates on demand from  emerging markets  and
 North America .  Sales rose 12 percent to 286 million euros ($349 million),
the company said in a statement today. That beat the 279.3
million-euro average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Earnings before interest and taxes climbed 29 percent to 38.3
million euros, while incoming orders advanced 13 percent to
337.1 million euros.  “Solid demand for new vehicles in emerging markets and
North America, together with product ramp-ups” and the
contribution of acquisitions helped the results, the Dettingen-
based company said. ElringKlinger, whose clients include
Volkswagen AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, reiterated full-
year forecasts for organic sales growth of 5 percent to 7
percent and Ebit of 145 million euros to 150 million euros.  ElringKlinger shares climbed 4 percent to 22.80 euros at
10:25 a.m. in Frankfurt trading.  ElringKlinger’s  acquisitions  last year included the
majority of mold and tool manufacturer Hummel Group, the
cylinder-head and exhaust system gasket business of Freudenberg
Group, and 66.7 percent of Switzerland-based Hug Group, a maker
of diesel particle filters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
