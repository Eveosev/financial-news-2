Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food
company, named U.K. head Paul Grimwood as chairman and chief
executive officer of its U.S. operations, replacing Brad Alford,
who is to retire in October after 32 years.  Grimwood has led Nestle’s U.K. and Ireland business since
2009 and prior to that ran the company’s U.K. confectionery
business for three years, the Vevey, Switzerland-based maker of
KitKat bars said today in a statement.  Nestle generated 26.8 billion Swiss francs ($27.5 billion)
in revenue in the Americas region last year. Growth in  North
America  was helped by sales of DiGiorno pizza and Haagen-Dazs
ice cream. New products such as Maggi Juicy Roasting cooking
aids also helped the Swiss company counter weakening consumer
sentiment in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
