OpenTable Inc. (OPEN) , the largest U.S.
online restaurant-reservation service, gained the most in more
than two years after forecasting full-year profit that topped
analysts’ estimates amid an increase in seated diners.  The shares  advanced  16 percent to $39.55 at the close in
 New York , for the biggest gain since February 2010. The stock
had declined 13 percent this year through yesterday.  OpenTable, which reported a 27 percent increase in seated
diners using its service in the second quarter, said the number
of restaurant patrons accessing the San Francisco-based company
through mobile devices rose 3 percentage points during the
period.  “The shift to mobile is a long-term positive for us,”
Chief Executive Officer Matthew Roberts said on a conference
call with analysts yesterday. “Our primary and fastest growing
source of revenue is reservation transactions, which monetize
well on mobile devices.”  Full-year earnings excluding certain items will be $1.54 to
$1.66 a share, according to a statement yesterday. That’s up
from a prior forecast of $1.49 to $1.64. Analysts had predicted
an average of $1.57, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Seated diners rose to 30.3 million in the quarter ended
June 30, including 28 million in  North America .  “If you look at our total seats filled in North America,
28 percent last quarter started where people were on using a
smartphone or a tablet,” Roberts said.  That’s up 3 percentage points from the prior quarter, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
