After scoring an Olympic-record 156
points in beating Nigeria, the competition is about to get
tougher for the U.S. men’s basketball team.  Next up for the defending champion is Lithuania and then
the Americans will finish group play against  Manu Ginobili  and
Argentina, which placed third in Beijing and won the gold medal
at the 2004 Athens Games.  The Americans have won all three group games they’ve played
so far at the London Games, by an average of 52 points a game.  Carmelo Anthony  of the National Basketball Association’s
 New York  Knicks had 37 points and shot 10-for-12 on 3-pointers
to lead the U.S. yesterday against Nigeria, which scored 73
points.  U.S. coach  Mike Krzyzewski  said the Americans will have to
pick up their defense tomorrow against a Lithuanian team that
includes Toronto Raptors players Linas Kleiza and Jonas
Valanciunas.  “Our guys just couldn’t miss,” Krzyzewski told reporters.
“Just an incredible shooting performance that’s not going to
happen very often.”  Lithuania lost to Argentina and France this week before
beating Nigeria 72-53. Argentina got its second win of the
London Games yesterday, beating Tunisia by 23 points. The
Argentineans lost their July 31 game against France.  NBA Players  There are four NBA players on the Argentina team, including
the 35-year-old Ginobili, who has won three NBA titles with the
 San Antonio Spurs .  The U.S. scored 49 points in the opening quarter last night
and led 78-45 at halftime. The Americans hit 71 percent of their
shots overall, and 63 percent of their 3-pointers (29-for-46).
The Americans have won 13 gold medals in the 16 Olympic
tournaments they have entered.  “When they shoot like this, I don’t know if there is any
team that can beat them,”  Nigeria ’s Ike Diogu, who has played
for six NBA teams, said in a news conference.  Also yesterday, 2008 silver medalist Spain held on to
defeat Great Britain 79-78.
