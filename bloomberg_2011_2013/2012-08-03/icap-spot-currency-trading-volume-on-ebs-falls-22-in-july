ICAP Plc, the London-based
independent broking service, said currency trading volume on its
electronic trading platform EBS was down 22 percent in July from
a month earlier.  Foreign-exchange volumes in June were $106.7 billion, ICAP
said in an e-mailed statement today. Volumes were down 41
percent from a year earlier, on exceptionally high volume after
multiple sovereign credit rating downgrades in 2011, ICAP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
