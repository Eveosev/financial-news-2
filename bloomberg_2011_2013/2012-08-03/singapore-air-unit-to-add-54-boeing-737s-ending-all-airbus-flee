Boeing Co. (BA)  reached agreements to sell
94 of its single-aisle 737 planes to Asian carriers, including
an accord with a  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  unit that has an all-
Airbus SAS fleet.  SilkAir, Singapore Air’s regional arm, said today it
committed to buy 54 737s, including 31 of the new Max 8, while a
 China Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  unit ordered 40 737-800s. The deals’
list value is $8.3 billion, from which the carriers typically
would get discounts.  “It is a big positive for Boeing that they have managed to
get the confidence of Singapore Airlines,” said Ahmad Maghfur Usman, an analyst at OSK (Asia) Securities in  Kuala Lumpur .
“Going forward, Singapore Air will continue to order Boeing.”  The deal is a boost for Boeing as the Chicago-based  company 
and Airbus revamp their narrow-body models to compete in the
biggest segment of the global aircraft market. Boeing has
amassed more than 1,200 orders and commitments for the Max since
the jet’s 2012 unveiling, of which 649 were firm as of July 31.  SilkAir’s purchase will be tallied on Boeing’s orders and
deliveries  website  once the transaction is confirmed, according
to a statement from the planemaker.  Boeing rose 1.1 percent to $72.81 at the close in  New York ,
joining a rally in broader U.S. indexes. The shares had fallen
1.9 percent this year through yesterday.  SilkAir Expansion  The 737 accord, which also includes purchase rights for
another 14 aircraft, will more than double SilkAir’s fleet by
the end of 2021 as rising wealth spurs travel in  Asia . The
carrier now has 21 planes from Airbus’s A320 family, with three
more due to be delivered by the end of next year.  “It’s quite an aggressive order,” said Ahmad. It also
suggests that  SilkAir  may take over most of Singapore Air’s
operations within Asia, he said. The main Singapore Air unit may
then fly only a few of the most-important regional routes
besides its long-haul service, he said. The main  unit  has both
Airbus and Boeing planes.  The new Boeing planes, which will begin arriving in 2014,
will be used to expand capacity and replace older aircraft,
SilkAir said.  “We continue to see very strong growth within the region
and these new aircraft will position SilkAir well,” the unit’s
Chief Executive Officer Marvin Tan said in a statement. The
carrier undertook “detailed evaluations and extensive
negotiations with both Airbus and Boeing” before placing the
order, he said.  Xiamen Airlines  Xiamen Airlines, which is 51 percent-owned by  China 
Southern, will receive its 40 Boeing planes from 2016 to 2019,
according to a statement. The carrier is China’s only all-Boeing
operator, with 81 planes, according to its  website .  The  737 Max , which is due to enter service in 2017, will be
more fuel efficient than the current model after upgrades that
will include new engines. Airbus is making similar alterations
for its A320neo, which is due to begin commercial flights in
2015.  Airbus has previously sold the A320neo to all-Boeing
operators. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA ordered 100 neo planes in
January, ending its reliance on Boeing. The carrier ordered 122
737s at the same time. PT Garuda  Indonesia ’s Citilink unit also
last year placed an order for 25 A320s, including 10 neo planes,
to replace its fleet of 737s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
