Argentine vehicle  production  fell 6.7
percent to 65,900 units in July from a year earlier, the
Argentine Automakers Association said.  Exports tumbled 38.4 percent to 28,483 vehicles, while
 sales  declined 8.1 percent to 66,614 units, according to the
report.  The 10 automakers based in Argentine, which have driven the
country’s industrial growth since 2003, began cutting exports in
March as demand for vehicles in  Brazil ,  Argentina ’s biggest
automobile buyer, fell. Auto production dropped 36 percent in
June.  Auto dealers’ sales last month fell 0.1 percent from a year
earlier and rose 4.7 percent from June, the association said in
an e-mailed report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
