Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  turned to
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  on Aug. 1 to buy the firm out of
trading positions acquired by mistake when a computer program
malfunctioned, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Knight has until the close of business on Aug. 6 to
complete the transaction with Goldman Sachs, said the person,
who asked for anonymity because the deal hasn’t been made
public.  David Wells , a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said he couldn’t comment. Kara Fitzsimmons, a spokeswoman
for Knight, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  Knight said yesterday it had “traded out of its entire
erroneous trade position, which has resulted in a realized pre-
tax loss of approximately $440 million” and severely hurt its
capital. The Jersey City, New Jersey-based firm has opened its
books to potential investors or buyers, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, made the most
revenue from equities trading of any Wall Street bank in the
first half of 2012, according to company reports. Goldman Sachs
is also the biggest owner of Knight’s $375 million of 3.5
percent convertible bonds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Those notes are trading about 80 percent of face
value, according to prices reported by Trace.  To contact the reporter on this story:
