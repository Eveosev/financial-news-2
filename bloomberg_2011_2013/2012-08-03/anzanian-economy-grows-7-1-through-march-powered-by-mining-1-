Tanzania’s economy expanded 7.1
percent in the first quarter, powered by mining and electricity
production, the National Bureau of Statistics said.  Growth in  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy accelerated
from 6.1 percent last year as mining and quarrying output
increased by 14.3 percent from 0.8 percent, the Dar es Salaam-
based agency said in a  statement  published on its website today.
Power generation rose by 9 percent from 6.6 percent, it said.  Growth quickened from 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter of
last year, the agency said May 7.  “This is a good indicator that the economy has started to
pick up,” said Yonoh Mtengule, chief economist at National Bank
of Commerce Ltd., the Tanzanian unit unit of  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)   Sustained growth will depend on electricity supply and the
coming dry season could hamper hydropower generation, he said in
a phone interview from  Dar es Salaam  today. “The economy may
expand in the second quarter, but the trend may not continue in
the third and fourth quarters depending on power supplies,” he
said.  Gold output more than doubled to 16,736 kilograms in the
three months through March, while diamond production rose more
than fivefold to 57,330 carats, the statistics agency said.  Growth in transport and communications increased to 16.4
percent in the first quarter from 15.1 percent, while the
financial industry grew 15 versus 10 percent, it said.
Construction accelerated to 3.7 percent from 0.4 percent, and
manufacturing was little changed at 4.8 percent compared with
4.6 percent previously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
