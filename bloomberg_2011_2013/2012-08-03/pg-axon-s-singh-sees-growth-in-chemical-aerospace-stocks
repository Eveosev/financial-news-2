Dinakar Singh , founder of $4 billion
hedge fund TPG-Axon Capital Management LP, said the commodities
“super-cycle” is over because of falling Chinese productivity
and profits.  “It’s not where it was 10 years ago,” Singh said today in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers” program
with  Erik Schatzker  and Stephanie Ruhle. “They are slowing down
in their growth.”  Price multiples of Chinese companies have collapsed and
investors don’t trust the private firms based there, he said.  Singh, a former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  partner who co-
founded New York-based TPG Axon in 2004, said profits are
improving the most in Japan, where companies with cheap stock
valuations are paying out cash and growing. He said he also sees
growth in the chemical, health-care and aerospace industries and
likes cash-rich companies such as  Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI)  and  WR
Grace & Co. (GRA)   Singh said he is bearish on regional banks and is betting
against telecommunications stocks.  TPG-Axon returned about 13 percent this year through
yesterday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the fund is private.
Hedge funds rose 1.1 percent in the first half, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  TPG-Axon Capital told clients in February it was
liquidating a London-based fund, Montrica Global Opportunities,
it merged with less than two years ago after facing client
redemption requests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
