Periods of dry weather during
plantation and rain at harvest has compromised as much as 40
percent of the quality coffee in  Brazil , said the largest
producer of the bean, the National Coffee Council.  Brazil’s government told producers that they will have an
additional 600 million reais ($296 million) for storage, the
council, known as CNC, said in an e-mailed statement. The state
of  Minas Gerais , one of the biggest producers in Brazil,
announced the creation of a fund to help producers, CNC said.  Brazilian producers are “cautious” about selling their
beans at the moment to wait for better prices, CNC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
