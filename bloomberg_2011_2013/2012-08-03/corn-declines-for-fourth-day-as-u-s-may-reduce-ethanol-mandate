Corn fell for a fourth day in  Chicago 
on speculation demand will slow after a drought-fueled surge in
prices spurred U.S. lawmakers to propose reducing requirements
for use of ethanol made from the grain.  More than 150 U.S. legislators asked President  Barack
Obama ’s administration to cut a requirement that refiners use
ethanol, added to gasoline. Ethanol producers used more than 40
percent of last year’s U.S. corn crop. Corn has surged 56
percent since mid-June as the U.S. suffered its worst drought
since 1956, increasing costs for users including livestock
producers and food processors.  “The market certainly did take some direction from that
announcement” from legislators, said  Michael Creed , an
agribusiness economist at  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
Predicting whether the government will give in to the calls is
difficult, he said.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to $7.9125 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:03 p.m. London time.
Futures reached a record $8.205 on July 31 and are down 0.3
percent this week.  Fuel refiners are required to use 13.2 billion gallons of
ethanol this year and 13.8 billion in 2013, according to
standards from the Environmental Protection Agency, which
regulates the renewable-fuels market. The EPA can adjust or
waive the ethanol  requirement  if it would cause “severe harm to
the economy or environment,” according to lawmakers led by
Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte of  Virginia .  Drought Spreads  Drought may persist in the Midwest and spread into areas of
 North Dakota  and central  Texas  through October, the U.S. Climate
Prediction Center said yesterday. The Department of Agriculture
slashed its forecast for the U.S. corn crop by 12 percent on
July 11 to 12.97 billion bushels. The USDA is scheduled to
update its projections Aug. 10.  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$16.1225 a bushel, for a weekly gain of 0.7 percent. The oilseed
climbed to a record $16.915 on July 23.  The USDA said July 30 about 55 percent of the U.S. soybean
crop was setting pods, a critical phase in determining yields.
Areas of the Midwest may receive as much as 1.25 inches (3.2
centimeters) of rain in the next five days, according to a
Commodity Weather Group forecast today.  “Weather over the last week and maybe this week may have
helped conditions more” for soybeans than corn, which matures
earlier, said Muktadir Ur Rahman, a commodities economist at
Capital Economics Ltd. in  London . “We don’t think we’ll see any
upward yield improvement, but maybe yields are not deteriorating
as sharply.”  Wheat for September delivery added 0.3 percent to $8.675 a
bushel, set for a 3.4 percent loss this week. In Paris,
November-delivery milling wheat fell 0.1 percent to 256.25 euros
($314.19) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
