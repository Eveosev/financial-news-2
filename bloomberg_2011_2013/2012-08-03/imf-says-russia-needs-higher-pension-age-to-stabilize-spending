Russia should increase the  retirement
age  for men and women to 63 by 2030 and 65 by 2050 to maintain
spending on pensions at the current level of 8 percent of
economic output, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  Without an overhaul, pension payments will probably double
to 16 percent of gross domestic product by 2050, Odd Per Brekk, 
the IMFâ€™s senior representative in Moscow, told reporters in the
Russian capital today, adding that he advises against reducing
the size of pension payouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
