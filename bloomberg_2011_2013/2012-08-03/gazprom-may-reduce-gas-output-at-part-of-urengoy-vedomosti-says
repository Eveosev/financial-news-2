OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s state natural
gas export monopoly, may reduce gas output at part of the
Urengoy field because of water intrusion,  Vedomosti  said, citing
a company document and an unidentified company manager.  Water intrusion hampered production plans at part of the
Urengoy production area known as the Pestsovaya field, which
reached its full capacity of 27.5 billion cubic meters in 2006.  That accounted for five percent of Gazprom’s total
production last year, the newspaper said. The company may now
cut production at Pestsovaya to between 24 billion and 21
billion cubic meters a year, Vedomosti said, citing the manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
