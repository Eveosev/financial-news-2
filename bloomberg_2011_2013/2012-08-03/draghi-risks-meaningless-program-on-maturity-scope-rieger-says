The master plan European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  presented yesterday may be
“meaningless” if it is restricted to buying government debt
with maturities of less than a year, said  Christoph Rieger , head
of interest-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG.  “Obviously, if this were to be the case, the entire
program would be meaningless,” Rieger said in an e-mailed note
from Frankfurt today. “Should tensions continue in coming days
with markets realizing that a short-end focus will simply not be
enough, quite likely the ECB will be required to broaden the
maturity scope when announcing the detailed program.”  The ECB is developing a plan that would allow policy makers
to wade forcefully into bond markets to reduce borrowing costs
in tandem with  Europe ’s rescue fund. Draghi said yesterday that
potential bond purchases would focus “on the short end of the
yield curve” because “this falls squarely within the range of
classical monetary policy instruments.”  While the ECB has provided banks with unlimited liquidity
for three years, the “normal” lifetime for refinancing loans
ranges “from six months to nine months to a year,” he said.  Rieger said Draghi’s comments at a Frankfurt briefing
seemed to imply that the ECB won’t buy debt with a maturity of
more than a year, which was a “major blow for the markets.”  The euro initially climbed as much as 0.5 percent to
$1.2405, the highest level since July 5, after Draghi’s remarks
before declining. It traded at $1.2198 at 9:47 a.m. in
 Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
