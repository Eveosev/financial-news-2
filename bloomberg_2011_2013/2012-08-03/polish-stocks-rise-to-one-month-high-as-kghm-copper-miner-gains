Polish stocks jumped to a one-month
high as  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , the second-biggest lender, rallied on
better-than-expected earnings and  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the
country’s only copper miner, climbed on U.S. payrolls data.  The WIG20 Index surged 2.4 percent to 2,222.64 at the close
in Warsaw, the highest level since July 10.  KGHM rallied 3 percent to 127.7 zloty as copper advanced
after Labor Department figures showed American employers added
163,000 workers last month. That exceeded the 100,000 median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Bank Pekao, the unit of  Italy ’s UniCredit SpA, gained 4.6
percent to 147 zloty, the most since June 6, after posting
second-quarter net income of 704.2 million zloty ($209 million).
That beat the 672.4 million-zloty estimate of five analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The bank will probably post second-half
earnings “not worse” than in the first six months, Chief
Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
