Kenya ’s shilling gained for a third
day this week as higher yields and lower inflation spurred
demand for government debt.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.4 percent before trading less than 0.2 percent
stronger at 84.13 per dollar by 4:17 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Kenya yesterday received 12.9 billion
shillings ($153 million) in bids for 3-month securities, having
offered 4 billion shillings. The country’s  inflation  rate slowed
for an eighth month, falling to 7.7 percent in July from 10.1
percent in June, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said on
July 31.  “The local currency has gained on increased offshore
investments into government debt off the back of elevated yields
and falling inflation,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said today
in a note to clients.  Food costs, with a 36 percent weight in the  consumer price
index , declined 1.9 percent and transportation prices including
fuel retreated 1.4 percent.  The central bank received 7.6 billion shillings in bids for
6-month securities at a market-weighted average rate of 13.038
percent on Aug. 1.  The bank accepted 3.8 billion shillings of seven-day
 repurchase agreements  at a weighted average yield of 10.127
percent, an official, who asked not to be identified in line
with policy, said today. The bank also accepted 100 million
shillings each in 14- and 21-day day term auction deposits at
10.45 percent, for both tenures, the official said by telephone
today from Nairobi.  Tanzania’s shilling gained for a second day, strengthening
0.2 percent to 1,574 per dollar to the highest on a closing
basis since June 29.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 0.2 percent to 2,490 per
dollar, a second day of declines to the lowest on a closing
basis since June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
