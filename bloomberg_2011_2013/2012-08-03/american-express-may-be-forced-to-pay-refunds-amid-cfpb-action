American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, said it may be forced to refund
customers as bank regulators weigh enforcement actions based on
consumer-protection laws.  The lender “currently believes” the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau will take enforcement action against at least
one of the company’s units and possibly a second, similar to
measures the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had said previously
it intends to pursue, New York-based AmEx said yesterday in a
quarterly filing.  The bank and its subsidiaries “continue to make changes to
certain of their card practices and products and established
accruals for, among other costs, expected refunds to
cardmembers,” American Express said in the filing.  U.S. financial firms face inquiries and information
requests from regulators reviewing the sale of add-on credit-
card products.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  said yesterday it received
queries from regulators related to identity-theft protection
services and that consumers may have paid for products without
receiving certain benefits from third-party vendors.  Capital One Financial Corp., in the first public
enforcement case brought by the CFPB, said last month it will
pay $210 million to settle claims of deceptive marketing on
credit-card products including payment protection and credit
monitoring. The bureau and FDIC also have subpoenaed  Discover
Financial Services (DFS)  amid a probe into that lender’s marketing of
fee-based products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
