European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen comments on ECB plans to intervene
in government bond markets.  He made the remarks in an interview on Helsinki-based
broadcaster MTV3.  “The ECB hasn’t let anyone down. President Draghi last
week made strong comments, saying the ECB will act within its
mandate to strengthen the irreversibility of the euro and to get
us out of this crisis. Yesterday, the council gave its support
to the President and his remarks.”  “Each country must take measures to boost growth. The
member states together need to build tools, we have the EFSF,
the ESM. Why? Because even if countries take the required
measures, it will take time before it is transmitted to the
markets, and some support may be needed here. When this is done,
the ECB can act. Yesterday we gave some clear direction to the
preparations. ECB can independently act on the secondary
markets, this is normal central-bank activity. It will take
place at the short end of the curve. We may also take other non-
standard measures.”  “The third phase is that when preparations are over, we
are ready to act. ECB decision-making is such that it can always
act. The ECB is always ready to act.”  “The euro is irreversible and we work each day to get
control of the crisis and to get the financial markets operating
normally. We’re working to get the euro area onto a path of
stable growth where  price stability  is maintained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
