EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) , the largest oil
producer in  Texas ’ Eagle Ford shale, surged the most in nine
months after boosting output forecasts and reporting profit that
surpassed analysts’ estimates.  EOG, based in Houston,  climbed  11 percent to $106.75 at the
close in  New York , the biggest gain since Nov. 2.  Second-quarter net income increased 34 percent to $395.8
million, or $1.47 a share, from $295.6 million, or $1.10, a year
earlier, EOG said in a statement after the close of regular
trading yesterday. Excluding one-time items such as gains from
asset sales, profit was $1.16 a share, beating by 24 cents the
average of 30 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Robust” results in the Eagle Ford and Bakken increased
crude and condensate production 52 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, the company said. Based on those gains and
production from the Wolfcamp and Leonard shale, EOG raised its
2012 production growth forecast to 9 percent from 7 percent,
without increasing its capital spending budget.  “EOG still continues to impress, and results, especially
in the Eagle Ford, remain a step above those announced in other
resource plays,” Bob Brackett, a New York-based analyst for
Sanford Bernstein & Co., wrote in a note to investors today.
“EOG is well ahead of peers in the ‘shift-to-liquids,’ showing
meaningful production growth while laggard shifters contend with
the struggle of initial capex burdens.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
