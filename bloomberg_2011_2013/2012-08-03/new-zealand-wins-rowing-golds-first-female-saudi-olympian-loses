Michael Phelps  won his record 17th
Olympic gold and two teenaged teammates led another big night
for Americans in the pool as the U.S. maintained its supremacy
atop the London Games medal standings.  Phelps, 17-year-old Missy Franklin and 15-year-old Katie
Ledecky all won races as the U.S. pushed its total to 43 medals,
21 of them gold.  China  is second with 42 medals, including 20
golds.  Phelps, 27, captured the 100-meter butterfly title in his
final individual swimming event, giving him 21 career medals --
also an Olympic record. Phelps, who is swimming in his fourth
games and has said he’ll retire after London, will swim his last
Olympic race today in the 400-meter medley relay.  “To be able to finish that way, you can’t really finish
any better,” Phelps said yesterday of his butterfly win. “I’m
very pleased with how everything went.”  Medals will be awarded in 25 Olympic events today,
including the women’s 100-meter track and field final in which
Jamaicans swept the medals in 2008. In women’s tennis, Wimbledon
champion  Serena Williams , 30, of the U.S., and French Open
winner  Maria Sharapova , 25, of  Russia , will meet for the singles
title. Today is the last day of swimming at the games.  Franklin set a world record in winning the women’s 200-
meter backstroke last night in 2 minutes, 4.06 seconds. Ledecky,
the youngest American swimming in London, won the 800-meter
freestyle in a national record of 8:14.63 as defending champion
Rebecca Adlington of Britain placed third.  Ledecky’s Win  “I figured I was going pretty fast,” Ledecky told
reporters. “At one point I thought, ‘If I’m going to be close
to this record I don’t even care. I just want to get my hand on
the wall first.’”  At the 2008 Beijing Games, American swimmers won a total of
31 medals, including 12 golds. In London, the U.S. so far has 28
swimming medals, half of which are gold, with four events
remaining.  France’s Florent Manaudou, 21, won the final swimming gold
of last night in the men’s 50-meter freestyle.  Roger Federer , 30, of  Switzerland , and  Andy Murray , 25, of
Britain, set up a rematch of their Wimbledon tennis final.
Federer defeated Juan Martin del Potro, 23, of Argentina, 3-6,
7-6 (7-5), 19-17 yesterday in a semifinal that lasted 4 hours,
26 minutes and was the longest tennis match in Olympic history.
Murray advanced to the final with a 7-5, 7-5 win against  Novak Djokovic , 25, of Serbia.  “Very tough from start to finish,” Federer said. “It was
very physical at the end and so mental.”  British Gold  Britain won two golds on the cycling track as Ed Clancy,
Geraint Thomas, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh broke their own
world record in the men’s team pursuit and Victoria Pendleton
won the keirin. Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins won the
women’s rowing double sculls for the host nation.  New Zealand  got rowing golds from Eric Murray and Hamish
Bond in the men’s pairs and Mahe Drysdale in the men’s singles
sculls, while  Germany  won the quadruple sculls.  In the first track and field medal of the London Games,
defending champion Tomasz Majewski of  Poland  won the men’s shot
put with a final throw of 21.89 meters (71 feet, 10 inches),
topping Germany’s David Storl by 0.03 meters. American Reese
Hoffa won the bronze medal.  In the women’s 10,000 meters, Tirunesh Dibaba of  Ethiopia 
successfully defended her 2008 title with a time of 30 minutes,
20.75 seconds. Kenyans won the silver and bronze medals, with
Sally Jepkosgei Kipyego finishing in 30:26.37 and Vivian
Jepkemoi Cheruiyot in 30:30.44.  Saudi Woman  Wojdan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shaherkani, the first Saudi
Arabian woman to compete at an Olympics, lost to Melissa Mojica
of Puerto Rico in their 78-kilogram judo match.  Saudi Arabia joined Qatar and Brunei in sending female
athletes to  London  after the three were the only countries not
to have any in Beijing in 2008.  “I’m excited and proud to be representing my country,”
said Shaherkani, 18. “Hopefully this will be the start of
bigger participation for other sports. Hopefully this is the
beginning of a new era.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
