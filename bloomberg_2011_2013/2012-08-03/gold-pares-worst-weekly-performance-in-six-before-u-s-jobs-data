Gold futures jumped most in more than
a week after a report showed the U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly
increased to a five-month high.  Unemployment advanced to 8.3 percent in July, the Labor
Department said today. The rate was forecast to hold at 8.2
percent, according to the median in a Bloomberg survey. The
jobless number climbed even as the U.S. payrolls gained more
than forecast last month, the report showed. Higher joblessness
may spur the  Federal Reserve  to boost stimulus measures in a bid
to buoy growth, raising the prospect of higher inflation.  “Traders think that the Fed is watching the  unemployment
rate  very closely, and that will determine the timing of the
stimulus,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J.
O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Some people may move to gold before the Fed makes an
announcement.”  Gold futures for December delivery increased 1.2 percent to
settle at $1,609.30 an ounce at 1:58 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest gain since July 25. The metal ended the week
down 0.8 percent, after as the  European Central Bank  and the Fed
refrained from announcing new stimulus measures.  Bullion surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  Silver futures for September delivery jumped 3 percent to
$27.810 an ounce in New York, the biggest rise since June 29.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $1,414.40 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery rose 1.8 percent to
$578.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
