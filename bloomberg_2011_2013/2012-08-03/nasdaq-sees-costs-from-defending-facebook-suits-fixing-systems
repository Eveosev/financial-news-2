Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. said it may
incur additional expenses in defending lawsuits resulting from
its botched initial public offering for Facebook Inc.  The second-largest U.S. equity exchange operator said it
may spend more on implementing technical changes and “remedial
measures,” according to a regulatory filing today. Nasdaq OMX
said it is cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation into the handling of the IPO and that the lawsuits
are without merit.  Nasdaq has taken steps to repair problems that
disadvantaged some members during the May 18 IPO, according to
the statement. On July 23, the exchange proposed creating a $62
million fund to reimburse members who suffered losses. UBS AG
said earlier this week that its losses exceeded $350 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
