Turkey ’s central bank said banks must
hold at least 50 percent of the foreign currency they deposit as
reserves for lira liabilities in dollars, in a new set of rules
published today.  Banks may hold the foreign currency in dollars or euros,
the central bank said in a statement published in the Official
Gazette today. The rules will be enforced from Aug. 17.  Turkey’s central bank is establishing a new system whereby
it may vary the amount of reserves banks can hold in
foreign currency for lira liabilities, seeking to control 
liquidity in the market.  The total value of banks’ reserves for lira liabilities 
kept in local or foreign currency may fluctuate as much as five 
percent during defined two week periods because of the exchange 
rate, the central bank said. The banks may carry any surplus 
over into the next two week period to cover future shortfalls, 
it said.  The central bank allows banks to hold as much as 55 percent
of their required reserves for lira liabilities in foreign
currency and said last week it may increase the amount to 60
percent.   Central bank governor Erdem Basci increases the cost for 
banks to hold foreign currency instead of liras in the reserves 
after the share of foreign currency passes 40 percent. So-called 
coeffients used to calculate that cost may be increased or 
decreased in the coming period as the central bank seeks to 
control liquidity, Basci said on July 26.   To contact the reporters on this story:
