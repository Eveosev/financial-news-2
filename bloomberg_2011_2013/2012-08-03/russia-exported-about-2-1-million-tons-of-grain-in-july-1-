Russia  exported about 2.1 million
metric tons of grain last month, according to Rusagrotrans, the
country’s biggest grain rail carrier.  July’s shipments exceeded Rusagrotrans’ expectations for
1.6 million tons, Igor Pavensky, the company’s head of
analytics, said by e-mail. Exports were 2.5 million tons a year
earlier, he said.  Shipments were the biggest for the month for any year
except 2011, when exporters had stocks packed and ready to go at
ports in anticipation of the end of an exports embargo imposed
the previous August after crops wilted amid Russia’s worst
drought in a half century.  While Russia’s main grain growing areas, including parts of
the Southern, Volga, and Siberian federal districts, have been
hit by drought this year, the government has said there’s no
need for export restrictions this year.  Rusagrotrans lowered its grains crop forecast to 77.4
million to 75.2 million tons for 2012-13, while the wheat
harvest may reach 42.5 million tons. The company had forecast
last month 82 million to 85 million tons for all grains and 47
million to 49 million tons for wheat.  The barley crop may be 14.6 million tons, while the corn
crop is seen at 7.2 million tons, according to Pavensky.  Grain exports may reach 13 million tons, down from a July
estimate of “at most” 18 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
