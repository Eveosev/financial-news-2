The Dollar Index may post further
gains after a “bullish breakout” above a resistance level this
week, Royal Bank of Canada said, citing trading patterns.  The index, which  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  uses to
track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, surpassed “congestive” resistance at 83.01 on Aug.
1, according to  George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed-
income and currency strategy in Toronto at the bank’s  RBC
Dominion Securities  unit. The gauge climbed to a one-week high
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The advance is “underpinning topside momentum for the
Dollar Index,” Davis wrote in a report yesterday. “We note
that 83.63 serves as the next resistance target to watch for
this development.” Resistance is an area on a chart where
orders to sell may be clustered.  The  gauge  was little changed from yesterday at 83.33 as of
9:55 a.m. in Tokyo. It yesterday touched 83.51, the strongest
since July 26. The Dollar Index is set for a 0.8 percent  advance 
this week, the most since the period ended July 6.  In technical  analysis,  investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
