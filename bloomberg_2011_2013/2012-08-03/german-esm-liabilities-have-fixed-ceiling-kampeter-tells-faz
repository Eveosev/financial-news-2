Germany ’s financial liabilities
toward the European Stability Mechanism, the euro-area’s
permanent bailout fund, can’t surpass a fixed ceiling, Deputy
Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter told  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  in a response to critics.  Some economists have interpreted the ESM contract as
foisting unlimited liabilities on Germany under certain
scenarios, Kampeter said in a guest column. No ESM clauses can
force Germany to raise its input to the ESM above the agreed
amount of 190 billion euros ($232 billion), in line with the
country’s economic weighting in the euro area, Kampeter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
