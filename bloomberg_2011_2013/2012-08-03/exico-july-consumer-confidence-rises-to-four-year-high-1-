Mexico’s  consumer confidence  index
rose to 98.9 in July, the highest since March 2008, the national
statistics agency, known as Inegi, reported today on its
website.  The index increased from 95.5 in June and compared with the
96.9 median forecast of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The consumer sentiment index reflects Mexicans’ perception
of the economy, their financial situation and whether they
consider it a good time to spend on durable goods. The index
fell in May and June after reaching 97.2 in April as the economy
showed resilience in the face of Europe’s debt crisis.  The economy grew about 4 percent in the second quarter,
less than the 4.6 percent expansion Mexico saw in the first
three months of the year, according to both a July 30 estimate
from the  Finance Ministry  and the median forecast of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
