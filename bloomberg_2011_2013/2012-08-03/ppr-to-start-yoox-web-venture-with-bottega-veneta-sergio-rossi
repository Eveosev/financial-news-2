PPR SA (PP)  luxury brands Bottega Veneta
and Sergio Rossi will join forces with Italian Internet fashion
retailer Yoox SpA to open new online stores by the end of 2012.  Yves Saint Laurent , Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga will
also operate digital stores using Yoox’s platform by the end of
2013, Paris-based PPR said today in a statement as it confirmed
the signing of a joint venture with the Italian company.  PPR, which plans to generate more than 1 billion euros
($1.2 billion) of sales online by 2020, said it may decide to
involve other brands in the partnership in future. The Stella
McCartney label wasn’t on the list of brands published today
after being included in plans that the companies outlined in May
for the joint venture.  Yoox  rose  as much as 4.5 percent to 10.93 euros in Milan
trading and was up 3.6 percent at 9:45 a.m. PPR shares gained
1.3 percent to 122.85 euros in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
