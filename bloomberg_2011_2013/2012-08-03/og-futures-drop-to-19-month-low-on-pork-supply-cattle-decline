Hog prices tumbled to a 19-month low
on signs that the worsening U.S. drought is forcing farmers to
sell more animals for slaughter to limit losses on higher feed
costs, boosting pork supplies. Cattle futures also declined.  More than 55 percent of the Midwest is in severe drought as
of July 31, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed. Wholesale  pork 
yesterday fell 1.3 percent to 92.78 cents a pound, the biggest
drop since July 3, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . The agency reported that meatpackers processed 1.62
million hogs in the first four days of this week, up 1.4 percent
from a week earlier. Hog futures have dropped 17 percent since
mid-June as corn costs jumped 60 percent.  “We’re obviously liquidating, and that’s putting a little
bit more pressure on the product market,” Jason Golly, a vice
president of risk-management marketing at Lynch Livestock Inc.,
said in a telephone interview from Waucoma,  Iowa .  Hog futures for October settlement slumped 3 percent to
settle at 75.85 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, after reaching 75.8 cents, the lowest since
Dec. 21, 2010. Prices are down 6.7 percent for the week, the
first drop since July 13.  Hot, dry conditions are expected to persist through October
and spread in parts of  North Dakota  and  Texas , according to the
U.S. Climate Prediction Center’s drought outlook.  Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$1.24375 a pound in Chicago. Prices have gained 2.4 percent in
2012.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement slid 1.3
percent to $1.40125 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
