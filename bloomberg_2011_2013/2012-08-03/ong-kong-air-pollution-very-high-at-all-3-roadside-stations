Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at all three of the city’s roadside-monitoring
stations, the Environmental Protection Department said on its
website today.  The index was 178 in  Mong Kok , 174 in Central
business district and 172 in Causeway Bay as of 7 a.m. local
time, the department said. Roadside pollution of more than 100
triggers a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy-traffic
areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
