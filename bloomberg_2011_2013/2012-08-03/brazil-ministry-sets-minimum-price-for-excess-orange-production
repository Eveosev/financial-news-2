Brazil set a minimum price of 10.10
reais ($4.96) per 40.8-kilogram box of oranges in an attempt to
help farmers sell excess production profitably.  The excess production will be sold through auctions, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement. Brazil wants
to develop the domestic orange juice market, said Jose Carlos
Vaz, the ministryâ€™s executive secretary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
