U.K. stocks  climbed, extending the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index’s biggest-weekly gain in almost a month, led by a
rebound in financial companies after  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS)  reported earnings.  RBS, Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, added 5.6
percent.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Aviva Plc (AV/)  also increased, rallying at
least 6 percent.  Kazakhmys (KAZ)  Plc and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) 
advanced with copper.  The benchmark FTSE 100 rose 124.98 points, or 2.2 percent,
to 5,787.28 at the close in London, extending the gauge’s weekly
advance to 2.8 percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also
climbed 2.2 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.9
percent.  “Given all of the distractions, the fact that RBS
continues to edge in the right direction at all is of some
comfort to investors,” said  Richard Hunter , Head of Equities at
Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London. “The bank has moved
away from the government’s emergency loans, whilst its overall
financial health has undoubtedly improved.”  Stocks extended gains after a U.S. jobs report beat
economists’ forecasts. Payrolls increased 163,000 in July
following a revised 64,000 rise in June, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The median economist
forecast was for a gain of 100,000.  The FTSE 100 tumbled yesterday, led by a selloff in
financials, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
damped speculation he would take immediate steps to support the
economy. The FTSE 100 has still climbed 10 percent from this
year’s low on June 1.  RBS rallied 5.6 percent to 216 pence after reporting a 22
percent decline in operating profit to 650 million pounds ($1
billion) as revenue from its markets unit slipped. That was in
line with the 649 million-pound median analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  “We have continued to make the bank safer and stronger as
we clean up problems of the past,” Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Hester, 51, said in a statement. “In a difficult moment
for banks it is more essential than ever to drive through these
changes.”  Hester has cut assets by more than 800 billion pounds,
eliminated 36,000 jobs and scaled back RBS’s securities and
Irish units since he took over from  Fred Goodwin  when the bank
was rescued in 2008.  Barclays climbed 5.6 percent to 171.35 pence after tumbling
3.6 percent yesterday. Lloyds Banking Group Plc rose 4.2 percent
to 30.61 pence, while  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  gained 4.1 percent to
560.5 pence.  Insurers Gain  Insurance companies also advanced after France’s Axa SA,
Europe’s second-largest insurer, reported first-half operating
profit that topped analyst estimates.  Aviva led gains in insurers, climbing 7.4 percent to 306.2
pence.  Prudential Plc (PRU)  rose 6.1 percent to 791.5 pence and  Legal
& General Group Plc (LGEN)  gained 2.7 percent to 130 pence.  Kazakhmys jumped 6.6 percent to 723.5 pence as copper led
base metals higher on the London Metal Exchange. Vedanta
Resources rose 5.9 percent to 954.5 pence and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) ,
which owns mines in Chile, increased 4.6 percent to 1,089 pence.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA paced
declining shares, falling 5.2 percent to 151 pence the parent
company of British Airways said it will probably record a
“small operating loss” for the full year following costs
related to its Spanish arm Iberia. The company had earlier said
it would break even.  The carrier reported a second-quarter operating loss of 42
million euros ($51 million) versus a year-earlier profit of 134
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
