Russia will sell wheat from
stockpiles if prices climb to certain pre-set targets in parts
of the country, according to a draft of an order proposed by the
 Agriculture Ministry .  The targets are meant to keep grain prices stable,
according to the ministry’s draft published on its website
today. The trigger for third-grade milling wheat, used to make
wheat, will be 5,000 rubles ($155) to 7,500 rubles a metric ton,
depending on the area of the country, it said. Last week, third-
grade milling wheat sold at 8,200 rubles to 8,700 rubles a ton
across the country, according to Grain Producers’ Union data.
For fourth-grade milling wheat, the target will be 5,300 rubles
to 7,150 rubles, it said.  The pre-set selling level will be 4,550 rubles to 6,000
rubles a ton for feed wheat, 4,300 rubles a ton for milling rye,
and 4,550 rubles a ton for feed barley, according to the draft.  Editors: Claudia Carpenter,  John Deane   To contact the reporter on this story:
