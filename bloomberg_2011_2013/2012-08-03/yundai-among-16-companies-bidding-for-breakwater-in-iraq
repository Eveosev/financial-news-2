Hyundai Engineering & Construction (000720)  is
among 16 companies that bid to build a breakwater for the $6
billion first phase of the Grand Fao port in the south of Iraq,
said the director general of the State Company for Iraq’s Ports.  Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. (047040) , Dredging
International,  China Communications Construction Co. (1800)  and Al
Habtoor Leighton Group are also among the bidders for the 480
billion-dinar ($412 million) breakwater, Omran Radhi said in a
telephone interview from Baghdad yesterday. Brazilian, Turkish,
Italian, Ukrainian, Jordanian and Iraqi companies have submitted
bids as well, he said.  Results will be made public after an evaluation that will
take up to two months, Radhi said, adding that the government
will finance construction of the breakwater.  The Grand Fao port will have a capacity of more than 30
ships and will provide at least 100,000 jobs, Radhi said in a
March 5 interview.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-largest crude deposits
including Canadian  oil sands , according to data from  BP Plc. (BP/)  The
government is trying to attract foreign investment and expertise
to help rebuild the infrastructure and boost energy exports to
revive an economy shattered by years of conflict, sanctions and
sabotage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
