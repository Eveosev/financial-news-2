Tropical Storm Ernesto, the fifth
named system of the Atlantic season, moved past  St. Lucia  into
the eastern Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said.  Ernesto is packing winds of 45 miles (75 kilometers) per
hour, the  center  said in an 8 a.m. Atlantic time advisory. The
storm is 40 miles west-southwest of St. Lucia moving west at 24
mph. The government of Barbados discontinued a tropical storm
warning for the islands, as did Trinidad for Grenada.  The center of the storm “moved over or very near St.
Lucia” into the eastern Caribbean this morning, the Miami-based
NHC said. Its forecast path shows the storm may possibly grow
into a hurricane late this weekend as it moves south and west of
 Jamaica  and may approach  Mexico ’s Yucatan peninsula near Cancun
in about five days.  It’s too early to say if  the storm’s track  will lead it
into the  Gulf of Mexico , which according to the U.S. Energy
Department is home to 29 percent of oil production, 6.5 percent
of U.S. natural-gas output and 40 percent of refining capacity.  “The current thinking is it will be no more than tropical
storm strength through the weekend,” said Jim Rouiller, senior
energy meteorologist at Planalytics Inc.  Tropical-storm warnings, meaning winds of at least 39 mph
may arrive within 12 hours, are in effect for Dominica, St.
Lucia, Martinique and Guadeloupe. Rain and high waves generated
by the storm may affect the warning area for a day or two.  To contact the reporters on this story:
