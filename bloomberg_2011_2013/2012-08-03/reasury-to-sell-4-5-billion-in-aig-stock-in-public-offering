The U.S. Treasury Department has
begun an offering of $4.5 billion in  American International
Group Inc. (AIG)  shares, and the bailed-out insurer plans to buy back
as much as $3 billion of the stock.  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are managing the sale, and other banks
are expected to be added, the Treasury said in a statement
today.  A $4.5 billion sale would be the smallest of four offerings
of AIG stock by the Treasury Department. The U.S. holding was
cut to 61 percent from 92 percent in the first three sales,
which raised more than $17 billion for the Treasury. AIG has
raised funds for repurchases by divesting assets including part
of its stake in Hong Kong-based insurer AIA Group Ltd.  “Ongoing asset sales and share buybacks are a near-term
catalyst for AIG,”  Jimmy Bhullar , an analyst at JPMorgan, wrote
in a research note today before the announcement.  AIG advanced 1.6 percent to $31.34 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The first two  offerings  were priced at $29 a share, and the
third at $30.50. The government needs to average about $28.72
over all share sales to break even on its investment, which was
part of a 2008 bailout.  Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche has been
repurchasing stock to help the company regain independence and
increase the value of remaining shares. Book value per share, a
measure of assets minus liabilities, climbed to $60.58 as of
June 30 from $57.68 on March 31, the company said yesterday when
it posted its third-straight  quarterly profit .  Buybacks contributed $1.03 to the increase in book value
per share in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer David Herzog
said on a conference call today.  Underwriters have a 30-day option to buy as much as $675
million more in AIG stock from the Treasury, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
