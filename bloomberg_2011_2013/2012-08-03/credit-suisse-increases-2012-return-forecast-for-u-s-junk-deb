Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  raised its
projection for U.S. high-yield debt  returns  as the  European debt
crisis  and sluggish economic growth in the U.S. aren’t hurting
the markets as much as expected.  Speculative-grade bonds will now see gains ranging between
8 percent and 11 percent compared with 7 percent to 10 percent,
the lender said yesterday in a report. Leveraged loan returns
will be between 5 percent to 8 percent, up from earlier
projections of 4 percent to 7 percent.  The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II
bond index has returned 9.3 percent this year through yesterday,
while there has been a gain of 6.6 percent in the  Standard &
Poor’s/LSTA Leveraged Loan 100 index . Investors have placed
$11.9 billion in funds that purchases high-yield debt this year,
Credit Suisse research shows.  “We had maintained projections slightly lower than our
forecast models due to concerns about European recession and
slowing U.S. growth,” Credit Suisse analysts led by Jonathan
Blau wrote in the report. “Even though our concerns were
realized, the market disruption has been fairly minor.”  Credit Suisse economists predict U.S. gross domestic
product will stabilize at 1.5 percent growth in the third
quarter and rise to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter.  High-yield bonds and leveraged loans are those rated below
BBB- by S&P and less than Baa3 at Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
