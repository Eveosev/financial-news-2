Washington Post Co. (WPO) , the publishing
group part-owned by billionaire  Warren Buffett , said second-
quarter profit fell 29 percent after revenue from its education
business declined.  Net income from continuing operations dropped to $34
million, or $4.48 a share, from $47.6 million, or $6, a year
earlier, the Washington-based company said today in a statement.
Sales fell 5.1 percent to $1 billion.  The company’s Kaplan unit has come under government
scrutiny -- along with the rest of the for-profit education
industry -- and faces increasing regulation. The Washington Post
newspaper also is struggling. It doesn’t charge online readers
and needs to boost revenue, said  Ken Doctor , a  Santa Cruz ,
California-based analyst at  Outsell Inc. , at research firm
focused on the publishing industry.  “Print circulation is on a rapid decline at the Post,”
Doctor said before today’s earnings report. “They need to
become less of a newspaper company and much more of a digital
news company and a digital advertising company.”  For the first six months of 2012, Post daily and Sunday
circulation declined 9.3 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively,
compared with a year earlier. Average daily circulation at The
Washington Post totaled 482,100 and Sunday circulation was
699,900, according to the statement.  Online-publishing revenue, which primarily includes
Washington Post and Slate digital advertising sales, rose 8
percent to $26.3 million in the quarter compared with a year
earlier, the company said.  Restructuring Charges  The company recorded $8.4 million in restructuring charges
at the Kaplan education and newspaper units. Revenue in the
education division dropped 9 percent to $558.4 million in the
quarter.  Advertising sales at the company’s flagship newspaper
declined 15 percent to $56.7 million, as the broader industry
continues to suffer declines in print advertising. To create new
sources of revenue, the company has been working to develop
digital technology, such as social-marketing tools, through its
research and development unit  WaPo Labs , Doctor said.  Profit attributable to common shareholders rose 14 percent
to $51.8 million or $6.84 a share, from $45.6 million or $5.74 a
share a year earlier.  Washington Post said on July 31 it sold Avenue100 Media
Solutions to a management group. It didn’t disclose terms for
the sale of the marketing firm, which it acquired in 2007.  Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  is the company’s largest
shareholder, with a 27 percent stake, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Washington Post shares fell less than 1 percent to $330.29
at the close in  New York . The stock has declined 12 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
