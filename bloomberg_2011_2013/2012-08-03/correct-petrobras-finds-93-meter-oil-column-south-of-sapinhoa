Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the biggest
crude producer in waters deeper than 1,000 feet, rose the most
in a week after finding “good quality” oil at the third well
it drilled in a $42.5 billion exploration zone off the coast of
 Brazil .  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
rose 1.7 percent to 20.22 reais at in Sao Paulo, the biggest
gain in a week. The stock has dropped 7.3 percent for the year
to date, compared to a 0.9 percent gain in the benchmark  stock
index .  The state-controlled producer completed drilling a well to
the south of the Sapinhoa field, previously known as Guara, in
deep waters of the Santos Basin where the company found a layer
of oil 93 meters (305 feet) thick, the company said today. The
announcement encouraged investors who were disappointed with a
drop in June production, said Bruno Piagentini Caloni, an
analyst at brokerage Coinvalores.  “It’s a sign that Petrobras could increase production from
this area,” Caloni said in a telephone interview from  Sao
Paulo . “It’s a switch in the focus.”  The well was drilled in an area where Petrobras bought the
rights to produce as much as 5 billion barrels of oil from the
government in 2010 as part of a $70 billion share sale. The area
includes the Franco and six other fields in the so-called pre-
salt region and will account for 19 percent of Petrobras’s
domestic oil output in 2020, according to its business plan.  In 2010 Petrobras said Franco had an estimated 3.1 billion
barrels of recoverable oil, compared with 6.5 billion barrels at
Lula, the largest discovery in the western hemisphere since
 Mexico ’s Cantarell in 1976.  To contact the reporter on this story:
