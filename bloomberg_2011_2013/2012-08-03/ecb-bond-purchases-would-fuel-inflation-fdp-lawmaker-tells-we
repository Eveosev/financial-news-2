The  European Central Bank â€™s probable
resumption of government-bond purchases is a mistaken plan that
will fuel inflation, Alexander Lambsdorff, a German European
Parliament lawmaker, told  Die Welt .  Euro-area countries should adopt a debt-redemption fund as
demanded by the European Parliament to quell the debt crisis,
Lambsdorff, a Free Democrat, said in an interview with the
newspaper. Such a fund offers a solution for euro-area leaders
to act quickly to end the crisis, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
