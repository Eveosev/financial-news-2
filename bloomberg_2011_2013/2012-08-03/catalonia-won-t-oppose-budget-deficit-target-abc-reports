The regional government of Catalonia
will not resort to going before  Spain ’s Constitutional Court to
challenge the budget deficit target imposed on regions by
Spain’s central government,  ABC  newspaper reported.  Catalonia’s finances have collapsed, it can’t meet payments
for health care, and is studying the possibility of adhering to
a central government aid mechanism, the newspaper said.  As a result Andreu Mas-Colell, Catalonia’s Finance Chief,
has asked to start “from zero” and “open channels of
dialog,” ABC cited Mas-Colell as saying during a radio
interview on RAC1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
