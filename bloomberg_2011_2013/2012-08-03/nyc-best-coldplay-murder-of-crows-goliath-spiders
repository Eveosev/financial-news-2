century French duke, got elected king of Poland.  He hated the job and the country so much, he plotted to
overthrow himself.  That’s the comic premise of Emmanuel Chabrier’s 1887 “Le
Roi Malgre Lui,” now at Bard College in a funny staging by
Thaddeus Strassberger.  The wonderful cast includes Liam Bonner, Michele Angelini
and Andriana Chuchman. With college president  Leon Botstein  on
the podium, this rarely staged farce is worth a summer’s journey
up to Annandale-on-Hudson. Information: +845-758-7900;
