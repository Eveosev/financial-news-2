Turkish bond yields retreated to the
lowest in more than 1 1/2 years after the central bank raised
the amount of daily funding for a second day and inflation in
July fell more than economists’ predicted.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.59 percent by 12:20 p.m. in
Istanbul, the least on a closing basis since January 2011. The
lira appreciated for a second day, trading 0.9 percent stronger
at 1.7862 per dollar, heading for the highest since May 11.  The central bank lent 6 billion liras ($3.3 billion) at its
lowest 5.75 percent policy rate for a second day, compared with
4 billion liras it provided a week earlier. The  inflation  rate
fell 0.23 percent in July, the statistics office in Ankara said
on its website today, beating the 0.18 percent median forecast
of six economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “This shows the average cost of funding fell to 6.95
percent,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-income strategist at  Turk Ekonomi
Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “Inflation
is slightly more positive.”  The  funding cost  was 7.63 percent yesterday, the lowest
since July 26. Central bank Governor Erdem Basci introduced an
interest-rate corridor in October to execute the bank’s unique
monetary policy, switching between rates of 5.75 percent and
11.5 percent on a daily basis to tame inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
