Missy Franklin won the 200-meter
backstroke in a world-record time at the  London  Olympics, adding
it to the gold medal she won in the 100-meter event five days
ago.  Franklin, a 17-year-old Colorado high school student, won
today in 2 minutes, 4.06 seconds, breaking the mark of 2:04.81
set by Kristy Coventry of  Zimbabwe  in 2009. Anastasia Zueva of
 Russia  was second, 1.86 seconds behind, and Elizabeth Beisel of
the U.S. was third.  Franklin had won the 100-meter backstroke on July 30 in a
U.S. record to take gold from Emily Seebohm, an Australian who
overcame swine flu last year to reach the  Olympic Games .  It’s Franklin’s third gold in London. She was part of the
championship U.S. 800-meter freestyle relay team, and took
bronze in the 400-meter freestyle relay. She’s competing in
seven events, the most attempted by a U.S. female swimmer.  Franklin, the world champion, had been the 4-9 favorite to
win the Olympic race at U.K. bookmaker William Hill Plc, meaning
a successful $9 wager would return $4 and the original stake.  Her teammate Elizabeth Beisel, who took silver in the 400-
meter individual medley, had been the fastest qualifier.  Entering today’s races, the U.S. was at the top of the
medal table in swimming with 23, including 11 gold. China was
second with nine medals, including four golds.  France  was in
third place with six medals, of which three are gold. World
records had been set in five events.  The swimming competition at the Aquatics Centre ends
tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
