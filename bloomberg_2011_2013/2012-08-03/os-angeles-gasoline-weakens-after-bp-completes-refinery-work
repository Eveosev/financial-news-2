Gasoline in  Los Angeles  weakened for
a third day after  BP Plc (BP/)  completed routine maintenance at its
Carson refinery in Southern California yesterday.  The 260,000 barrel-a-day plant yesterday reported flaring
that didnâ€™t affect output, a person familiar with refinery
operations said at the time. BP shut equipment that removes
residual benzene from the crude unit for about three weeks of
planned repairs, a person with direct knowledge of the work said
July 19.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles fell
8.75 cents to a premium of 2 cents a gallon above gasoline
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The same fuel in San Francisco fell 9.75 cents to a premium
of 5 cents a gallon above gasoline futures.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles climbed
0.37 cent to 6.5 cents a gallon above Nymex heating oil futures.
The same fuel in  San Francisco  added 1.25 cents to an 11-cent-a-
gallon premium versus futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
declined 6 cents to a discount of 1 cent a gallon versus Nymex
gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel  there  added 7.5 cents to 19
cents a gallon above heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
