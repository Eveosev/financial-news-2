Copper climbed for the first time in
three days as the lowest price in six weeks stoked demand before
data that may show U.S. employers didn’t hire enough workers to
lower the jobless rate, boosting chances of fresh stimulus.  Three-month copper rose as much as 0.5 percent to $7,368 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $7,365.50
by 4:03 p.m. in  Tokyo . The metal is still down 2.6 percent this
week. The September-delivery contract rose 1 percent to $3.322 a
pound on the Comex.  Unemployment in the U.S., which has been stuck above 8
percent since February 2009, was probably at 8.2 percent for a
third month, economists forecast before data today. The Fed
“will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a
stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor
market conditions,” it said after a two-day meeting this week.  “We’ve seen good buying interest around $7,300 a ton for
copper,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea Exchange
Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . A drop in stockpiles also lent
support for the market, he said.  The metal fell yesterday as European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  failed to provide detailed measures to curb the 17-
nation region’s fiscal crisis after policy makers met. Copper
stockpiles monitored by the LME fell 0.7 percent to 246,800 tons,
declining for a fourth day, exchange figures showed yesterday.  Inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell
4,463 tons to 156,510 tons last week from a week ago, dropping
for the first time in six weeks. November-delivery copper fell 1
percent to close at 54,100  yuan  ($8,488) a ton on the bourse.  LCH.Clearnet Ltd. lowered margins for copper, aluminum
alloys, tin, lead, cobalt and the LME index of six industrial
metals on the London Metal Exchange, effective Aug. 8, according
to a notice on the LCH.Clearnet’s website.  Aluminum, zinc, lead, tin and nickel also advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
