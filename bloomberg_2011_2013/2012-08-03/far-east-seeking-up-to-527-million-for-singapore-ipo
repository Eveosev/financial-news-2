Far East  Organization, Singaporeâ€™s
biggest closely held developer, is seeking to raise as much as
S$656.3 million ($527 million) in an initial public offering of
a Singapore hotel trust.  Far East Hospitality Trust plans to sell 705.7 million
stapled securities at a range of between 86 to 93 Singapore
cents, according to a prospectus lodged with the Monetary
Authority of Singapore today.  The IPO may be the biggest this year in Singapore, where
$785 million has been raised so far in 2012 compared to $7
billion in the first seven months of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ascendas Hospitality Trust (ASHT)  started
trading in the city last month after raising S$459 million.  The initial portfolio of the trust will comprise 11
properties, according to the offering document. They consist of
seven hotels, including Albert Court Village Hotel and Orchard
Parade Hotel, as well as four serviced residences. The
distribution yield for this year is projected to be as much as
6.5 percent.  DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are managing the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
