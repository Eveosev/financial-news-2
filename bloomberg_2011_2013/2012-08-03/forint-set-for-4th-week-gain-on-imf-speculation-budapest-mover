The forint appreciated a fourth week
and default swaps fell to the lowest in almost a year as
investors speculated the government will reach an aid agreement
with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union.  Hungary’s currency strengthened 1.4 percent to 277.77 per
euro by 4:54 p.m. in Budapest, bringing its weekly advance to
1.1 percent. The forint was the best performer today among more
than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
cost of insuring Hungarian debt with credit-default swaps fell
19 basis points to 448, the lowest level since September 2011.  “The forint-euro  exchange rate  continues to price an
EU/IMF standby loan soon,” Gergely Palffy, a currency
strategist at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt, wrote in a report today.  The IMF wrapped up a week of “constructive” loan talks in
Budapest, the lender said on July 26. Hungary’s government,
which is targeting an agreement by the end of October, said
negotiations will continue in September. Hungary may be ready to
change the financial transaction tax, which the  European Central
Bank  said would violate the Hungarian central bank’s
independence, if arguments presented against the levy are
“convincing,” government spokesman Andras Giro-Szasz told TV2
yesterday.  Government bonds  rallied the first day in three, cutting
the yield on benchmark 2022 forint notes by 10 basis points, or
0.1 percentage point, to 7.42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
