Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , the maker
of the “Call of Duty” video game, dropped after the Financial
Times reported that majority owner Vivendi SA hasn’t attracted
interest for its planned sale of its stake in the company.  Activision fell 4.4 percent to $11.25 at 10:34 a.m. New
York time, after earlier tumbling 6.5 percent for the biggest
intraday decline since Nov. 9. Through yesterday, the  Santa
Monica , California-based company’s shares had declined 4.5
percent this year.  Vivendi may not proceed with a sale in the near term after
bankers failed to generate interest, the paper said, citing
people it didn’t identify.   To contact the reporter on this story:
