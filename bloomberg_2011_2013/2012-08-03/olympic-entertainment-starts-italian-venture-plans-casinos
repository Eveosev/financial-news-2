Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) , the
only publicly traded casino operator in eastern Europe, agreed
to set up a joint venture in  Italy  with GHolding to enter the
western European market.  The Box S.r.l., the equally owned holding company, plans to
open three casinos in northern Italy by the end of next year
with 50 to 70 video lottery terminal slot machines each, the
Tallinn-based Olympic said in a regulatory statement today.
Olympic will invest 4.5 million euros ($5.5 million).  “In the first phase we are talking about three gaming
locations with a total of couple of hundred VLT slots, but the
potential is much higher,” Olympic’s Chief Executive Officer
Madis Jaager said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
