Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , the Turkish lender part-
owned by  Citigroup Inc. (C) , reported a drop in second-quarter
profit, missing all estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Net income fell 16 percent to 535.1 million liras ($300
million), compared with 640.3 million liras a year earlier. The
average of 4 analyst estimates on Bloomberg was 607.3 million
liras.  “Net income was below estimates as the bank had lower-
than-expected other income and higher-than-expected effective
 tax rate ,‘‘ Muge Dagistan, an analyst at BGC Partners in
Istanbul, said in an e-mail today. ‘‘But expectations are high
for the third quarter so I’m not negative.’’  The shares closed 2.1 percent higher at 6.82 liras today in
Istanbul, the biggest jump since July 26. The benchmark ISE
National 100 index rose 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
