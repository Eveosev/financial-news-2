Argentina ’s foreign debt will drop to
the equivalent of 8.4 percent of gross domestic product after
tomorrow’s final $2.2 billion payment on its Boden 2012 bonds,
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said at an event at the
Buenos Aires stock exchange.  “The payment gives us an immense freedom from markets
which move every day and don’t allow us to act efficiently,”
Fernandez said.  Government debt held by the private sector dropped to the
equivalent of 88 percent of reserves and 12 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011 from 815 percent and 124 percent
respectively in 2002, Fernandez said. Most government debt is in
the hands of the public sector.  Twenty-two percent of the Boden 2012 bonds are owned by
local investors, while the rest is held abroad, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
