Volvo AB (VOLVB)  will appeal a $72 million
penalty imposed on its truck-engine unit after a federal judge
found the company violated a 1999 emissions-control agreement
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Volvo Powertrain Corp. seeks reversal of an April 13 ruling
that it breached a consent decree on emissions standards for
heavy-duty diesel engines, according to a notice of appeal filed
today in the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Washington. U.S. District
Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that 8,354 engines weren’t compliant.  “Volvo believes the consent decree covers only the engines
specifically referenced, which are certain specified Volvo
Powertrain on-highway engines and Volvo Construction Equipment
non-road engines,” the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company said in
a statement when the court decision was issued.  Volvo and six other manufacturers of heavy  diesel engines 
agreed to spend $1 billion to settle charges that they had
“illegally poured millions of tons of pollution into the air,”
according to a Justice Department press release.  At the time it was announced, the settlement, approved by a
federal judge in 1999, was the largest environmental enforcement
penalty, according to the statement.  The case is U.S. v. Volvo Powertrain Corp., 12-05234, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
