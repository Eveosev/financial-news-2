India ’s rupee completed its biggest
weekly drop since June after the nation’s central bank, the
 Federal Reserve  and the  European Central Bank  refrained from
announcing fresh measures to spur growth.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  declined to intervene in debt
markets yesterday, while a day earlier the Fed signaled its
readiness to support the world’s largest economy even as it held
back from adding to bond purchases. The  Reserve Bank  of India
kept borrowing costs unchanged on July 31. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the greenback against the currencies of six major
trading partners, rose 0.1 percent this week.  “Triple disappointments for risk traders would be a hard
pill to swallow,” analysts at Edelweiss Financial Advisors
Ltd., including Mumbai-based Vinay Khattar, wrote in a research
report released today. “The rupee will continue to face
resistance from a stronger dollar.”  The rupee declined 0.7 percent this week to 55.7550 per
dollar in Mumbai, the biggest drop since the five days through
June 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
strengthened 0.1 percent today, after earlier falling as low as
56.1900, the weakest level since July 25.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 11.30 percent today. It declined 20 basis
points this week.  RBI Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  kept the benchmark repurchase
rate at 8 percent this week, raised the monetary authority’s
inflation forecast for the year through March 2013 to 7 percent
from 6.5 percent, and lowered the growth estimate to 6.5 percent
from 7.3 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.76 per
dollar, compared with 56.81 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.77 from 56.88. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
