The premium buyers have to pay to
obtain coffee from  Vietnam , the world’s largest robusta grower,
slid 75 percent in a week on sales from stockpiles and slow
demand, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Vietnamese beans for August and September shipment were at
a premium of $10 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based unit of commodities
trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. said in a weekly report e-mailed
today. That compares with $40 a ton last week.  There is “pressure to clear the stocks and nearby demand
being low, resulted in cheaper free-on-board differentials this
week,” Volcafe said.  A differential is a discount or premium paid to obtain
physical coffee in relation to the price on the futures market.
Free-on-board shipment denotes delivery of a commodity by the
seller at no cost to the buyer onto the transporter, such as a
vessel, used for shipment.  Coffee exports from Vietnam last month totaled 1.97 million
bags, each weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), bringing total
shipments for the 2011-12 season begun in October to 20.6
million bags, according to the report.  In  Indonesia , coffee arrivals at ports climbed to 15,000 to
16,000 tons this week because of dry weather across “large
parts” of growing regions, Volcafe estimated. That compares
with 12,750 to 14,000 tons last week.  Beans from Indonesia for August and September shipment were
at a premium of $40 a ton to the NYSE Liffe price, up from $30 a
ton last week, according to the trader.  “A few international trading houses are quite aggressive
and buying actively,” Volcafe said.  Robusta coffee for September delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$2,224 a ton on NYSE Liffe by 4:26 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
