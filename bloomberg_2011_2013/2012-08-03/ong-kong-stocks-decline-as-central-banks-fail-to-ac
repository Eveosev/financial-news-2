Hong Kong  stocks  fell, paring this
week’s gain in the benchmark index, after central banks in
China, Europe to the U.S. failed to deliver new stimulus to
bolster growth.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , an operator of ports that gets  54
percent of revenue from Europe, fell 1.5 percent after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  failed to announce immediate
action to stem the region’s debt crisis. Li & Fung Ltd., a
supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., slid 2.9 percent ahead of a
U.S. employment report.  China Yurun Food Group Ltd. (1068)  gained 8.7
percent, extending yesterday’s steepest gains since its 2005
listing.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.9 percent to 19,510.69 at the
midday trading break, with three shares falling for each that
gained on the 49-member gauge. It is headed for a 1.2 percent
gain this week. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland companies dropped 1.2 percent to 9,556.91.  “No monetary easing is not what the market wants to
hear,” said Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean Holdings
Ltd., a Hong Kong-based brokerage. “The market had shot up in
the last few days in anticipation of easing of monetary policy.
Investors just got ahead of themselves.”  The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 9.2 percent from this
year’s high in February through yesterday on signs Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening while economic growth slows in China and the
U.S. The drop reduced the  value  of shares on the gauge to 10.3
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.3 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.1 for Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Central Banks  THE ECB kept its benchmark interest rate on hold yesterday
and the People’s Bank of China said it will keep pursuing
“prudent” monetary policy. The U.S. Federal Reserve also
refrained this week from adding stimulus.  “There is no real action to support the economy,” said
Lewis Wan, Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Pride
Investments Group Ltd., which manages $300 million of assets.
“The news did not meet the market’s expectations.”  Hutchison Whampoa, the largest company controlled by Asia’s
richest man,  Li Ka-shing , slid 1.5 percent to HK$67.65 even
after reporting a net income of HK$10.2 billion ($1.3 billion),
exceeding a HK$9.55 billion median estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates a port in Greece, fell
3.1 percent to HK$10.48. China Cosco Holdings Co., the nation’s
biggest listed shipping company, fell 1.6 percent to HK$3.18.  U.S. Jobs  Li & Fung dropped 2.9 percent to HK$14.62 ahead of the
release of a U.S. report expected to show the jobless rate
remained at 8.2 percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The  unemployment rate  has been above 8 percent since
February 2009.  Man Wah Holdings Ltd. (1999) , a sofa maker that gets more than
half of its revenue from the U.S., fell 0.7 percent to HK$2.87.

 North America  for 72 percent of its sales, lost 1.7 percent to
HK$10.16.  China Yurun gained 8.7 percent to HK$5.99, extending
yesterday’s gains after billionaire  Robert Kuok ’s Kerry Group
Ltd. disclosed it owns a stake in the nation’s second-largest
meat supplier.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index retreated 0.9 percent to
19,454. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slid 6.7 percent to 19.77,
