Prices for Russian steel exports will
rise closer to U.S. levels and remain strong through October as
the Ramadan holiday ends in August, boosting demand from  Muslim
countries  for construction materials,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said.  Russian export prices of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel
product, are at about a $45-a-metric-ton discount to the U.S.,
compared with a typical average level of $30 a ton, Dmitriy Kolomytsyn, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said today in a note.  Low stockpiles and imports, summer smelter repairs, growing
lead times and limited U.S. supply are inflating prices, he
said, citing data from OAO Severstal,  Russia â€™s second-largest
steelmaker. The price of Russian hot-rolled coil exports from
the Black and Baltic seas stands at $555 a ton, close to the
lowest in two years,  data  compiled by Metal Bulletin shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
