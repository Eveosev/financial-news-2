Shoe Mania LLC creditors with a total
of $3.4 million in claims filed court papers seeking to force
the Manhattan retailer into bankruptcy.  Clarks Cos., Cole Haan, New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc.,
Puma North America Inc., Earth Inc., VF Outdoor Inc., Mephisto
Inc., Allrounder Inc., Skechers USA and Converse Inc. filed the
involuntary Chapter 7 petition today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan.  Shoe Mania has failed “to pay its debts owed to the
petitioning creditors as such debts became due,” Lawrence
Gottlieb, an attorney for the creditors, said in court papers.  Bank Leumi USA sued Shoe Mania on July 24 in  New York  state
 Supreme Court  alleging the company shut all three of its
Manhattan stores earlier that month and moved the inventory
without notifying the lender.  In today’s filing, the Shoe Mania creditors asked the
bankruptcy court to appoint an interim trustee “to preserve the
property of the estates or to prevent loss to the estates.”
They also filed petitions to force Shoe Mania Holding Inc. and
Shoe Mania V LLC into bankruptcy. Puma is listed as the largest
creditor, with a claim of $1.2 million.  The Chapter 7 case is In re Shoe Mania Holding Inc.,
12-13323, U.S.  Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The Bank Leumi case is Bank Leumi USA v. Shoe Mania
Holding Inc., 652551/2012, New York Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
