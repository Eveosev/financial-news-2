The  U.S. Senate  confirmed Mark Mazur
as the top tax policy official in the Treasury Department,
marking the first time the post will be filled by a permanent
appointee since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.  Mazur, a 56-year-old economist, will become assistant
secretary for tax policy after today’s voice vote in Washington.
The position has been filled by temporary and acting officials
since Obama became president.  Obama’s first nominee, Elizabeth Garrett, withdrew in 2009,
citing family concerns. His second candidate, Michael Mundaca,
left the administration last year without being confirmed.  Mazur’s confirmation comes as lawmakers in both parties
debate the extension of expiring tax cuts and the prospects for
an overhaul of the tax code next year.  Mazur, nominated in November 2011, worked in the White
House and the Energy Department during President  Bill Clinton ’s
administration and has been at Treasury since 2009. From 2001 to
2009, led the research and analysis division of the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Senate also confirmed  Matthew Rutherford  to be the
Treasury’s assistant secretary for financial markets.
Rutherford, who has been deputy assistant secretary for federal
finance, was nominated in September. He will replace  Mary Miller , who was confirmed as undersecretary for domestic finance
in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
