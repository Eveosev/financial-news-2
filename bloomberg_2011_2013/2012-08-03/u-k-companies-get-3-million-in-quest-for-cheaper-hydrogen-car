ITM Power Plc (ITM) , a hydrogen energy
system maker, and low-cost fuel-cell developer ACAL Energy Ltd.
will get 1.95 million pounds ($3 million) from the U.K.’s Carbon
Trust to build cheaper hydrogen-powered vehicle engines.  The funding brings the Carbon Trust’s total investment in
the two companies to 3.6 million pounds, a statement from the
London-based not-for-dividend green investor shows.  Hydrogen cars currently under development are prohibitively
expensive to run, at around $50 a kilowatt, according to Carbon
Trust estimates. To compete with traditional engines, costs need
to fall below $37 a kilowatt, it said.  ACAL Energy, based in Runcorn,  England , has the ability to
make a fuel cell which operates for $35 a kilowatt, while
Sheffield, England-based ITM Power can reduce the size and
weight of cells without decreasing power, the Carbon Trust said
in its July 31 statement.  The global hydrogen vehicle industry could be worth 180
billion pounds by 2050, the Trust said, with the first mass-
produced cars appearing in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
