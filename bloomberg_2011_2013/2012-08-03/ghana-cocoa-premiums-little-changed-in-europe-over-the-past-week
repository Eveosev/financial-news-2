The premium paid in  Europe  for cocoa
from Ghana, the world’s second-largest grower, was little
changed over the past week, according to three traders with
direct knowledge of the sales.  Ghanaian beans in the European market cost 90 pounds ($140)
to 100 pounds a metric ton more than futures on NYSE Liffe in
London, according to the traders who declined to be identified
because they’re not authorized to speak to the media. The
premium was 90 pounds to 110 pounds last week.  Ghana may have already sold 425,000 to 500,000 tons of
beans from the 2012-13 crop that starts in October, Drew Geraghty, a broker at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New
Jersey , said in a report on Aug. 1. The crop in 2011-12 was an
estimated 890,000 tons, according to the London-based
International Cocoa Organization.  Beans from top producer  Ivory Coast  were at a premium of
60 pounds a ton above the NYSE Liffe price, said the traders.
That compares with 60 pounds to 65 pounds a ton last week.  Cocoa for December delivery settled unchanged at 1,630
pounds a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
