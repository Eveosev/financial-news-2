On July 2, 1881, Charles Guiteau shot
President James Garfield from behind. The first bullet sliced
through his arm, while the second ripped into his back. Garfield
died on Sept. 19.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  A classic ne’er-do-well, the jailed Guiteau was thrilled by
the surrounding media circus. He gave long interviews to
journalists and posed for photographs, making sure they were
flattering.  Convinced he’d soon be out on bail and looking to
capitalize on his new-found fame, Guiteau planned to go on a
lecture tour and earn tens of thousands of dollars. He also
wanted to auction off the suit he’d been wearing on the day of
the shooting.  Sending his autobiography to the  New York  Herald, he added
a note saying he wished to marry an “elegant Christian lady of
wealth, under thirty, belonging to a first-class family.” All
suitable candidates should get in touch with him.  He was hanged on June 30, 1882.  I spoke with Candice Millard, author of “Destiny of the
Republic,” on the following topics:  1. White House Stalker  2. President Shot  3. Incompetent Doctors  4. Nation’s Grief and Rage  5. Jailhouse Celebrity  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
