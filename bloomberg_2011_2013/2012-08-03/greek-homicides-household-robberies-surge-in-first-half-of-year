Household robberies, homicides and
sexual assaults in  Greece  surged in the first half of the year,
national police reported. Bank robberies fell.  Home holdups rose 52 percent to 604 and house robberies and
break-ins climbed 12 percent to 13,832. Sexual assaults
increased 62 percent to 306, and vehicle thefts rose 2 percent
to 14,851, according to statistics on the  website  of the Greek
police.  Greece’s Public Order Minister Nikolas Dendias announced an
 increase  of 1,500 officers, 100 vehicles and 60 motorcycles on
July 30 to combat neighborhood crime, reducing the number of
police assigned to guard politicians.  Greece is in the fifth year of a recession that’s been
worsened by measures to narrow a  budget deficit  at more than
five times the euro area’s limit in 2009. Unemployment in the
first quarter rose to a record 22.6 percent.  Police arrested 44,602 people for illegally entering the
country or residing in Greece without authorization in the first
half, up from 38,061 a year earlier, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
