Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open at 0.14 percent to 0.18
percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.15 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.27 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will sell Treasuries maturing from January
2013 to June 2013. The sales are part of the Fed’s program to
replace $267 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The central bank plans to sell from $7 billion to $8
billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  will begin today a
series of ”small-value” repurchase agreements with its primary
dealers as part of its “operational readiness program,”
according to a  statement  posted on its website yesterday. The
operations don’t represent any change in Fed monetary policy and
are part of the central bank’s efforts to test its readiness to
conduct temporary open market operations in the future. The  New
York  Fed hasn’t conducted repos since Dec 30, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
