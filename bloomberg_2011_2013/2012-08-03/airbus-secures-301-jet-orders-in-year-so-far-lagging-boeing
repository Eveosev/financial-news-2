Airbus SAS secured orders for 301
passenger jets so far this year, less than half of rival  Boeing
Co. (BA) ’s tally and leaving the European planemaker at the mid-point
of its minimum 2012 target.  Airlines and leasing companies booked 48 orders in July,
the company said today in a statement. Airbus lost orders for
eight planes through cancellations, bringing the year-to-date
tally to 31. Boeing, which lagged last year, has 736 gross
orders, and 36 cancellations so far.  Airbus, which is targeting 600 to 650 orders in 2012, is
coming off a record year after introducing the A320neo, a re-
engined version of its best-selling airliner. The Toulouse-based
aircraft maker had 922 gross orders at the same point last year
as it went on to book an industry record. Since then, Boeing has
responded with the 737 Max to close the order gap with its
European competitor.  Higher production rates on A320 narrowbodies helped drive
Airbus deliveries through July to 326 aircraft from 298. Boeing
has delivered 332 aircraft in the first seven months.  Airbus has said it may fall short of its target of 30 new
A380 orders this year, having booked four so far.  Airbus says Libyan airline Afriqiyah Airways ordered three
A330-200 on July 13. The airline previously had ordered three
A321s, which are no longer listed on the aircraft maker’s
orderbook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
