Canadian realtors recorded lower
sales in July from a year earlier, regional data suggest, led by
a plunging housing market in  Vancouver .  The value of purchases at seven major regional real estate
boards that have reported figures for July fell 3.4 percent from
the same month in 2011 to C$7.75 billion ($7.76 billion),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Sales in Vancouver
were down 28 percent.  The  Canadian Real Estate Association  publishes aggregated
national data in the middle of every month.
