HVB Group (HVB) ,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s German
banking unit, said second-quarter profit dropped 72 percent amid
a “difficult” market environment.  Net income fell to 182 million euros ($223.5 million) from
639 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today. Pretax earnings declined to 436
million euros from 925 million euros.  HVB Chief Executive Officer Theodor Weimer said in a
conference call with reporters that the second quarter was
generally difficult for banks and that it has been
“historically” a weaker quarter for the German lender.  The bank still expects 2012 pretax earnings to be higher
than the previous year, the CEO said. The company won’t exceed
2011’s results “significantly” as “clients are cautious at
all levels, IPOs are failing and credit demand remains low,” he
said.  UniCredit rose as much as 8 percent to 2.78 euros in Milan
today and was up 4.3 percent at 2:51 p.m. The Italian bank’s
Polish unit  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  earlier today posted second-quarter
profit that fell less than analysts estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
