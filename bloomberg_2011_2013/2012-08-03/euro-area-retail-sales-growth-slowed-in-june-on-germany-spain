European  retail sales  growth slowed
in June, led by decreasing demand from Ireland to  Spain  and
 Germany , adding to signs of the euro-region fiscal crisis
undermining household spending.  Sales gained 0.1 from May, when they rose 0.8 percent, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists forecast a drop of 0.1 percent, according to the
median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. From a year
earlier,  sales  dropped 1.2 percent.  European consumers may keep spending plans on hold as
governments toughen austerity measures and some of the region’s
largest companies including Deutsche Bank AG and PSA Peugeot
Citroen eliminate jobs. Euro-area unemployment held at a record
high in June and economic confidence dropped last month, adding
to signs the economy is edging toward recession. A gauge of
 service industries  showed a contraction in July.  In  France , the euro area’s second-largest economy after
Germany, retail sales rose 0.7 percent from May, when they
increased 2.1 percent, today’s report showed. German sales fell
0.1 percent in the month. Ireland and Spain, which both received
external aid, reported drops of 2.2 percent and 0.1 percent from
May, respectively.  The statistics office didn’t report data for Greece, Cyprus
or Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
