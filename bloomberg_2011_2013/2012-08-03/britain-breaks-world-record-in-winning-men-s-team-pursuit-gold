Britain won gold in the men’s 4,000-
meter team pursuit, breaking its own world record while beating
 Australia  in the final.  The British quartet of Edward Clancy, 27; Geraint Thomas,
26; Steven Burke, 24, and Peter Kennaugh, 23, crossed the line
in 3 minutes, 51.659 seconds at the Velodrome in London today.
Australia got silver and  New Zealand  got bronze.  “I never felt under pressure from the Aussies, we were so
comfortable,” Kennaugh said after the medal ceremony. “They
were at the limit and we were comfortable.”  The Britons, who are the defending Olympic and world
champions, did a lap of honor in front of a crowd that included
Bradley Wiggins, the first Briton to win the Tour de  France .  The previous record of 3:52.499 was set by Britain
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
