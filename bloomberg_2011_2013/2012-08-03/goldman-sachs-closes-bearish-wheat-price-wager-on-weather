Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said it’s
closing a bearish wager on wheat prices because of worsening
weather conditions for crops in the former  Soviet Union ,
 Australia ,  India  and  Argentina .  Goldman Sachs had been short wheat for delivery in May 2013
versus corn on the Chicago Board of Trade, New York-based
analyst Damien Courvalin said today in an e-mailed report. The
price difference closed at about 72 cents a bushel yesterday,
allowing for a gain of almost 50 cents a bushel after the bank
entered its bearish wager when the spread was at $1.21,
according to the report.  Wheat production in the former Soviet Union, Australia,
India and Argentina may be 15 million metric tons below the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s forecast in July because of dry
weather, creating “growing upside risks to wheat prices in
coming months,” Courvalin said. The USDA is slated to update
its global crop estimates Aug. 10.  Still, global wheat inventories are likely to remain more
ample than corn, meaning wheat may underperform in the next 12
months, Courvalin said. Both grains are used in livestock feed.
Corn prices have surged 59 percent since mid-June as the worst
drought since 1956 damaged crops in the U.S., while wheat rose
41 percent and soybeans rallied 24 percent in the same period.  The bank said it’s bullish soybeans for November delivery
versus a bearish wager for December corn, as soybeans are likely
“to reverse part of their recent underperformance to corn,”
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
