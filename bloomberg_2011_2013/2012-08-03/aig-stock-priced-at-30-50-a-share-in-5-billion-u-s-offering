American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
shares were priced at $30.50, below yesterday’s closing value on
the New York Stock Exchange, as the U.S. cut its stake in the
Treasury Department’s fourth offering of the company’s stock.  The U.S. raised $5 billion, with New York-based AIG buying
$3 billion of the stock, the department said in a statement
yesterday. AIG closed at $31.34 in New York trading.  The sale cuts the government stake to 55 percent from 61
percent. Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche has been
repurchasing stock to help the company regain independence and
increase the value of remaining shares. AIG has raised funds for
repurchases by divesting assets including part of its stake in
Hong Kong-based insurer  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)   “AIG is doing a commendable job of rapidly winding down
the Treasury’s overhang,”  Meyer Shields , an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a research note.  The first two  offerings  were priced at $29 a share, and the
third at $30.50. The government needs to average about $28.72
over all share sales to break even on its investment, which was
part of a 2008 bailout that swelled to $182.3 billion.  Bank of America Corp.,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS) , UBS
AG and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  led the offering, according to the
statement. Underwriters have a 30-day option to buy as much as
$750 million more in AIG stock, the department said.  U.S. Investment  Including yesterday’s offering, the U.S. has raised more
than $22 billion in AIG share sales, reducing the government’s
outstanding investment to about $25 billion. The U.S.  holding 
was cut from 92 percent in the prior three sales, the first of
which was in May of 2011.  Book value , a measure of assets minus liabilities, climbed
to $60.58 a share as of June 30 from $57.68 on March 31, the
company said on Aug. 2 when it posted its third-straight
 quarterly profit . Buybacks contributed $1.03 a share to the
increase in book value, Chief Financial Officer David Herzog
said on a conference call yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
