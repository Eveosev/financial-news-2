U.S. Gulf Coast crudes weakened as
the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent oil
narrowed the first time in eight days.  The difference between the grades narrowed $1.23 to $17.54
a barrel based on September settlement prices. When Brent rises
at a slower pace than WTI, as it did today, that typically
weakens the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign oils
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
narrowed 65 cents to $17.35 a barrel at 4:02 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
decreased $1.10 to $17.90.  Poseidon’s premium lost 65 cents to $12.80, while Southern
Green Canyon decreased $1 to $11.25 a barrel over WTI. Mars
Blend’s premium weakened 65 cents to $13.35.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
gained 25 cents to $16.75.  Syncrude strengthened $1.25 to parity with WTI. Syncrude is
a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $1.25 a barrel to
$18.75 below WTI. Bakken oil’s discount weakened 50 cents to
$4.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
