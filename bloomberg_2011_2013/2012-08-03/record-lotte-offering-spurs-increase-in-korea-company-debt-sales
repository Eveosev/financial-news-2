Offerings of won-denominated bonds in
 South Korea  rose this week after  Lotte Shopping Co. (023530)  priced a
record 780 billion won ($687 million) of notes to fund its
acquisition of home-appliance retailer Himart Co.  Lotte’s sale was the biggest on record for the department
store operator, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung
Techwin Co. also offered notes, driving total issuance to 980
billion won, a 27 percent increase from last week, the data
show. Yields on AA- rated three-year notes, the benchmark
according to the  Korea  Financial Investment Association, fell 10
basis points this week to 3.35 percent today, the lowest in data
going back to 2000.  Interest rates  on AA rated  U.S. debt  were
2.10 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  South Korean corporate yields declined to a record on
expectations of further easing after the central bank’s surprise
interest-rate reduction on July 12. HSBC Holdings Plc and
Citigroup Inc. forecast the 3 percent rate will be lowered again
this year as  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy grew at the slowest
pace in almost three years last quarter.  “Since the benchmark rate cut by the central bank,
investors have been in more of a buying mode compared with about
a month ago, spurred by expectations of one more potential
cut,” Lim Jungmin, a credit analyst with Woori Investment &
Securities Co., the biggest arranger, said Aug. 1. “Demand for
corporate bonds is definitely higher now than in June.”  Offerings rose from 770 billion won last week, according to
the data. No companies are planning sales next week, preliminary
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lotte Shopping  Lotte Shopping sold bonds due in 2015, 2017 and 2019,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s three-
year notes were priced to yield 3.05 percent, compared with the
4.44 percent it paid on 200 billion won of securities with the
same tenor in March 2010, the data show. Those securities traded
at a yield of 2.87 percent yesterday, according to Korea’s NICE
Pricing Service.  It’s cheaper for Lotte Shopping to finance through bond
sales than bank loans, spokesman Kim Kun Soo said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg News. The retailer decided
on the size and timing of the sale based on its funding needs
and the current condition of financial markets, he said.  More than half the proceeds will be used to fund its 1.25
trillion won acquisition of  Himart (071840) , its largest takeover in more
than two years, according to a regulatory filing on Aug. 1.
Seoul-based Lotte Shopping also sold 230 billion won of five-
year debt priced to yield 3.32 percent, and 200 billion won of
seven-year bonds at a yield of 3.43 percent, the data show.  Government Bonds  Elsewhere in Korea’s financial markets, benchmark three-
year sovereign bonds headed for a fifth weekly gain, as
expectations of another reduction in the Bank of Korea’s key
rate drove down yields. Policy makers meet again on Aug. 9.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent government notes
due June 2015 slid two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 2.77 percent as of 1:31 p.m. in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show.  The won strengthened 0.2 percent this week to 1,135.45
against the dollar on expectations central banks globally may
provide further monetary stimulus, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,125.20 on Aug. 1, the highest
level since April 3.  The average yield premium on three-year corporate debt
compared with  government bonds  held at 59 basis points today,
near the lowest level this year, according to data from the
financial association.  Samsung Techwin, a maker of imaging products and aircraft
engines, sold 200 billion won of three-year bonds priced to
yield 3.18 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
offering was its first in nine months, the data show.  The company will use the proceeds to repay 150 billion won
of debt due in December, with the remainder for working capital,
according to Seoul-based spokesman Jun Yong Han.  “The low rates allowed us to raise a bit more than what we
needed for the debt repayment to increase our liquidity,” Jun
said by telephone on Aug. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
