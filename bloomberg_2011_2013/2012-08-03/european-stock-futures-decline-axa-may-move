European stocks  advanced to a four-
month high, rebounding from yesterday’s biggest slide in more
than a week, as a report showed the U.S. economy added more jobs
in July than forecast.  Allianz SE (ALV)  and  Axa SA (CS)  gained 5.7 percent and 5.1 percent,
respectively, after Europe’s biggest insurers reported profit
that beat analysts’ estimates. Banks rose as  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) 
and Natixis SA posted better-than-projected quarterly earnings.
 Siemens AG (SIE)  gained 6.2 percent after Europe’s largest engineering
company said it will repurchase as much as 3 billion euros ($3.7
billion) in stock by the end of the year.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  climbed 2.4 percent to 265.58 at
the close in London, its highest level since April 2. The gauge
climbed 2.2 percent this week, even though the  European Central
Bank  and the  Federal Reserve  failed to deliver immediate
measures to stimulate the slowing global economy. The equity
benchmark completed its ninth week of gains, the longest stretch
since January 2006.  “It may well have been a win-win situation, where a lower
number would’ve signaled potential Fed easing and the beat
signaling that the  U.S. economy  isn’t in such a bad state as
some believe,” said Serge Berger, a Zurich-based trader at Blue
Oak Advisors LLC. “It’s possible investors are waiting for next
week to make decisions based on the numbers. But still, a beat
by 60,000 is better than a miss by 60,000.”  In the U.S., the Labor Department report showed that
American employers added 163,000 workers last month. That
exceeded the 100,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Monthly jobs growth had slowed to an average of
75,000 in the quarter through June from 226,000 in the previous
three months. The  unemployment rate  climbed to 8.3 percent in
July, the release said.  National Benchmarks  National benchmark indexes gained in every western-European
market except in Iceland. France’s CAC 40 advanced 4.4 percent
and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 increased 2.2 percent. Germany’s DAX
rose 3.9 percent. Italy’s FTSE MIB and Spain’s IBEX 35 jumped
6.3 percent and 6 percent, respectively.  The Stoxx 600 declined 1.3 percent yesterday after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  failed to reassure investors
that he will do everything to preserve the euro.  Draghi yesterday announced that the ECB has a plan to re-
enter bond markets and said new purchases in the secondary
market would only complement buying by the European Union’s
rescue fund in the primary market, to which strict
conditionality is attached.  Allianz, Axa  Allianz rose 5.7 percent to 83.07 euros as second-quarter
profit climbed more than analysts had predicted after earnings
increased at its life and health business.  Net income  of 1.23
billion euros topped the 1.15 billion-euro  average estimate of
13 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Axa climbed 5.1 percent to 10.19 euros as first-half
operating profit, which excludes  capital gains , one-off charges
and asset-valuation swings, rose to 2.3 billion euros, helped by
rising revenue from health and property-and-casualty insurance.
That exceeded the 2.15 billion-euro  average estimate .  Intesa Sanpaolo surged 13 percent to 1.06 euros after
Italy’s second-biggest bank posted second-quarter net income of
470 million euros. That beat the average analyst estimate of 323
million euros.  Natixis Rallies  Natixis (KN)  jumped 8.8 percent to 2.06 euros. The investment-
banking and asset-management unit of Groupe BPCE reported
second-quarter net income of 394 million euros, exceeding the
347 million-euro average estimate of five analysts.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,  France’s largest
lenders , soared 8.7 percent to 32 euros and 10 percent to 18.53
euros, respectively. A gauge of European banks contributed the
most to the Stoxx 600’s advance.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  rose 8.7
percent to 25.23 euros.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s biggest lender,
rallied 8.4 percent to 2.79 euros.  Siemens climbed 6.2 percent to 72.55 euros, its biggest
gain in more than two years, after the company said it will
repurchase equities and cancel 33 million shares held in
treasury. Siemens said it will use the buybacks to reduce
capital stock, to issue shares to employees and board members
and to back convertible bonds and warrants.  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT)  rallied 11 percent to 537 pence, its biggest
gain since May 2009. The company posted second-quarter sales of
$329 million, beating the $310 million  average estimate  of three
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  slid 5.2
percent to 151 pence after reporting a second-quarter operating
loss of 42 million euros, wider than the 35.6 million-euro
analyst estimate.  Givaudan SA (GIVN)  plunged 3.6 percent to 920 Swiss francs, its
biggest decline in almost a year, as first-half earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 428 million
francs ($441 million) missed the average analyst estimate of
451.7 million francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
