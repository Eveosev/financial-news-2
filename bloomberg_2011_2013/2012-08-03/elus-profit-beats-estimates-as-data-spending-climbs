Telus Corp. (T) ,  Canada ’s third-largest
wireless carrier, reported second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as customer spending on smartphone data
surged. The company raised its forecast for annual revenue.  Excluding one-time charges, profit per share was C$1.02,
the Vancouver-based company said today in a statement. The
average estimate from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was C$1.
Sales rose 4.3 percent to C$2.67 billion ($2.66 billion),
matching the average estimate.  The company forecast annual revenue of C$11.2 billion to
C$11.5 billion, up from C$10.7 billion to C$11 billion
previously.  Chief Executive Officer Darren Entwistle is ploughing
profits back into its improving its network, betting faster data
speeds will lure subscribers away from larger rivals  Rogers
Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  and  BCE Inc. (BCE)  Telus’ strategy stands in
contrast to Rogers and BCE, Canada’s number one and two wireless
operators respectively, who together have spent more than C$6
billion buying up programming and sports teams including the
Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors they can repackage and
sell to subscribers.  Telus last quarter added 86,000 net new mobile customers,
8.5 percent lower than a year ago. Postpaid subscribers rose 22
percent to 112,000.  Rogers Earnings  Toronto-based Rogers gained 87,000 subscribers and reported
profit that beat estimates as job cuts and other cost savings
more than offset a slowdown in consumer wireless spending.  BCE, set to report results Aug. 8, may have added 95,000
contract subscribers, according to estimates from Maher Yaghi,
an analyst at Desjardins Securities.  Telus said wireless data revenue growth grew 27 percent to
C$512 million and its wireless average revenue per unit rose 2.4
percent to $60.29 per customer. Yaghi predicted C$58.87.  Telus’ net income climbed 1.2 percent to C$328 million, or
C$1.01 cents a share, from C$324 million or 99 cents a year
earlier.  Telus slipped 0.5 percent to C$62.39 yesterday in Toronto.  To contact the reporters on this story:
