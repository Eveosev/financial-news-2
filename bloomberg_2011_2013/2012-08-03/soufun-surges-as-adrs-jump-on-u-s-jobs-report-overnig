Chinese stocks traded in  New York 
rose, sending the benchmark index to its biggest gain in a week,
after a surge in U.S. payrolls boosted the outlook for exporters
in the world’s second-largest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. jumped 2 percent to 87.40,
snapping a four-day retreat yesterday in New York.  SouFun
Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)  added the most in two months after the company
said China’s new home prices rose in June.  Yanzhou Coal Mining
Co. (YZC)  rose to a six-week high. Online travel agency  Ctrip.com
International Ltd. (CTRP)  advanced while competitor  elong Inc. (LONG)  tumbled
the most in a year.  U.S. Labor Department figures yesterday showed payrolls
increased 163,000 in July, exceeding the 100,000 median estimate
of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Members of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition parties signaled they won’t
stand in the way of European Central Bank chief  Mario Draghi ’s
plan to buy government bonds.  “What’s driving markets today is the encouraging job data
in the U.S. and continued hope in Europe that they’ll still buy
bonds to save Spain and Italy,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at
Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which manages $700 million, said
yesterday by phone from Lisle, Illinois. “A better global
economy will help risk assets like Chinese equities.”  The Bloomberg gauge of Chinese stocks declined 0.8 percent
this week. The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest
Chinese exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 2.5 percent
yesterday to a six-week high of $34.80. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index of the biggest U.S. shares added 1.9 percent to
1,390.99 after falling in the previous four days. The measure
gained 0.4 percent in its fourth weekly increase.  Home Prices  Beijing-based Soufun, owner of  China ’s largest real estate
information website, surged 9 percent to $12.68, the biggest
gain since May 29.  China’s new home prices last month rose 0.3 percent from
June, signaling a “turning point” for the nation’s property
market, SouFun said in a statement Aug. 1, based on its survey
of 100 cities. That was the second monthly gain and the biggest
rise since June 2011.  American depositary receipts of Yanzhou Coal, China’s
fourth-biggest producer of the fuel, jumped 6.3 percent to
$16.32, the highest level since June 20. The ADRs traded 2.4
percent  above  its Hong Kong stock, the widest premium in a week.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., the world’s sixth-largest
silicon-based solar module producer, rallied 8.4 percent to
$1.68, the biggest advance since June 15. The gain trimmed its
weekly loss to 18 percent, its fourth weekly decline.  Shanghai-based Ctrip.com, China’s largest online travel
agency, climbed 3.8 percent yesterday to a one-week high of
$12.97. The company has slid for eight consecutive weeks, the
longest losing streak since its initial public offering in 2003.  Elong, Ctrip’s Beijing-based rival, sank 9.5 percent
yesterday to $12.35, the biggest tumble in a year. The decline
cut its increase this week to 1.5 percent. The company is  due to
report  second-quarter figures on Aug. 20 after U.S. market
close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
