A U.S. antitrust settlement with e-
book publishers Simon & Schuster, Hachette Book Group and
HarperCollins should be approved by a judge, lawyers for the
federal government said in a court filing.  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Simon & Schuster,  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s HarperCollins
and Lagardère SCA’s Hachette Book Group previously agreed to
settle a U.S. lawsuit alleging e-book price-fixing. Lawyers for
the government today filed papers in Manhattan asking U.S.
District Judge Denise Cote to sign off on the accord.  “Prompt entry of the proposed final judgment will benefit
consumers,” lawyers with the  Justice Department ’s antitrust
division said.  Under the settlement, the three companies agreed to cancel
contracts with electronic-book sellers that allowed publishers
to set prices. Claims by the U.S., 15 states and Puerto Rico are
pending against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and other companies.  The case is U.S. v. Apple, 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
