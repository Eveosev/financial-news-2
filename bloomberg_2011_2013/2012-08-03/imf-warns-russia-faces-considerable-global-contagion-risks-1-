Russia faces “considerable” risks
of spillover from global economic difficulties even as reduced
vulnerabilities will help it avert a downturn similar to 2009,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  There’s “much less room for fiscal response to adverse
developments than there was in 2008,” with the country’s budget
still “heavily dependent” on oil revenue, Odd Per Brekk, the
Washington-based lender’s senior representative in Moscow, told
reporters in the Russian capital today.  The main channel of contagion would be via oil prices,
while strains in the euro area may spur more capital flight and
squeeze financing for Russian companies, he said. Russia’s
economy, forecast by the IMF to grow 4 percent in 2012 and 2013,
contracted 7.8 percent in 2009 after the credit squeeze and
global slowdown that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. The downturn crimped demand for commodities,
sending Urals,  Russia ’s chief export oil blend, to as low as
$32.34 a barrel on Dec. 24, 2008. The decline was a 77 percent
drop from a high of $142.50 in July that year.  In a worst-case scenario following  Greece ’s exit from the
euro area, Russia’s economy would contract 2.1 percent with the
potential for $95 billion in capital leaving the country in a
year,  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , the country’s biggest lender, said in May.  ‘Less Vulnerable’  “Russia is less vulnerable on balance than it was in
2008-2009,” Brekk said. “We would not expect from -- a similar
shock -- a contraction like we had previously.”  Even so, in the case of a sharp decline in  oil prices , the
government would have to seek borrowing in an “uncertain
international environment” because it has “much less cash in
reserve” than four years ago, he said.  Russia deployed the largest stimulus package among Group of
20 nations, totaling 9.8 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010,
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  estimates.  The central bank’s international currency and gold reserves
shrank for a fourth time in five weeks in the seven days ended
July 27 to $505.5 billion, bringing the stockpile more than $92
billion below its peak in August 2008. Assets in Russia’s
Reserve Fund amount to about 3 percent of gross domestic
product, almost two-thirds less as a percentage of economic
output than the rainy-day fund held in 2008.  Russia’s non-oil deficit, which excludes revenue and
expenses related to the oil and gas industry, is at 10 percent
of GDP and without any prospect for improvement under current
plans, according to the IMF.  Russia, which relies on oil and gas exports for half of its
budget revenue, also faces a widening pension-system deficit,
forecast to double from 8 percent of GDP to 16 percent of GDP by
2050, the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
