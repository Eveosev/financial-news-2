in New York, led by oil futures.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26 prices advanced 1.7
percent to 1,555.76.  CRUDE OIL  Oil surged the most in a month after U.S. payrolls climbed
more than estimated and service industries expanded at a faster
pace, bolstering optimism about economic strength in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming country.  Payrolls gained 163,000 in July, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s non-manufacturing index unexpectedly rose.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures for

planned at seven lots of 600,000 barrels each, one more than

signaled reduced demand from  power plants .  On the Nymex, gas futures for September delivery dropped
1.5 percent to $2.877 per million British thermal units. The

snapping a three-day decline, according to broker data compiled
by Bloomberg. September gas fell 0.3 percent to 54.15 pence a
therm. That’s equivalent to $8.47 per million British thermal
units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline and heating oil gained as U.S. payrolls rose more

investment appeal of commodities.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for September delivery
climbed 2.1 percent to $2.931 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for September delivery advanced 2.9
percent to $2.9261 a gallon.  BASE METALS  Copper futures rallied the most in three weeks after the

July, easing concern that slowing economic growth is eroding
demand for the metal.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for September
delivery climbed 2.3 percent to $3.3675 a pound, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since July 13.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three

month high.  On the Comex, gold futures for December delivery advanced

25.  Silver futures for September delivery jumped 3 percent to

the lightest Indian monsoon in three years may curb global
production already hurt by dry weather in the U.S.,  Russia  and

worsening U.S. drought is forcing farmers to sell more animals
for slaughter to limit losses on higher feed costs, boosting
pork supplies.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for October
settlement slumped 3 percent to 75.85 cents a pound, after
