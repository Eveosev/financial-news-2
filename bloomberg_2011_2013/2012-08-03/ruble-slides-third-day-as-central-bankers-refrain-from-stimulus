The ruble strengthened to its highest
in more than two weeks after oil, Russia’s chief export earner,
rallied after U.S. payrolls climbed more than economists
estimated.  The Russian currency appreciated 1.5 percent to 32.02 per
dollar by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its highest level since
July 19.  Crude oil rallied as much as 4.3 percent to $90.91 a barrel
in  New York . U.S. payrolls added 163,000 last month, beating the
100,000 increased predicted in a Bloomberg survey, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  “The ruble depends on oil, it’s supporting it,” Dmitry Mikhailov, who manages $130 million in assets at  Renaissance
Capital  in Moscow, said by phone.  The ruble gained 0.2 percent to 39.50 per euro and
strengthened 1 percent to 35.3635 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency
weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
32.6031 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 33.1600 per dollar yesterday.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday
declined to intervene in bond markets, while China’s central
bank said it will pursue “prudent” policy, and the  Federal
Reserve  a day earlier refrained from adding fresh stimulus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
