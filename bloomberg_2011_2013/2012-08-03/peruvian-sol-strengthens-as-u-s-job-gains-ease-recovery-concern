Peru’s sol climbed to a two-week high
after a report that showed the  U.S. economy  generated more jobs
than forecast in July eased concern that the world recovery is
faltering and boosted global markets.  The sol advanced 0.3 percent to 2.6210 per U.S. dollar
today, the strongest level since July 19. The currency rose 0.1
percent this week.  “It’s reacting to the strong rally we’ve seen in stock
markets around the world today,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head
trader at Banco Santander in Lima, in a phone interview from
Lima.  Global stocks jumped after U.S. payrolls increased 163,000
following a revised 64,000 gain in June, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The median estimate of 89
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain of 100,000.
The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  Index rallied 2.4 percent, while the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 1.9 percent.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the spot
market today. The last time the sol closed at this level, the
central bank purchased $164 million to stem gains against the
 U.S. dollar .  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.55 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.18 centimo to 121.74 centimos
