Xi’an, home of  China ’s terracotta
warriors, may limit vehicle ownership to control traffic
congestion, the latest city in the world’s largest auto market
to consider such restrictions.  The city government put out a draft plan that includes a
provision allowing it to “control the total volume of vehicles
and introduce restrictions on their use according to traffic
conditions,” according to its website. The proposal, for which
authorities are seeking public feedback until Aug. 15, is one of
88 regulations listed in the document that also covers parking
spaces, right of way rules and the use of bicycles.  Cities in China, home to 16 of the world’s 20 most polluted
cities according to the  World Bank , have resorted to limiting
sales as surging car ownership worsens congestion and pollution.
The number of cars in China may surpass 200 million by 2020, a
trend that will require intelligent traffic management, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported on July 31, citing the
Ministry of Transport.  If the plan is approved, Xi’an will join the cities of
Guangzhou, Guiyang, Beijing and  Shanghai  in restricting vehicle
ownership. The southern city of Guangzhou said on June 30 that
it would limit new car registrations to half of the previous
year’s total.  SAIC Motor Corp., the nation’s biggest carmaker, fell as
much as 6 percent in Shanghai and was trading 5.1 percent lower
at 12.23  yuan  as of 1:27 p.m. local time. China’s benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
