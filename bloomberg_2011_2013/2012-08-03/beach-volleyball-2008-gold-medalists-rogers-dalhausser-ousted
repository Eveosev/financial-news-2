Americans Todd Rogers and Phil
Dalhausser, the defending Olympic gold medalists in men’s beach
volleyball, lost in the Round of 16 at the London Games.  The U.S. pair fell to Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo of
Italy 21-17, 21-19 today at the Horse Guard Parade. After
rallying from five points down in the second set, the 2008 gold
medalists were eliminated when Nicolai blocked a Rogers spike.  “They played an A-plus game, we played an average, a C-
game,” Rogers said after the match. “I put it in perspective.
I have got a wife and a kid back home, that is so much more
important to me.”  Rogers, 38, said he would not compete in the 2016 Games in
Rio de Janeiro. He has played professionally with the 32-year-
old Dalhausser since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
