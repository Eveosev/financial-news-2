Oil options volatility fell to the
lowest level since June 19 as futures rose to a two-week high
after reports indicated strengthening in the U.S. labor market
and service industries.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.92 percent at 3:35 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 30.77 yesterday.  “The market is higher and we’re back over $90 so
volatility naturally comes off,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Rigolini said the 4.9 percent gain in futures and a weaker
dollar increased interest in buying calls and straddles, where a
buyer takes a put and a call at the same price, betting on a
large movement in either direction.  Crude oil for September delivery rose $4.27 to $91.40 a
barrel on the Nymex, the biggest gain since June 29.  “There’s some buying on protection or on a whim we could
get over $100 again,” Rigolini said.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $100 calls, which rose 14 cents to 21 cents a barrel
at 3:39 p.m. with 2,901 lots trading. September $80 puts were
the second-most active options, with 2,563 lots changing hands
as they declined 23 cents to 7 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 55 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Previous Session  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 57
percent of the 83,782 contracts traded.  September $100 calls were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 5,053 lots changing hands. They fell 7 cents to
7 cents a barrel. September $80 puts rose 8 cents to 30 cents on
