The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau is investigating  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  over
issues related to  mortgage insurance , the company said in an
Aug. 2 regulatory filing.  AIG said the CFPB issued a civil investigative demand, an
early step in a probe, in June. On July 24, the bureau suspended
the deadlines for complying with the demand “pending
discussions that could resolve the investigation,” AIG said.  State and federal regulators have in recent years examined
the propriety of payments between lenders and insurers for
policies covering mortgages, and whether they comply with the
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
