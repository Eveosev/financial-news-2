Viacom Inc., the television
programmer that owns cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy
Central, plans to unveil television viewing apps for tablets
before the end of the year.  “We are rolling out apps in partnership with several of
our distributors,” Chief Executive Officer  Philippe Dauman  told
analysts on Viacom’s quarterly earnings call today.  Viacom is working with pay-TV operators like Time Warner
Cable Inc. on tablet apps that will feature its library of
television programming. The company declined to specify which
channels would be available.  This would be Viacom’s first major step into a so-called TV
Everywhere approach, which lets viewers watch programming they
already pay for on multiple devices, such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.
 Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  was one of the first television programmers to
embrace this strategy, most notably with its HBO Go app. Viacom
already has distribution agreements with online streaming
providers such as  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)   While online viewing hasn’t hurt Viacom’s television
ratings, more people are watching on digital devices today,
Dauman said.  “We clearly have to be where consumers are, and we’re very
anxious to deliver content to our audiences wherever they are,”
he said.  Profit at Viacom, based in  New York , missed analysts’
estimates for the period that ended in June after advertising
sales dropped 9 percent, the most in more than three years. Net
income decreased 7 percent to $534 million, or $1.01 a share,
from $574 million, or 97 cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
