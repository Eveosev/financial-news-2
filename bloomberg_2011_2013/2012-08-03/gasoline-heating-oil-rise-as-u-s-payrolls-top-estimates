Gasoline and heating oil gained as
U.S. payrolls rose more than estimated in July and a sagging
dollar boosted the investment appeal of commodities.  Futures rose after payrolls climbed 163,000, more than the
100,000 median estimate of 89 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.
The dollar fell against the euro after members of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition signaled they won’t oppose
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s plan to buy
 government bonds  to ease the region’s debt crisis.  “It’s a combination of a better-than-expected employment
number and the statement from the ECB yesterday putting a nice
bid in the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Gasoline for September delivery advanced 6.14 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $2.931 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices rose 1.5 percent this week.  In another report today showing improvements in the
economy, the Institute for Supply Management’s  index  of U.S.
non-manufacturing businesses, covering about 90 percent of the
economy, rose to 52.6 in July from the prior month’s 52.1. The
median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
no change from June. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  The dollar fell 1.6 percent against the euro at 3:27 p.m.
in New York.  Futures also gained on the potential for Tropical Storm
 Ernesto  to become a Category 1 hurricane and disrupt oil
refining and production along the U.S.  Gulf Coast .  Ernesto Gains  Ernesto had top winds of 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour,
up from 45 mph earlier, the National Hurricane Center said in an
advisory at 11 a.m. New York time. The storm was 410 miles
southeast of San Juan,  Puerto Rico , and moving west at 21 mph.  The Gulf region is home to 29 percent of oil production and
40 percent of refining capacity, along with 6.5 percent of U.S.
natural gas output, according to the Energy Department. The
availability of gasoline supplies has already been threatened by
the shutdown of an  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  oil pipeline serving Midwest
refiners and unplanned production unit shutdowns from the Gulf
Coast to New York Harbor.  “There’s tropical disturbances popping up everywhere and
Ernesto could get into the  Gulf of Mexico ,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Add
to this refinery issues and the pipeline still shut and there’s
not a lot of reasons to be short this market right now.”  Heating oil for September delivery advanced 8.38 cents, or
2.9 percent, to settle at $2.9261 a gallon, the largest gain in
a month. Futures advanced 1.3 percent this week.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 3.3
cents to $3.567 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s the
highest price since June 4. Prices have fallen 9.4 percent from
a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4, according to AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
