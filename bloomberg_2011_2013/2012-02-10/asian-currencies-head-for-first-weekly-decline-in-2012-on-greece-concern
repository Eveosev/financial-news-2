Asian currencies had this year’s
first weekly loss after European leaders held back a bailout
package for  Greece , sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  fell 0.5 percent
this week, led by the Indian rupee’s biggest drop since December,
as data showed Chinese and Philippine exports shrank while
Malaysian shipments rose at the slowest pace in seven months.
Greece must pass its latest austerity package into law before
European leaders endorse 130 billion euros ($173 billion) of aid,
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said Feb. 9.  “Concern is growing the Greece problem won’t be resolved
easily, including whether the politicians can agree on the
austerity measures,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the
Japan Center for Economic Research in Tokyo. “It’s making
people risk-averse again and there are opportunities for taking
profits.”  The rupee fell 1.5 percent this week to 49.41 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ringgit
lost 0.9 percent to 3.0363,  Indonesia ’s rupiah depreciated 0.6
percent to 9,031 and South Korea’s won weakened 0.5 percent
lower at 1,123.73.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos pressed domestic
political leaders to yield to conditions for the bailout, saying
failure could pave the way for the country’s exit from the euro.
Euro-area leaders refused to approve a second rescue package Feb.
9 because the Greek government fell short of austerity demands,
he said.  Exports Slowdown  Malaysia’s ringgit snapped a five-week rally, retreating
from a five-month high, after a government report on Feb. 9
showed exports climbed  6.1 percent  in December, the slowest
since May. A central bank report on Feb. 15 may show economic
growth cooled to 4.8 percent in the final quarter of 2011 from
5.8 percent in the preceding three months, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The won declined the most in a month yesterday after the
central bank kept its seven-day repurchase rate at  3.25 percent 
on Feb. 9, unchanged for an eighth straight month, saying the
economy was in “a difficult situation.”  “Investors are refraining from selling the dollar as there
isn’t much momentum for the won to strengthen further,” said
Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Daegu Bank.  The rupiah fell for a second day yesterday.  Bank Indonesia 
unexpectedly cut its  reference rate  to 5.75 percent from 6
percent on Feb. 9, citing the need for stimulus to sustain
economic growth.  Record Yuan  The Philippine peso fell 0.7 percent yesterday to 42.49 per
dollar in Manila, reducing its weekly gain to 0.3 percent. A
government report yesterday showed overseas shipments contracted
20.7 percent in December, extending a slump since April.  China ’s yuan climbed 0.07 percent to 6.2986 for the week,
after touching an 18-year high of 6.2884 yesterday. The People’s
Bank of China fixed the reference rate at a record 6.2937 per
dollar, before Vice President Xi Jinping visits  Washington  next
week.  “They are trying to defuse criticism from Washington ahead
of Xi’s visit,” said  Brian Jackson , an emerging-market
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong . While the yuan
will appreciate this year, the pace may be restrained by weaker
external outlook, he said.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.1 percent this week to
NT$29.56 and the  Thai baht  was little changed at 30.85 versus
the U.S. currency. Vietnam’s dong climbed 0.5 percent to 20,868.  To contact the reporter on this story:
