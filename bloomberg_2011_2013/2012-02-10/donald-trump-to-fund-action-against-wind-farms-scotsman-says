Donald Trump  will fund an
international crusade against “monstrous” wind farm
developments around Scotland’s coast, the Scotsman reported,
citing a letter to First Minister Alex Salmond.  Trump said in January that he would scrap plans for a hotel
and housing at his golf resort in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, if
the government approves an offshore wind farm in sight of his
championship course due to open in June.  The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre, a venture
between Vattenfall AB,  Technip SA (TEC)  and Aberdeen Renewable Energy
Group, applied in August to build 11 next-generation offshore
wind turbines in Aberdeen Bay.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
