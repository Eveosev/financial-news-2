Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) , the
independent studio that bought the producer of the “Twilight”
movies, rose to the highest closing price in more than four
years after outlining post-purchase plans.  Lions Gate , based in Vancouver, gained 7.5 percent to
$11.84 at the close in  New York , the highest closing price since
June 2007. The company  purchased  Summit Entertainment, maker of
the “Twilight” series, in January.  The deal gave Lions Gate two teen franchises whose
popularity is reflected in book buying and, in the case of
“Twilight,” in box-office results to date. In March, the
studio releases the first of four planned movies from Suzanne
Collins’s best-selling “The Hunger Games” novels. In November,
Lions Gate will distribute the last “Twilight” film, part of a
series with $2.5 billion in  ticket sales.  “The deal brings together the two premier young-adult
franchises,” Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer said today
on a conference call. “We now have a strong pipeline of
franchise property.”  Lions Gate is also developing a film based on “Chaos
Walking,” a young-adult book series by Patrick Ness, and,
through the Summit deal, a picture called “Ender’s Game,”
based on the science-fiction novel by Orson Scott Card.  Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger, Summit’s co-chairmen,
have been named to comparable posts overseeing Lions Gate’s
motion picture group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
