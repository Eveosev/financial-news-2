LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , the
world’s largest maker of polypropylene plastic, dropped 3.5
percent after posting fourth-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates as refining margins weakened.  The company had a fourth-quarter net loss of $218 million,
or 38 cents, a share, compared with net income of $766 million,
or $1.34, a year earlier, Rotterdam-based LyondellBasell said
today in a statement. Excluding costs related to a refinery
closure and the early repayment of debt, the company said profit
was 41 cents a share. The average of 14 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for earnings of 80 cents.  “The downside was due mostly to weaker olefin and refining
margins,” Charles Neivert, a New York-based analyst at Dahlman
Rose & Co. who rate the shares “buy,” said in a note. “Shares
are likely to pull back having rallied over 35 percent year to
date.”  Sales advanced 7.9 percent to $11.4 billion from $10.6
billion, compared with the $12 billion average of 10 estimates.  LyondellBasell fell to $43 at 8:57 a.m. before the start of
regular trading in  New York .  (LyondellBasell will hold a conference call at 11 a.m, New
York time. Dial +1-888-982-4611, pass code 3987211.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
