Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. lender by assets, was told to turn over documents
to  Massachusetts ’s top securities regulator related to the
company’s involvement in collateralized loan obligations.  The inquiry focuses on two CLOs the  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based bank sold in 2007 that resulted in about $150
million in losses to investors, according to a statement today
from the state’s secretary of the commonwealth,  William Galvin .  “My securities division is investigating these CLOs to
determine if the issuer was knowingly over-valuing the assets in
the portfolio to get them off their books and onto investors,”
Galvin said in the statement. “What did the issuers know at the
time of the sales and were the assets being priced truthfully?”  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Bill Halldin , a Bank of America
spokesman, said the company would cooperate fully with the probe
and can’t comment further on regulatory inquiries.  Separately, Bank of America and four of the other biggest
mortgage servicers agreed yesterday to a $25 billion settlement
of state and federal probes into shoddy foreclosure practices.
The deal allowed regulators to pursue the industry over claims
regarding the packaging of loans into securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
