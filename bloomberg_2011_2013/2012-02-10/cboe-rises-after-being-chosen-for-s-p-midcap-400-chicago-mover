CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  gained the most
since September and bullish options trading on the stock rose to
an 11-month high after  Standard & Poor’s  added the operator of
the biggest U.S. options exchange to the S&P MidCap 400 Index.  CBOE shares climbed 6 percent, the most since Sept. 7, to
$28.07 today. The Chicago-based company is up 8.6 percent  in
2012 . More than 11,000 calls to buy the shares changed hands,
5.3 times the four-week average daily  volume  and 3.2 times the
number of puts to sell. February $28 calls were  most-active .  The oldest U.S. options exchange will replace Temple-Inland
Inc., which International Paper Co. is buying, in the  S&P MidCap
400 (MID)  on a date to be announced, S&P said in a statement
yesterday. Funds such as the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF Trust,
which has $10.7 billion in market value, will have to acquire
CBOE stock to keep tracking its performance.  The exchange operator reported fourth-quarter profit
yesterday that exceeded analysts’ projections as higher-margin
contracts accounted for a larger share of trading. Earnings
excluding some items were 37 cents a share, exceeding the 35-
cent  average estimate  of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Edward Ditmire , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., raised
his 2012 profit  forecast  for CBOE by 5.1 percent to $1.84 a
share today.  “Whether it’s from the index news or the earnings report,
estimates are probably headed a little higher,” New York-based
Ditmire said in a telephone interview today. “Most of the items
they gave were constructive for the outlook.”  U.S. trading of equity derivatives linked to stocks,
indexes and exchange-traded funds rose to 4.6 billion contracts
last year for a ninth-straight annual record. CBOE’s two
exchanges handled 27 percent of U.S. options trades last month,
the largest share among the country’s equity derivatives
exchange operators, according to Chicago-based OCC, which clears
all trades.  Gail Osten, a CBOE spokeswoman, declined to comment on the
stock’s rally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
