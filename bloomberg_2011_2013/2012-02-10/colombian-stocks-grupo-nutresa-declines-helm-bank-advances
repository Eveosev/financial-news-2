The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:04 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.3 percent to 14,067.53, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.2 percent to 1,654.83.  Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA)  (NUTRESA CB),  Colombia ’s biggest food
producer, fell 0.1 percent to 22,160 pesos.  Coffee production in Colombia, the world’s second-largest
supplier of Arabica beans after  Brazil , shrank 41 percent in
January after storms last year increased disease and damaged
plants, according to Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee
Growers.  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB)  , a Colombian lender, rose 5.2
percent to 365 pesos, a seven-month high.  Helm President Carmina Ferro said controlling stakeholders
have no intention of selling amid takeover speculation that’s
driven the share price up from a three-year low. Profit growth
may accelerate to as much as 30 percent this year as the bank
seeks to almost double the retail sector’s share of the bank’s
loans to about 25 percent over five years, Ferro said in an
interview.  “That profit growth sounds very good and is above
expectations,” said David Pelaez, an analyst at Bolsa y Renta.
“The fact that the bank is a very cheap possible buy could also
be driving up the stock price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
