Ivory Coast  plans to impose a 3
percent tax on processing facilities for granulated rubber, the
head of the West African nation’s tax authority said.  Telecommunications companies will also pay a new tax,
Pascal Abinan, director-general of the country’s Directorate
General of Taxes told reporters yesterday in the capital,
Abidjan, without giving further details.  The country loses as much as 500 billion CFA francs ($1
billion) a year to fraud and  tax evasion , Abinan said. “We’re
going to strengthen our tax collection,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
