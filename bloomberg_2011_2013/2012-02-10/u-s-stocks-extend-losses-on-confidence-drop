U.S. stocks extended losses as a
gauge of  consumer confidence  trailed economists’ estimates,
worsening earlier declines triggered by concern that plans to
help  Greece  avoid default were unraveling.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1 percent to 1,338.76
at 10 a.m. in  New York .  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer confidence for February fell to 72.5 from 75
at the end of last month. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
projected a median reading of 74.8.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
