Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet.  Sea-level  rise is threatening the Maldives, the Indian Ocean nation made up of 1,200 islands, 80 percent of which are less than a meter above sea level. The country will will be largely uninhabitable by the end of this century, according to a 2010  review article  in  Science  by Robert J. Nicholls and Anny Cazenave. Former President Mohamed Nasheed put the Maldives on the map by calling attention to predictions that his nation was disappearing from it. A coup forced Nasheed from power this week, and the U.S. has recognized the new government. The new regime's position on global climate policy is not yet established. Nor is it known if they'll share Nasheed's penchant for publicity -- and try to top the 2009 cabinet meeting he held under water, in scuba gear.
