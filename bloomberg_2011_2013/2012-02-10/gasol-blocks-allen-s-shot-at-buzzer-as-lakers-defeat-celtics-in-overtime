Pau Gasol blocked Ray Allen’s layup
at the buzzer as the  Los Angeles Lakers  ended a two-game losing
run with an 88-87 overtime win over the  Boston Celtics .  Gasol scored 25 points and had 14 rebounds while Kobe Bryant contributed a game-leading 27 points as the Lakers
brought a close to Boston’s five-game winning streak in the
 National Basketball Association .  Andrew Bynum, whose tip shot with one minute, 29 seconds
remaining in overtime sealed the win, had 17 rebounds and scored
16 points last night at TD Garden in Boston.  Boston’s Paul Pierce, who two days ago passed Larry Bird as
the second-highest scorer in Celtics history, missed an 18-foot
shot with one second left.  Allen had 22 points and Pierce added 18 and nine rebounds
for the Celtics, who had a 47-45 halftime advantage.  The Lakers (15-11) are in second place in the Western
Conference’s five-team Pacific Division, 1 1/2 games behind the
 Los Angeles Clippers .  The Celtics are second, 3 1/2 games behind the Philadelphia
76ers in the Eastern Conference’s five-team Atlantic Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
