German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government may seek alternative ways to reduce income taxes if
opposition parties block its planned 6 billion-euro ($8 billion)
 tax cut  in the upper house of parliament, Handelsblatt reported,
citing members of the two smaller parties in her three-party
coalition.  The solidarity surcharge, imposed to aid the formerly
communist east of the country after German reunification in
1990, can be abolished by a lower-house vote, avoiding the upper
house where Merkel’s coalition lacks a majority, the Dusseldorf-
based newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
