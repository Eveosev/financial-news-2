Wheat tumbled for a fourth day,
heading for the first weekly drop in four, after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  predicted that global stockpiles would
climb to a record. Corn and soybeans also declined.  Inventories on May 31, before the next harvest, will climb
to 213.1 million metric tons, 1.5 percent more than estimated
last month, the USDA said yesterday. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had expected a drop. The prior record was set in
1999-2000 when stockpiles reached 210.7 million tons. Wheat
prices are down 26 percent in the past year.  “Record ending stocks should be bearish,” said  Dave
Norris , an independent grain broker in Harrogate,  England . “We
now have more wheat than we did in 1999-2000, the previous
record-high stockpiles until yesterday.”  Wheat for March delivery fell 1.1 percent to $6.39 a bushel
by 9:53 a.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price earlier reached $6.3825 a bushel, the lowest level since
Jan. 30. Futures are set for a 3.3 percent decline this week.
Milling wheat for March delivery on NYSE Liffe in Paris fell 1.1
percent to 210.50 euros ($279) a ton.  U.S. corn inventories may total 801 million bushels before
this year’s harvest, 1.9 percent more than expected by analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Global stockpiles at 125.35 million
tons were bigger than expected, even after the U.S. Department
of Agriculture cut its outlook for Argentina’s crop 15 percent
from the prior month to 22 million tons.  Corn for March delivery slid 0.3 percent to $6.3525 a
bushel in  Chicago . The price has declined 1.4 percent this week.
March-delivery soybeans fell 0.5 percent to $12.22 a bushel,
dropping for a fourth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
