President  Barack Obama  will project
a deficit of $901 billion next year when he submits his fiscal
2013 budget to Congress on Feb. 13, according to two
administration officials.  The forecast is based on the assumption Congress accepts
all the White House’s policy recommendations, such as abolishing
Bush-era tax cuts for families earning $250,000 or more.  The budget to be submitted to Congress will also show a
 deficit  of $1.33 trillion this year and include hundreds of
billions of dollars in infrastructure spending. Fiscal 2013
begins Oct. 1.  The Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal reported
the White House’s deficit projection. The numbers were confirmed
by two administration officials who weren’t authorized to speak
publicly on figures that haven’t been released.  The government posted a deficit of $1.3 trillion last year
and the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  projected the
shortfall will be about $1.1 trillion this year if current
policies remain in place, which would mark the fourth straight
year of trillion-dollar deficits.  Last year’s deficit of $1.3 trillion represented 8.7
percent of the economy, the third-highest as a share of gross
domestic product since 1945, according to the CBO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
