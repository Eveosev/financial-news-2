Vishnu Varathan, an economist at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in Singapore, comments on the outlook
for  India ’s rupee.  The rupee fell 0.7 percent to 49.5075 per dollar in Mumbai
yesterday, taking this week’s decline to 1.6 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three-month non-deliverable
forwards for the currency gained 0.1 percent to 50.47 as of 8:20
a.m. in Mumbai.  “In May, the rate is going to be at 51 perhaps. First of
all, euro-zone risks will come back and  oil prices  will be
higher, putting pressure on the fiscal deficit and on the
current account.  “The rupee has gained quite a bit against the dollar in
most of January and part of February. That was in line with our
medium-term expectation that the rupee will make some ground.
For the next one month we see the rupee firm.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
