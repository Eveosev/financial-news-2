Assistant Chinese Foreign Minister
Ma Zhaoxu will visit  Iran  from Feb. 12 to 13 to discuss the
dispute over that country’s nuclear program, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Liu Weimin said at a briefing in Beijing today.  The two sides will exchange views  “over the Iranian
nuclear issue,” Liu said. “We are ready to work together with
parties concerned to seek an early resumption of talks,” he
said.  Ma was invited by Iran’s Supreme National Security Council,
Liu said.  Tensions over Iran have risen in the last week, with U.S.
Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  expressing concern about a
potential Israeli military strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities
by mid-year.  Policy makers in Washington and  Europe  say economic
pressure on Iran to abandon illicit aspects of its nuclear
program is the best way to avoid a military confrontation.
Iran says its program is for civilian energy and medical
research.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
