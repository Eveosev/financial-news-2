The  World Bank  will give Niger 30
billion CFA francs ($60.7 million) to help it deal with the
effects of climate change, said Nestor Coffi, the Washington-
based lender’s representative in the West African nation.  The funds will be spent on projects including improving
water resources and communities’ resilience to climate change,
Coffi said at a signing ceremony yesterday in Niamey, the
capital.  In 2010, the World Bank said Niger, Banlgadesh and
Tajikistan would each receive grants to pilot climate-resilience
strategies and integrate climate risk into their economic plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
