Daily Journal Corp. (DJCO) , the publisher
that counts on Chairman Charles Munger for ideas on deploying
funds, broadened its portfolio last quarter by investing in a
sixth company.  Daily Journal bought common stock in “another Fortune 200
company” in the three months ended Dec. 31, the Los Angeles-
based publisher said in a regulatory filing today.  The publisher of California Lawyer magazine bought stock of
two Fortune 200 companies in February 2009 and bonds of a third
firm, and invested in equity of two foreign manufacturers in
2011 before the latest purchase, the filing shows. Munger, the
88-year-old vice chairman at Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , gives investing advice to the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal has depended on Munger’s “judgment and
suggestions, as well as those of J.P. Guerin, the company’s vice
chairman, when selecting investments,” according to the filing.
“Both of them will continue to play an important role in
monitoring existing investments and selecting any future
investments.”  The publisher invested about $45.2 million in its portfolio
of securities, which were valued at $76.2 million as of Dec. 31.
Daily Journal didn’t return a phone message seeking the names of
the companies in which it invested.  Munger’s company slipped 1.3 percent to $73.95 at 4:30 p.m.
in  New York . The stock has advanced about 3.1 percent in the
past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
