New York , California and nine other
states sued to enforce clean air standards after the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency  failed to meet a deadline to
reduce pollution from soot.  The lawsuit, filed today in federal court in  Manhattan ,
asks a judge to order the EPA to propose and complete the
standards for particulate matter, or soot.  “The delay caused by the administrator’s failure has
harmed and continues to harm the states by delaying the adoption
and implementation of more protective fine particulate matter
standards that will result in cleaner and healthier air,”
according to the complaint.  According to the American Lung Association, one in 17
Americans lives in areas with unhealthy year-round levels of
pollution from soot, Attorney General Peter P. Kilmartin of
 Rhode Island , one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement today.
Most soot comes from diesel vehicles and power plants, he said.  “The science is clear that the current federal standards
for soot emissions are woefully inadequate, causing premature
deaths and serious chronic respiratory harm,” Kilmartin said.  Connecticut,  Delaware , Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico,
Oregon, Vermont and  Washington  also sued the EPA.  “EPA is continuing to work on proposing” the standards,
an agency spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said in an e-mail.  The case is U.S. v. Jackson, 12-cv-10064, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
