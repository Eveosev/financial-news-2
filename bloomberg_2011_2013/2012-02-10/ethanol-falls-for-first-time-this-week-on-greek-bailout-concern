Ethanol futures fell for the first
time this week on concern that the European debt crisis will
curtail fuel demand.  Futures dropped 0.9 percent after German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  told lawmakers in Berlin that  Greece  is
missing its debt-cutting targets. Ethanol, made from corn in the
U.S., is blended into gasoline to reduce crude oil use.  “The energy markets were lower,” said Matt Janney, a
trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago . “Everything
was lower. It’s a macro thing.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery slipped 1.9 cents, the
most since Feb. 2, to $2.212 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices are down 11 percent from a year earlier.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  slumped 4
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.25 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive lost 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.285, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slid 2 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.235 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel climbed 1 cent, or
0.5 percent, to $2.20.  Crude oil for March delivery declined $1.17, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $98.67 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Gasoline for March delivery fell 3.79 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to settle at $2.9749 a gallon in New York. The contract includes
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
