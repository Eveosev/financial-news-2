The Pakistan  Supreme Court  rejected
Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani ’s appeal against a contempt of
court order in a case that may force him from office.  “The prime minister now will appear before the court on
Feb. 13 when the contempt of court charges will be framed
against him,” Gilani’s lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan, told reporters in
Islamabad after the decision. The rulings relate to Gilani’s
failure to pursue corruption cases against the president, Asif Ali Zardari.  Ahsan had argued that the constitution granted Zardari
immunity in criminal cases and Gilani could not be held in
contempt. Gilani’s team and the Supreme Court have disputed
whether the court can remove the prime minister from office.  The court last month said Gilani violated his oath of
office by ignoring its order to re-open graft probes against
Zardari which former military ruler  Pervez Musharraf  suspended
in 2007.  A judge in Geneva charged Zardari and Bhutto in 2004 with
accepting bribes to award contracts to companies, including SGS
Societe Generale de Surveillance Holding SA, the Swiss newspaper
Le Temps reported at the time.  Zardari has denied all charges against him and has never
been found guilty by a court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
