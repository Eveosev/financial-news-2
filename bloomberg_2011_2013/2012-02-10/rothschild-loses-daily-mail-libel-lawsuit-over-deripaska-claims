Nathaniel Rothschild , chairman and
co-founder of  Bumi Plc (BUMI) , lost a lawsuit against the publisher of
the Daily Mail newspaper for an article describing a 2005
meeting with politician  Peter Mandelson  and Oleg Deripaska.  The paper claimed Rothschild arranged for Mandelson to
attend a dinner in Moscow to close a deal between Alcoa Inc. and
Deripaska’s  United Co. Rusal Plc (RUALR) , which led to the loss of 300
British jobs.  Judge Michael Tugendhat ruled in favor of Mail publisher
Associated Newspapers Ltd., saying he determined the article was
“substantially true.” Meanwhile, Rothschild “had not been
entirely candid throughout the different stages of the case,”
the judge said, referring to the reasons given for a trip to
Siberia.  Rothschild, 40, said in a statement he was disappointed
with the decision and he intended to appeal. He said the Alcoa
deal had been completed before he arrived in Moscow and
Mandelson’s trip to  Russia  was “entirely recreational.”  “Mandelson’s trip to Russia was entirely recreational --
as the Court has accepted -- and Lord Mandelson had
obtained clearance for the trip from his office before
undertaking it,” Rothschild said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
