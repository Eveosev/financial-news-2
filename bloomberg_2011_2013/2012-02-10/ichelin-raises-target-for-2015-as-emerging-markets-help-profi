Michelin & Cie. , the world’s second-
largest tiremaker, raised its earnings target for 2015, saying
that new plants in Brazil and China will add to profit starting
this year.  Operating profit in 2015 will amount to 2.5 billion euros
($3.3 billion), compared with an earlier target of 2 billion
euros, the Clermont-Ferrand, France-based manufacturer said
today in a statement. Michelin also said it plans 1 billion
euros of cost savings in its industry and services segments over
five years.  “Growth in operating income and, given capital expenditure
of around 1.9 billion euros for the year, the generation of free
 cash flow  should both be in line with the group’s 2015
objectives,” Michelin said.  The company agreed in September to invest in a tiremaking
venture in  China , adding to its four plants in the world’s
biggest car market. China’s industrywide vehicle sales,
including cars, trucks and buses, increased 2.5 percent last
year, and U.S. light-vehicle deliveries jumped 10 percent, in
contrast to a drop in  Europe ’s car market of 1.4 percent.  The cost-reduction program will focus on effecting savings
without any reorganization of operations, Co-Managing Partner
Jean-Dominique Senard said in a conference with analysts today.
Improvement of the truck-tire unit’s profitability is among the
goals, he said.  Stock Performance  Michelin fell 2.3 percent to 54.47 euros in Paris trading
as of 1:26 p.m. after European stocks declined as finance
ministers held back a rescue package for  Greece . The tiremaker’s
shares rose as much as 4 percent earlier in the day.  Operating profit gained 15 percent in 2011 to 1.95 billion
euros, Michelin said. Net income jumped 39 percent to 1.46
billion euros, and sales rose 16 percent to 20.7 billion euros.  Profit last year was helped by price increases that
outpaced a 1.75 billion-euro jump in raw-material costs,
Michelin said. The raw-material cost effect this year will be
300 million euros to 350 million euros,Senard said today at an
earlier press conference in Paris.  The average price of natural rubber is likely to decline to
$4.05 from $4.60 last year, Michelin said in an online
 statement .  The tiremaker, which ranks second behind  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) 
in global production, sold its 9.98 percent stake in  Hankook
Tire Co. (000240)  in November, raising as much as $610 million to fund
expansion in  emerging markets .  ‘Steady’ Volume  Michelin said it plans to hold volume “steady” in 2012 as
growth is “favorable” in emerging markets against a “less
buoyant” Europe. The company reiterated targets of 25 percent
volume growth in the 2011-2015 period and an annual return on
capital employed of at least 9 percent.  The tire market this year “will probably be negative in
the first half due to the high figures from the previous year,”
Senard said. “In the second half, we see a general rebound,
meaning that the year as a whole will be stable if there are no
surprises.”  The company has adequate funds to cover pension commitments
and has moved in the last three to four years to reduce pension
risks, lessening its exposure to stock market fluctuations,
Senard said. Michelin may have to add some cash to the fund in
the future, he said.  Senard will become Michelin’s sole chairman in May when Co-
Managing Partner Michel Rollier steps down, the tire
manufacturer also said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
