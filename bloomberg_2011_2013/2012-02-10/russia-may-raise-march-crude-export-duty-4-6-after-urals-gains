Russia , the world’s biggest oil
producer, may increase the export duty on most crude shipments
by as much as 4.6 percent from March 1 after Urals prices rose.  The standard duty may climb to $409.10 to $412 a metric
ton, or $55.81 to $56.21 a barrel, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on Finance Ministry data. That compares with
$393.70 a ton in February.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea oil may be set within a range from $202.80 to $205 a ton,
compared with $191.20 this month.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, may average $111.74 to
$112.42 a barrel during this period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today. Urals averaged
$108.23 in the previous period, according to the ministry.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the levies
before they take effect. The government lowered the crude  tax
rate  applying a coefficient of 60 percent, down from 65 percent,
and unified the duty on most refined products at 66 percent of
that levy since October.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products may
increase to within a range from $270 to $271.90 a ton next
month, from $259.80 in February.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed from May to counter
domestic shortages may be within a range from $368.20 to $370.80
a ton, from $354.30 this month. That is 90 percent of the crude
oil duty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
