The European Union and India took a
“significant step forward” during talks to reach a free-trade
agreement and negotiations should be completed late this year,
said European Commission President  Jose Barroso .  Trade between the two sides, which have been negotiating a
deal since 2007, climbed to 84 billion euros ($111 billion) in
2010. Disagreements over Indian duties on cars and spirits and
limited access for India to the EU’s labor market have hindered
efforts to reach an accord.  “The negotiations have progressed steadily and I am happy
to report that we have made a significant step forward,”
Barroso said in  New Delhi  today after an India-EU summit,
according to an e-mailed copy of his speech. “Our positions are
now closer in all areas and the contours of the final agreement
are emerging. We have therefore committed to intensify these
negotiations. I expect the finalization of these negotiations
this autumn.”  The EU is  India ’s largest trading partner, accounting for
14 percent of foreign commerce, and India’s largest source of
foreign direct investment. A deal between the two economies
would be the biggest trade agreement in the world, delivering
benefits to a combined population of 1.7 billion people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
