First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker
of thin-film solar panels, fell the most in almost two months
after permitting issues delayed a U.S. loan guarantee for a
power plant in California and an analyst at  Collins Stewart  LLC
downgraded the shares.  First Solar dropped 10 percent to $43.91 at the close in
New York, the most since Dec. 14. The shares have declined 72
percent in the past year.  First Solar sold the 230-megawatt Antelope Valley Solar
Ranch One plant to  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  for $75 million in September.
The Tempe, Arizona-based solar company will have to buy it back
if the project cannot win final construction permits and qualify
for a $646 million U.S. Energy Department loan guarantee, First
Solar said yesterday in a regulatory  filing .  “First Solar will not be able to recognize revenues from
AVSR construction unless a sale is completed and funded,” Dan Ries, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said today in a note to
clients. He reduced his rating to “neutral” from “buy.”  If required to repurchase Antelope Valley, First Solar will
probably be able to sell it to another buyer and the transaction
may reduce its first-quarter profit to break-even, Ries said.  When Exelon purchased the project, the deal was contingent
upon First Solar receiving the government-backed funding
“within approximately four months,” according to the filing.
The companies have agreed to extend that deadline to Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
