Investors who stuck with Treasury
bills during billionaire  Warren Buffett ’s tenure at Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. would have seen most of their returns eroded by
the effects of inflation.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the value of $100 invested
in three-month bills has changed since 1965, when Buffett took
control of Berkshire and began transforming the textile maker
into an insurance and investment company.  Before inflation, a bill investor would have had $1,099.09
at the end of last year. The nominal return of about 11-fold is
based on data compiled by Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor
at  New York University .  After accounting for increases in the  consumer price index ,
the real return on the holding would have been only 54 percent.
The investor would have ended up with the equivalent of $154.38
in 1965 dollars.  Buffett addressed inflation’s effect on investments in an
article published yesterday on Fortune magazine’s website. The
report was adapted from his annual letter to shareholders of
Berkshire, based in Omaha,  Nebraska , and cited the 47-year
period since he took control of the company.  Current  interest rates  “do not come close to offsetting
the purchasing-power risk that investors assume” when they buy
government debt, Buffett wrote. The CPI climbed 3 percent last
year, causing real yields on every benchmark Treasury security
except the 30-year bond to turn negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
