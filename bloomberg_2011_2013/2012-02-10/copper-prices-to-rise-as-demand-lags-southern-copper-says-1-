Copper prices will increase this
year as global copper supply lags demand because of labor strife
and depleting mines,  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) ’s Financial Planning
Manager Raul Jacob said.  Mines will need to produce an additional 430,000 metric
tons of copper in 2012 to meet demand, Jacob said. Southern, the
largest copper producer in Peru and  Mexico  and also a silver
producer, will increase output by 3.8 percent to 610,000 metric
tons this year, he said.  “Production has underperformed badly due to labor unrest,
power shortages, adverse weather conditions and ore-grade
declines,” Jacob said today on a conference call with analysts.
“These events are likely to continue in 2012, maintaining
tightness in the copper market.”  Workers in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Indonesia held
stoppages at copper, gold and zinc mines last year to pressure
for better conditions and a bigger percentage of record profits
after metal prices surged.  New York  copper prices doubled over a
two-year period through June 2011. Global mine output dropped by
200,000 metric tons in 2011, according to  Barclays Capital .  Silver will see “strong” demand as an investor haven this
year, Jacob said.  Southern Copper fell 3.3 percent to $33.69 at the close in
New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
