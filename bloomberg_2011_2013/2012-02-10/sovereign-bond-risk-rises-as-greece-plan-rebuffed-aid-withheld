The cost of insuring European
sovereign debt soared after finance ministers rebuffed a Greek
austerity plan being demanded in exchange for a 130 billion-euro
($173 billion) rescue package.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed nine basis points to 331
at 1 p.m. in London. The gauge is headed for the first weekly
increase in five weeks, signaling deterioration in perceptions
of  credit quality .  Resolution of the aid talks, which have dragged on since
July, is needed for  Greece  to avoid defaulting next month. The
nation must pass its latest austerity package into law and
identify 325 million euros in extra spending cuts before euro-
area governments endorse a second bailout for the country,
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said.  “Time is obviously running out for Greece,” said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at Credit Agricole SA in London.  A leader of Greece’s coalition government today pushed back
against German demands for deeper budget cuts as the price of
the bailout needed to stave off a financial collapse.  George Karatzaferis, the leader of one of the three parties
supporting interim Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , said he
wouldn’t support austerity measures worked out for a rescue.
Karatzaferis, who heads the Laos party, spoke in Athens hours
after German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told lawmakers
in Berlin that Greece was missing debt-cutting targets.  Italy Swaps  Swaps on Italy surged 24 basis points to 394 and  Spain 
jumped 20 to 368, according to BNP Paribas SA. Contracts on
Austria climbed 14 to 170,  France  rose 10 to 174 and Belgium
increased seven to 213.  The cost of insuring corporate debt also surged with the
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-
yield credit ratings jumping 32 basis points to 599.5, heading
for the first weekly increase since Dec. 16, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 5.75 basis points to 135.75 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 14 basis points to 219 and
the subordinated index climbed 25 to 362.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
