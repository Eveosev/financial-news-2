Abu Dhabi  National Oil Co. offered
to sell a year’s supply of naphtha beginning in April to Asian
buyers at premiums of $25 to $27 a metric ton above Middle East
prices, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s
discussions with Asian buyers.  Abu Dhabi offered Pentane-Plus grade naphtha at a premium
of $27, the people said, asking not to be identified because the
talks are private. Low-sulfur naphtha was offered at a premium
of $26 a ton and Splitter-grade at $25 a ton, they said.  Nobody answered a call to Abu Dhabi National’s marketing
department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
