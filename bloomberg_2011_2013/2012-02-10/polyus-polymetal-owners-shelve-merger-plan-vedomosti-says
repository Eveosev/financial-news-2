The owners of Russian gold producers
Polyus Gold International Ltd. and Polymetal International Plc
shelved a plan to merge the companies,  Vedomosti  reported today,
citing people it didn’t identify.  The idea is about 10 years old and the shareholders may
reopen talks at a later date, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  Billionaires Mikhail Prokhorov and Suleiman Kerimov jointly
control about 78 percent of Polyus Gold. Polymetal owners
include Czech billionaire  Petr Kellner  and Russia’s  Alexander
Nesis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
