Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO) ,
owner of lower  Manhattan ’s World Financial Center, said fourth-
quarter funds from operations fell 34 percent after the company
spun off its profitable residential business.  FFO attributable to common shareholders, which gauges a
real estate company’s ability to generate cash, dropped to $134
million, or 26 cents a share, from $204 million, or 40 cents, a
year earlier, New York-based Brookfield said today in a
statement. The result matches the average  estimate  of 15
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The company projected full-year
diluted FFO of $1.07 to $1.12 a share, compared with an average
analyst estimate of $1.12.  Brookfield sharpened its focus on office properties last
year when it merged its residential land operation, which mainly
built homes in oil-rich western  Canada , with another unit of its
parent,  Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A)  Brookfield Office
generated no income from residential operations in the fourth
quarter, compared with $48 million a year earlier.  Brookfield faces expiring leases in its skyscrapers in
 lower Manhattan , where it’s the biggest office landlord.  “Significant lease rollover in 2013, much of it in
downtown Manhattan, appears to still be more of a risk than a
positive,” Ross Smotrich, an analyst with Barclays Capital Inc.
in  New York , wrote in a Jan. 26 report. “Brookfield’s earnings
could be hit relatively hard if leasing demand wanes in lower
Manhattan in the near term.”  Manhattan Vacancies  Bank of America Corp. said it will leave behind more than 3
million square feet (279,000 square meters) of World Financial
Center offices when the leases expire next year. The bank agreed
to keep 767,000 square feet of the space it inherited with its
2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co.  Brookfield has 590,000 square feet of empty offices at 1
New York Plaza that had been rented by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Lower Manhattan, which had an 11.6 percent office
availability rate at the end of last year, probably will have a
“spike” in unleased space as such financial firms as Bank of
America, Nomura Holdings Inc. and Depository Trust & Clearing
Corp. consolidate offices, the brokerage firm Studley Inc. said
in a report last month.  Revenue was $527 million, a 33 percent jump from a year
earlier. Net operating income from commercial properties rose 50
percent to $305 million, as the company’s U.S. portfolio
contribution almost doubled to $186 million. Net income
attributable to shareholders fell to $338 million from $971
million.  Leasing Record  The company signed a record 10.1 million square feet of
leases in 2011, Chief Executive Officer Ric Clark said in the
statement. That’s 22 percent more than the its previous high in
2007. About 2.7 million square feet was rented in the fourth
quarter at an average net rent of $29.50 a square foot, up 4
percent over the expiring rents on the same space.  Brookfield’s Australian properties, which it acquired in
September of 2010, contributed $40 million to net operating
income from commercial business, up from $34 million a year
earlier.  Earnings were released before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Brookfield fell 0.5 percent to $17.81 yesterday in New
York. The shares have gained 2.3 percent in the last 12 months,
compared with a 4.2 percent increase in the 83-member  Dow Jones
U.S. Real Estate Index. (DJUSRE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
