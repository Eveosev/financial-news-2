OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, dropped the most this month as  Europe ’s finance
ministers held back approval of a rescue package for Greece,
eroding demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The shares fell 2.1 percent to 3,975 forint by 5 p.m. in
Budapest, extending the decline this week to 3.3 percent after a
25 percent rally in January.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped as much as 2
percent today after Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos
said a parliamentary vote set to begin this weekend amounted to
a ballot on euro membership as the country faced further delays
to an aid package.  “Investors have taken their feet off the accelerator on
the domestic market,”  Akos Kuti , a Budapest-based analyst at
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., and colleagues wrote in an e-mailed
report today. “After it seemed last week the Greek drama would
be ending, it turned out we just opened a new chapter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
