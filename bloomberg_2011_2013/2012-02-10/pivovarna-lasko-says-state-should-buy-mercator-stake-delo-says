Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. said the
state should buy its 23 percent holding in  Mercator Poslovni
Sistem (MELR)  d.d. via its agencies to help the company ease its debt
burden, Delo newspaper  reported , citing Dusan Zorko, the chief
executive officer of the Slovenian drinks company.  Kapitalska Druzba d.d. and Slovenska Odskodninska Druzba
d.d., the state-owned financial companies or the agency for
managing state assets, should step in as Pivovarna Lasko “isn’t
a stable partner” as owner of Mercator, Zorko was quoted as
saying in the interview with the Ljubljana-based newspaper.  The drinks company needs to repay 150 million euros ($199
million) of loans by end of March and Zorko hopes banks will
reprogram the debt, Delo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
