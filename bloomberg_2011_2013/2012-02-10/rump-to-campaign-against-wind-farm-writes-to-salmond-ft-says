Donald Trump , billionaire U.S.
property developer and reality-TV star, described Scottish First
Minister  Alex Salmond  as “hell-bent on destroying Scotland’s
coastline,” with plans for an offshore wind farm to be built
near the site of Trump’s golf resort in Aberdeenshire, Scotland
and has allocated “a substantial amount of money to launch an
international campaign” to fight the plan, the Financial Times
reported, citing a letter from Trump to Salmond.  “With the reckless installation of these monsters, you
will single-handedly have done more damage to Scotland than
virtually any event in Scottish history,” Trump wrote in the
letter, according to the FT. “I am doing this to save
Scotland,” he wrote, the FT said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
