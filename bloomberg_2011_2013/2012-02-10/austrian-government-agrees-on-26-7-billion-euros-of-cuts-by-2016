Austria’s government agreed on
pension and spending cuts and tax increases that will cut the
Alpine republic’s deficit an accumulated 26.5 billion euros ($35
billion) by 2016.  “We will have a balanced budget again in 2016,”
Chancellor Werner Faymann, who leads the coalition government of
 Social Democrats  and the pro-business People’s Party, said at a
press conference in Vienna, broadcast live in Austrian state
television ORF. About 76 percent of that is due to cuts, while
24 percent is because of new or increased taxes.  Austria, which lost its AAA rating at  Standard & Poor’s 
last month, is aiming to narrow its deficit to comply with
balanced-budget rules agreed among euro-area leaders last month.
The country’s budget deficit will fall to 0.6 percent of gross
domestic product by 2016, from 3.1 percent last year, according
to the plan. Debt, which amounted to 72.2 percent of GDP in
2011, will widen to 75.4 percent in 2014 before narrowing to 71
percent in 2016.  Finance Minister Maria Fekter told  Austria  Press Agency
that she hopes the measures will allow Austria to regain its AAA
rating at S&P.  Pensions, Civil Servants  The plan includes 7.26 billion euros of savings because of
stricter rules for early retirement and lower pensions, about
2.5 billion euros saved on pay and hiring freezes for civil
servants and about 440 million-euro tax surcharge for top
earners. Additional measures include lower investments in
infrastructure, health care and at the state-owned railway
company, an end to double subsidies from regional and federal
agencies and closing tax loopholes including an exemptions for
real estate gains and tax benefits for gasoline acquired by
farmers.  The measures also include potential revenue of a tax on
financial transactions within the European Union as of 2014 and
taxes on undeclared Austrian funds in Swiss accounts, which
should be levied on the basis of a treaty that still needs to be
agreed on with  Switzerland .  Austria’s economy may continue to stagnate in the first
half of this year, Wifo economic research institute, which
compiles gross domestic product figures for the Alpine
republic’s government, said yesterday.  While Austria’s economic slowdown this year will be more
abrupt than forecast earlier, the country is unlikely to see
more than one negative quarter this year, Wifo said Dec. 21.
Gross domestic product is expected to rise 0.4 percent, the
group said, down from a September prediction of 0.8 percent
growth, and 1.8 percent in July.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
