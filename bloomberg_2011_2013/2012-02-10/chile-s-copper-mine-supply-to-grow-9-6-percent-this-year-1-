Chile , which mines a third of the
world’s copper, will boost supply of the metal by 9.6 percent
this year, easing global shortages, state-run copper commission
Cochilco said.  Chile’s supply will increase to 5.75 million metric tons,
from 5.24 million tons last year, Cochilco said in its  quarterly
report  e-mailed today. Anglo American Plc completed an expansion
to its Los Bronces mine in central Chile in December, making it
the world’s fifth-largest.  Global supply will increase 4.5 percent this year, and 7.3
percent in 2013, Cochilco said. Copper declined in  New York 
today, paring a fifth weekly advance, as inventories monitored
by the Shanghai Futures Exchange advanced to a record.  Cochilco predicted prices of the metal will average between
$3.75 a pound and $3.95 a pound in 2012. March-delivery copper
on the Comex fell 0.7 percent to $3.9485 a pound today.  The commission raised its estimate for global copper demand
to grow 3.2 percent in 2012, from an estimate of 2.4 percent in
its previous quarterly report. Copper demand will exceed 20
million metric tons for the first time as Chinese usage
increases 5.9 percent, Cochilco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
