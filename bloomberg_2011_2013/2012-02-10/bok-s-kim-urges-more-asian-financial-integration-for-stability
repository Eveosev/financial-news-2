Asia should work to integrate
regional financial markets to encourage stability while global
capital should be redirected toward productive economies and
away from debt-ridden countries, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said.  “If better integrated Asian markets can produce more safe
assets of our own, offer greater risk hedging, and help to
reduce financial mismatches, the financial stability gains to us
could be quite large,” Kim said in a statement prepared for a
speech at a conference in  Tokyo  today.  Regional financial market integration should be guided by
greater exchange-rate flexibility, freer capital mobility,
transparent rules and regulations, fair competition on
reciprocity and a clear roadmap for the private sector to cope
with the expected changes, he said.  The world should pay greater attention to reviving economic
growth, Kim said, adding that global financial resources have
been directed too much toward financing unsustainable fiscal
deficits in debt-ridden countries and too little toward
countries with high productivity.  Kim and his board kept the benchmark seven-day repurchase
rate unchanged at 3.25 percent yesterday, holding off raising
borrowing costs for an eighth straight month as the economy
slowed and exports declined due to the European debt crisis. The
unanimous decision was predicted by 18 of 19 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
