AO Kazakhstan Temir Zholy National
Co., the state-owned railroad monopoly, said net income climbed
45 percent last year as transit shipments increased and the
company sought to control costs.  Profit rose to a record $750 million, Chief Executive
Officer Askar Mamin said today in the capital Astana.  “This is the biggest number we’ve ever had,” Mamin said.  Net income reached $417 million in 2010, more than tripling
from 2009 as demand for cargo and travel gained amid economic
expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
