Electricite de France SA made an
offer to take over Photowatt, the country’s only make of
silicon-based solar cells.  EDF will acquire Photowatt, which was placed in
receivership in November, through its renewable energy unit, the
Paris-based utility said in a statement today, without giving
any financial details for the deal.  EDF and Photowatt are already partners in PV alliance, a
ventur to develop silicon-based technologies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
