Gedeon Richter Nyrt. (RICHT) ,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, fell the most in more than four months after
a state-controlled fund sold shares in the company.  The stock dropped 4.6 percent to 37,150 forint by the close
in Budapest, the biggest daily plunge since Sep. 22, erasing
this week’s advance.  The stake in the company held by the state’s Pension Reform
and Debt Reduction Fund, created after the government took over
assets from privately managed retirement funds, fell below 5
percent, Richter said in a statement to the Budapest Stock
Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
