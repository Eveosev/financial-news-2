A group of Greek lawmakers have
objected to a government plan to abolish a sales-tax discount
enjoyed by some of the country’s more remote islands,  Proposed legislation that would standardize the sales-tax
rate nationwide threatens the social well-being of islands in
the east Aegean Sea, 19 lawmakers from three parties that
support the government said in a letter to Prime Minister  Lucas
Papademos . The islands need a lower rate to compensate for the
higher cost of goods and services, according to a copy of the
letter sent by e-mail.  “We do not accept the repeal of a measure that contributes
crucially to the maintenance of social cohesion and the
sustainability of our islands,” the lawmakers said. “We call
on the government to expend every effort to avoid it.”  Tax revisions are among the measures that the European
Commission,  International Monetary Fund  and  European Central
Bank  have demanded as a condition for a second Greek financial
bailout. Papademos was appointed in November as head of an
interim government that was charged with securing 130 billion-
euro ($171 billion) in aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
