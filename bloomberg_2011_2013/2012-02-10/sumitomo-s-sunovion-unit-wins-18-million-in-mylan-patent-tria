Sumitomo Chemical Co. (4005) ’s Sunovion
Pharmaceuticals Inc. won an $18 million patent-infringement
verdict in federal court in Delaware from  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  and its Dey
Pharma unit over technology for asthma-treatment inhalers.  The jury decided today after a two-week trial that Dey
induced and contributed to infringement of a series of patents
for inhaler solutions, according to court electronic documents.  Jurors also ruled that the infringement was intentional,
which may allow U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark to triple the
damages.  Sunovion, based in Marlborough,  Massachusetts , sued in
2006, alleging its rival planned to market its copies without
authorization, while the patents remained enforceable. Sumitomo
is based in  Tokyo .  “We firmly believe that the jury has erred and intend to
seek reversal through post-trial motions and, if necessary, an
appeal of the verdict and the damages award,” Mylan Chief
Executive Officer Heather Bresch said in a statement.  Patricia Moriarty, a spokeswoman for Sunovion, didn’t
immediately return a call for comment.  The case is Sunovion v. Dey and Mylan, 06CV113, U.S.
District Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
