After the June 28, 1914,
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, many
voices clamored for war with  Serbia . No one was louder than
Conrad von Hotzendorf, chief of staff for the Austro-Hungarian
army.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  It was not simply a question of military policy. Von
Hotzendorf was involved in one of the great scandals of the
time. His mistress was dusky-eyed Gina, 28 years his junior and
the mother of six children with beer king Hermann von
Reininghaus.  His plan was to so inflame her with military heroics that
she would get a divorce and marry him. Von Hotzendorf also
imagined that when he led the army to victory, the emperor would
intercede with the Vatican to allow the Catholic pair to marry
in church.  It didn’t quite work out as planned. The Russians dealt his
forces defeat after defeat. But Von Hotzendorf did get to marry
Gina, who left the beer king and converted to Calvinism.  I spoke with Jack Beatty, author of “The Lost History of
1914,” on the following topics:  1. Improbable Accident  2. History as Contingency  3. Blood on Their Hands  4. Local Determinants  5. Seminal Catastrophe  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
