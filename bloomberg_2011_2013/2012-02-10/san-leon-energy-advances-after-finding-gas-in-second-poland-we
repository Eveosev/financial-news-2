San Leon Energy Plc (SLE) , an oil and gas
explorer drilling shale rock in  Poland , rose the most in five
weeks in London trading after its Rogity-1 well found
hydrocarbons.  San Leon climbed 14 percent to close at 12.5 pence, the
biggest one-day gain since Jan. 6, valuing the Dublin-based
company at 141.8 million pounds ($223.4 million).  The well, operated by  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) , was drilled to
a depth of 2,788 meters (9,147 feet), San Leon said today in a
statement. “Continuous gas shows were encountered over more
than 500 meters,” as well as indications of oil, it said.  Rogity-1 is San Leon’s second well with Talisman in Poland.
Last year, the Lewino 1G-2 well encountered gas over more than
1,000 meters, the company said Nov. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
