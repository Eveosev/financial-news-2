Brazil ’s real headed for its first
weekly decline in six after European finance ministers withheld
a Greek rescue package, reigniting speculation a default would
derail the global economic recovery.  The real weakened 0.4 percent to 1.7240 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:57 a.m. in Sao Paulo, from 1.7169 yesterday. It is down 0.3
percent this week.  The Brazilian real dropped with most other major and
emerging-market currencies after German officials said Greece is
missing its debt-cutting targets, prompting European finance
ministers to withhold aid.  “The problems in Greece still aren’t over,” Hideaki Iha,
a currency trader at Fair Corretora de Cambio e Valores, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “The dollar is accompanying the external
market. The euro was gaining but now it’s giving it back.”  The yield on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract
due in January 2013 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 9.36 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
