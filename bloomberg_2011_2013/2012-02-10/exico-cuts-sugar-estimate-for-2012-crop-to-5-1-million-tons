Mexico , the worldâ€™s sixth-largest
sugar producer, cut its official production estimate to 5.1
million tons this crop year, said an industry committee.  The committee, known as Conadesuca, cut by 3.8 percent its
previous estimate of 5.3 million tons of sugar this season,
according a report posted on its website. Conadesuca is a
committee formed by government officials, sugar producers and
buyers that recommends sugar-import policies for Mexico.  To contact the reporters on this story:
