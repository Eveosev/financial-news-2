Electric cars in the European Union
wonâ€™t be allowed to make animal noises or musical sounds to help
people hear them in traffic,  Bild  reported, citing an EU rule.|  While the rule says electric cars must make a steady,
artificially generated noise while in operation, animal and
insect sounds, melodies, sirens and bells are banned, the
Berlin-based newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
