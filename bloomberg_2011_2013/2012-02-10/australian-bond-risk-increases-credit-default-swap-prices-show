The cost of insuring bonds in
 Australia  against non-payment rose, according to credit-default
swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 3 basis points to
141.5 basis points as of 11:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The benchmark is on course for its biggest
daily increase since Jan. 30, according to CMA, which is owned
by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was changed little at 159 basis points
as of 8:23 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index was changed little at
140 basis points as of 9:32 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
