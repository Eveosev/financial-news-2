The  International Monetary Fund  said
that Singapore’s “near-term outlook is clouded by an
extraordinary degree of uncertainty.”  “Growth is expected to slow significantly in 2012, driven
down by softening external demand and global financial
volatility. Against the backdrop of a weaker external and
domestic outlook, headline inflation is also expected to ease
sharply in 2012,” the IMF said in a statement released today in
 Washington .  The statement added: “Executive Directors commended the
authorities for proactive macroeconomic and financial policies,
which have underpinned a strong rebound in activity. Directors
noted that Singapore’s economic growth is likely to slow in the
near term amidst an unsettled global environment, and that
significant downside risks weigh on the outlook. Nevertheless,
they agreed that  Singapore  has sufficient policy room and tools
to cushion the impact of external shocks and preserve
macroeconomic stability.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
