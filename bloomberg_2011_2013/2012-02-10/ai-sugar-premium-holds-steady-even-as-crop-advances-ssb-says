The premium buyers are prepared to
pay to obtain sugar from  Thailand , the world’s second-largest
shipper, is holding steady even as half of the crop has been
harvested, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  Thai sugar for loading in February and March was selling at
a premium of 0.5 cent a pound above the price of the March
contract on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange in  New York , data from
the Rolle, Switzerland-based company show. That compares with a
premium of 0.55 cent on Feb. 3. The so-called J-spec sugar for
March delivery was at a premium of 0.15 cent to 0.25 cent a
pound, from 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound on Feb. 3, the broker
said.  Thailand’s sugar production reached 5.15 million metric
tons in the first 85 days of the current crushing season,
according to data from the Office of Cane and Sugar Board. The
country is forecast to produce 9.9 million tons in 2011-12. The
season there started in November.  Thai raw sugar remains “supported” and J-spec offers are
“scarce,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers, wrote
in a report e-mailed yesterday.  “Wondering why the values are holding when the Thai crop
has reached more than 5.1 million tons,” Beydoun wrote.  The cane crop in Thailand will end “much earlier” than
last year, Andrew Slinger, a Singapore-based director at
Armajaro Trading Group Ltd., said on Feb. 6 at a Kingsman sugar
conference in Dubai. The harvest will be between 98 million and
102 million tons, down from a previous forecast of 103 million
tons, he said.  Raw sugar for May delivery slid 0.8 percent to 23.51 cents
a pound on ICE by 10:38 a.m. London time. White, or refined,
sugar for May delivery was down 0.4 percent at $630.60 a ton on
NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
