The new Slovenian government may
have to provide a 400 million-euro ($531 million) capital boost
for Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. if the country’s biggest bank
fails to attract other investors, TV Slovenija  reported , citing
Janez Sustersic, who is nominated to become Finance Minister.  NLB must also be allowed to sell stakes in companies it
seized during the 2009 recession, Sustersic said at a
parliamentary hearing in Ljubljana yesterday, according to the
public broadcaster.  Slovenia has the reputation of an unreliable partner among
foreign investors as it is known to pull back from deals at the
last moment, Sustersic said according to TVS. He plans to “stop
such practices,” TVS said.  Croatia ’s Agrokor d.d. abandoned its bid to buy Slovenian
retailer  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  after increased opposition
from Slovenian officials, which may have prolonged the sale
process. NLB was among banks and investors that sought to sell
the majority stake in Mercator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
