Copper declined in New York, paring
a fifth weekly advance, as European finance ministers held back
a rescue package for  Greece , fueling concerns that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis may curb global economic growth.  Greece is missing its debt-cutting targets, German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told lawmakers today, intensifying
pressure on Greek politicians to deliver on austerity promises.
Copper also fell as imports of the metal by China, the biggest
buyer, dropped for the first time in eight months in January,
while inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
advanced to a record.  “The Greek situation rumbles on with new German pre-
conditions,” Andrew Silver, a trader at Natixis Commodity
Markets Ltd., said by e-mail today. Copper also fell on the
weakness of import figures, the euro and equities and as
investors took profits following gains yesterday, he said.  March-delivery copper declined 1.6 percent to $3.9135 a
pound by 8:08 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . The contract is
heading for a 0.3 percent gain this week after yesterday
climbing to the highest level since Sept. 16. Copper for
delivery in three months slipped 1.8 percent to $8,601.25 a
metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said there
will be “no disbursement without implementation” of the
austerity measures. Greece must pass its latest austerity
package into law and identify 325 million euros ($431 million)
in spending cuts before euro-area governments endorse a second
bailout for the country, Juncker said.  Greek Plans  Schaeuble said in Berlin Greece’s plans would leave its
debt as high as 136 percent of gross domestic product by 2020,
according to two people who took part in a meeting. The euro
fell from a two-month high against the dollar, making metals
denominated in greenbacks more expensive for users of the single
European currency.  Imports (CNIVCOPP)  of unwrought copper and products by  China  were
413,964 tons in January, falling from a record 508,942 tons in
December, the General Administration of Customs said today.
Arrivals of scrap copper slumped to 230,000 tons from 450,000
tons a month ago. Inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained for a ninth straight week, rising 18,311 tons,
or 10 percent, to 198,202 tons, according to a survey of 10
warehouses, the exchange said on its website.  “In China, as credit has been tighter, consumers haven’t
wanted or been able to afford to hold higher levels of
inventory,”  David Wilson , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in
London, said by e-mail today. “Consumers are running lower
levels of inventory, particularly here in  Europe , and this is
driven to some extent by macro nervousness.  Stockpiles monitored by the LME fell for a 28th session,
declining 0.3 percent to 312,750 tons, the lowest level since
Sept. 7, 2009. Orders to draw the metal from LME warehouses
declined 1.2 percent to 82,200 tons.  Aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin also fell in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
