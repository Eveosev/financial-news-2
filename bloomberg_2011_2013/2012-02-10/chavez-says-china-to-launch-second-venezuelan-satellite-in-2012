Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said  China  will launch a second satellite for the South American
nation before the end of the year after the two countries signed
a $140 million contract in May.  The satellite, which is being built in China, should be in
orbit in September or October this year, Science and Technology
Minister Jorge Arreaza said today in comments broadcast on state
television.  “ Venezuela  entered the space race,” Chavez said in the
same broadcast. “One day Venezuela will arrive on Mars but
China will do it first.”  The new satellite will be used for defense, health,
agriculture and urban planning projects, Arreaza said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
