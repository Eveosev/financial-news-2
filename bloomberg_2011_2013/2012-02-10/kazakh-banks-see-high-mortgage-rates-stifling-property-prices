Kazakh property prices will probably
stagnate as weak purchasing power depresses demand for housing,
the central bank said in a  quarterly survey  of banks.  Stricter lending conditions, including high  mortgage rates ,
are hindering home loans, the Almaty-based National Bank of
Kazakhstan said in the report published on its website today.
Fifty percent of the lenders that responded said mortgage demand
will remain unchanged in the first quarter, while 37 percent
expect an insignificant increase, according to the survey.  Kazakhstan’s 38 banks posted a combined profit of 38.9
billion tenge ($262 million) last year,  according  to the central
bank’s financial oversight committee. The banks set aside 3.3
trillion tenge against bad loans, led by Kazkommertsbank and
state-owned  BTA Bank (BTAS) , which is seeking to restructure debt for
the second time in as many years.  Thirty-seven of the nation’s banks responded to the survey,
with 65 percent saying they expect the quality of their loan
holdings to remain unchanged in the first quarter and 27 percent
forecasting an insignificant improvement.  About 76 percent of respondents said the pace of corporate
foreclosures will stay the same, with 18 percent predicting an
insignificant increase. Eighty-eight percent said the pace of
foreclosures on loans to individuals will stay the same, and 9.4
percent expect an insignificant increase.  The lenders surveyed by the central bank were asked to
choose among five possible answers: significant increase,
insignificant increase, no change, insignificant decrease and
significant decrease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
