U.S. retail sales of video-game
hardware, software and accessories tumbled 34 percent in January
to $750.6 million from a year earlier, researcher NPD Group Inc.
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Sales a year ago were $1.14 billion, when the industry
benefited from titles such as “Dead Space 2” and “Little Big
Planet 2,” NPD reported.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Xbox 360 led the console category with
sales of 270,000 units, down from 381,000 a year ago, David Dennis, a product manager for the company, said in an interview,
citing NPD data.  “We’ve shown that we can deliver new experiences by
updating the Xbox experience with new software,” Dennis said.
“We’re bringing more value to the 360, we’re bringing more
experiences with Kinect and new software. It’s like every year
there’s a new Xbox.”  Dennis declined to comment on reports that the Redmond,
Washington-based company will introduce a new console in June at
the annual E3 video-game industry show.  Retail sales of packaged video games have fallen sharply in
the past year as consumers purchase games for play on
smartphones and social networks such as Facebook Inc., NPD
reported.  The  Port Washington , New York-based research firm estimates
sales of games through alternative channels accounted for an
additional $350 million to $400 million.  Sony Corp. (6758)  had “solid results” for the PlayStation 3 in
January with retailer promotions such as “Play Days” helping
increase sales for the console and its peripherals, said Patrick Seybold, a spokesman, in an e-mailed statement.  The Tokyo-based company plans to begin selling its
PlayStation Vita handheld console in the U.S. and  Europe  on Feb.
