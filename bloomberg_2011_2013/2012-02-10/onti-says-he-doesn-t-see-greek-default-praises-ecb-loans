Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said he doesn’t see  Greece  defaulting or leaving the
euro, and that a deal to extend another aid package to the
nation is within reach.  “It’s far from true that there will be a Greek
default. I believe there will not be,” he said today in an
interview with CNBC television. “Default or not, I don’t
see Greece leaving the euro.”  He said that Italy’s fate is no longer seen as linked
to that of Greece and that investors should not be
concerned that  economic changes  his government is
implementing will be undone when he leaves power next year.  Monti said that the  European Central Bank ’s decision
to extend unlimited three-year loans to banks is a “smart
move” and “perfectly inside the mandate.” The lending is
easing concerns about bank funding and allowing banks to
buy more sovereign debt, creating a “virtuous” circle
that has brought down bond yields.  The yield on  Italy ’s benchmark 10-year bond has fallen
by 118 basis points to 5.61 percent since the ECB extended
489 billion euros ($645 billion) in three-year loans on
Dec. 21.  Monti also urged all Europeans who share the common
currency to approach Greece’s fiscal problems
constructively.  “It would be a terrible paradox if the euro, which
was meant to unite us, further were to become a divisive
innovation,” Monti said on CNBC. “This division is to
some extent occurring, unfortunately, in terms of mindset,
in terms of antagonizing different countries, in terms of
resentment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
