Belgium ’s planning bureau cut its
forecast for 2012 economic growth as government austerity
measures hurt  consumer spending , complicating Prime Minister
Elio Di Rupo’s task of meeting his deficit goal.  Growth in the Belgian economy shouldn’t exceed 0.1 percent
this year, the Brussels-based agency said today in an e-mailed
 statement , compared with its September forecast of 1.6 percent.  The slower growth means Di Rupo’s government needs to find
as much as 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in spending cuts or
new revenue in order to meet its budget-deficit target of 2.8
percent of gross domestic product, L’Echo and De Tijd reported
today. Belgium entered a recession last year, with the economy
shrinking 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter and 0.1 percent in
the third.  “In 2012, quarterly growth in the Belgian economy should
remain very modest given the very gradual recovery of the
European economy and fiscal consolidation measures decided by
the federal government,” the planning bureau said. “Economic
activity should stabilize in the first quarter, and then show
weak export-led growth” over the rest of the year.  Belgian  consumer confidence  dropped to the lowest in two
and a half years last month as consumers faced inflation
accelerating to 3.7 percent boosted by higher gasoline prices
and a record price of diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
