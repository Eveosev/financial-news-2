U.S. stocks  declined as concern that
Europe’s plan to rescue Greece is unraveling gave the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index its first weekly loss in 2012.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  fell 4.4 percent this week and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
slumped 1.9 percent,  leading losses  in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  since Feb. 3, as investors sold shares of companies most
tied to economic growth. Commodity producers and financial
companies had the biggest drop out of 10 groups in the  S&P 500 .
TripAdvisor Inc. lost 15 percent, the largest slump in the S&P
500, after fourth-quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,342.64 this week. It had
advanced  five straight weeks , the longest rally in more than a
year. The measure is up 6.8 percent this year, the best annual
start since 1991. The Dow slumped 61 points, or 0.5 percent, to
12,801.23 this week, pulling back after reaching its highest
level since May 2008 on Feb. 9.  “People were thinking the issues in  Greece  were nearing
resolution, and now it looks as far off as ever,”  John Carey , a
Boston-based  money manager  at Pioneer Investments, said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees about $220 billion. “You
still have that uncertainty overhanging the market. People may
be taking more of a wait-and-see approach again.”  The S&P 500 erased a weekly gain yesterday after euro-area
finance ministers refused to approve a 130 billion-euro ($173
billion) rescue package until Greece backs austerity measures.
George Karatzaferis, who leads one of Greece’s coalition
parties, said he won’t vote for proposed budget cuts. Concern
the European debt crisis would trigger a global recession drove
the index down 19 percent between April and October. It has
risen 22 percent since then.  Consumer Sentiment  Stocks also retreated yesterday after U.S. consumer
confidence decreased more than forecast. The  Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index  of sentiment
dropped to 72.5 from 75 in January. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for 74.8.  The S&P 500 advanced earlier this week amid optimism
Greece’s government made progress on measures to secure
international aid.  “U.S. stock pickers over the last six to eight weeks have
been relatively complacent over what’s going on in  Europe ,”
Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at Los Angeles-based
TCW Group Inc., which manages $120 billion, said in during an
interview on “Street Smart” on Bloomberg Television. “There
is a significant decline which has to happen.”  100% in Equities  Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc., the
world’s largest money manager, urged investors earlier this week
in  Hong Kong  to “be 100 percent in equities.” He later said in
Beijing his call was aimed at getting cash back into the  capital
markets .  “It’s important to get cash off the sidelines and back
into the markets so people can get the returns they need and we
can get our economies moving again,” Fink said in Beijing. His
firm manages $3.5 trillion in assets. “Too many people are
underweight equities, and one of things I’m trying to do is to
get people to think about the opportunities they’re missing,
with valuations at these levels.”  Commodity companies in the S&P 500 slumped 2.2 percent as a
group, while financial stocks lost 1.2 percent. Alcoa, the
largest U.S. aluminum producer, erased 4.4 percent to $10.29 for
the biggest Dow loss. Caterpillar, the largest construction and
mining-equipment maker, sank 1.9 percent to $111.75.  Travel Recommendations  TripAdvisor (TRIP)  declined 15 percent to $30.04 for the biggest
drop in the S&P 500. The online travel-recommendation service
spun off from Expedia Inc. in December reported fourth-quarter
profit excluding some items that missed the average analyst
estimate by 21 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At
least three analysts downgraded the stock.  Western Union Co. (WU)  slid 11 percent to $17.59. The world’s
largest money-transfer business  forecast earnings  in 2012 will
be no more than $1.75 a share, less than the average analyst
estimate of $1.81.  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the largest daily-deal site, tumbled the most
since November after reporting a tax-related fourth-quarter loss
that analysts hadn’t predicted. Groupon fell 14 percent to
$21.03 after reporting a loss, excluding certain costs, of 2
cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had projected
profit of 3 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
