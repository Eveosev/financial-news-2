Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-largest oil
company, is looking “very closely” at investment opportunities
in Kurdistan where contract terms are superior to those on offer
in Iraq, Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said.  “It’s a place where there are important oil and gas
reserves and contracts are better” than Iraq, de Margerie said
today at a press conference in Paris. Total is looking to see
whether there are “interesting” exploration blocks in
Kurdistan, he said.  The authorities in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of
northern Iraq, home to about 40 percent of the country’s 115
billion barrels of reserves, angered  Baghdad  by signing a
contract with Exxon Mobil Corp. The central government has so
far refused to recognize production-sharing agreements between
foreign companies and the Kurds.  “Kurdistan is in  Iraq  and it’s up to Iraqis to decide
among themselves” whether agreements should be separate, de
Margerie said.  Iraq plans to auction 12 exploration areas as part of its
fourth bidding round. The concessions, seven for oil and five
for gas, cover 90,700 square kilometers, according to an Oil
Ministry statement in April. Total has signed contracts in
previous bidding rounds.  The latest auction “doesn’t appear very attractive,” de
Margerie said. “The reward for investment doesn’t appear for
the moment to be enough.”  Companies operating in the Kurdish region are banned from
participating in the planned auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
