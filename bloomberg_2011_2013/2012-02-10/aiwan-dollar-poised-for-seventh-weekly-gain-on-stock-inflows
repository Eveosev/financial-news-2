Taiwan ’s government bonds had their
first weekly drop in a month on signs the island’s recovery will
withstand  Europe ’s debt crisis. Taiwan’s dollar fell.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.91 percent in 2012,
according to the statistics bureau, compared with an official
preliminary estimate of a 4 percent increase last year. The
currency snapped a six-week rally after European finance
ministers held back a rescue package for  Greece , renewing
concern the indebted nation may have to exit the euro.  “Some people may be thinking the economy’s not doing that
bad after all,” said George Pu, a Taipei-based fixed-income
trader at Sinopac Securities Corp.  “Yields are edging
higher.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
2017, the most-traded  government securities , rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.949 percent this week,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate was little
changed today. Benchmark five-year yields could test 1 percent,
Pu said.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.2 percent today and 0.1
percent this week to NT$29.56 against its U.S. counterpart,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.370
today, its strongest level since Sept. 13.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped one basis point for the week to
0.397 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
