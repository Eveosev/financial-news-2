The U.K.’s five-biggest consumer
banks met their commitments to government to boost lending to
businesses in 2011, the British Bankers’ Association said.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Santander (SAN)  U.K., provided 214.9 billion
pounds ($339 billion) in gross new lending, fulfiling the so-
called Merlin agreement with the government, the lobby group
said in a statement today. The figure includes 74.9 billion
pounds of loans to small and medium-sized companies, the BBA
said.  The five lenders promised the government last year to
provide gross new credit of 190 billion pounds to businesses,
including 76 billion pounds to small firms with revenue of less
than 25 million pounds.  Politicians have criticized banks for failing to boost
credit after accepting about 1 trillion pounds in bailouts and
guarantees following the 2008 financial crisis. Banks say the
lending slowdown is largely the result of a drop in demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
