Transfield Services Ltd. (TSE)  jumped the
most in more than two years in Sydney trading after the
Australian provider of services to the oil and gas industry
confirmed it expects full-year profit will be at least 17
percent higher than analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  climbed 11 percent to A$2.19 at 1:53 p.m. in
Sydney, the most since August 2009. They’ve advanced 1.2 percent
this year, compared with a 5.1 percent gain in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index.  Net income for the year ending June 30 will be at the lower
end of its forecast range of between A$130 million ($140
million) and A$135 million, the Sydney-based company said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange today. Analysts
forecast a profit of A$111.5 million, according to a median of
14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors were concerned they’d come out with a weak
result and have to downgrade full-year guidance,” said Will Seddon, who helps oversee A$300 million at White Funds
Management in Sydney. “So this is a relief.”  First-half profit in the six months to Dec. 31 was A$44
million, the company said. Earnings will be skewed to the second
half, with 60 percent of profit for the year in the period, due
to weather-related reasons, it said. The company will release
its full first-half earnings report on Feb. 22.  “Key risks include the economy outside the resources
sector continuing to soften and the weather,” Managing Director
Peter Goode said in the statement. “While the macro environment
remains mixed, we’ve worked on our performance and focused on
growth sectors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
