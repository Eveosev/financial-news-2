Brazil  is excluding small and mid-
sized banks that arenâ€™t focused on credit from an initiative to
provide them with additional funding.  Under rules published today, lenders must maintain credit
or leasing equivalent to at least 20 percent of assets to be
eligible for funding from bigger banks through a temporary
reserve requirement program announced in December. Policy makers
are encouraging bigger lenders to use a portion of their
reserves requirements to buy loan portfolios and bonds from
small- and mid-sized banks.  Starting Feb. 24, big banks will earn no interest on as
much as 27 percent of their  reserve requirements  on  time
deposits . The funds can be used to buy loans or bonds from
financial institutions with equity below 2.2 billion reais ($1.3
billion). That threshold will gradually grow to 36 percent in
August. The relief program ends June 2014, according to an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
