U.S. corn stockpiles in the 2011-12
marketing year will tighten further and price gains will outpace
increases in other commodities in six months, Goldman Sachs
said.  Corn will rise 9 percent in six months, Goldman said in an
e-mailed report dated yesterday. U.S. inventories are expected
by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  to fall to 20.3 million
metric tons, the lowest level in 16 years. Global stockpiles may
fall to the lowest since 2006-07, according to the USDA.
Soybeans may gain 6 percent to $12.90 a bushel on reduced South
American production, Goldman said.  “We expect further tightening of the 2011-12 U.S. corn
balance, lower South American corn and soybean production and a
2012-13 U.S. soybean balance in deficit,” New York-based
analyst Damien Courvalin said. “Corn prices will remain high
relative to other crops in coming months in order to secure
sufficient acreage gains in the U.S. to help rebuild U.S.
inventories.”  Corn futures have declined 11 percent in the past year,
partly on speculation that demand would decline amid economic
crises in the U.S. and European Union. Soybeans declined 15
percent and wheat has plunged 26 percent.  Soybean acreage may suffer as farmers plant corn in the
U.S., Goldman said. Dry weather in Brazil and  Argentina  will
reduce production of both crops, improving export demand for
inventories from the U.S., according to the report.  Because of the increased corn planting in the U.S., the
biggest exporter of the grain, prices may decline after the
harvest in August and September. Gains in soybean futures are
expected to outpace corn in the 12-month timeframe, Goldman said
in the report. Corn may drop to $5.25 a bushel in a year while
soybeans may rise to $12.90 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
