Angola will send an envoy to  South
Sudan  next week to negotiate an oil deal for state-owned oil
company Sonangol EP, Novo Jornal reported, citing an
unidentified company official.  President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has asked Lopo do
Nascimento, a former Angolan prime minister, to travel to South
Sudan’s capital of Juba to discuss Sonangol’s access to an oil
block once owned by oil company Elf, the weekly newspaper said.  Sonangol has already won a tender to operate an oil field
in South Sudan, Novo Jornal said, without providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
