Hugo Boss AG (BOS3) , the German luxury
clothing maker, may be able to eliminate net debt as soon as
next year as it increases sales in  Asia  and avoids acquisitions,
Chief Financial Officer Mark Langer said.  The company, controlled by buyout firm Permira Advisers,
may be in “cash positive territory” by 2013 or 2014 and won’t
need any major refinancing, Langer said in an interview at the
company’s headquarters in Metzingen,  Germany . Hugo Boss has cut
borrowings by about 75 percent since 2008.  Net debt  totaled 247
million euros ($328 million) as of Sept. 30 and was “slightly”
below 150 million euros at the end of 2011, Langer said.  The planned reduction of debt won’t affect the clothier’s
investment plans or dividend policy, the executive said. Hugo
Boss plans to spend 60 million euros to 80 million euros a year
opening 50 new stores on three continents and renovating
existing ones. The company  forecasts revenue  of 3 billion euros
by 2015, up from 2.06 billion euros in 2011.  “To build this franchise into a 3 billion-euro business is
purely and only driven by aggressively pursuing growth
opportunities that exist under the  Hugo Boss  brand,” Langer
said, adding that the company doesn’t need acquisitions.  The main thrust for growth will be Asia, and more
specifically  China , according to the executive. Hugo Boss plans
to open as many as 20 stores a year in China and expects sales
in Asia to represent more than 20 percent of group sales by
2015, compared with 13 percent at the end of 2010.  ‘Quite Confident’  “We’re quite confident that this trend of up to 20 new
openings on an annual basis will continue in China for the near
future,” Langer said. The company owned 179 stores in the Asia-
Pacific region as of the end of September.  Hugo Boss, which yesterday reported a 26 percent gain in
fourth-quarter operating profit, is confident about the outlook
for its business in  Europe , Langer said.  “We don’t foresee any plans for store closures in
Europe,” he said. Some European retailers are shuttering stores
as the region’s debt crisis restricts  consumer spending . Langer
said he’s happy with sales in Spain and  Italy .  Hugo Boss  forecasts revenue  earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of 3 billion euros by 2015 as it
opens more shops and increases sales in Asia and the U.S.  Langer said he will increase free  cash flow  through
“profitable growth” and “tight capital management.”  The clothier expects retailing to overtake wholesaling as
its biggest source of revenue, Langer said. The retail unit will
represent about 55 percent of sales by 2015 as about 50 stores a
year are opened in Asia, Europe and the U.S., he said.  ‘Long-Term Investment’  Permira (BOS3) , which has controlled Hugo Boss since 2007, views
the company “as a long-term investment,” Langer said.  The buyout firm said in November it will sell 4.5 million
shares, or about 6.4 percent of the stock, to institutional
shareholders, reducing its holding to 66 percent. Permira said
at the time that it wasn’t the start of an exit process.  Hugo Boss preferred shares rose 1.3 percent to 78.29 euros
as of 11:02 a.m. in  Frankfurt , extending their advance this year
to 38 percent. Hugo Boss is the  steepest gainer  in the Bloomberg
European Fashion Index in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
