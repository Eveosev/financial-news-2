Barclays Capital, the securities
unit of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , cut the amount it paid to employees by 9
percent in 2011, drawing criticism from investors as investment
banking profit shrank.  The unit gave employees an average of 203,750 pounds
($322,150), compared with 223,340 pounds in 2010 and 191,000
pounds in 2009, company filings show. The payments include
salary, bonuses and pensions. The lender limited cash bonuses at
65,000 pounds and said it will cut remuneration for its top
executives by almost half.  The cut “is not the signal of the change required in order
to improve the investment case,” said  Robert Talbut , investment
committee chairman at the Association of British Insurers, whose
members control 1.7 trillion pounds of equities. “This appears
to be very close to business as usual.”  Barclays and other U.K. banks have been under pressure from
investors and politicians to show restraint on pay after the
U.K. economy contracted in the fourth quarter and unemployment
rose to a 16-year high.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  Chief
Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  last month waived his bonus
after the U.K. opposition  Labour Party  said it would ask
Parliament to vote on the award. Barclays CEO  Robert Diamond 
declined to comment on the size of his bonus today.  Discretionary awards at Barclays Capital fell 30 percent to
an average 64,000 pounds in 2011, while base pay rose 6 percent
to about 139,750 pounds in the period, Barclays said.  ‘So Much Pressure’  “There’s been so much pressure exerted on them that
they’ve had to make a move,” said  Paul Mumford , who manages 650
million pounds at Cavendish Asset Management in  London ,
including Barclays shares. “I would hope the bigger hit is on
the obscene bonuses at the top, rather than the smaller ones at
the bottom.”  Barclays, Britain’s third-biggest bank, said full-year
profit fell 16 percent as investment-banking revenue shrank. Net
income for 2011 fell to 3 billion pounds from 3.56 billion
pounds a year earlier at the London-based bank. That was lower
than the 3.27 billion-pound median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Barclays Capital  allocated 4.89 billion pounds for pay,
bonuses and pensions for the 24,000 employees at Barclays
Capital in 2011, down from 5.54 billion pounds split between
24,800 employees for 2010.  Annual pay for executive directors and the eight highest-
paid senior executives will decline 48 percent, the lender said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
