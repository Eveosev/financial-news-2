Indian stocks dropped, paring their
weekly advance, after government data showed factory production
climbed less than estimated in December.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the nation’s biggest company,
fell the most in two weeks.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the
aluminum maker that controls U.S.-based Novelis Inc., sank 3.9
percent.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the largest carmaker, dropped
for the first time in three days.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.5 percent
to 17,748.69 at the 3:30 p.m. close, paring its weekly advance
to 0.8 percent. The gauge has risen for six weeks, its longest
such run in 21 months, as foreign funds bought a net $4 billion
of equities this year, compared with an outflow of $512 million
in 2011. Factory  output  climbed 1.8 percent in December from a
year earlier, missing the 2.6 percent median of 23 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg News.  “Investors are taking money off the table as industrial
production data has disappointed,” said Kaushik Dani, a  fund
manager  at Peerless Mutual Fund, which has an equivalent of $884
million in assets. “The rally was driven by liquidity. Not much
has changed fundamentally.”  The deterioration in factory production may fan concern the
nation’s growth is slowing after the government this week
forecast the weakest economic expansion since 2009. The central
bank has signaled cuts in funding costs to shield the economy if
inflation eases further, with a decline in Chinese exports in
January underscoring the threat to Asian expansion from Europe’s
protracted debt crisis.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India lost 0.6 percent to 5,381.60. The  BSE 200 Index  fell from
a six-month high, losing 0.4 percent to 2,181.79.  Earnings Report  Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s largest refining
complex, decreased 1.2 percent to 843.25 rupees. Hindalco sank
3.9 percent to 152.9 rupees. Maruti lost 2 percent to 1,244.6.  Eleven out of 21, or 52 percent, of Sensex companies have
posted December-quarter profits that missed analyst  estimates ,
compared with 40 percent in the September quarter.  Still, foreign  funds  bought a net  $294.3 million  of stocks
yesterday, data from the market regulator show. Offshore funds
have been net buyers on all but three days this year, as the
rupee rebounded from a record low, the central bank eased its
policy for the first time since 2009 and inflation slowed.  Emerging-market stocks have had their best start to a year
since 2001 after European countries agreed to tighter controls
and as policy makers from  Brazil  to the Philippines cut funding
costs to stoke economic growth. Emerging stock funds lured $5.8
billion in the week ended Feb. 8, the most since mid-October
2010, according to a report by Citigroup Inc. today.  Europe Outlook  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the nation’s biggest producer which gets
about two-thirds of its sales from Europe, jumped 5.1 percent to
475.05 rupees, its most in a month as prospects for higher
prices and lower input costs attracted investors undeterred by a
loss from writing down inventory.  “There’s a strong feeling that a recovery in Europe can
happen quicker than expected,” said  Jagannadham Thunuguntla ,
chief strategist at New Delhi-based SMC Global Securities Ltd.
“With that hope, investors seem to be taking every bad news in
their stride.”  Tata Steel yesterday reported a  loss  of 6.03 billion rupees
($121 million) for the December quarter, following a one-time
charge of about 7.4 billion rupees at Tata Steel  Europe  Ltd. and
other units due to a decline in prices. The loss contrasts with
a 10-billion rupee profit a year earlier, and a median net
income of 2.57 billion rupee estimated in a Bloomberg survey of
28 analysts.  The Sensex, which slumped 25 percent in 2011 amid concern
high borrowing costs, a falling rupee and accelerating consumer
prices, trades at 15.7 times estimated profits, compared with
19.4 times at end of 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is
valued at 10.4 times, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
