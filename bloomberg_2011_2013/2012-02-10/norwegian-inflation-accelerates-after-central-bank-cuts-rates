Norwegian underlying inflation
accelerated for the first time in five months after the central
bank cut interest rates to stimulate growth.  The annual  underlying inflation  rate, adjusted for taxes,
fees and energy prices, rose to 1.3 percent in January from 1
percent a month earlier, Oslo-based  Statistics Norway  said
today. That compares with the 1.2 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 12 economists. Underlying consumer prices
fell 0.6 percent from December, the office said.  The central bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  by 50
basis points to 1.75 percent in December, the first reduction
since June 2009, as slowing growth in continental  Europe  weighs
on exports. Norwayâ€™s manufacturing industry grew in January for
the first time in three months, while retail sales rose an
annual 2.6 percent in December and credit growth was 6.7
percent.  Norges Bank policy makers meet on March 14 to decide on
interest rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
