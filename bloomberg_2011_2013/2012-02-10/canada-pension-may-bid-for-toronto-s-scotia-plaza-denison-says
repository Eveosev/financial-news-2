Canada  Pension Plan Investment
Board, the country’s second-biggest pension fund, may consider
bidding for  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s Scotia Plaza office tower in
Toronto, Chief Executive Officer David Denison said.  “We obviously will look at it, no question,” Denison said
today in a telephone interview from Toronto. “We will look at
it and determine whether we want to put an offer in.”  Bank of Nova Scotia  said last month it may sell the Toronto
office tower, the corporate headquarters for Canada’s third-
biggest bank. The 68-floor office building is the second-tallest
in Canada after First Canadian Place, Bank of Montreal’s head
office.  “Any time an asset like that in Toronto or in  New York  or
wherever one of the key markets is comes available,” the fund
will take a look, Denison said. “They don’t come up for sale
very often.”  The sale of the office building at 40 King St. West in the
heart of Toronto’s financial district would help boost the
bank’s regulatory capital ahead of 2013 deadlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
