The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for Dec. released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the  Department of Commerce , announced
today that total December exports of $178.8 billion and
imports of $227.6 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $48.8 billion, up from $47.1 billion in
November, revised.  December exports were $1.2 billion
more than November exports of $177.5 billion.  December
imports were $3.0 billion more than November imports of
$224.6 billion.  In December, the goods deficit increased $1.8 billion from
November to $64.3 billion, and the services surplus was
virtually unchanged from November at $15.5 billion.
Exports of goods increased $0.9 billion to $127.1 billion,
and imports of goods increased $2.7 billion to $191.4
billion.  Exports of services increased $0.3 billion to
$51.7 billion, and imports of services increased $0.3
billion to $36.2 billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $8.3 billion from
December 2010 to December 2011.  Exports were up $14.8
billion, or 9.0 percent, and imports were up $23.1
billion, or 11.3 percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The November to December increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($1.0 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines
($0.7 billion); other goods ($0.3 billion); and foods,
feeds, and beverages  ($0.2 billion). Decreases occurred in  consumer goods  ($1.0
billion) and capital goods ($0.2 billion).  The November to December increase in imports of goods
reflected increases in capital goods ($1.0 billion);
consumer goods ($0.9 billion); automotive vehicles, parts,
and engines ($0.5 billion); and industrial supplies and
materials ($0.3 billion). A decrease occurred in foods,
feeds, and beverages ($0.1 billion). Other goods were
virtually unchanged.  The December 2010 to December 2011 increase in exports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($6.0 billion); capital goods ($2.2 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.8 billion);
consumer goods ($0.1 billion); other goods ($0.1 billion);
and foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.1 billion).
The December 2010 to December 2011 increase in imports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($9.2 billion); capital goods ($4.7 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($3.1 billion);
consumer goods ($2.1 billion); foods, feeds, and beverages
($1.1 billion); and other goods ($0.3 billion).  Services  Exports of services increased $0.3 billion from November
to December.  The increase was mostly accounted for by
increases in royalties and license fees and travel.
Changes in the other categories of services exports were
small.  Imports of services increased $0.3 billion from
November to December.  The increase was mostly accounted
for by increases in travel, other transportation (which
includes freight and port services), and passenger fares.
Changes in the other categories of services imports were
small.  The December 2010 to December 2011 increase in
exports of services was $4.0 billion. The largest
increases were in royalties and license fees ($1.5
billion), travel ($0.9 billion), and other private
services ($0.8 billion), which includes items such as
business, professional, and technical services, insurance
services, and financial services.  Within other private
services the largest increase was in business,
professional, and technical services.  The December 2010 to December 2011 increase in
imports of services was $2.4 billion. The largest
increases were in other private services ($1.1 billion),

and services averaged $178.5 billion, while imports of
goods and services averaged $224.8 billion, resulting in
an average trade deficit of $46.3 billion.  For the three
months ending in November, the average trade deficit was
$44.6 billion, reflecting average exports of $179.1
billion and average imports of $223.8 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The December figures show surpluses, in billions of

of this release.  NOTICE  Effective with the release of the January 2012 statistics
on March 9, 2012, the U.S. Census Bureau (Census) and the
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will implement the
following changes:  Changes to the Real (Chain-Weighted Dollar) Series  Census will begin seasonally adjusting selected export and
import prices that previously were not seasonally
adjusted.  These prices are used in calculating the chain-
weighted dollar series that are presented in Exhibits 10
and 11.  Chain-weighted dollar statistics for 2010 and
2011 will be revised to reflect this new procedure.  This change will improve the overall quality of the chain-
weighted dollar series by removing identified seasonal
patterns.  This change also improves consistency between
the Census chain-weighted dollar data and the chain-
weighted dollar data published by BEA in the National
Income and Product Accounts.  For information on recent
changes to BEA's seasonal adjustment procedures, see
``Annual Revision of the National Income and Product
Accounts'' in the August 2011 Survey of Current Business,
