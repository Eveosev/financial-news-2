President  Barack Obama  will request
$308 million to fund the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission , the main U.S. derivatives regulator, in the 2013
fiscal year, according to a person briefed on the budget request
scheduled to be announced Feb. 13.  The CFTC’s budget has been the focus of a debate between
Democrats seeking additional resources to complete Dodd-Frank
Act rules and Republicans trying to reduce the agency’s spending
as part of a broader effort to rein in deficits. The $308
million request would be a 50 percent increase from the agency’s
current $205 million budget.  Congress rejected Obama’s request last year for a $308-
million budget. Lawmakers didn’t consider legislation setting
user fees on the industry to help support the agency.  The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission are leading
U.S. efforts to write new rules for the  derivatives market  after
largely unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.
The agencies have set a goal to complete the regulations this
year.  Reuters reported earlier on the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
