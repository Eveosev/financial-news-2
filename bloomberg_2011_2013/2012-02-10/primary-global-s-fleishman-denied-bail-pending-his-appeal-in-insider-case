Former Primary Global Research LLC
executive James Fleishman, convicted of taking part in an
insider-trading scheme, will have to report to prison this month
to start serving a 2 1/2-year sentence after losing a bid for
bail pending appeal.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York today denied
Fleishman’s request to remain free while it considers the
challenge to his conviction on two conspiracy charges.  Fleishman is accused of participating in a scheme to obtain
and pass along confidential information from technology company
employees who moonlighted as consultants for  Mountain View ,
California-based Primary Global, a so-called expert-networking
firm. The tips were given to fund managers who paid Primary
Global for consultation calls, prosecutors said.  In December, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan
denied Fleishman’s request to dismiss his conviction or grant
him a new trial.  The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-cr-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
