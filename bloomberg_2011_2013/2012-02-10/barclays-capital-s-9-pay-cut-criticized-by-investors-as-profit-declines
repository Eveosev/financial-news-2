Barclays Capital , the securities
unit of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , cut the amount it paid to employees by 9
percent in 2011, drawing criticism from investors as investment
banking profit shrank.  The unit gave employees an average of 203,750 pounds
($322,150), compared with 223,340 pounds in 2010 and 191,000
pounds in 2009, filings show. The figure includes salary,
bonuses and pensions. Annual pay for executive directors and the
eight highest-paid senior executives will fall 48 percent.  The cut “is not the signal of the change required in order
to improve the investment case,” said  Robert Talbut , investment
committee chairman at the Association of British Insurers, whose
members oversee 1.7 trillion pounds of stocks. “This appears to
be very close to business as usual.”  Barclays and other U.K. banks have been under pressure from
investors and politicians to show restraint on pay after the
U.K. economy contracted in the fourth quarter and unemployment
rose to a 16-year high.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  Chief
Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  last month waived his bonus
after the U.K. opposition  Labour Party  said it would ask
Parliament to vote on the award.  Barclays CEO  Robert Diamond  declined to comment on the size
of his bonus today after receiving a 6.5 million-pound award
last year.  Discretionary awards at Barclays Capital fell 30 percent to
an average 64,000 pounds in 2011, the company said in a
statement today. About 75 percent of the Barclays Capital bonus
pool will be deferred for as long as three years, Still, base
pay rose 6 percent to about 139,750 pounds in the period.  ‘So Much Pressure’  “There’s been so much pressure exerted on them that
they’ve had to make a move,” said  Paul Mumford , who manages 650
million pounds at Cavendish Asset Management in London,
including Barclays shares. “I would hope the bigger hit is on
the obscene bonuses at the top, rather than the smaller ones at
the bottom.”  Barclays, Britain’s third-biggest bank, said full-year
profit fell 16 percent as investment-banking revenue shrank. Net
income for 2011 fell to 3 billion pounds from 3.56 billion
pounds a year earlier, missing the 3.27 billion-pound median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Barclays Capital allocated 4.89 billion pounds for pay,
bonuses and pensions for the 24,000 employees at Barclays
Capital in 2011, down from 5.54 billion pounds split between
24,800 employees for 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
