Japanese  stocks  declined, sending
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average Down for a second day, as European
finance ministers withheld a bailout for Greece, putting
lawmakers in  Athens  under pressure to endorse a newly crafted
austerity plan or exit the euro.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a maker of video-game consoles that gets 34
percent of its sales in  Europe , slid 0.7 percent.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) ,
a construction machinery maker that generates 23 percent of its
sales in  China , fell 2.2 percent as a report showed mainland
exports declined for the first time in more than two years.
 Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  and  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  led shippers
higher after JPMorgan Chase & Co. lifted their ratings.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.6 percent to 8,947.17
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index
lost 0.7 percent to 779.07, rising 2.4 percent on the week as
some of the nation’s biggest companies including Toyota Motor Co.
and  Japan  Tobacco Inc. raised forecasts.  “ Greece  reached some sort of agreement, but it’s still up
for negotiation whether the rest of the European authorities
will accept that agreement,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-
based head of investment markets research at Colonial First
State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150 billion.
“It was a positive step last night, but only a small one and
there’s a long way to go.”  Greek Bailout  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.4 percent
today. The gauge rose 0.2 percent in New York yesterday after
Labor Department figures showed applications for jobless
benefits fell 15,000 last week to 358,000.  European finance chiefs’ refusal to deliver the bailout
reflects frustration with Greece’s bickering politicians and the
prospect that they may again backtrack on austerity measures not
yet passed into law. Prime Minister Lucas Papademos yesterday
agreed with political parties on budget cuts required for the
130-billion-euro ($172) financing package. The deal has yet to
be voted on.  “In short: no disbursement without implementation,”
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said in Brussels
late yesterday after chairing emergency talks of euro-area
policy makers. He set another extraordinary meeting for Feb. 15.  Nintendo Co. (7974)  fell 0.7 percent to 10,830 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
camera maker that gets 31 percent of its revenue in Europe,
dropped 1.3 percent to 3,415 yen.  China Slowdown  Komatsu dropped 2.2 percent to 2,127 yen as a report showed
China’s exports fell 15.3 percent in January while imports slide
0.5 percent last month from a year earlier. The nation’s
inflation unexpectedly climbed 4.5 percent last month, damping
prospects for the central bank to ease lending.  “The key is whether there’s going to be a slowdown in that
economy and whether the authorities will respond to that,”
Colonial First State’s Halmarick said. “Yesterday the inflation
number in China was clearly a little bit on the high side, but
most people accepted that was due to temporary factors” during
the holidays.  Lenders fell on expectations the  Bank of Japan  will refrain
from additional monetary easing on Feb. 14 because of signs of
strength in the global economy and the boost from reconstruction
after March’s disasters, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Banks Decline  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender,
slid 2.8 percent to 385 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) , the second-largest bank by market value, fell 2.4 percent
to 2,544 yen.  Japan’s two biggest shipping companies by sales gained
after JPMorgan boosted the equity ratings to “overweight” from
“neutral.”  Nippon Yusen  gained 1.3 percent to 229 yen and Mitsui O.S.K.
advanced 1.2 percent to 339 yen. Shippers also got a boost after
the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a gauge of cargo rates, advanced 2.8
percent yesterday, rising for a fourth day.  The Topix’s  shipping lines  industry group trades at 0.66
times book value, compared with 0.95 times for the broader index.
A number below 1 means that companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 6.9 percent this year amid optimism the
 U.S. economy  is weathering the European debt crisis and central
banks will relax monetary policy to spur growth. Of the 1,290
companies in the index that have reported earnings since Jan. 9,
241 missed analysts’ estimates while 119 beat them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index  rose 0.5 percent to 21.01,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
