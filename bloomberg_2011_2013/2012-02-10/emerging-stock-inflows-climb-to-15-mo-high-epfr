Emerging-market equity funds took in
the most cash in more than 15 months in the week ended Feb. 8,
as indications  Greece  would forge a bailout deal and better-
than-estimated U.S. unemployment data buoyed markets, according
to EPFR Global.  The funds saw inflows of $5.8 billion during the week ended
Feb. 8, the most since October 2010, according to a report e-
mailed today by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR. The surge
brought net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds in
2012 to $17 billion, compared with outflows of $11.4 billion for
the same period of 2011.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
absorbed a record $5.4 billion of the new commitments to overall
developing-nation funds, the report showed. The average
emerging-market equity portfolio recorded a 2.7 percent gain,
 Cameron Brandt , EPFR’s director of research, said by phone.  Funds dedicated to the biggest emerging markets of  Brazil ,
 Russia , India and China saw their biggest weekly inflows since
the end of 2009. Emerging-market stock funds posted a net
outflow of $48 billion in 2011, Brandt said.  Inflows into emerging-market bond funds amassed a record
$2.14 billion of flows in the week, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
