Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKAN) , the biggest
of  Switzerland ’s publicly owned cantonal banks, is “confident”
it will find a solution to a U.S. tax investigation, Chief
Executive Officer Martin Scholl said.  “The bank is cooperating fully in the current negotiations
with the U.S. authorities,” Scholl said today at a press
conference. The company hasn’t handed over any client account
information or employee data to the U.S., he said, declining to
comment if ZKB has made any reserves for a possible fine to
resolve the matter.  The U.S. is investigating 11 Swiss financial institutions
suspected of helping Americans hide money from the  Internal
Revenue Service . Switzerland and the U.S. may reach an agreement
on the treatment of undeclared bank accounts within months,
Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said in an
interview on Jan. 28.  Of the 16.4 billion Swiss francs ($18 billion) in net new
money inflows in 2008, when some American clients switched from
banks that were under U.S. scrutiny, a “low-single-digit”
percentage was from U.S. clients, Scholl said.  The Zurich-based bank, which is fully owned by the canton
of Zurich, also reported today that full-year net income rose
5.6 percent to 769 million francs on higher interest income and
net inflows of 12.3 billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
