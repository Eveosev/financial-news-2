AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB)  fell
the most in almost three years after the New York-based money
management firm reported a loss for the fourth quarter and said
clients withdrew $13.2 billion.  The shares tumbled 13 percent to close at $14.35 in New
York trading, the biggest one-day drop since April 23, 2009. The
company reported a loss of $199.5 million, or $1.97 per unit, in
the quarter, compared with a profit of $42.9 million, or 42
cents, in the same period of 2010.  Results for the quarter were dragged down by a one-time
$587 million non-cash charge related to changes in employee
compensation, which had previously been announced.  Over the past four years customers have pulled more than
$200 billion from the firm, much of it coming from the company’s
institutional equity business. In a statement, Chief Executive
Officer  Peter Kraus  referred to the money manager’s “ongoing
investment underperformance in our largest equity services.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
