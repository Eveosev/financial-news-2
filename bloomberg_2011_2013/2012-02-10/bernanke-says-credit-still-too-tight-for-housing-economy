Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said credit is “too tight” for the U.S. housing
market, impeding economic growth.  “Tight credit remains a problem for our economy as well as
for the construction industry,” the Fed chairman said in
response to an audience question after a speech today to the
National Association of Home Builders in Orlando, Florida.  The Fed chairman said some tightening was to be expected in
the aftermath of the U.S. financial crisis, which sent the
economy into an 18-month recession from December 2007 to June
2009, the worst since the Great Depression.  “The pendulum has probably swung too far in the other
direction,” he said. “Conditions are still too tight for the
health of both the financial system, for the  construction
industry  and for our economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
