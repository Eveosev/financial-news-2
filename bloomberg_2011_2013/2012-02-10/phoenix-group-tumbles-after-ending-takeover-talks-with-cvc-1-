Phoenix Group Holdings (PGH) , the U.K.’s
biggest manager of closed life insurance funds, declined by the
most on record in  London  trading after saying it ended takeover
talks with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd.  The stock fell as much 7.8 percent, the most since it began
trading on London Stock Exchange in November 2009, after Phoenix
said in a statement today that CVC’s offer was too low. The
stock was down 5.9 percent at 536 pence at 9:01 a.m. in London.  “The terms proposed by CVC did not reflect our view of the
full value of Phoenix and its stable, long-term cash flows,”
Chief Executive Officer Clive Bannister said in the statement.
Phoenix is not in talks with any other party, it said.  Phoenix, which buys life insurance policies and profits by
releasing capital from them as they mature, has 2.7 billion
pounds of debt, almost half of which matures in 2014, compared
with a market value of 1 billion pounds. The stock is the worst
performer in the  FTSE 350 Life Insurance Index  in the last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
