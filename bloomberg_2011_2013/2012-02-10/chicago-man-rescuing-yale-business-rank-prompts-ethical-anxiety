When Marion McCollom Hampton
graduated from the  Yale School of Management  in 1982, the
program didn’t grant business degrees and she didn’t want one.
Its mission was to train leaders of all sorts, not just
executives, she said.  Yale “was not your father’s business school,” said
Hampton, 61, who works as an adviser to family-owned companies.
“When the school was founded, it had an absolutely unique niche
in the management-school world.”  Yale SOM opened in 1976 with a focus on grooming leaders in
government and philanthropy. Now the school is preparing to take
on Harvard Business School and the Wharton School with a new
$222 million building and new dean -- Edward “Ted” Snyder, who
previously led the University of  Chicago ’s top-ranked business
school. As Yale’s business school sheds its outsider status,
alumni and former faculty worry that it risks losing its unique
qualities just when the business world needs them most.  “I’m not sure that the changes that are being made now are
going to produce the sort of graduate who is going to use that
management and business knowledge to make a difference in the
world,” said Hampton, who turned down the opportunity to
convert her management degree to an MBA. “To make it just
another business school, to me, is a shame.”  Public-Mindedness  Snyder, 58, who took the helm in July, was hired by Yale
University President  Richard Levin  to help raise the business
school to the levels of Yale’s top-ranked schools of law and
medicine. Snyder, who led Chicago’s Booth School of Business for
a decade and the University of Virginia’s business school before
that, said Yale can improve without giving up the public-
mindedness that sets it apart.  Yale SOM trains its graduates to understand the complicated
relationships between business, government and society, Snyder
said in an interview in his New Haven, Connecticut, office.  “The world is facing extraordinarily big issues,” Snyder
said. “Leaders have to be aware of what’s going on. Obviously
they need to be competent in solving business problems but they
need to be in tune with this extraordinarily important layer of
complexity.”  Snyder said his mission is to tell the world what Yale
graduates can offer.  “We’ve got some great people here who can help the world
solve some big problems,” he said.  Top Five  Snyder said he loves competition -- he set a Colby College
record in the triple jump in 1972 -- and he’s determined to
boost Yale SOM’s rankings. He wants it to be one of the top five
U.S. business schools in a decade, he said.  Yale’s full-time MBA program is  ranked 21st  by Bloomberg
Businessweek compared with first for Chicago, second for Harvard
and third for Wharton. Yale graduates’ median base salary was
 $100,000  for the class of 2011, trailing the $120,000 earned by
business school graduates at  Harvard  and Wharton.  While Yale has produced prominent executives like  Indra Nooyi , chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. and a 1980
graduate, it’s escaped the notoriety of high-profile alumni
winding up in prison, such as Harvard’s  Jeffrey Skilling , former
CEO of Enron Corp., and Wharton’s Raj Rajaratnam, a hedge fund
manager convicted of  insider trading .  Snyder won’t try to impose his ideology on Yale faculty,
which would be “suicidal,” said  Steven Kaplan , a finance and
entrepreneurship professor at Chicago Booth. Instead, he’ll
boost the school by identifying its strengths and selling them
to potential students and donors, Kaplan said.  “SOM has a lot more potential than it has currently
reached,” Kaplan said. Snyder “has to figure out how to
position the school and he’ll market that externally.”  Nonprofit, Government Jobs  Yale didn’t offer a masters degree in  business
administration  until 1999, and didn’t phase out its masters of
public and private management until after 2001. While most
graduates take jobs in private industry, 10 percent work for
nonprofit organizations and government, compared with 3 percent
of graduates at  Harvard Business School  and 1 percent at
Wharton.  In the wake of the financial crisis, Harvard Business
School appointed Nitin Nohria as dean in 2010. Nohria, who has
written about ethics, says business students should take a
professional oath of conduct. Harvard also introduced a
leadership course designed to immerse students in real-world
experiences. In 2010, Wharton, part of the  University of
Pennsylvania , said it would overhaul its curriculum with a new
focus on ethics and on global issues.  Yale SOM was at the forefront of introducing those ideas to
business education and should continue to be a leader, said
William Donaldson, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the first dean of Yale SOM.  Advancing the Cause  “There’s a lot of criticisms of business school in
general, as perpetuators of what’s going on that’s bad in
business,” Donaldson said. “Yale has a position where it can
really advance the cause, because it’s Yale and because of the
history of the school.”  Snyder will be boosted by a new 242,000 square-foot
building, designed by  Norman Foster  and set to open in 2013,
which will allow the school to add more students and faculty.
Snyder plans to expand international programs, which he said lag
behind those of other business schools and the rest of the
university.  He also wants Yale to bolster its reputation with corporate
recruiters from top companies. Already, the school is placing
more graduates at businesses such as  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Goldman Sachs
and McKinsey & Co. than in years past, Snyder said.  Teamwork Culture  “The numbers aren’t huge -- they’re going from zeros,
ones, twos and threes to fours and fives and sixes -- but it
makes a huge difference for the school going forward,” Snyder
said. “We’re never going to be a big core school for McKinsey
but are we going to be an accepted source of high-quality
talent? We don’t want that question to come up.”  Barclays went from hiring two graduates from the class of
2010 to seven from the class of 2012, according to the company.  “The thing that really stands out is teamwork,” said Tara
Udut, Barclays Capital’s head of campus recruiting for the
Americas. “It’s part of the overall culture there.”  Alumni worry that to climb in the rankings, Yale SOM will
reorient itself around the world of finance and  Wall Street ,
said Chris LaFarge, who graduated in 1980.  “The rankings are distorting a business school’s ability
to do something outside of the box,” said LaFarge, CEO of
MedicaMetrix Inc., a medical-device company in Wayland,
 Massachusetts . “Yale should be able to get away with it because
it’s Yale.”  ‘Points of Pride’  While rankings don’t tell the whole story about business
schools, they can attract more applicants and please graduates,
said David Schmittlein, dean of the  Sloan School of Management 
at  Massachusetts Institute of Technology .  “Rankings can be points of pride with alumni and the
feelings alumni hold for the school are important,” Schmittlein
said.  Students and faculty will also look to Snyder to provide
stability at an institution that has had little of it, going
through 10 deans in its short history.  While the  Wharton School  was founded in 1881 and Harvard
Business School in 1908,  Yale University ’s faculty and
administration resisted for decades alumni efforts to start a
school they saw as at odds with its humanistic values.  Under Kingman Brewster, Yale’s president from 1963 to 1977,
that resistance began to crumble as the university put more
emphasis on social sciences, including the study of economics
and organizational behavior. The college received a bequest of
$15 million from the estate of  Frederick Beinecke , who died in
1971. Most of the money was directed to the founding of a new
school for the study of management.  ‘New and Different’  Brewster was adamant that Yale wouldn’t start a business
school, said Victor Vroom, who was then chairman of the
department of administrative sciences and a member of the
committee charged with developing the new school.  “It’s got to be different,” Brewster told the committee,
according to Vroom, 78, who still teaches at Yale. “We can’t
copy Wharton, we can’t copy Harvard. It has to be new and
different.”  The school, originally named the School of Organization and
Management, was intended to educate managers for government,
nonprofit companies and business and drew some of its curriculum
from Yale departments that focused on human behavior, said
Donaldson, the first dean. They even considered bringing in
professors from the divinity school to teach ethics, he said.  In its early years, Yale SOM attracted students who might
have otherwise considered studying law or government, Donaldson
said.  Different ‘Cat’  “It was for a different sort of cat,” said Ned Lamont, a
Connecticut entrepreneur and former U.S. Senate candidate who
graduated in 1980. “I was on a different track and I loved the
SOM message.”  Much of that spirit ended abruptly in October 1988, when
Dean Michael Levine and Yale President Benno Schmidt decided to
turn SOM into a traditional business school, eliminating faculty
and departments they viewed as nonessential.  “They really gutted the school and made it more into a
Chicago, Michigan place, more of a finance and accounting
place,” LaFarge said.  Students and alumni were furious at the unilateral
decisions, and hired a plane to tow a banner denouncing the
moves over the university’s graduation. It took a decade for the
school to regain its equilibrium.  $300 Million Gift  Snyder, who earned his Ph.D. in economics from Chicago in
1984, served as the dean of the Darden School of Business at
Virginia from 1998 to 2001 before returning to run Chicago.
While at Chicago, he secured a record $300 million gift from
David Booth, co-CEO and chairman of Dimensional Fund Advisors
LP, an Austin, Texas-based asset-management firm.  Snyder also helped found the  Milton Friedman Institute , a
research center named after the Nobel prize-winning economist
noted for his free-market philosophy and revered by
conservatives. It’s now called the Becker Friedman Institute for
Research in Economics.  Snyder’s background made him a surprising choice for Yale,
said  David Thomas , dean of  Georgetown University ’s business
school who received his Ph.D. in organizational behavior from
Yale in 1986. Graduates of Yale SOM wondered if a free-market
advocate would be a good fit, he said.  “That’s the question that’s on some people’s minds,”
Thomas said.  Donor Cultivator  Snyder said that while he believes in laissez-faire
principles, he recognizes the interconnectedness of business and
governments.  “Governments are playing a bigger role and market
economies are evolving very differently,” he said.  Snyder’s success at Chicago resulted from his ability to
manage relationships, said Robert Topel, a professor at Chicago
Booth who is writing an economics paper with Snyder. Snyder can
massage the egos of “prima donna” professors, defend the
business school’s interests to the university president and
cultivate donors, Topel said.  “He’s extraordinarily good at communicating what it is we
do and defending what we do and marketing what we do and looking
the donor straight in the eye and saying ‘Can I have some
money?’” Topel said.  So far, Snyder has shown a willingness to bolster the
school without forcing changes, said  Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , a
senior associate dean who studies CEO leadership.  “He’s been one of the best bosses I’ve ever had,”
Sonnenfeld said. “He’s come in with no grandiosity. He has
ambition institutionally for the school and absolutely no ego
personally.”  Yale DNA  Tom Taft, a 1985 graduate, said the school will continue to
produce socially conscious graduates no matter who is in charge.  A fifth-generation Yale graduate and the great-grandson of
 William Howard Taft , the 27th U.S. president, Taft said the
spirit of the school survived the Levine era.  “Despite efforts to turn the school into Wharton, there’s
an inherent DNA in SOM that makes it a real special place,”
Taft said. “Regardless of the administration, it’s going to be
a place where students come in and walk out with a picture that
the world is a bigger place.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
