The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  tumbled the most in three weeks, by 1
percent to 673.37, at 4 p.m. New York time on concern that a
Greek bailout plan will unravel. Metals led the decline.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices dropped 1.2
percent to 1,605.682.  BASE METALS  Copper fell the most in two months on signs that a Greek
debt-bailout plan may unravel and as imports of the metal
declined in  China , the world’s largest user.  European finance ministers held back a rescue package for
Greece, fueling concern that the continent’s sovereign-debt
crisis will hinder the global economy. Copper shipments to China
fell in January, the first drop in eight months, while
inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange advanced
for the ninth straight week to a record.  Copper futures for March delivery fell 2.9 percent to

London. An LME gauge of the six industrial metals fell 3

more than last year, the Department of Agriculture said. World

enough to reduce a U.S. surplus.  Gas has dropped 17 percent this year. Chesapeake Energy
Corp., the second largest U.S. producer, reiterated plans
yesterday to cut output by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a
day. Gas supplies last week were about 33 percent above the

months, on speculation that exports will climb from  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s biggest shipper. Coffee dropped and sugar rose.  Cocoa exporters reached an agreement with local authorities
on industry reforms after complaints that the changes were
