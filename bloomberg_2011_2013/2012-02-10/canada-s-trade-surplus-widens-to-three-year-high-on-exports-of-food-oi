Canada ’s merchandise trade surplus
widened in December to the largest in more than three years on
aircraft exports and record shipments of food and crude oil.  The  surplus  more than doubled to C$2.69 billion ($2.29
billion) from a revised C$1.17 billion in November, Statistics
Canada said today in Ottawa. The December figure exceeded all 19
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey of economists and was the
widest since October 2008.  The report “was universally strong,” said Mazen Issa,
Canada macro strategist at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto. “It’s
too early to confirm that we are really at a turning point
because there are still a lot of uncertainties.”  Greek politicians today protested German demands for deeper
budget cuts to avoid a debt default, and there are still
questions about the durability of a recovery in the U.S.,
Canada’s biggest export customer, Issa said. Shipments abroad
will see “relatively modest growth” through 2013 because of
weak global demand, a loss of Canadian competitiveness and a
strong currency, the central bank  said  last month.  The Canadian dollar trimmed losses after the report. The
currency depreciated 0.6 percent to C$1.0011 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:47 a.m. Toronto time on concern that plans to help  Greece 
avoid default were unraveling. Earlier it weakened 0.9 percent,
the biggest intraday drop since Jan. 5. One Canadian dollar buys
99.93 U.S. cents.  Exports (CATBTOTE)  rose 4.5 percent to C$42 billion, with energy
rising 1.7 percent to C$10.3 billion, including a record C$6.91
billion of crude oil. Agriculture and fishing exports rose 3.8
percent to C$3.84 billion, an all-time high.  Yearly Surplus  Canada returned to a yearly trade surplus of C$1.4 billion
in 2011 after two annual deficits tied to the global recession.
Annual surpluses exceeded C$40 billion in 2007 and 2008.  The volume of exports rose 4.9 percent in December, and
import volumes increased 1.2 percent,  Statistics Canada  said.
The volume figures adjust for price changes and can be a better
indicator of how trade contributes to economic growth.  Exports of machinery and equipment rose 9.2 percent to
C$7.49 billion, led by a 25 percent jump in aircraft. Automotive
products climbed 6.7 percent to C$5.76 billion, the highest
since November 2007, and a gain of 27.4 percent from a year
earlier.  Imports (CATBTOTI)  rose 0.8 percent to C$39.3 billion, the second
highest monthly total on record. The main contributor was a 2.6
percent increase in industrial goods to C$8.57 billion.  Trade With U.S.  The  surplus with the U.S.  widened to C$5.54 billion in
December from C$4.69 billion a month earlier, the largest since
October 2008. Exports make up about one-third of Canada’s
economy, with about 75 percent of the shipments going to the
U.S.  There are other signs that demand is picking up in the U.S.
A report today showed the December trade deficit widened to a
six-month high as a strengthening economy prompted bigger gains
in imports than exports. The gap widened 3.7 percent to $48.8
billion as imports advanced 1.3 percent to $227.6 billion, the
most since July 2008, Commerce Department figures showed in
 Washington .  “There is no denying the U.S. is doing well these days and
Canada is benefitting,” said Jimmy Jean, a strategist in the
fixed-income group at Desjardins Capital Markets in  Montreal .
“How long that will last is still in question.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
