Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, the
Idaho man accused of shooting at the White House, was given
until May 11 to review the evidence that the government has
assembled against him.  U.S. District Rosemary Collyer made the ruling today during
a brief hearing in federal court in  Washington , where Ortega-
Hernandez appeared. His lawyer said the alleged gunman needs the
extended time because of the volume of information the
government was turning over.  Accused of attempting to assassinate President  Barack
Obama , Ortega-Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to 17 criminal
charges including assaulting federal officers with a deadly
weapon and firearm offenses.  Under federal sentencing guidelines, the charges carry a
possible prison term of  life imprisonment , according the U.S.
Attorneyâ€™s Office in Washington.  Ortega-Hernandez is accused of firing a semi-automatic
rifle at the White House on Nov. 11 in an attempt to kill Obama.
He was arrested at a hotel near Indiana, Pennsylvania, on Nov.
16.  Last month, U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola in
Washington ordered that Ortega-Hernandez remain in custody
during the grand jury investigation because he was a potential
flight risk and a danger to the community.  The case is U.S. v. Ortega-Hernandez, 12-00014, U.S.
District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
