A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , a Waltham,
Massachusetts-based maker of batteries for electric cars and
utilities, rose after announcing a contract to supply power-
storage systems to a U.K. grid operator.  A123 gained 7.7 percent to $2.03 at the close in New York
after saying it would provide six of its grid battery systems to
Northern Powergrid, a unit of  Des Moines , Iowa-based MidAmerican
Energy Holdings Co. that supplies power to more than 3.8 million
customers in the U.K.  The storage systems will manage fluctuations on the grid
and will be in operation by the end of this year, according to a
statement today.  A123 yesterday fell 24 percent to $1.88, the biggest
decline since September 2009, after its largest customer, Fisker
Automotive Inc., stopped work on a factory and an analyst
downgraded its shares.  Fisker said Feb. 6 that it fired 26 employees and stopped
work at the factory itâ€™s developing in Wilmington,  Delaware , to
make plug-in electric vehicles after the U.S. Energy Department
blocked access to a federal loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
