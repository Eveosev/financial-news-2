Five Latvians and a Russian were
detained Feb. 8 near  St. Petersburg  for cutting into a diesel
pipeline that runs to the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk, said
Russian oil products pipeline operator OAO Transnefteprodukt.  One of the men identified himself to the police as a
tourist from  Latvia , according to a  statement  posted on St.
Petersburg-based Transnefteprodukt’s website today.  During the investigation, police and employees from two
Transnefteprodukt units discovered a 1.5 kilometer, or 0.9 mile,
hose leading from a breach in the pipeline to a 20 metric ton
storage tank. More than 40,000 liters of stolen diesel were
recovered, according to the statement.  The pipeline handles low-sulfur diesel from refineries
including TNK-BP’s Ryazan plant and OAO Lukoil’s Nizhny Novgorod
facility and has a capacity of 8.5 million tons a year, Ilya
Arkhipov, a spokesman for the operator, said by phone from
Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
