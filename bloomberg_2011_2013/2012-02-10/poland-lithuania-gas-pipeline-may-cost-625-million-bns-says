A planned  gas pipeline  between
Poland and Lithuania may cost 471 million euros ($625 million),
the Baltic News Service reported today, citing Slawomir
Sliwinsky, board member of Poland’s Gaz-Systems.  The 562-kilometer pipeline is projected to be completed in
2018, which would supply the Baltic region with 2.3 billion
cubic meters of gas a year, the newswire said. Gaz-Systems and
Lithuania’s gas utility  Lietuvos Dujos AB (LDJ1L)  plan to receive
financing for the project from the European Commission, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
