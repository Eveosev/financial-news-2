Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose,
pushing yields to the lowest since October, after coupons
dropped at a debt auction yesterday. The dong strengthened for a
fourth consecutive day.  The State Treasury sold 2 trillion dong ($95.7 million)
each of three- and five-year notes at 11.90 percent and 11.98
percent, respectively, the Hanoi Stock Exchange said yesterday.
The treasury sold similar-maturity securities at 12.10 percent
and 12.15 percent at the previous debt sale on Jan. 12.  The  yield  on the government’s three-year bonds fell one
basis point to 12.29 percent, the lowest since Oct. 21,
according to daily fixings from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
yield dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this
week.  The dong advanced 0.1 percent to 20,895 per dollar as of
2:30 p.m. in  Hanoi , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the daily  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged
since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  In the so-called black market, the dong traded between
20,870 and 20,920 at gold shops in Hanoi today, compared with
between 20,870 and 20,900 yesterday, according to a telephone-
information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
