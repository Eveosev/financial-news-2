The U.K. market for granular urea
fertilizer, a source of crop-yield boosting nitrogen, has been
“incredibly quiet” this week as buying was slow amid cold
weather and snow, grain trader Gleadell Agriculture Ltd. said.  U.K. prices for ammonium nitrate, another nitrogen
fertilizer, are “weak” as importers compete for farmers’
orders, Gainsborough, England-based Gleadell wrote in a weekly
 market report  on its website. The European market for phosphate
fertilizer has also been affected by the cold snap, and price
support “will be dictated by the weather,” the trader said.  Farmers typically apply fertilizer in granular form, and
frozen fields across  Europe  will need to thaw before rain or
irrigation can dissolve the nutrients for plant use. More than
half of soils in northern  Germany  are frozen to a depth of 50
centimeters (20 inches) or more, according to the country’s
 weather office .  “Buying has been damped by plummeting sub-zero
temperatures and applications expected in Germany and the U.K.
in mid-February could now be delayed by up to three weeks,”
Gleadell wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
