Companies in southern  Germany  have
been asked to limit use of natural gas and switch to alternative
means of energy generation, as too little Russian gas is
reaching the country via  Austria ,  Die Welt  reported, without
saying how it got the information.  Open Grid Europe GmbH said natural gas-imports at the
Waidhaus border station in Bavaria are currently 25 percent to
30 percent down and although the companyâ€™s gas reserves, mostly
located in northern Germany, are still at 60 percent to 70
percent, pipeline capacity between the two parts of the country
is under pressure, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
