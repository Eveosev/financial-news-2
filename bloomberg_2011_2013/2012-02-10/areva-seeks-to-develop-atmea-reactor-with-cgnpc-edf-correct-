(Corrects to say Areva in headline.)  Areva SA wants a 1,000-megawatt
nuclear reactor it agreed to develop with Electricite de France
SA and  China  Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co. to be based on
the Franco-Japanese Atmea model.  “This is what we’re hoping for,” Claude Jaouen, senior
vice-president for reactors and services at Areva, told
reporters on a conference call today. “It would be a shame to
have two 1,000-megawatt reactors on the market.”  Areva is bidding to sell the Atmea, developed with
 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) , to Jordan, competing with
Russia’s ZAO Atomstroyexport and Canada’s SNC-Lavalin
International Inc. for a $4.5 billion contract. Getting China to
adopt the model would help future sales, Jaouen said.  GDF Suez SA, operator of seven nuclear reactors in Belgium,
has said it wants to develop an Atmea in the Rhone River Valley
in  France . The model, which has never been built, would widen
the range of French reactors that includes the EPR, a 1,650-
megawatt generator EDF is developing at Flamanville in Normandy.  EDF,  Europe ’s biggest power generator, operates 58 reactors
in France.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
