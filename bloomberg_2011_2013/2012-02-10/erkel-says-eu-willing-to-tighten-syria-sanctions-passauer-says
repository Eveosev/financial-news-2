China and Russia were “wrong” to
veto a United Nations Security Council resolution backing an
Arab League plan to transfer power in Syria, German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said, the  Passauer Neue Presse  reported, citing an
interview.  “The European Union has already agreed to important
sanctions against Syria, and we are willing to tighten these
measures,” Merkel said, according to the German newspaper.
Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy also support
creating a contact group to solve the conflict, the publication
said.  The chancellor also said  Iran’s nuclear program  is of
“great concern,” and that the European Union must increase
political pressure on the Tehran regime, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
