Hungarian negotiators held talks
with  Vnesheconombank (VNECB) ,  Russia ’s state development bank known as
VEB, on a possible loan to revive the collapsed state-owned
carrier Malev Zrt.,  Napi Gazdasag  reported.  Hungary is seeking to shield the budget and protect jobs
with the effort, the Budapest-based business newspaper said,
without citing anyone. VEB has provided 120 million euros ($159
million) in loans to Malev and still has a stake in it,
according to Napi.  Hungary acquired a 95 percent stake in Malev in 2010 to
replace VEB as a controlling shareholder when a previous
privatization failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
