Nigerian authorities arrested an
Islamist militant linked to the Christmas Day bombing of a
church outside the capital, Abuja, that killed 43 people and
wounded 73, a spokeswoman for the State Security Service said.  Kabiru Abubakar Dikko, also known as Kabiru Sokoto and
Kabiru Umar, was arrested in the northeastern state of Taraba,
Marilyn Ogar, a spokeswomen for the security service, told
reporters today in Abuja. Dikko had escaped from police custody
on Jan. 16, two days after his arrest.  “Kabiru was picked up from where he was hiding at the
residence of an accomplice,” Ogar said.  The Dec. 25 attack on the church in Madalla town, near
Abuja, was claimed by the Islamist group Boko Haram. President
 Goodluck Jonathan ’s administration blames the group, whose name
means “Western education is a sin,” for a series of attacks
targeting government buildings, security forces and churches in
the mainly Muslim north and Abuja over the past year.  The group claimed responsibility for bomb and gun attacks
in the northern city of Kano on Jan. 20 killed 256 people,
according to the Civil Rights Congress, a rights group that
participated in the rescue of victims.  Jonathan fired his police chief, Hafiz Ringim, after
Dikko’s escape. The activities of Boko Haram pose a worse threat
to the country than the 1967-1970 Biafra civil war, Jonathan
said on Jan. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
