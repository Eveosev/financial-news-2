Hong Kong  will face a shortfall of
22,000 workers with higher education by 2018 as the city’s
population ages, the government said in its first forecast for a
shortage since it began the study in 1988.  The city, which has a total population of about 7.2 million,
will need 500 people with degrees in six years’ time and will
have an 8,500 surplus of employable people with a “lower
education,” the city’s Labour and Welfare Bureau said in a
 report .  The Hong Kong government has turned to China to try to
attract talent to meet a shortfall, as it faces increasing
challenges to lure professionals elsewhere because of
competition from cities including  Singapore .  Asia ’s elderly
population is poised to double within four decades, according to
the  United Nations .  “Aging population is one of the key population policy
issues on which the government has been focusing its efforts,”
the bureau said. “As the retirees leave the  labor force , the
growth in manpower supply will be hindered.”  About 17 percent of Hong Kong’s  population  will be at least
65 years old by 2018, compared with 13 percent last year,
according to the Census and Statistics Department. The city has
the lowest birth rate in a government list that included five
countries, and the gap is projected to widen.  Hong Kong had granted residence to 40,933 mainland  China 
professionals and skilled people by the end of 2010 under an
admission plan started in 2003, according to the government
website.  Talent Shortage  Hong Kong faces increasing challenges to lure professionals
because of competition from cities such as  Tokyo  for quality of
living. Singapore was 25th, Tokyo 46th and Hong Kong 70th in
Mercer LLC’s quality of life list published in November.  Pollution, high home prices and difficulties in finding
school places for expatriate children are cited as reasons
foreign professionals choose not to live in Hong Kong.  The city’s schools have failed to keep up with record
numbers of applications. In a survey of American Chamber of
Commerce members in May last year, 63 percent said some
executives are driven away by the lack of student places.  Home prices  have surged about 66 percent since early 2009
on record low mortgage rates, a lack of new supply and an influx
of buyers from other parts of China. The government has imposed
measures to prevent the formation of an asset bubble since late
2010.  The city’s  air pollution  is linked to thousands of
avoidable deaths, the University of Hong Kong said last year,
with many due to respiratory and cardiovascular disease,
according to Thach Thuan-quoc, an honorary assistant professor.  ‘Education Concerns’  “Some international companies may opt for Singapore over
Hong Kong because of pollution and education concerns, but Hong
Kong still has an edge in its proximity to China,” Raymond So,
dean of the business school at Hang Seng Management College in
Hong Kong, said last month.  Demand for professionals in the financial services industry
is expected to increase 2.5 percent to 253,100 by 2018, while
the number of workers needed in the manufacturing sector may
drop 3.1 percent, according to the government report.  Hong Kong’s fertility rate is expected to decline 5.7
percent to 983 births per 1,000 women in 2019 from 2009, the
lowest in the government list that included  Australia ,  Japan ,
the U.S., the United Kingdom and  Sweden .  The number of Asians 60 or older will exceed 1.25 billion,
or 24 percent of the population in 2050 from 10 percent in 2011,
according to data compiled by the  United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
