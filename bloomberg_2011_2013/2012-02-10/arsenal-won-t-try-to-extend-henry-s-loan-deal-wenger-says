Arsenal won’t look to extend  Thierry Henry ’s loan spell with the Premier League club, manager  Arsene Wenger  said.  Henry, 34, rejoined Arsenal earlier this month from the New
York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. Wenger considered trying
to extend the deal but today said Henry will return to New York
next week.  “I would have loved him to stay for two more weeks but he
has to go back,” Wenger said on Arsenal’s  website . “We
accepted at the start that we would release him on Feb. 16, so
we respect our word.”  Henry has scored twice in five substitute appearances to
extend his Arsenal club-record total to 228. He’s eligible to
play in tomorrow’s league match at Sunderland and the Feb. 15
Champions League game at AC Milan before heading back for MLS
preseason training.  “He is captain of the Red Bulls, so just to appear on the
first day of the season would be unfair to them,” Wenger said.  The Red Bulls open their season March 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
