Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT) , a power
provider in the U.S. Midwest, is seeking a buyer for RMT after
reporting losses widened more than ninefold last year at the
unit.  The board will sell RMT, which designs and builds
renewable-energy projects, in 2012, the Madison, Wisconsin-based
company said in a statement today. The unit had a per-share loss
of 19 cents in 2011, compared with a 2-cent loss the year
before, Alliant said.  Alliant attributed some of the losses to a solar project in
 New Jersey  that’s experienced delays and higher costs after the
original subcontractor abandoned the job. Profit for wind
projects “experienced modest erosion” last year, according to
the statement.  Selling RMT will reduce  consolidated earnings  by 5 cents a
share from previous estimates to $2.75 to $3.05 for 2012,
Alliant said. The forecast excludes per-share costs of 10 to 14
cents from increased state taxes associated with the sale.  “RMT has about $235 million in contracts and those will go
ahead with construction in 2012,” Scott Reigstad, a spokesman
for Alliant, said in a telephone interview today.  Alliant’s fourth-quarter net income rose to $57 million, or
51 cents a share, from $47.3 million, or 43 cents, a year
earlier, the company said today. Alliant fell 0.7 percent to
$43.08 at the close in New York.  RMT was founded in 1977 to handle waste management,
according to its  website . Alliant bought it in 1983 and last
year sold the environmental portion of the business to focus
exclusively on wind, solar and geothermal projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
