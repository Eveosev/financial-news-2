Wheat futures tumbled as much as 1.2
percent, dropping for a fourth day to post the longest losing
run since mid-December, after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
predicted record world stockpiles.  Wheat fell as low as $6.3825 a bushel, the cheapest since
Jan. 30, before trading at $6.3925 at 9:32 a.m. Singapore time.  The grain dropped the most in four weeks yesterday after
the agency said global stockpiles may climb to an all-time high
before the next harvest, signaling ample supply and lower food
prices.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
