The U.S. government’s  budget deficit 
narrowed in January as income-tax receipts climbed and spending
dropped.  The $27.4 billion gap was less than the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and followed a $49.8
billion shortfall in January 2011, the Treasury Department said
today in Washington. It was the smallest January deficit since
2008, when the government ran a surplus.  “There are signs that better economic conditions are
leading to faster growth in government tax receipts,”  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. in  New York , said before the report. “This gives one
some hope that the trillion-dollar deficits will not be with us
forever.”  President  Barack Obama  on Feb. 13 will submit to Congress
an election-year spending plan for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. Obama’s four-volume package will be based in part on the
10-year, $3 trillion deficit-reduction proposal he offered
unsuccessfully to Congress in September.  Before today’s report, the median estimate in a survey of
22 economists by Bloomberg News forecast that the January budget
deficit would narrow to $31.6 billion. Estimates of the gap
ranged from $66.7 billion to $20 billion.  So far in the fiscal year that began in October, the  budget
deficit  is $349.1 billion compared with $418.8 billion in the
same period last year.  Spending fell by 5.3 percent in January from a year earlier
to $261.7 billion, while revenue rose 3.4 percent to $234.3
billion.  More Receipts  Individual income tax receipts in the first four months of
this fiscal year rose 4.9 percent to $403.8 billion. Corporate
income tax receipts climbed 56 percent to $60.2 billion in the
first four months of the fiscal year.  The non-partisan  Congressional Budget Office  estimated
this week the January budget deficit would reach $27 billion.
The shifting of payments because Jan. 1 fell on a weekend
reduced payments by about $17 billion last month, the CBO said
in its monthly review.  Additionally, the government spent less this January than
last on the student loan program, refundable tax credits and the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, the CBO said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
