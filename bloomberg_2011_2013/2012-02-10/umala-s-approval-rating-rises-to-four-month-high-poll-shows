Peruvian President Ollanta Humala’s
approval rating rose to a four-month high amid optimism the
Andean nation will withstand the global slowdown, an opinion
poll showed.  Humala’s approval rating climbed 8 percentage points from
January to 58 percent, according to the Feb. 3-7 poll by Datum
Internacional, which was published in Lima-based newspaper
Peru21 today.  The rating slumped 22 percentage points in the fourth
quarter as the economy slowed and street protests led  Newmont
Mining Corp. (NEM)  to suspend its $4.8 billion gold project, clouding
the outlook for investment as global demand slows. The economy
expanded faster than expected in December as the government
pumped up public investment as part of a $3.5 billion stimulus
package, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Feb. 7.  Humala, who took office July 28, courted investors in
Madrid last month and at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos as he
seeks to spur investment in energy and infrastructure projects.  Of those surveyed, 65 percent thought the visit to Madrid
will attract more investment to Peru, Datum said.  The company questioned 1,211 people and the poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
