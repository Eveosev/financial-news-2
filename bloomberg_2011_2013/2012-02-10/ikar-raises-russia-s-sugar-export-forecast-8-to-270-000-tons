Russia’s exports of sugar made from
domestically grown beets may reach 270,000 metric tons in the
marketing year that ends on July 31, the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies said.  Ikar , as the institute is known, raised the export forecast
by 8 percent from 250,000 tons made in November after refineries
produced a record 5 million tons of the sweetener by the end of
January and still continue to process the beets.  Ikar raised its forecast for domestic consumption by 1.3
percent to 5.67 million tons this season from an earlier
estimate of 5.6 million tons,  Yevgeny Ivanov , Ikar’s senior
sugar analyst, said by phone from Moscow today.  Usage may increase because of low sugar prices in the
domestic market that are currently at 25 rubles (83 U.S. cents)
a kilogram, Ivanov said. Consumption may also gain on greater
domestic sugar use in caramel production after  Russia  barred
caramel imports from Ukraine with a duty last year, Ivanov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
