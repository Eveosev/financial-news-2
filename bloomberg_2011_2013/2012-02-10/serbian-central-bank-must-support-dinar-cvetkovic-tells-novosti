Serbia ’s central bank must
“intervene” to support the dinar and explain what is happening
with the currency after it fell to a record low against the
euro,  Novosti  quoted Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic as saying.  Cvetkovic said in an interview with the newspaper that
there was no excessive demand in the market to make the dinar
“fall several percent a day” and that the best “remedy” for
situations like this is “timely and sufficient intervention,”
according to Novosti.  The dinar fell to an all-time low of 109.7532 against the
euro yesterday, prompting the National Bank of Serbia to sell
68.5 million euros to support the local currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
