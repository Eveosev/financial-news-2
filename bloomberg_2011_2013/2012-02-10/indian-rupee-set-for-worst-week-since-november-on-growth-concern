India ’s rupee headed for the worst
week since November on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is eroding
economic growth in developing nations.  A government report will show today that gains in India’s
 factory output  slowed to 2.6 percent in December from 5.9
percent the previous month, according to the median of 23
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Europe will not disburse
aid to  Greece  without implementation of austerity measures,
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said in Brussels
yesterday.  “There are still concerns emanating from Greece which have
impacted the rupee,” said J. Moses Harding, executive vice
president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “As long as European
policy makers keep liquidity easy, India will attract flows as
our fundamentals are relatively strong.”  The rupee declined 2 percent this week and 0.2 percent
today to 49.6050 per dollar as of 9:47 a.m. in Mumbai, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 49.7250 earlier, the
lowest level since Jan. 31.  The government predicted this week India’s gross domestic
product will rise 6.9 percent in the year ending March 31, the
least since 2009.  Three-month offshore non-deliverable rupee forwards traded
at 50.64 a dollar, compared with 50.50 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
