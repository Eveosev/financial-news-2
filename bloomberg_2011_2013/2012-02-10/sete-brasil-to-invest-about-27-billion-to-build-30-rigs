Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, an
oil-rig provider owned by  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , banks and
pension funds, will spend $27 billion by 2020 on drilling units
as the South American country expands output.  The company will borrow $13.5 billion from  Brazil ’s BNDES
development bank and $7 billion from other lenders to order 30
rigs, Chief Executive Officer Joao Carlos Ferraz told reporters
in Rio de Janeiro today. Rio de Janeiro-based Sete is also
seeking a capital increase of about $6.5 billion from investors,
Ferraz said.  The creation of Sete was part of Brazil’s drive to expand
the domestic shipbuilding industry to supply  oil companies  as
they tap the largest discoveries in the Americas in over three
decades. Petrobras needs to source as much as 70 percent of
goods and services from local suppliers to develops so-called
pre-salt deepwater reserves in the Atlantic Ocean that hold at
least 50 billion barrels of recoverable oil.  Sete already has contracts with shypyards for nine of the
30 rigs, including agreements with Estaleiro Atlantico Sul and
Keppel Offshore & Marine Ltd. It’s negotiating with five other
shipyards for the remaining contracts, including billionaire
 Eike Batista ’s OSX Brasil SA, Estaleiro Enseada do Paraguacu,
Jurong Aracruz, Keppel and Rio Grande 2, Sete said in a
statement distributed in Rio today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
