Jim Curley stepped down from his
position as tournament director of the  U.S. Open , ending a
decade-long tenure running the biggest tennis event in the U.S.  Curley, who will remain a consultant to the United States
Tennis Association through the 2012 U.S. Open, was replaced by
his former deputy, David Brewer, the USTA said today in a news
release.  “It has been a privilege to lead the USTA’s efforts in
professional tennis,” Curley said in a statement. “My decision
to step down after more than 10 years was a difficult one, but I
believe it is time for a change.”  Curley’s last year running the U.S. Open included rain
delays and criticism from top players about how USTA officials
handled the event.  The tournament at  New York ’s National Tennis Center, which
doesn’t have a retractable roof on any court, was pushed to a
Monday finish for the fourth straight year because of the
weather.  Brewer, a member of the USTA for 14 years, also will
oversee the organization’s professional tennis operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
