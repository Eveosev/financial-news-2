A unit of  Bayer AG (BAYN) , Germany’s
largest drugmaker, sued  Watson (WPI)  Pharmaceuticals Inc., accusing
the generic-drug maker of violating a patent for Beyaz birth
control pills.  Watson, based in Parsippany,  New Jersey , is trying to
develop a copy of Beyaz in violation of the patent, Bayer Pharma
AG and partner Merck & Cie claimed today in court papers filed
in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Bayer and Merck “are entitled to an award of damages and
treble damages for any commercial sale or use” of Watson’s
generic version of Beyaz, the companies said.  Bayer, of Leverkusen, Germany, asked a judge to ban the
sale of any Watson birth control product based on the patent.  Watson plans to challenge the validity of the patent,
Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Watson, said in a telephone
interview today.  The lawsuit “initiates the formal process of challenging
the patent on the product,” Mayr said.  The case is Merck Cie v. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., 12-
cv-00161, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,153,401.  -- With assistance from Phil Milford in Wilmington, Delaware.
