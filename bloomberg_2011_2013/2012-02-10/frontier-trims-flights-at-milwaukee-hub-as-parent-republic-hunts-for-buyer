Frontier Airlines  will cut daily
departures from Milwaukee by 44 percent to drop unprofitable
flights as parent  Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (RJET)  prepares to
sell or spin off the carrier.  Frontier will end non-stop service to six cities by mid-
April as departures from Milwaukee are reduced to 18 from 32 a
day, Lindsey Carpenter, a spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview today.  Republic is close to naming an adviser to help divest
Frontier, which it bought out of bankruptcy in 2009. Frontier
faced competition in Milwaukee from  Southwest Airlines Co. , the
biggest low-fare carrier. The city had served as a Frontier hub
since Republic bought Midwest Airlines in 2009 and combined the
two carriers under the Frontier name.  “We’ve been incurring significant losses on our flights
out of Milwaukee,” Carpenter said. “We can’t continue to do
that if we want to stay a viable airline.”  Frontier is still assessing how many employees will be
affected by the changes and hopes to offer them other jobs with
the airline, she said. Midwest’s Milwaukee departures peaked at
150 a day in 2007.  The carrier no longer will fly non-stop from Milwaukee to
Dallas-Fort Worth,  Kansas City , Philadelphia, Phoenix, Newark
and  Grand Rapids , Michigan. The cuts come as the airline expands
flights from its main base in Denver.  Republic fell 2.2 percent to $5.87 at the close in  New
York . The shares have risen 71 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
