The U.S.  Defense Department (USBODEFN) ’s fiscal
2013 spending plan draws more than 40 percent of proposed
reductions from weapons accounts that contribute less than a
fifth of the budget, based on Pentagon projections.  The military budget that President  Barack Obama  will send
to Congress on Feb. 13 calls for $525 billion in spending, a
reduction of $45 billion from previous projections. About $18.7
billion of the cuts would come from weapons procurement,
according to data provided by an official who spoke on condition
of anonymity because the budget hasn’t been submitted.  The breakdown shows the Pentagon is cutting weapons more
deeply in an effort to limit cuts in personnel and benefits,
according to  Todd Harrison , a defense analyst.  “Compare that to spending on military personnel, which
accounts for one-third of the budget but is only taking one-
ninth of the cuts,” Harrison of the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments in  Washington , said yesterday in an e-
mail. “Protecting pay, benefits, and end strength is a higher
priority than modernizing weapon systems.”  The $98.8 billion the Pentagon will propose spending on
weapons in fiscal 2013 compares with $117.5 billion it had
projected for the same period a year ago. Through 2017, cuts in
weapons spending would average about 37 percent of the annual
reductions projected by the administration, according to a
nonpartisan government analyst who also spoke on condition of
anonymity before the budget submission.  Details behind the reductions will unfold over the next
month as lawmakers and their staffs press the Pentagon for
specifics and military officials outline their respective
service budgets.  Cutting 100,000  A five-year plan outlined by Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
last month calls for slowing weapons acquisition and reducing
forces by 100,000. That plan already has been criticized by
Republican lawmakers as cutting too many people.  “The president has abandoned the defense structure that
has protected America for two generations, turning 100,000
soldiers and Marines out of the force,” California Republican
Representative Howard “Buck” McKeon, chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, said in a Jan. 26 statement.  Few weapons systems would be canceled outright by the
Pentagon.  “The absence of big program kills may suggest to investors
that DoD investment fared relatively well,”  Byron Callan , a
defense analyst with Capital Alpha Partners LLC in Washington
said in an e-mail. “These procurement figures suggest a tougher
reality for industry. Even without big, iconic platform cuts,
industry will still see some pain.”  Lockheed’s C-130  One project being canceled is $4 billion to modernize the
C-130 transport plane built by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  The Navy
plans to cut eight of nine planned Austal Ltd. high-speed
transports.  Mostly, programs would be delayed, such as postponing until
after 2017 the purchase of 179 of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter
jet. One Virginia-class submarine would be moved to 2018, and
acquisition of 24 V-22 Osprey aircraft would be postponed.  “The defense aerospace, shipbuilding, and vehicle
manufacturing industrial base will take a big hit in a short
amount of time under these proposed spending levels,” MacKenzie
Eaglen, a defense analyst with the  American Enterprise Institute 
in Washington, a policy group, said in an e-mail.  “Yes, there will still be ‘reset,’ maintenance, overhaul
and repair work for some companies, but not nearly enough to
support the current workforce,” she said.  The proposed weapons spending budget is $104.3 billion in
fiscal 2014, or $21.6 billion less than projected previously;
$112.3 billion in fiscal 2015, or $17.2 billion less; $116.3
billion in 2016, or $20.9 billion less; and $122.9 billion in
2017 or $16.8 billion less.  The Office of Management and Budget had previously
projected procurement spending through 2017 would be $650.3
billion. The new plan calls for $554.6 billion, or $95.7 billion
less, over the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
