The premium paid by buyers of cocoa
from  Ghana , the world’s second-largest producer, climbed over
the past month, boosted by rates for Ivorian beans, according to
three traders with direct knowledge of the trade.  Ghanaian cocoa in the European market is 90 pounds to 105
pounds ($142 to $165) a metric ton above the price on the NYSE
Liffe exchange in London, according to the traders, who declined
to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the
media. The premium was 70 pounds to 90 pounds on Jan. 6. In the
past week, premiums for Ghanaian beans were little changed.  The crop in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer, will
shrink 21 percent in the season started in October to 1.34
million metric tons, according to Marex Spectron Group, a
London-based broker. Cocoa prices jumped 8.5 percent last month
in  London  on speculation of crop damage from hot, dry Harmattan
winds. In Ghana, cocoa production will drop 12 percent to
845,000 tons, Marex said on Feb. 3.  “Lack of rain as well as severe Harmattan-related weather
conditions, old tree stocks and poor husbandry practices were
reported to have had a negative impact on production,” the
London-based  International Cocoa Organization  said in a report
this week, referring to the Ivory Coast.  Ivorian cocoa in the European market is 55 pounds to 70
pounds a ton above the price on the NYSE Liffe exchange, the
traders said.  Cocoa for March delivery settled 3 percent lower at 1,411
pounds a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
