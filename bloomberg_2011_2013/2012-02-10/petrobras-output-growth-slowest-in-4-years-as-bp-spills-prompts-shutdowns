Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil producer, said output growth slowed to the
least since 2007 after regulators stepped up safety inspections
in response to BP Plc.’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  Petrobras lost 12 million barrels of output after platform
shutdowns, while growth was also curbed by delays in installing
new equipment at the Campos basin, where Petrobras is struggling
to slow declines at aging fields, Guilherme Estrella, Petrobras’
head of production, told reporters today in  Rio de Janeiro .  Petrobras plunged the most in six months in Sao Paulo after
quarterly profit missed estimates due to rising production costs
and a weakening currency boosted import expenses. Petrobras was
down 6.5 percent to 23.84 at 3:04 p.m. in  Sao Paulo . The stock
fell as much as 7.1 percent earlier, the most since Aug. 8.  Output rose 1.5 percent in 2011 to 2.6 million barrels a
day of oil and natural gas on average, slower than its 7.7
percent target.  “It was a very difficult year with unplanned stoppages,”
Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa also told reporters
today. “Costs rose.”  BP’s 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill at the Macondo platform
killed 11 people, sullied hundreds of miles of coastline and
damaged fishing and tourism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
