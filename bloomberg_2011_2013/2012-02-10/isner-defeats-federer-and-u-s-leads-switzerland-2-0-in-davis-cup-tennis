The American doubles team of  Ryan
Harrison  and Mike Bryan will try to clinch a Davis Cup victory
today against Switzerland after  John Isner  defeated Roger Federer yesterday to give the U.S. a 2-0 lead.  Isner’s 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 victory, on an indoor clay
court in Fribourg, Switzerland, followed a 4 1/2-hour win by
Mardy Fish against  Stanislas Wawrinka , 6-2, 4-6, 4-6, 6-1, 9-7
in first-round play.  Harrison and Bryan will face Federer and Wawrinka in the
doubles match as the U.S. tries to clinch the best-of-five
series.  Serbia, Argentina, Spain, the  Czech Republic  and Austria
also hold 2-0 leads after the first day of play in World Group
matches, the top tier of the leading team event in men’s tennis.  Croatia and  Japan  are tied 1-1, as are Canada and France,
after the opening day. Doubles matches are set for today in all
the contests, with two more singles matches tomorrow.  Fish, ranked No. 8 in the world, came back to beat Wawrinka
in 4 hours, 26 minutes. The American lost a match point at 5-4
in the deciding set before taking the victory six games later.  Isner, ranked No. 17 on the ATP World Tour, followed with
his first career victory in three matches against third-ranked
Federer. The U.S. team, which has a record 32 Davis Cup
championships, last won the tournament in 2007 and is 2-1 in the
series against  Switzerland .  Serbia is leading Sweden 2-0 behind victories from No. 9
Janko Tipsarevic and No. 22 Viktor Troicki, while Argentina has
a 2-0 lead against  Germany  following wins from No. 23 Juan Monaco and David Nalbandian.  Defending champion Spain took a 2-0 lead against Kazakhstan
on victories by Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nicolas Almagro. The
Spanish team has won five titles since 2000, more than any other
country in that span.  Jurgen Melzer and Andreas Haider-Maurer gave Austria a 2-0
lead against Russia. Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek won for
the Czech Republic against Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
