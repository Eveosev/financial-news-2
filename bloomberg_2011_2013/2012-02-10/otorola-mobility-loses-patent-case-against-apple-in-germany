Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. (MMI) ,
which has won two rulings against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in  Germany , failed
to win a third in a patent case involving the use of
mathematical sequences in mobile telecommunications.  The Regional Court in Mannheim rejected the suit today.
Motorola Mobility didn’t show that Apple is violating the
patent, Presiding Judge Andreas Voss said when delivering the
ruling.  The decision ends a winning streak by Motorola Mobility,
which has twice prevailed over Apple in the same court. More
cases between the two are pending in German courts, including a
bid by Motorola Mobility to enforce its first win from December,
which forced Apple to briefly remove some older iPhones and iPad
models from its online store in Germany last week.  “While we can’t comment on specific details, we will
continue to protect our intellectual property,”  Jennifer
Weyrauch-Erickson, a spokeswoman for Motorola Mobility, said in
an e-mailed statement.  Apple spokesman Alan Hely declined to comment.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  is buying Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola
Mobility to gain mobile patents and expand its hardware
business. Google’s Android operating system is used by
smartphones from  HTC Corp. (2498)  and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  that
compete with Apple’s iPhone.  Today’s case is LG Mannheim, 7 O 230/11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
