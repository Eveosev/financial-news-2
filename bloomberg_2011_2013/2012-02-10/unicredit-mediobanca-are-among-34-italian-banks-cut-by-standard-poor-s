UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s biggest bank,
had its ratings lowered to BBB+/A-2 from A/A-1 by Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services, following last month’s sovereign
downgrade. The outlook is negative.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena
SpA (BMPS) , the second- and third-largest banks, were also downgraded
as S&P revised of the banking industry country risk assessment,
or BICRA, to group 4 from group 3. S&P downgraded 34 of the 37
Italian banks it rates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
