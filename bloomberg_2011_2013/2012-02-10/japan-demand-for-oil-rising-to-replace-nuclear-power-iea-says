Japan ’s power sector will buy an
additional 465,000 barrels of oil a day this year if all of its
nuclear plants are idle after April, offsetting declines
elsewhere in the nation, the  International Energy Agency  said.  Total demand for oil in Japan may rise 0.9 percent this
year to 4.5 million barrels a day, with the power sector
consumption growing by an average of 320,000 barrels daily, the
Paris-based IEA said in its monthly report. Japan’s oil demand
increased by 9.5 percent in December.  “The Japanese oil demand outlook remains highly uncertain,
and the possibility of a ‘no nuclear’ capacity profile, at least
for 2012, remains a real one,” according to the report. “The
incremental need for oil in the power sector offset contracting
demand elsewhere in the economy and led to Japanese oil demand
rising overall in 2011.”  Japan has three nuclear reactors operating with a capacity
of 3,138 megawatts, or 6.4 percent of the total, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News on Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
