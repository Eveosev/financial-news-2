Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings
Ltd. (682) , the Chinese vegetable supplier whose shares have been
suspended since September, failed to make a bond repayment on
time,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  “In our view, it is likely that a payment default has
occurred,” S&P said in a statement yesterday. Chaoda failed to
repay the principal on its $200 million convertible bond by the
Feb. 7 due date, according to S&P, which cut the company’s
credit rating to “CC’ from ‘‘CCC.’’  Winston Yau, an external spokesman for Chaoda at
Christensen Investor Relations Inc. in  Hong Kong , said yesterday
that he was trying to obtain information about the company’s
debt.  S&P also said yesterday that it is withdrawing its ratings
on Chaoda because it lacks access to the Chinese company’s
management. Chaoda lost 82 percent of its  market value  last year
and delayed its annual earnings release on Sept. 30 to audit its
accounts after a report from Anonymous Analytics questioned its
finances.  Bondholders can request Chaoda buy back the bond if the
company’s shares are suspended for more than 60 days, S&P said
last month. Chaoda may be required to make repayments in early
February, the credit rating company said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
