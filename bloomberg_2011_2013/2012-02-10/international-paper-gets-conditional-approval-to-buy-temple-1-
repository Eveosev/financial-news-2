International Paper Co. (IP) , the world’s
largest pulp and paper maker, won conditional approval from U.S.
antitrust regulators for its $3.7 billion takeover of Temple-
Inland Inc.  International Paper will sell three containerboard mills to
proceed with the takeover, the U.S. Department of Justice said
today in a statement on its website.  The acquisition “as originally proposed, would have
substantially lessened competition in the production and sale of
containerboard, the type of paper used to make corrugated boxes,
in the  United States ,” the DOJ said.  International Paper Chief Executive Officer John Faraci
last year said the all-cash deal of $32 a share would boost
International Paper’s share of the continent’s corrugated-
packaging market to about 37 percent from 27 percent.  Memphis ,
Tennessee-based International Paper last year raised its offer
to win acceptance from Temple-Inland.  Analysts expected conditional approval.  The acquisition “would fundamentally alter the balance of
power in favor of producers, and help ensure that cost-of-
capital returns become routine,”  Mark Connelly , a New York-
based analyst at Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., said
Jan. 23 in a note to clients. “We expect very little price
volatility going forward.”  International Paper fell less than one percent to $31.28 at
11:53 in New York trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
