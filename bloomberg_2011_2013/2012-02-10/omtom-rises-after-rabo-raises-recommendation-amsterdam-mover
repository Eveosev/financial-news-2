TomTom NV (TOM2) ,  Europe ’s biggest maker of
portable navigation devices, rose to the highest in seven months
after Rabo Securities raised its recommendation, citing strong
automotive sales and a potential  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  mapping deal.  TomTom advanced as much as 36 cents, or 9.7 percent to 4.04
euros in Amsterdam, the highest since June. The shares traded
9.3 percent higher at 4.03 euros as of 10:28 a.m., valuing the
company at 893 million euros ($1.19 billion). TomTom shares have
lost 47 percent in the past 12 months.  “TomTom’s undemanding valuation does not fully reflect
valuable options for shareholders,” Hans Slob, an Utrecht
Netherlands-based analyst at Rabo Securities, wrote in a note to
clients. Slob sees a tripling potential for business systems, a
doubling potential for automotive sales, a potential Apple
mapping deal, and, “last but not least, the option of an
acquisition of TomTom with a high strategic premium.” Rabo
raised its recommendation to “buy” from “hold.”  TomTom Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn is trying to
increase sales of built-in navigation systems for cars as well
as electronic maps and other software, as demand for portable
navigation devices is falling.  The company, based in Amsterdam, recently announced deals
with  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co. for maps and location content and
Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co.’s Opel division for built-
in navigation systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
