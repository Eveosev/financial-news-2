The  European Investment Bank  loaned
Tanzania 50 million euros ($66 million) to upgrade five regional
airports in the East African country, said Ramadhani Khijjah,
permanent secretary in the  Finance Ministry .  The loan will be a 20-year facility, Kurt Simonsen, head of
the lender’s East African division, said at a joint briefing
with Khijjah today in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital.  The airports to be upgraded include Kigoma, Tabora and
Sumbawanga in the western part of the country, and Bukoba and
Shinyanga in northwestern Tanzania, according to Khijjah.  “The major activities of the project will include
replacement of existing runways, reconstructing link taxiways,
aircraft apron, passenger terminal building, storm-water
drainage and substation access roads,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
