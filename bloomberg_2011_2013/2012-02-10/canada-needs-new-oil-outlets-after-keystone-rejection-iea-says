Canada  will need to find new outlets
for its crude output after the Obama administration rejected
TransCanada Corp.’s application to build the Keystone XL
pipeline, the  International Energy Agency  said.  The Keystone decision has longer-term implications for
Canadian oil producers and will result in the country having to
find a West Coast export point by the middle of this decade, the
IEA said today in its monthly oil market report.  Without either Keystone XL or a pipeline to Canada’s West
Coast, producers will have to export extra volumes to refiners
in the Midwest and the Rockies, instead of to the Gulf Coast or
to  China , incurring an $8 a barrel value loss in revenue,
according to a Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. assessment for
the  Alberta  Department of Energy, the Paris-based agency said.  In the U.S., the short-term impact of the absence of the
1,661 mile (2,673 kilometer) oil pipeline on production will be
limited because of rapid increases in rail and alternative
pipeline capacity in North Dakota, the IEA said. Railways may
account for more than half of total delivery capacity by 2015,
according to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority.  The proposal to construct the 700,000 barrel-a-day pipeline
from Alberta, Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast was turned down by
President  Barack Obama  in January after it wasn’t deemed to be
in the national interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
