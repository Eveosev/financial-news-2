The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell to the lowest in six months, according to
a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 67.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:22 a.m.
in London, from minus 70 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The cost, the lowest since Aug. 5, has fallen from minus
114 basis points at the start of the year.  The one-year basis swap was 58 basis points less than
Euribor, from minus 56 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  A measure of European banksâ€™ reluctance to lend to one
another held near a four-month low. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed
swaps, was 73 basis points in  London , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank , placing 496 billion euros ($657 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday from 495 billion euros on Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
