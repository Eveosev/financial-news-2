Mercialys SA (MERY) , the French shopping
center owner controlled by  Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , rose to
the highest in five months in Paris trading after announcing a
plan to distribute 1.25 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of one-time
dividends this year.  The shares gained as much as 3.8 percent to 28.39 euros.
The company will distribute 13.59 euros per share to investors
in two installments, funded partly by the sale of as much as
half of its shopping centers this year, according to a statement
yesterday.  Casino Guichard-Perrachon will reduce its  shareholding  in
Mercialys to about 35 percent from 51 percent. Mercialys manages
shopping centers, most occupied by Casino supermarkets, and the
adjacent arcades and restaurants. Mercialys, based in the French
capital, aims to sell 500 million euros of small shopping
centers to concentrate on large outlets that attract higher-
paying retail brands.  “We expect this strategy to improve the resilience of our
portfolio, maintain a robust growth - whatever changes in the
macro environment are -- and increase the yield offered to
investors,” Mercialys Chief Executive Officer Jacques Ehrmann
said in the statement.  Mercialys rose 60.5 cents to 27.96 euros at 9:42 a.m. in
Paris. Since Casino sold shares in Mercialys in an October 2005
initial public offering, the stock has returned 7.85 percent
annually through dividends and price gains,  according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.   The company’s change in strategy was announced as Mercialys
reported a 10 percent increase in funds from operations last
year to 140.8 million euros, or 1.53 euros a share. Net asset
value advanced 3.1 percent to 27.72 euros a share.  The company said it will sell about 500 million euros of
bonds and expects to agree to 500 million euros of bank loans in
coming months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
