A measure of currency volatility
dropped to the lowest level since August 2008 amid signs the
global economy is improving, giving investors more confidence to
buy assets that appreciate in periods of growth.  Implied volatility of three-month options on Group of Seven
currencies as tracked by the JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index fell
as low as 9.79 percent today, the least since Aug. 8, 2008,
before trading at 9.92 percent at 11:14 a.m. London time. A
lower figure makes investments in currencies with higher
benchmark lending rates more attractive as the risk in such
trades is that market moves will erase profits.  “The improvement that we’ve seen in terms of global data
flow means that a somewhat lower  risk premium  is justified,”
said  Todd Elmer , head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy
for Asia excluding  Japan  at Citigroup Inc. in Singapore. “We
feel that somewhat more benign trading conditions are likely to
prevail over the course of 2012.”  Higher-yielding currencies have surged in 2012 as improving
data in the U.S. has sapped demand for the perceived havens of
the dollar and the yen.  The  Mexican peso  has appreciated 9.2 percent versus the
greenback in 2012, the Brazilian real strengthened 8.2 percent
and New Zealand’s dollar gained 6.7 percent. Mexico’s benchmark
lending rate is 4.5 percent, Brazil’s is 10.5 percent and New
Zealand’s is 2.5 percent compared with a low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
