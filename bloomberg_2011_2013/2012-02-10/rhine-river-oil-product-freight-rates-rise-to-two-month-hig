The cost of shipping oil products on
the Rhine River advanced to a two-month high as water levels
dropped, reducing the volume that can be transported on barges.  The rate for transporting gasoil to Duisburg from Rotterdam
or Amsterdam rose to 5.75 euros ($7.62) a metric ton yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the highest
level since Dec. 9 and compares with 4.50 euros on Feb. 7. Barge
clearance levels at  Cologne (GH20RHKO)  dropped for a seventh day on Feb. 8,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
