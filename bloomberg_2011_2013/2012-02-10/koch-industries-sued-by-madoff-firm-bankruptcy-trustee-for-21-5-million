Koch Industries Inc., the company
run by billionaire brothers Charles and  David Koch , was sued for
$21.5 million by the trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s firm.  The trustee,  Irving Picard , sued to recover money received
from a feeder fund that invested with Madoff, according to a
complaint filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
Madoff is serving 150 years in federal prison for running the
biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.  One of the largest closely held companies in the world,
Koch Industries has businesses in chemicals, refining, consumer
products and commodities trading. Charles Koch is chairman and
chief executive officer of the company, and David Koch is an
executive vice president.  Melissa Cohlmia, a spokeswoman for the Wichita, Kansas-
based company, said Picard’s complaint was “without merit.”  “The Koch entity involved made an investment in an
entirely separate fund,” she said in an e-mailed statement.
“That Koch entity no longer exists and its investment was
redeemed in 2005, long before anyone knew of Madoff’s fraud.”  The case is Picard v.  Koch Industries  Inc., 12-01047, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
