Asian  stocks  fell, paring the
regional index’s longest streak of weekly gains since 2005,
after European leaders held back a debt bailout for  Greece 
pending a parliamentary vote on an austerity plan and as
companies cut earnings forecasts.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , a South Korean consumer
electronics maker that gets a fifth of its sales from Europe,
slid 2 percent.  AOC Holdings Inc. (5017) , a Japanese oil and gas
explorer, tumbled 9.8 percent in  Tokyo  after cutting its full-
year profit forecast by half.  Rio Tinto  Group, the world’s
third-biggest mining company, dropped 2.3 percent in Sydney
after posting a second-half loss.  “There still needs to be fine-tuning process for a Greece
package,” said Chu Moon Sung, a Seoul-based  fund manager  at
Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees $28
billion. “Investors are taking a breather following the recent
solid rally.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  declined 1.4 percent to 124.80
as of 7:27 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than two shares falling for
each that rose. The gauge is set for a 0.4 percent gain this
week, its eighth consecutive weekly advance and the longest
winning streak since December 2005, on improving U.S. economic
data, efforts to contain Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and
signs China will act to support growth.  The  benchmark Asian index  gained 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.5 percent advance by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a 7.8 percent increase by the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Earnings Season  Stocks on the Asian gauge were valued at 14.1 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the
 S&P 500  and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600. More than half of the
334 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that reported
 earnings  since Jan. 9 missed estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  lost 0.6 percent today. South
Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index both fell 1.1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid
0.9 percent as the  Reserve Bank  of Australia lowered its
forecasts for economic growth and inflation this year.  China Exports Fall  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  settled at 0.1 percent
higher after swinging between gains and losses as the nation’s
exports fell for the first time in more than two years in
January and imports slid more than forecast after the weeklong
Lunar New Year holiday disrupted trade.  Futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent today. The gauge
rose 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday after jobless claims
declined last week.  European finance chiefs’ refusal to deliver the bailout
reflects frustration with Greece’s bickering politicians and the
prospect they may again backtrack on austerity measures. Prime
Minister Lucas Papademos yesterday agreed with political parties
on budget cuts required for the 130-billion-euro ($172)
financing package. The deal has yet to be voted on.  Companies that get revenue from Europe declined after
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said there will be
“no disbursement without implementation” of the austerity
measures. Greece faces a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment on March
20 and is struggling to secure financing to avoid a default that
could spark a new round of contagion in the euro area.  Greek Agreement  “Greece reached some sort of agreement, but it’s still up
for negotiation whether the rest of the European authorities
will accept that agreement,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-
based head of investment markets research at Colonial First
State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “It was a positive step last night, but only a small
one and there’s a long way to go.”  Samsung Electronics fell 2 percent to 1.062 million won.
 Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets about 31 percent of sales
from Europe, lost 1.3 percent in Tokyo to 3,415 yen.  Esprit
Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-based clothier most dependent on
Europe, dropped 1 percent to HK$14.30.  AOC, Citizen  AOC Holdings plunged 9.8 percent to 500 yen. The Japanese
company cut its full-year net-income forecast by 55 percent to
1.3 billion yen ($17 million), citing foreign-exchange losses
and falling energy prices.  Citizen Holdings Co. slid 2.2 percent to 436 yen after the
watchmaker cut its full-year net-income forecast by 22 percent
to 7 billion yen.  Rio Tinto fell 2.3 percent to A$69.98 in Sydney. The miner
swung to a second-half loss, its first in four years, after
taking a one-time charge of $8.9 billion on the value of its
aluminum business.  Among stocks that advanced,  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  rose 1.7
percent to A$34.01 after Australia’s largest gold producer said
first-half net income rose 50 percent from a year earlier to a
record A$659 million ($711 million).  Yamada Denki Co. climbed 9 percent to 5,460 yen in Tokyo,
the second-biggest advance on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after
the Japanese electronics retailer forecast earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Shipping companies rallied after carriers announced plans
to raise Asia-U.S. cargo rates for the second time this year.
Members of the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement yesterday
said they would seek a $300 increase per 40-foot box next month
after “successfully” pushing through a boost in January.  Hanjin Shipping Co., South Korea’s largest shipping line,
climbed 4.5 percent to 17,600 won in  Seoul .  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd. (9104) , Japan’s biggest marine transport company, added 1.2
percent to 339 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
