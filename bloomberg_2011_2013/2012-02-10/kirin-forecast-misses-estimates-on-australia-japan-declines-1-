Kirin Holdings Co. (2503) ,  Japan ’s largest
brewer by market value, forecast 2012 earnings 23 percent less
than analyst estimates as falling sales in  Australia  and Japan
crimp profitability.  Net income  may reach 48 billion yen ($618 million) in the
12 months ending Dec. 31, the Tokyo-based company said in a
statement yesterday. That compares with the 62.5 billion yen
average estimate of 16 analysts based on data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Earnings from its Lion unit in Australia will miss budget
as discounting by the nation’s biggest retailers stymies its
ability to raise prices, higher ingredient costs curb
profitability and stalling consumer demand cuts sales. Declines
in the Japanese drinks market will result in revenue missing
target and limiting the benefit of overseas acquisitions such as
 Brazil ’s Schincariol Participacoes e Representacoes.  “We want to take a medium to long-term view for Lion,”
President Senji Miyake told reporters in Tokyo yesterday.  Kirin expects 2012 earnings from Lion of A$96 million ($103
million), lower than the A$350 million target set in 2010, it
said in a presentation on its website. Kirin owns Australia’s
second-largest brewer and largest milk processor.  Lion’s management will focus on more profitable products,
such as cheese and flavored drinks, to reduce the impact of
plain milk discounting by retailers.  Kirin and rivals  Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501)  and Asahi Group
Holdings Ltd. have expanded overseas to offset a slump in demand
at home. Industrywide beer sales in Japan fell 3.7 percent to
442 million cases last year, the lowest level since records
began in 1992.  Schincariol, San Miguel  Among other acquisitions last year, Kirin agreed to buy out
shareholders in Schincariol Participacoes e Representacoes in
November 2011. The deal at that time valued the Brazilian
company at about $3.6 billion excluding debt, when combined with
the initial purchase of a 50.45 percent stake.  The brewer increased its stake in Manila-based  San Miguel
Brewery Inc. (SMB)  to 48 percent in 2009, bought a 14.7 percent of
 Singapore ’s  Fraser and Neave Ltd. (FNN)  in 2010 and purchased a
majority stake in  Vietnam ’s Interfood Shareholding Co. for an
undisclosed sum in March 2011.  Kirin’s 2011 annual profit dropped 35 percent as the value
of its Sydney-based Lion unit and investments declined. Net
income fell to 7.4 billion yen in 2011 from 11.4 billion yen the
previous year, the Tokyo-based company said yesterday.  Japanese Rivals  Kirin’s rival Asahi Group Holdings Ltd., which spent at
least $1.8 billion on acquisitions in 2011, yesterday forecast
2012 profit will rise 18 percent, in line with analyst
estimates.  Asahi, Japan’s largest brewer by volume, said net income
may climb to 65 billion yen ($837 million) in the 12 months
ending Dec. 31 from 55.1 billion yen in 2011, according to a
statement yesterday. The forecast compares with the 64.9 billion
yen average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Kirin, Asahi and Sapporo were forced to temporarily shut
factories after the March 11 earthquake in northern Japan. Beer
shipments by the nation’s five biggest brewers plunged more than
8 percent in the months of March, May and June from a year
earlier.  Sapporo forecast net income of 6.3 billion yen in 2012 and
7.4 billion yen in 2013, compared with the 7.95 billion yen mean
estimate of five analysts for 2012 and 8.8 billion yen estimate
for 2013.  The company posted 2011 net income of 3.2 billion yen,
according to statement to  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  Kirin’s shares rose 1.9 percent to 967 yen at the close in
Tokyo yesterday before the earnings were released. Asahi climbed
0.8 percent to 1,731 yen, while Sapporo gained 0.7 percent to
294 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
