Oil options volatility fell as crude
dropped from a three-week high after euro-area finance ministers
refused to approve a rescue package for  Greece , boosting concern
that the European debt crisis will reduce fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.6 as of 2:30 p.m. in New York, down
from 29.8 yesterday.  Crude for March delivery dropped $1.17, or 1.2 percent, to
$98.67 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The 15-day
range is $95.44 to $101.39.  “We are just incredibly range-bound,”  James Cordier ,
portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida , said
by phone. “We have a floor in crude oil of $96 to $97 and we
have a ceiling of $100 to $101 and we are going to continue to
see volatility come in going forward. You can’t simply trade in
that $3 or $4 trading range and expect anything else other than
volatility to shrink.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts, which gained 2 cents a barrel to 25 cents at
3:04 p.m. with 2,613 lots trading. Next were March $89 puts,
which rose 1 cent to 5 cents on 1,499 lots, and March $100
calls, which dropped 67 cents to 59 cents on 1,200 lots. A
contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Puts were 54 percent of
the volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Puts accounted for 41 percent of the volume yesterday.
April $120 calls were the most actively traded options, with
10,726 lots changing hands. They added 8 cents to 38 cents a
barrel. The next-most active options, April $125 calls, rose 5
cents to 28 cents a barrel on volume of 6,310 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 41,686
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,853 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,547.  To contact the reporter on this story:
