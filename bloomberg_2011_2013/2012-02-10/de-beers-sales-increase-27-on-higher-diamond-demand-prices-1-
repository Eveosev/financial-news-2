De Beers , the supplier of about a
third of the world’s rough diamonds, reported a 27 percent
increase in sales last year on higher demand for the luxury gems
in the U.S.,  China  and  India .  Sales of unpolished and uncut diamonds by Diamond Trading
Co., De Beers’ trading arm, rose to $6.5 billion from $5.1
billion a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said
today in a statement. Average prices increased 29 percent during
the year, pushing net income to $939 million from $546 million.
Output declined 5.2 percent to 31.3 million carats.  “We expect to see continued growth in global diamond
jewelry sales, albeit at lower levels than the exceptional 2011
growth,” the company said in the statement. Production is
expected to remain stable this year, Chief Executive Officer
Philippe Mellier said on a conference call today.  De Beers, whose largest shareholder  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  is
boosting its stake to as much as 85 percent, has benefited from
rising demand in Asia’s emerging markets as economic growth
outpaces the global average. Rough-diamond prices probably rose
an average 15 percent last year as producers struggled to keep
pace with consumption,  RBC Capital Markets  said in January.  In November, 45 percent shareholder Anglo bid $5.1 billion
to buy the Oppenheimer family’s 40 percent in De Beers. The
Botswana government, which holds the remaining stock, said Jan.
8 it may say in March whether it will exercise an option to
increase its holding to 25 percent. The sale is expected to be
completed by the end of the third quarter, Mellier said.  Earnings ‘Disappointing’  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 21 percent to $1.7 billion dollars, the
company said. That compared with an estimate of $1.86 billion,
including fourth-quarter output, by Barclays Plc’s investment
banking arm,  Barclays Capital .  “These somewhat disappointing results reveal a difficult
second half for De Beers,” Barclays Capital analysts wrote in
an e-mailed note to clients.  OAO Alrosa (ALRS) , De Beers’ biggest global competitor, expects to
report a 29 percent gain in 2011 sales to a record $4.45
billion, the company said Dec. 19. RBC Capital Markets that
month forecast De Beers sales of about $6.4 billion.  De Beers mines diamonds by itself and in joint ventures in
 South Africa ,  Canada , Botswana and Namibia. A carat is equal to
a fifth of a gram.  Anglo American retreated as much as 4.2 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since Dec. 12, to 2,739 pence and was
3.8 percent lower at 2,750.50 pence at 12:19 p.m. in  London . The
FTSE 100 retreated 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
