Kuwait Petroleum Corp. lowered its
offer price for a year’s supply of naphtha to Asia beginning in
April, according to three people with knowledge of the talks.  The company offered to sell term supplies at a premium of
$24 a metric ton above benchmark  Middle East  prices, down from
$26 a ton earlier this week, the people said, asking not to be
identified because the talks are private.  Two telephone calls to the company’s general line and
marketing department in  Kuwait City  were not answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
