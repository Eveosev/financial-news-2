Spain ’s Congress yesterday approved
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s royal decree to halt subsidies
for new renewable-energy projects, Cinco Dias reported.  Rajoy’s  People’s Party  voted in favor, while three smaller
parties abstained and the rest of the Parliamentary groups
including the main opposition Socialists voted against the
measure, which is already in effect, the newspaper said, citing
newswire Efe.  Energy Minister Jose Manuel Soria said the goal of ending
above-market payments for solar and wind energy projects is to
help eliminate Spain’s so-called tariff deficit, which he called
 an “insurmountable” obstacle to the proper development of
clean-energy technology, the report said.  Soria said the suspension of premium power rates will
likely last until the country has eliminated the power system
deficit, which has created a 24 billion-euro ($32 billion) debt
by charging consumers less than the revenue booked by utilities,
according to the report.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
