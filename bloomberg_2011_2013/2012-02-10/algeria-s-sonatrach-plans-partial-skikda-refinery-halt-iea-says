Sonatrach,  Algeria ’s state oil
company, will partly shut its 300,000 barrel-a-day Skikda
refinery for repairs from March to August, according to the
 International Energy Agency .  The halt will increase the country’s need for gasoil
imports while reducing naphtha exports, the Paris-based agency
said today in its monthly report. The plant is expected to run
at half capacity during the work, according to the report.  Sonatrach plans to import about 2 million metric tons of
diesel in 2012, compared with 1.3 million tons last year, Yamina
Hamdi, vice president of commercial activity at the company,
said on Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
