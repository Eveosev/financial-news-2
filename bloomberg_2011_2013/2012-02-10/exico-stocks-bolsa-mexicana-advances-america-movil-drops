The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC  index  fell 0.2 percent to 38,149.22.  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  , the biggest mobile-phone
carrier in the Americas, dropped 1.7 percent to 15.29 pesos. The
wireless carrier controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim  reported
fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates as costs
rose to recruit new subscribers and service debt.  Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB  (BOLSAA MM), the operator of
Mexico’s securities exchange, gained 1.6 percent to 24.49 pesos.
The company is “starting the year on the right foot” and
shares could benefit from better-than-expected fourth-quarter
results, Santander said today in an e-mailed research note.  Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO)  , Mexico’s second-largest land-line
phone company, climbed 6.5 percent to 5.07 pesos, the biggest
