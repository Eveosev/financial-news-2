Andrew Colquhoun , Hong Kong-based
head of Asia-Pacific ratings for  Fitch Ratings , comments on the
prospects of a change in  credit rating  for the Philippines in an
interview in Singapore.  The company ranks the foreign-currency rating of the
Philippines at BB+, one level below investment grade.  “The rating remains on stable outlook. Of course that can
change depending on what happens with structural reforms and the
economy’s growth path. Management of public finances and
monetary policy will remain important.”  From a slower global economy, “there’s an impact via
remittance flows. We didn’t really see a shock to remittance
flows in the 2009 global recession. If that changes, then that
could be a risk for the  Philippines . It’s certainly something to
watch.  “The much more important parts of the credit profile are
particularly the structural reforms to lift the investment rate
and raise the growth rate. The Philippines, after all, grows
more slowly than Indonesia. We’re not just looking at one year’s
numbers, or one quarter’s number, we’re looking for a longer
period over the last five years or so.”  At stable outlook, “we’re signaling we don’t see a rating
move in the next 18 to 24 months on current trends.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
