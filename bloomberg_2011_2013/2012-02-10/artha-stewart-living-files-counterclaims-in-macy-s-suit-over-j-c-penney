Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. (MSO) , sued last month by Macy’s Inc. over its deal to sell
merchandise in J.C. Penney Co. stores, defended the agreement
and filed counterclaims against Macy’s.  The agreement with J.C. Penney is permitted under an
existing contract between Macy’s and  Martha Stewart  Living, the
company said in a filing today in New York State Supreme Court
in  Manhattan .  “Macy’s simply has no exclusive right to MSLO’s creativity
or design concepts, now or in the future,” Martha Stewart
Living said.  Macy’s sued in January seeking to stop New York-based
Martha Stewart Living from executing the J.C. Penney agreement.
Macy’s, based in Cincinnati, claims its contract gives the
retailer an exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart-branded
products within certain categories.  In its filing today, Martha Stewart Living accused Macy’s
of breach of contract, saying the retailer has stocked and
priced Martha Stewart products in a manner that favors Macy’s
own private-label brands.  “They have used Martha Stewart Collection products to draw
customers into Macy’s Home Store, where its own private-label
brands take center stage and, of course, generate higher profits
for Macy’s without the burden of paying royalties,” the company
said.  Jim Sluzewski , a Macy’s spokesman, declined to comment on
the claims.  The case is  Macy’s Inc. (M)  v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
