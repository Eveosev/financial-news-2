Canada is sending three doctors as
part of an international commission that will assess the health
of former Ukrainian Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko , Foreign
Minister  John Baird  said.  The doctors will arrive in Kiev as soon as this weekend,
Baird said in a  statement  from Ottawa today. Tymoshenko was sent
to a penal colony in December after a court upheld a seven-year
prison term.  “We hope that outstanding issues can be resolved
expeditiously to allow doctors access to Ms. Tymoshenko as soon
as possible,” Baird said. “Canada remains concerned by the
apparently arbitrary and politically biased nature of judicial
proceedings against Ms. Tymoshenko and other individuals, which
undermine the rule of law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
