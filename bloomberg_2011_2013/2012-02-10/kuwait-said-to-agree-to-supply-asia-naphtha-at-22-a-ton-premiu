Kuwait Petroleum Corp. agreed to
sell a year’s supply of naphtha to an Asian buyer beginning in
April at $22 a metric ton above benchmark Middle East prices,
according to two people involved in the negotiations. They
declined to be identified because the talks are confidential.  Two telephone calls to the company’s marketing department
in  Kuwait City  were not answered. The supplier settled the
December 2011 contract at a premium of $18.50 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
