Coffee production in  Colombia , the
world’s second-largest supplier of Arabica beans after  Brazil ,
shrank 41 percent in January after storms last year increased
disease and damaged plants.  Production slid to 535,000 bags from 908,000 bags of 60
kilograms (132 pounds) each in January 2011, based on data
published by  Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers .
The group didn’t break out monthly output, which was calculated
from 12-month output it reported in a statement yesterday.  Colombia is struggling to stem a slide in its harvest after
above-average rainfall pushed the crop last year to the lowest
level since 1976. Exports declined 16 percent to 715,000 bags in
January, according to federation figures.  The nation dotted with farms on high mountain ranges is
planting disease-resistant coffee plants to improve its harvest,
the group said. The crop last year fell 12 percent to 7.81
million bags, missing growers’ November target of about 8
million bags.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery yesterday dropped
1.8 percent to $2.16 a pound, the biggest decline in almost
three weeks.  Arabica coffee is grown mainly in Latin America and favored
by brewers such as  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
