Spanish home sales declined in
December for a 10th month as the euro area’s fourth-largest
economy relapsed into a  recession  that began in 2008 when a
property boom ended.  The number of  transactions  fell 25.3 percent from a year
earlier, the National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is battling to turn around a
slump in the real-estate industry as unemployment rose to a 15-
year high of 22.9 percent in the last quarter of 2011 and the
Bank of Spain sees the economy shrinking 1.5 percent this year.  Less than two months since taking over from Spain’s
Socialists, Rajoy’s People’s Party government has given the
nation’s banks a year to increase provisions against 175 billion
euros ($232 billion) of troubled real-estate assets in a bid to
push down property prices and restore the flow of credit.  Spanish banks’ bad loans are mounting while deposits are
lower and lending has dropped at the fastest pace on record, the
latest available Bank of  Spain  data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
