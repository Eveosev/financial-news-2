Portugal ’s  consumer price index  rose
in January from a year earlier at a slower pace than recorded in
December.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 3.4 percent from a year earlier, less than the 3.5
percent increase in December, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices
rose 0.3 percent from December.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal rose 3.5 percent in January from a year
earlier and climbed 0.5 percent from December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
