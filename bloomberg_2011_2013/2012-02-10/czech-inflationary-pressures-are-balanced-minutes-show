Czech inflationary pressures are
“balanced” and the appropriate response was to leave  interest
rates  unchanged, according to minutes released from the central
bank’s policy meeting on Feb. 2.  The bank’s board voted 6-0 at the meeting, with Vice
Governor Mojmir Hampl absent, to leave the benchmark two-week
repurchase rate at a record-low 0.75 percent for a 14th session.  “It was said repeatedly that inflation expectations were
very well anchored and also that inflation expectations at the
three-year horizon had fallen to a historical low of 2.1
percent,” according to the minutes published on the central
bank’s website.  The bank reduced its forecast for economic growth in 2012
at the meeting to zero percent from 1.2 percent previously, less
than the  Finance Ministry ’s Jan. 31 estimate of a 0.2 percent
expansion. The new central bank outlook for gross domestic
product next year was revised down to a 1.9 percent increase
from 2.7 percent.  “The new forecast had absorbed a large part of the risks
contained in the alternative scenario of the previous forecast,
which had assumed stagnant economic activity in the euro area,
and that there had been no reason to prepare an alternative
scenario of the new forecast,” the minutes said. “However, it
was also said that there was still considerable uncertainty
going forward due to the external situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
