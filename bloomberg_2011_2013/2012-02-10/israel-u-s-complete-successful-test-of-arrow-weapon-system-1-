Israel  and the U.S. completed a
successful test of the Arrow anti-missile weapon over the
Mediterranean Sea, the Israeli Defense Ministry said.  “This was a major milestone in the development of the
Arrow Weapon System and provides confidence in operational
Israeli capabilities to defeat the developing ballistic missile
threat,” the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. and Chicago-
based  Boeing Co. (BA)  cooperate on the weapon system. The Arrow is
designed to defend against medium-range ballistic missiles, such
as those possessed by Iran.  The announcement of the Arrow test comes amid rising
tensions over Iran, with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta
expressing concern about a potential Israeli military strike on
 Iran ’s nuclear facilities by mid-year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
