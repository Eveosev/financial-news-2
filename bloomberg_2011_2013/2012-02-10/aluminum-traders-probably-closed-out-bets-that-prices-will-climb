Aluminum traders probably closed out
bets that prices will climb as the number of outstanding
contracts declined to the lowest in more than three months at
the same time as prices fell.  Open interest in London Metal Exchange aluminum futures
declined by 9,457 lots to 1.35 million contracts in the week
ended Feb. 8, the lowest level since Oct. 19, according to LME
figures. Each lot represents 25 metric tons of the metal used in
cars or packaging. The benchmark contract for three-month
delivery fell 0.5 percent in the period.  When open interest and prices fall together, this suggests
investors liquidated bets on climbing prices, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. Open interest in LME aluminum has fallen 15
percent since reaching an all-time high of almost 1.6 million
lots in December.  Following are changes to market open interest for both LME
members and their clients for the six biggest industrial-metals
futures traded on the exchange. The figures were compiled by the
LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
