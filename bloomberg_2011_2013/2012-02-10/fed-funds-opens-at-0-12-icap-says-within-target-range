Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.12 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.10 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.06 percent to 0.20 percent and averaging 0.11 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities maturing from July 2018 to February 2041 today. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion
of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries
to reduce borrowing costs further and counter recession risk.  The central bank plans to buy $1 billion to $1.5 billion of
securities today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
