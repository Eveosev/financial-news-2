Serbia ’s economy will grow 0.5
percent this year, the  International Monetary Fund  said, in line
with the Balkan nation’s central bank forecast.  Serbia’s general government deficit target “was missed by
a small amount,” while the 2012 fiscal deficit will be
“significantly higher” than targeted because of insufficient
spending cuts after the budget was approved, the IMF said in a
statement today.  The government’s budget gap target for 2011 was set at 4.5
percent of gross domestic product and it is projected to narrow
to 4.25 percent of GDP this year. The government has not yet
published the end-2011 budget data.  “Amid faltering euro area economic activity, Serbia’s GDP
is projected to grow by 0.5 percent this year, with high and
rising unemployment being a key concern,” the IMF said.  Serbia’s economy is estimated to expand 1.9 percent in 2011
after a 0.8 percent growth in the third quarter, according to
preliminary estimates. Unemployment rose to 23.7 percent last
year from 20 percent in 2010.  Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said yesterday Serbia’s $1.3
billion precautionary loan program with the IMF will stay frozen
until parliamentary elections, planned for early May, are
completed. He pledged that his government will stick to the
agreed debt and deficit targets.  “Maintaining debt sustainability requires effective and
credible medium-term fiscal consolidation,” the IMF said.  The public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to exceed the
national limit of 45 percent of GDP at the end of this year, the
IMF said.  Unchanged spending policies will fuel Serbia’s public debt
to 53 percent of GDP by 2016, and it will top 50 percent this
year, the lender said in October. The estimate was based on the
assumption that Serbia’s economy will grow 2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
