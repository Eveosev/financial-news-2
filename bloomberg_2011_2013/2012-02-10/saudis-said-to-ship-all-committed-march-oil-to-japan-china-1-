Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply
all its contracted volumes of crude to Japanese and Chinese
customers in March, said three refinery officials who received
notification from the world’s biggest exporter.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will supply 100
percent of shipments committed under long-term contracts for a
28th month, according to the refiners in Japan and  China . They
declined to be identified because of confidentiality agreements
with the Dhahran-based company.  Saudi Arabia (OPCRSAUD)  pumped 9.65 million barrels a day in January,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of producers, analysts and
companies. The country is the largest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The group agreed
in December to increase its production ceiling to 30 million
barrels daily, the first change in three years.  While Saudi Aramco has the option to reduce monthly sales
to term buyers, it hasn’t done so for more than two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
