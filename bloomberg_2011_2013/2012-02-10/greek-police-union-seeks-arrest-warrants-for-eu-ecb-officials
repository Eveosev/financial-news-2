The Greek police officers’ union
called for arrest warrants to be issued for European Union,
 European Central Bank  and International Monetary Fund officials
negotiating austerity measures for a national debt bailout.  The Greek Federation of Police Officers said in a published
letter it will ask for arrest warrants for former European
Commission representative Servaas Deroose, the IMF’s Poul Thomsen and the ECB’s Klaus Masuch. Under Greek law, arrest
warrants must be issued by an appellate court prosecutor, a
police spokesman in  Athens  said today, speaking on condition of
anonymity in line with official regulations.  “We warn you that we will demand, as legal representatives
of the Greek police according to Greek law, that warrants for
your arrest are immediately issued,” according to the letter
published on the union’s  website .  The police union accuses officials of the so-called troika
-- which is negotiating austerity measures in  Greece  in exchange
for a second bailout -- of extortion, promoting the elimination
of Greece’s democracy and national sovereignty and insulting the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
