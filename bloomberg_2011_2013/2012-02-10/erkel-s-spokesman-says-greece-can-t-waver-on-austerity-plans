Germany pressed the Greek government
to stay the course on deeper budget cuts needed to unlock its
second bailout as members of Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos ’s
Cabinet defected.  “Nothing has changed,” Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief spokesman, said in a text message today. “Debt
sustainability can only be reached if Greece makes these efforts
on its own.”  Seibert commented after two ministers and three deputies
said they were quitting the Cabinet in Athens to protest steps
needed for the 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) rescue worked out
with European officials and the  International Monetary Fund .
Papademos held a meeting of his ministers this evening to
discuss a bill detailing the austerity measures to be put to a
parliamentary vote this weekend.  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers
in Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc earlier today that current
plans don’t go far enough, leaving  Greece ’s debt as high as 136
percent of gross domestic product by 2020, according to two
people who attended the meeting in Berlin. That compares with
the 120 percent foreseen in the country’s second bailout. Debt
was about 160 percent of GDP last year.  “The Greek offer is not sufficient and they have to go
away to come up with a revised plan,”  Bertrand Benoit , a
spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
