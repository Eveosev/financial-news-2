beloved rock tracks of all time: “Sweet Child of Mine,”
“November Rain,” anyone?  At 239 W. 52nd St. Information: +1-212-777-6800;

creates a bust from ashes, Jim Dingilian fills glass bottles
with candle smoke and draws inside, while Margaret Boozer tells
the story of  New York City  with soil samples.  And don’t miss Vik Muniz’s stunning sepia-tone photographs
capturing his huge outdoor works.  “Swept Away” is at the Museum of Arts and Design, 2

anger unleashed by the Occupy Wall Street protests.  Among the “Winter of Our Discontent” participants:
Students for a Democratic Society veterans  James Miller , now a
professor of politics at the New School, and Todd Gitlin,
professor of sociology and journalism at  Columbia University .  “Debt” author David Graeber, who coined “We are the 99

on Broadway in 1981.  But this musical about three arty friends has some of
 Stephen Sondheim ’s best songs, including “Old Friends,” “Not
a Day Goes By” and “Good Thing Going.”  Longtime Sondheim collaborator James Lapine directs the
“Encores!” revival, which stars Colin Donnell, Celia Keenan-
Bolger and Lin-Manuel Miranda.  Runs through Feb. 19 at City Center, 131 W. 55th St.

Chamber Orchestra for some Russian-inflected music, including

gorgeous “Serenade for Strings,” as well as works by Tippett
and Honegger.  Carnegie Hall , 57th St. and 7th Ave. Information: +1-212-
247-7800;  http://www.carnegiehall.org .  Sunday  Travel back in time with Eugene Atget’s sophisticated
photographs of  France  in the early 1900s.  Preferring the old to the new, he focused on narrow lanes
and courtyards, quays on the Seine, bars, boutiques and the
gypsies, prostitutes and circus performers populating Parisian
streets.  A gallery conversation about his work begins at 11:30 a.m.  “Documents pour artistes” runs through April 9 at the
Museum of  Modern Art , 11 W. 53rd St. Information: +1-212-708-
9400;  http://www.moma.org .  Sunday Matinee  Another memorable Broadway flop looking for a comeback is
“Carrie,” based on the Stephen King novel that went on to be a
scary Brian De Palma film starring Sissy Spacek as a social
outcast with telekinetic powers.  The original team -- Lawrence D. Cohen, book, Michael Gore,
music and Dean Pitchford, lyrics -- has reimagined and updated
the story and replaced some songs. Plus, there’s not so much pig
blood this time around.  Molly Ranson stars as the bullied Carrie, with Marin Mazzie
as her very religious mom.  In previews at MCC at the Lucille Lortel Theatre, 121
Christopher St., for a March 1 opening. Information: +1-212-352-
3101;  http://www.mcctheater.org .  Sunday Afternoon  Violinist Daniel Hope is always up to something
interesting. With the Chamber Music Society of  Lincoln Center ,
he’s put together a tribute to Joseph Joachim, a mover and
shaker in European musical life.  The program includes pieces written by Joachim and more

in the Rose Studio.  Concert at 5 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center.

Deerhound, a big, gray beauty named Hickory, won Best in Show at
the Westminster Kennel Club.  Hounds, toys, terrier, herding, sporting and non-sporting
breeds will run around the arena with their proud owners hoping
to grab the top dog spot.  Go to Madison Square Garden and cheer on your favorite of
the pampered pooches groomed to perfection.  Runs through Feb. 14 at MSG, Penn Plaza. Information: +1-
