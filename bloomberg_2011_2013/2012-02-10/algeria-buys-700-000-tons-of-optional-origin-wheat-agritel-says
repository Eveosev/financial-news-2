Algeria bought 700,000 metric tons
of optional-origin soft wheat for loading in April and May at
prices between $300 and $303 a ton on the basis of cost and
freight, Paris-based farm adviser Agritel wrote in a report on
its website, without saying where it got the information.  The proposed prices suggest a “good” part of the order
may be filled by European wheat, Agritel said. Algeria had
initially tendered for 100,000 tons of wheat, according to the
farm adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
