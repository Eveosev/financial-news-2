Manchester United midfielder  Ryan
Giggs  signed a one-year contract extension to return for a 22nd
season, the Premier League club said on its website.  Giggs, 38, has made 898 appearances since debuting with
United in March 1991, scoring 162 goals. He’s won a record 12
Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues and four F.A. Cups
during his career.  “When I signed my first contract, I never thought I’d be
able to play at United for 22 years, but I feel good and I know
I can still contribute to keeping the team pushing for honors,”
Giggs said.  Giggs has three goals in 22 matches this season to help
United to second place in the league, two points behind
 Manchester City .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
