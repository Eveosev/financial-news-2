Former Lenta LLC shareholders August Meyer and Dmitri Kostygin are to set up a new retailer to
compete with Lenta,  Kommersant  reported today citing project’s
presentation.  The new chain will have 30 shops by 2016 and will be like
the U.S. Costco and Sam’s Club stores, the newspaper said.  The partners may invest $250 million in the project,
Kommersant said.  Meyer and Kostygin sold 42 percent of Lenta to TPG Capital,
European Bank of Reconstruction and Bevelopment and VTB Capital
for about $1 billion, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
