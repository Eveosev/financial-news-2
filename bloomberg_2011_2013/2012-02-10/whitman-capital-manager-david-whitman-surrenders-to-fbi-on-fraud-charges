The insider-trading case against
Doug Whitman, the founder of Whitman Capital LLC, won’t be
transferred to  California , a judge ruled in New York.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff denied Whitman’s request to
move the criminal prosecution, citing his familiarity with the
issues in the case and the likelihood that a transfer would
significantly delay a trial scheduled to begin July 30.  “I think that there is no basis on which I could properly
exercise my discretion and grant the motion,” Rakoff said at a
hearing in Manhattan federal court today.  Whitman, 54, is charged with using illegal tips on  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ,  Polycom Inc. (PLCM)  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. to make
more than $900,000 for the hedge fund, according to an
indictment filed Feb. 10. He is charged with two counts of
conspiracy to commit  securities fraud  and two counts of
securities fraud.  If convicted, Whitman faces as long as five years in prison
on each conspiracy charge and 20 years on each securities fraud
charge. Whitman, who lives in Atherton, California, pleaded not
guilty and is free on $1.5 million bond.  Prosecutors claim Whitman traded on information he got from
Roomy Khan, a former Intel Corp. executive who was Whitman’s
neighbor, and Karl Motey, an independent consultant. Both have
pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against Whitman.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Whitman, 12-CR-00125, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
