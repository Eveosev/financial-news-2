Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest oil company, said fourth-quarter profit doubled on
higher crude prices and natural-gas sales.  Adjusted  net income  rose to 79 million euros ($105 million)
from 40 million euros a year earlier, the Lisbon-based company
said today in a regulatory filing. That compares with the 69
million-euro mean  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey. Profit on this
basis excludes one-time items and inventory changes.  Galp is expanding exploration in regions such as Brazil’s
offshore  Santos Basin , where the Lula project is located, and
 Angola  to improve access to crude supplies and lessen dependence
on refining and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain . The
development of Lula is “ahead of expectations,” Galp said in a
presentation.  The average dated Brent price was 26 percent higher in the
fourth quarter of 2011 than a year earlier. The volume of
natural-gas sales rose 5.6 percent.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 20 percent to 212 million euros in the fourth
quarter. Galp forecasts average annual growth in Ebitda of about
15 percent from 2010 to 2015.  Galp on July 29 raised its 2020 output target in light of
“exceptional” progress in  Brazil . The company expects working
interest production of more than 300,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day by the end of the decade.  China Petrochemical Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest refiner, on Nov.
11 said it agreed to buy a 30 percent stake in  Galp (GAPL) ’s Brazilian
unit. Sinopec Group, as the Beijing-based company is known, will
invest a total of $5.2 billion in Galp’s Brazil unit, including
a subscription for new shares and a shareholder loan.  Biggest Discovery  Galp has stakes in four offshore blocks in Brazil’s Santos
Basin, including a 10 percent share in Lula, the largest crude
discovery in the Americas since  Mexico ’s Cantarell field in
1976. Lula, formerly known as Tupi, holds an estimated 6.5
billion barrels of recoverable oil and equivalents. The company
is also a partner with Brazilian state-controlled oil producer
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4BZ)  in Cernambi, which holds 1.8 billion
barrels of estimated reserves.  Average working interest production climbed 7.5 percent
from a year earlier to 21,600 barrels a day, helped by Brazil.
Average net entitlement production fell 8.9 percent to 13,000
barrels a day. Galp is targeting working interest output of
about 22,000 barrels a day for the first quarter.  Galp plans to invest about 3.5 billion euros from 2012 to
2015, with exploration and production representing 70 percent of
the total.  Refining Margin  The producer used its  refineries  at 69 percent of capacity
in the fourth quarter and processed 16.6 percent more crude,
while refined-product sales volumes fell 0.8 percent. The
refining margin, a measure of profit from converting oil into
fuels, narrowed to zero from $2.30 a barrel in the fourth
quarter of 2010.  The Portuguese oil company is investing 1.4 billion euros
at its refineries in Oporto and Sines, to increase diesel
production. Galp’s  refinery  in Oporto can process about 90,000
barrels a day, while the Sines plant has a 220,000-barrel-a-day
capacity.  The company expects to have “stable” production at its
Sines refinery at the end of the second quarter after it
completes the upgrade project.  Galp fell 0.9 percent to 12.87 euros as of 8:18 a.m. in
Lisbon. The stock has climbed 12.5 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 10.6 billion euros.  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s
biggest oil company, and Portuguese holding company Amorim
Energia BV each control a third of Galp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
