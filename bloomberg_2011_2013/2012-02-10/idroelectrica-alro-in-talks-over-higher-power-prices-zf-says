Hidroelectrica SA, Romaniaâ€™s state-
owned hydro-power operator, is in talks with smelter  Alro SA (ALR) 
over raising electricity prices at least 10 percent,  Ziarul
Financiar  reported, citing unidentified people close to the
discussions.  Hidroelectrica plans to renegotiate a bilateral contract
for selling power to Alro by Feb. 14 and a price increase may
cost the aluminum producer an extra 36 million lei ($11
million), according to the Bucharest-based news paper.  Alro, majority owned by  Vimetco NV (VICO) , is being investigated
by the European Union competition regulator for allegedly buying
electricity from Hidroelectrica at below-market prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
