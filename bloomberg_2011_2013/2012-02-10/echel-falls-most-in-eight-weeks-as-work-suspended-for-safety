OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest coal
producer for steelmakers, lost the most in eight weeks in  New
York  as work was suspended at several facilities at the New-
Olzherassk mine under order from the country’s safety regulator.  Mechel (MTLR) ’s American depositary receipts sank 6.8 percent, the
most since Dec. 19, to $10.68 in New York.  Shares (MTLR)  in Moscow
dropped 3.7 percent to 328.7 rubles, or the equivalent of
$10.94.  Production at the mine may resume “shortly” and the
temporary halt won’t affect the “operational commitments” of
the company’s Southern Kuzbass unit in Siberia, Mechel said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
