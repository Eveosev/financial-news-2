Germany ’s antitrust regulator said
Hotel Reservation Service Robert Ragge GmbH’s pricing agreements
with hotels may harm competition.  The best-price clause in HRS’s agreements with hotels
guarantees that the company would get the best hotel price, the
highest room availability and the best cancellation policies for
its complete Internet offering, the Federal Cartel Office said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “The best-price clause takes away from competitors the
possibility of gaining ground by offering better terms,” said
Andreas Mundt, president of the Bonn-based Cartel Office. “It
makes it more difficult for newcomers to enter the market.”  Today’s warning doesn’t mean the regulator has made a final
decision on HRS and it will give the company the opportunity to
respond, the Cartel Office said.  “We have good arguments that show that competition is not
restricted,” HRS Chief Executive Officer Tobias Ragge said in
an e-mailed statement. In this context, HRS will continue its
dialogue with the Federal Cartel Office, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
