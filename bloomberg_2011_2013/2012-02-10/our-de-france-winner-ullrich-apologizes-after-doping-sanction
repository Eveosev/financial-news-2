Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour de France
champion and four times runner-up to  Lance Armstrong , apologized
after the top sports court found him guilty of blood doping in
2005 and 2006.  Ullrich said in a statement on his website he regretted his
behavior and in hindsight would have acted differently “in
certain situations” during his career.  The Court of Arbitration for Sport yesterday stripped the
38-year-old German, who retired in 2007, of his third-place
finish at the 2005 Tour and handed him a two-year ban. Armstrong
won the Tour for a record seventh time in 2005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
