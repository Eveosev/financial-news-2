Kazakhstan plans to build a gas
refinery by 2019 at the Karachaganak oil project, a joint
venture led by  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Eni SpA. (ENI)   Construction is expected to begin in 2014 after agreement
with the venture partners is reached, state-owned  KazMunaiGaz
National Co. (KMGZ)  said by e-mail today. Building work mustn’t prevent
KazMunaiGaz meeting a commitment to supply  Russia ’s Orenburg
refinery with as much as 16 billion cubic meters of gas a year
following expansion of Karachaganak, the company said.  In December, KazMunaiGaz agreed to buy 10 percent of
Karachaganak, at the time the only major oil project without
state involvement. In an  address to the nation  in January Kazakh
President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  ordered completion of designs,
and work to begin on the 5 billion-cubic-meter a year refinery.  The first phase is expected to begin operating in 2019, and
the second phase may start up in 2023, KazMunaiGaz said.  Karachaganak has an estimated 9 billion barrels of
condensate and 48 trillion cubic feet (1.4 trillion cubic
meters) of gas initially in place, BG Group Executive Vice
President Ashley Almanza said in December. As of June 30, BG and
Eni will each hold 29.25 percent of the venture,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
18 percent and Russia’s OAO Lukoil will have 13.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
