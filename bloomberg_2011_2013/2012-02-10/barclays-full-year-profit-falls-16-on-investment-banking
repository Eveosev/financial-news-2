Barclays Plc (BARC) , the first of Britain’s
biggest banks to report full-year earnings, cut bonuses at its
 investment banking  unit by 32 percent after profit fell.  Net income for 2011 fell 16 percent to 3 billion pounds
($4.74 billion) from a year earlier, missing the 3.27 billion-
pound median  estimate  of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
bank raised its full-year dividend by 9 percent and said its
investment banking unit made an “encouraging start” to the
year. The shares climbed as much as 5.1 percent.  The lender today set a 65,000-pound limit on cash bonuses
and cut remuneration for its top executives by almost half. The
bank may still miss the 13 percent profitability target Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  set a year ago. Return on
equity fell to an “unacceptable” 6.6 percent in 2011, he said
today. Barclays was the last British consumer bank to have kept
its profitability target as Europe’s debt crisis and tougher
regulation eroded investment-banking earnings.  “Diamond will have to once again lay out a road map on how
he can improve returns,” said  Christopher Wheeler , a London-
based analyst at Mediobanca SpA who has an “outperform” rating
on the stock. “Very encouragingly” the bank increased the
dividend, he said.  Shares Gain  Barclays gained 0.4 percent at 234.05 pence in  London 
trading, for a market value of about 28.6 billion pounds. The
bank increased its dividend to 6 pence a share. The company has
 declined  25 percent in the past year in London trading, compared
with a 28 percent drop in the 43-member Bloomberg European Banks
and Financial Services index.  “People were fearful initially on the suggestion they
won’t get to the 13 percent return,” said Colin McLean, who
helps manage about 700 million pounds of assets at SVM Asset
Management Ltd. “They will get there eventually.”  The London-based lender today also raised its cost-cutting
target for next year to 2 billion pounds to bolster profit.  Among the U.K. banks,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said in
November it may not meet some of its medium-term financial
targets until beyond 2014.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  has said it will
meet only the “softer end” of its 12 percent to 15 percent ROE
target. Diamond said he isn’t cutting or abandoning his own
probability target.  “The target remains 13 percent,” Diamond told reporters
on a call today. “Because of some of the external headwinds, we
can’t be as convinced that 2013 will be the year.”  Equities Tumbled  Pretax profit at Barclays Capital, the investment banking
arm led by  Rich Ricci  and Jerry Del Missier, fell 32 percent to
2.97 billion pounds in 2011, the lender said in a statement.
Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading,
which accounts for more than half the unit’s income, slid 52
percent in the fourth quarter. Revenue from equities tumbled 51
percent and investment banking declined 30 percent.  Total revenue at  Barclays Capital  in the fourth quarter
declined 48 percent to 1.82 billion pounds. UBS AG,
 Switzerland ’s biggest bank, this month said investment banking
revenue dropped 36 percent to 1.8 billion francs ($2 billion).
Credit Suisse Group AG yesterday said revenue at its securities
unit fell 64 percent.  “Bob’s track record is unrivaled, but today is not his
finest hour,”  Ian Gordon , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc, said
in a note to investors. Barclays Capital’s revenue was “very
weak,” he wrote.  Barclays Capital set aside 47 percent of its income for
remuneration in 2011, up from 43 percent in 2010. The unit
reduced its 2011 bonus pool by 32 percent to 1.54 billion pounds
and capped cash bonuses at 65,000 pounds.  Public Mood  The cash cap was “the right thing to do” because banks
need to be “responsive to the public mood,” Diamond, 60, told
reporters.  Annual pay for executive directors and the eight highest-
paid senior executives will drop by 48 percent, Barclays said
today.  Diamond declined to comment on his bonus this year after
receiving a 6.5 million-pound award last year.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said last month profit fell 58
percent to $1.01 billion in the fourth quarter, while Deutsche
Bank AG,  Germany ’s largest lender, said last week profit fell 76
percent as Europe’s debt crisis curbed trading and the company
wrote down holdings.  Pretax profit from Barclays’s U.K. consumer division
climbed 3 percent to 1.02 billion pounds. Losses as the
corporate banking unit shrank by 89 percent to 70 million
pounds. The company provided 43.6 billion pounds of gross new
lending to British companies, exceeding its so-called Merlin
lending targets agreed with the government last year.  The bank’s European consumer and business banking unit’s
loss widened to 661 million pounds, from 139 million pounds as
it took a 427 million-pound goodwill impairment on its Spanish
unit and restructuring charges of 189 million pounds.  “We need to fix  Europe ,” Diamond said.  Barclays’s credit and bad-loan charges decreased to 3.8
billion pounds, from 5.67 billion pounds. It also wrote down its
stake in BlackRock Inc. by 1.8 billion pounds and took a 1
billion-pound charge to compensate customers who were sold
payment protection insurance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
