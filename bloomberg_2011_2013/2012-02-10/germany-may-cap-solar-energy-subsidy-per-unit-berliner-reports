Germany  is considering capping
subsidies for new solar energy installations,  Berliner Zeitung 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  New units would receive subsidies for no more than 900
kilowatt hours of output per year and kilowatt of generation
capacity, the newspaper reported in an e-mailed preview of a
story to be published tomorrow. Output per kilowatt installed
capacity can reach as much as 1,100 kilowatt hours in southern
Germany, the newspaper said.  German Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen and Economy
Minister Philipp Roesler are in talks over adjusting solar
subsidies after Germany,  Europe ’s biggest renewables market,
installed a record 7.5 gigawatts of solar panels last year, more
than double the government’s target. A decision probably will be
taken next week, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
