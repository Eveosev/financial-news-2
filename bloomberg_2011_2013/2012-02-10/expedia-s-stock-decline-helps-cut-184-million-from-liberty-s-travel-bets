Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA) ’s stakes
in travel sites  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  and  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP)  lost a
combined $184 million in a single day after disappointing
results dragged down shares in both companies.  TripAdvisor tumbled 15 percent yesterday, slicing $132.5
million from Liberty’s 22 percent stake, while Expedia dropped
5.7 percent after the close of trading, slashing those holdings
by another $51.7 million, Bloomberg.com reported on its  Tech
Deals blog . Liberty, under Chairman  John Malone , also owns 22
percent of Expedia.  The companies split up in December, giving investors a
chance to own a piece of faster-growing TripAdvisor, with its
expanding advertising revenue, without being tied to the more
plodding online travel business run by Expedia. TripAdvisor
shares gained 25 percent from when they started trading on Dec.
7, through the middle of this week, while Expedia gained 22 over
that stretch. Both outstripped the S&P 500’s 7 percent gain.  That changed Feb. 8, after TripAdvisor reported fourth-
quarter profit excluding some costs that missed analysts’
average estimate, prompting at least three securities firms to
cut ratings on the shares. The company has invested heavily in
 China  and said it will lose money there through 2012, banking on
a future payout.  Then Expedia today reported quarterly sales of $787.1
million -- almost $30 million less than analysts expected,
thanks in part to a 19 percent plunge in worldwide revenue from
airlines.  Liberty, which has part ownership of Time Warner Inc., the
website Evite Inc. and home-shopping network QVC, fell less than
0.1 percent today to $18.23 and remains up 12 percent for the
year. Liberty’s own fourth-quarter report is due on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
