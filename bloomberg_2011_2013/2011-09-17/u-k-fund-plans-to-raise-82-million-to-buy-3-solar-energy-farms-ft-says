Capital and renewable-energy company Low Carbon Group will start
the first U.K. fund to buy three solar farms, the Financial
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The fund will be announced on Sept. 19 and will seek to
raise $82 million to buy the solar-energy parks, located in the
U.K. The farms will be built and operated by Low Carbon, and at
full capacity, each will generate 15 million kilowatt hours a
year, collectively accounting for a third of U.K. solar output,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
