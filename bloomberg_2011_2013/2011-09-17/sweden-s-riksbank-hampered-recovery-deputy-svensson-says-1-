Sweden ’s central bank stifled the
country’s recovery from the financial crisis by raising its
benchmark  interest rate  too quickly in the past year, Deputy
Governor Lars E. O. Svensson said.  “The good Swedish development to a considerable extent may
be explained by the financial market implementing much easier
financial conditions than those consistent with the Riksbank’s
policy-rate path,” he said today in a speech published on the
 Riksbank’s website . “Development would have been better with
even easier policy and financial conditions.”  Svensson objected to all seven rate increases pushed
through by a majority at the Stockholm-based bank from July 2010
to July this year. When the bank halted its tightening cycle
this month, he voted against the majority’s view of future
increases, saying rates should be kept unchanged at 2 percent
until the middle of 2013.  Finance Minister Anders Borg slashed the government’s
economic and budget forecasts on Aug. 26, saying the largest
Nordic economy, which relies on exports for half its output,
will grow 1.3 percent instead of 3.8 percent next year. The
economy will expand 4.1 percent this year, after growing 5.7
percent in 2010, the most in the European Union.  Four of the Riksbank’s six board makers this month signaled
they may vote to raise the rate next quarter. The bank also
forecasts a rate of 3 percent in the third quarter of 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
