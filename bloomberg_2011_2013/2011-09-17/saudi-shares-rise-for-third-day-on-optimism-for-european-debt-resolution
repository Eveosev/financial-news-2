Saudi Arabian shares rose for a
third day, led by petrochemical makers and banks, as government
officials and central bankers took steps to ease the European
debt crisis.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, advanced the most since April. National
Industrialization Co., the petrochemicals company known as
Tasnee, gained the most in two weeks.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the
kingdom’s largest lender by market value, climbed the most in a
week.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) , the largest bourse in the
Middle East by market value, advanced 1.7 percent to 6,173.49,
the highest level since Aug. 3, in Riyadh. The 148-company gauge
has declined 6.8 percent this year.  U.S. stocks advanced, driving the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index to the third-biggest weekly gain since 2009, as government
officials and central bankers took steps to ease the European
debt crisis. The  S&P 500  climbed 5.4 percent to 1,216.01 this
week, trimming its 2011 loss to 3.3 percent.  “With the S&P above 1,200 and recording four straight up-
days, the Saudi market is re-valuing,” Asim Bukhtiar, an equity
analyst at Riyad Capital, said. “Gains on global markets are
reflective of subsiding investor anxiety. Overall, the Saudi
market is sensitive to international news.”  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet pressed
euro-area governments on Sept. 16 to take decisive action to
halt the debt crisis. Two days earlier, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said they are
convinced Greece will remain in the euro zone.  Sabic climbed 2.5 percent to 94 riyals, the highest level
since Sept. 11, and Tasnee rose 4.1 percent to 40.6 riyals, the
highest since Aug. 3.  Al Rajhi  added 1.1 percent to 70.25
riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
