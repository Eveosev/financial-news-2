U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
defended the retention of the 50 percent top rate of income tax,
saying it was justified by the “abnormal conditions” in the
economy.  Cable told activists at his party’s annual conference today
in Birmingham, central  England , that the Liberal Democrats might
be willing to discuss a reduction in that level if their
Conservative coalition partners would look at the introduction
of a levy on high-value homes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
