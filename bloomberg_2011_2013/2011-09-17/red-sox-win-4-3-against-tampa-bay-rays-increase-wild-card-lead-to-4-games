David Ortiz drove in two runs and
the  Boston Red Sox  increased their lead to four games over Tampa
Bay in the American League wild-card race with a 4-3 win last
night against the Rays.  Evan Longoria hit a two-run homer and drove in all three
runs for Tampa Bay (83-67), which won the opener of the four-
game series at Fenway Park in  Boston  two nights ago.  The Red Sox (87-63), who won for only the fourth time in 15
games in September, moved within 3 1/2 games in the American
League East division of the New York Yankees (90-59), who lost
5-4 in Toronto.  Boston’s Josh Beckett, making his first start in 11 days
after being sidelined by a sprained right ankle, improved his
record to 13-5 by allowing two earned runs in six innings.  The  Los Angeles Angels  lost 8-3 at Baltimore and fell five
games behind Boston in the wild-card chase. The Angels are 3 1/2
games in back of  Texas , which lost 4-0 at Seattle, in the AL
West division.  The Detroit Tigers clinched the AL Central division title
by winning 3-1 at Oakland. It is Detroit’s first division title
since 1987.  In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals won 4-2 in
11 innings at Philadelphia to move within 3 1/2 games of Atlanta
in the wild-card race. The Braves lost 12-2 at home to the New
York Mets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
