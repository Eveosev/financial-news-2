France ’s public disagrees with the
government’s decision to offer  Greece  more financial aid after
the parliament cleared a second European bailout to Greece, a
poll showed today.  Sixty-eight percent of respondents in an Ifop poll for
newspaper  Ouest France  said they did not support the new
European Union bailout of 160 billion euros ($221 billion).
Thirty-two percent said they approved of France’s support for
Greece. A May 2010 poll by Ifop, after the first bailout, showed
66 percent of the French people agreed with helping Greece.  The survey showed that 87 percent of the respondents
believed Greece will not repay its debt.  France was the first European country to approve the second
bailout on Sept. 8, in a parliamentary vote.  Paris-based Ifop completed the survey between Sept. 13 and
15, interviewing 1,009 respondents aged 18 and more. It did not
provide margins of error.  To contact the reporters on this story:
