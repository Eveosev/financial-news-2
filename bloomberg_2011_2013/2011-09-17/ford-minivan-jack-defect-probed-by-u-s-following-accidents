Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Freestar and
Mercury Monterey minivans are being investigated in the U.S.
following a death and three injuries related to the service
jacks that are supplied with the vehicles.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced the probe of 205,661 minivans from model years 2004
and 2005 today on its  website .  The regulator said it received five consumer complaints and
one report from the automaker, based in Dearborn, Michigan,
about the failure of jacks at their slotted hinges. Reports said
jacks “can suddenly fail while in use and cause the vehicle to
suddenly fall,” the agency said.  Ford will fully cooperate with the government as the matter
is reviewed, spokesman  Wes Sherwood  said in an e-mailed
statement.  The death happened when the minivan fell on a person who
was working under it, using just the service jack to support it.
The auto-safety agency said it recommends using the devices to
raise vehicles only for changing tires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
