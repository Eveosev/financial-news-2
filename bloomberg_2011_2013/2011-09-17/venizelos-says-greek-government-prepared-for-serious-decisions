Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos dismissed talk of the country declaring bankruptcy and
said Premier  George Papandreou  cancelled a visit to the U.S. to
be ready to take quick decisions in the coming week.  “Comments or analyses of an imminent halt in payments or
bankruptcy are both irresponsible and ridiculous,” Venizelos
said, according to an e-mailed transcript from the Athens-based
ministry. “The situation is serious in the sense that we need
to take serious, definitive and complete decisions.”  Papandreou’s return to  Athens  “isn’t due to the fact there
is an economic risk or some extraordinary economic event but to
the fact that now is the time to take the necessary political,
legislative, organisational and administrative initiatives which
will definitively lead the country out of this recycled
pressure,” Venizelos said. “This vicious circle must end and
will end.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
