The union representing pilots at
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s BMI unit has written to U.K. Transport
Secretary Philip Hammond asking him to try to protect its
members’ jobs should the German carrier try to sell the airline.  Hammond should meet with Lufthansa and tell the carrier
that any deal should protect U.K. jobs, the British Airline
Pilots’ Association said in a statement today. Lufthansa board
member Stefan Lauer said Sept. 5 that the carrier hired a bank
to “support in the search for a partner” for unprofitable BMI.  “Too often in the U.K., compared to elsewhere in  Europe ,
the human factor is ignored,” said Jim McAuslan, general
secretary of BALPA, in the statement. “This is serious.
Unemployment is on the increase and British jobs are at risk.”  Lufthansa, based in Cologne,  Germany , took control of BMI
in 2009 when then-owner Michael Bishop exercised an option to
sell it to the German carrier. Lufthansa has since been cutting
costs at BMI in an effort to make the business either
sustainable or attractive to bidders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
