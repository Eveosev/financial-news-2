Bunds declined the most in eight
weeks after the leaders of Germany and  France  signaled a
commitment to keeping  Greece  in the euro area, reducing demand
for the region’s safest assets.  Ten-year yields climbed to 2 percent for the first time
since Sept. 5 after the European Central Bank said it will lend
dollars to euro-region banks to ensure they have enough of the
U.S. currency. Greek two-year notes rose for the first week in
two months as traders trimmed bets for a pending default.
Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds fell for a fourth week even as
the ECB bought the securities.  “For bunds, some of the safe-haven flows have been
removed,” said Norbert Aul, a European interest-rate strategist
at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “What we have seen, to some
degree, is a pricing out of an imminent  default risk  for
Greece.”  German 10-year bund yields rose nine basis points this week
to 1.86 percent at 5 p.m. in London yesterday. They reached
2.002 percent on Sept. 15. The 2.25 percent security, due
September 2021 fell 0.85, or 8.50 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,377)
face amount, to 103.485. Two-year yields advanced 12 basis
points to 0.51 percent.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said on Sept. 14 they’re “convinced” Greece will
remain in the currency union.  Greek Notes  Greek two-year yields fell more than 20 percentage points
in the three days through yesterday. They had climbed above 80
percent for the first time on Sept. 14 amid speculation the
country wouldn’t be able to meet its obligations to investors.  The difference in yield, or spread, between Greek two-year
notes and 10-year securities narrowed by 2.48 percentage points
over the week to 33.94 percentage points. That’s down from a
euro-era record of 52.26 percentage points on Sept. 13.  The ECB said on Sept. 15 it will conduct three U.S. dollar
liquidity-providing operations in coordination with the  Federal
Reserve , the Bank of  England , the Bank of  Japan  and the Swiss
National Bank. European stocks and the euro rallied.  Italian and Spanish bonds ended the week lower, even as
people familiar with the transactions said the  European Central
Bank  purchased the nations’ debt.  Spain’s 10-year bond yields rose 13 basis points over the
week to 5.29 percent, after reaching 5.44 percent on Sept. 13
the most since the ECB began buying the debt on Aug. 8. Yields
on similar-maturity Italian bonds climbed 10 basis points to
5.51 percent, after reaching 5.77 percent on Aug. 14.  ECB Buying  The ECB began purchasing Spanish and Italian bonds last
month to curb a surge in yields as contagion from the debt
crisis that engulfed Greece, Ireland and Portugal spread to the
region’s third- and fourth-largest economies.  Economists say a report next week will show an index based
on a survey of euro-area purchasing managers in the services and
manufacturing industries fell to 49.8 from 50.7. A reading above
50 indicates growth.  German  government bonds  have returned 7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg.
Greece’s have declined 37 percent, Italy’s have dropped 3.2
percent and Spain’s have increased 3.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
