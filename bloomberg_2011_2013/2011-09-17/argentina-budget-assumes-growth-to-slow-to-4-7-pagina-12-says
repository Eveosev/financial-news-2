Argentina â€™s draft 2012 budget
forecasts the economy will expand 4.7 percent next year, down
from 8.3 percent in 2011, according to newspaper  Pagina 12 ,
which cited macroeconomic data it said was used to prepare the
budget.  The 2012 budget, which will be presented to Congress on
Sept. 28, assumes inflation at 9.2 percent, the peso weakening
to an average 4.5 per dollar and allows the government to use
central bank reserves to pay debt, the Buenos-Aires based daily
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
