Syracuse University  and the
University of Pittsburgh have applied to join the Atlantic Coast
Conference, the New York Times reported.  Syracuse and Pitt, members of the Big East Conference, are
among 10 schools that have approached the ACC about joining, the
Times said, citing an ACC official it didnâ€™t identify.  No timetable has been set for a decision on the
applications, the Times said. The ACC reached its current 12-
team format by adding Miami, Virginia Tech and  Boston College 
from the Big East in 2003, the newspaper said.  The presidents of the 12 ACC schools also unaminously
approved raising the fee for members to leave the conference to
$20 million from $12 million to $14 million, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
