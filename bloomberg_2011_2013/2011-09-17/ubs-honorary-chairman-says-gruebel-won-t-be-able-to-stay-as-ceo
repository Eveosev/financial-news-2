UBS AG (UBSN)  Honorary Chairman Nikolaus Senn said  Oswald Gruebel  won’t be able to keep his post as chief
executive officer after a trader lost $2 billion through
unauthorized trading.  UBS lacked adequate control measures, Senn said in an
interview with Swiss TV channel SF, according to the station’s
 website .  Senn was chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the
banks that later became UBS, from 1988 to 1996. He became
honorary chairman in 1996, two years before Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. merged.  Serge Steiner, a spokesman for UBS, declined to comment
today when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
