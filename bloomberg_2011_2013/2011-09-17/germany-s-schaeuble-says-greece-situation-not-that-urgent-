German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said  Greece  has no need to refinance itself in
financial markets any time soon, giving policy makers time to
find solutions for the over-indebted country.  “We’ve freed Greece from the need to refinance itself in
financial markets well into next year,” Schaeuble told
reporters in Wroclaw,  Poland , after a meeting of European Union
finance ministers and central bank governors. “So the situation
isn’t that urgent.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
