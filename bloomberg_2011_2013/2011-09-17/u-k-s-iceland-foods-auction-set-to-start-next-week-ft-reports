The auction of frozen food retailer
Iceland Foods Ltd. will start next week with about 20 buyers set
to receive sales information, the Financial Times said, citing
people familiar with the matter that it didn’t name.  The Resolution Committee of Landsbanki appointed Bank of
America Merrill Lynch and UBS AG to sell its 67 percent stake,
said the FT.  Glitnir Bank is also selling its holding, taking the total
for sale to 77 percent, Landsbanki said in a statement Sept. 1.
A price of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) may be
difficult for buyers to pay because of “strains” in the  debt
market , the FT said.  The big four U.K. supermarket chains, Tesco Plc, Asda
Stores Ltd., J Sainsbury Plc and WM Morrisson Supermarkets Plc
are likely to be among potential buyers receiving sales
information, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
