The  Hong Kong  government plans to
sell seven land sites in October through December by tender,
Carrie Lam, the city’s secretary for development, told
reporters. Lam’s comments were broadcast by Cable Television.   The level of buying interest among developers has fallen
recently, so it’s “more appropriate” for the government to
sell through tenders rather than auctions, Lam said at a media
briefing in Hong Kong yesterday, according to an official
transcript.   Lam said she is “confident” the annual target of
supplying 20,000 homes can be achieved in the fiscal year ending
March 2012.   To contact the reporter on this story:
