A global crisis with a 15 percent
drop in global trade would cause the Dutch economy to contract
7.8 percent within five years because it depends on exports, the
government said.  The  budget deficit  may rise to 4.4 percent of gross
domestic product under such a scenario, Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said in a letter to parliament in The Hague
yesterday. The banking industry would have sufficient reserves
to survive such a crisis without state support, he said.  The parliament asked the government on Sept. 14 to release
crisis scenarios in the case of a Greek default. Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  is seeking to secure additional
European Union and International Monetary Fund aid following a
110 billion-euro ($152 billion) bailout last year. Investor
skittishness about his ability to push through cuts to secure
the funds and avert default has roiled markets.  Under the governmentâ€™s second scenario, an ongoing European
debt crisis, housing prices may fall 20 percent and the stock
market may drop 40 percent while the economy shrinks by 5.4
percent. The third scenario, a repeat of the credit crisis of
2008, foresees a 10 percent decline in housing prices and an
economic contraction of 5.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
