Germany ’s main opposition  Social
Democratic Party  wouldn’t form a government with  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats without elections if the
chancellor’s coalition disintegrates amid debate over the euro
crisis, SPD leader  Sigmar Gabriel  told  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung  in an interview.  A new ruling mandate is only possible through a
parliamentary election, the newspaper quoted Gabriel as saying
in a preview of an interview to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
