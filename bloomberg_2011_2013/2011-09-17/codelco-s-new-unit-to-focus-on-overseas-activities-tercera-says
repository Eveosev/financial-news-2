Codelco’s new Inversiones Mineras
Acrux SpA unit will focus on overseas activities and may bring
in minority shareholders as the company seeks to expand abroad,
 La Tercera  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez .  The plan is for Inversiones Mineras Acrux to have its own
output and reinvest earnings, the Santiago-based newspaper said,
citing Hernandez. Codelco, the world’s biggest copper producer,
created the unit with capital of $10,000, it said in a
regulatory filing yesterday.  Chile’s Codelco will decide by mid-October if it will sell
bonds in international markets this year or next, depending on
market conditions, the newspaper said, citing Hernandez. The
company may sell $1 billion in debt and take a loan for another
$1 billion, according to Tercera.  To contact the reporter on this story:
