Mauritius’s  central bank  and the
Bankers Association set up a committee to explore the difference
between the bank’s benchmark rate and lending rates, the Bank of
Mauritius said in a statement published on its website
yesterday.  The central bank’s monetary policy committee left the
benchmark rate unchanged at 5.5 percent last week as inflation
slowed, after increasing it at the last two meetings. Commercial
bank’s lending rates range from between 2 percent and 19.75
percent above the prime rate, according to data on the Bank of
Mauritius’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kamlesh Bhuckory in  Port
