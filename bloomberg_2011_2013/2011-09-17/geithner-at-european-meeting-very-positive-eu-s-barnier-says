European Union Financial-Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said it was “very positive” to
have U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  attend a meeting
of EU finance chiefs this week and it might be a “good idea”
to invite his Chinese counterpart in the future.  “Eighty percent of financial transactions are trans-
Atlantic,” Barnier told a press conference today in Wroclaw,
Poland, after the conclusion of the two-day meeting. “It won’t
be like that forever;  Asia  is coming up more and more. But at
present that is the reality, which is why I thought it was a
very positive, useful thing to invite  Tim Geithner .”   Barnier applauded Poland, current holder of the six-month
rotating presidency of the EU, for inviting the U.S. Treasury
secretary to the meeting and suggested a similar invitation
could be extended to  China .  “I don’t know whether in the next presidency the Chinese
finance minister might be invited to come and have a dialog with
us,” Barnier said in response to a question. “I think that’s a
good idea myself.”  “I certainly approve very much of the initiative taken by
the Polish minister to invite Tim Geithner because we’ve got
things we have to look at together -- the Chinese, the
Americans, the Europeans and others,” Barnier said. “All of us
sit at the G-20 table. This financial crisis, which for the last
three years has seen no end, has led the leaders of the G-20,
including ourselves, to enter into commitments on  regulation
and transparency, on governance worldwide. Now we have to
deliver on all of that.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
