Russia  wants “firm guarantees”
from the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that
the country won’t be targeted by a planned missile-defense
system, the Foreign Ministry said.  “The logic of events confirms the need to work out within
the Russia-NATO council effective and concrete solutions on the
concept and architecture of the missile defense being deployed
in the region,” the ministry said on its  website  today.  The statement comes two days after a 2008 accord between
the U.S. and  Poland  to station SM-3 interceptor missiles on
Polish territory by 2018 came into force. That agreement, which
follows missile deployments in Turkey and Romania, is a “new
example” of missile-defense plans being implemented without
regard for the changing source of threats, the ministry said.  The anti-missile system that NATO says will be used to
guard against attacks from countries such as  Iran  has been a
sticking point for Russia, which fears it will blunt its own
nuclear deterrent. Russia wants to be an equal partner in the
missile-defense program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
