European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jens Weidmann said risks to the economic outlook
have increased “considerably” as the region’s debt crisis
roils financial markets.  “The risks for the economic outlook considerably
increased, due to the tensions in financial markets that relate
to the sovereign debt crisis in the European Union,” Weidmann
said today after meeting European finance ministers and central
bankers in Wroclaw,  Poland . Still, “the economic pessimism
that’s spreading at the moment is partly exaggerated. The
slowdown in economic growth we saw in the spring was largely due
to temporary factors” such as the disruption of supply chains
in  Japan  and the rise of crude oil prices.  Economic growth is slowing, though it will remain
“robust,” he added. “Against this background, measures to
stimulate the economy are not necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
