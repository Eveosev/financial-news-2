A Chinese businessman paid a record
125,000 pounds ($197,000) for a bottle of Scotch whisky, the
Financial Times reported today.  The 62-year-old bottle of Dalmore had been on sale in
 Singapore ’s Changi airport for six months, the FT said.  The Dalmore distillery was bought by Whyte and Mackay Ltd.
in 1960, who then sold it in 2007 to  India ’s United Breweries
group, the report said.  Last year, $1.13 billion worth of Scotch whisky was shipped
to Asia from the U.K., the newspaper said, without saying where
it had got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
