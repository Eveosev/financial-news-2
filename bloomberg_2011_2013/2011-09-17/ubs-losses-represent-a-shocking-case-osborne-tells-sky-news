The unauthorized trades that led to
losses at  UBS AG (UBSN)  represent “a shocking case,” British
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said in a Sky News
interview today.  “It is a shocking case,” Osborne said. “We will wait for
the full details of it to emerge, but it is pretty clear that
totally unacceptable things were going on in UBS and our
regulator is looking into it at the moment and indeed the police
are looking into it.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
