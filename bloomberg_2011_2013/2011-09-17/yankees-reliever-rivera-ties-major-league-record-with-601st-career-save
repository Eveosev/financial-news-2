Mariano Rivera  tied the Major
League Baseball record with his 601st career save in the  New
York Yankees ’ 7-6 win over the  Toronto Blue Jays .  Rivera, 41, matched the record held by Trevor Hoffman, four
days after joining him as the second relief pitcher to collect
 600 saves . No other reliever has 500.  Rivera, who has spent his 17-year major-league career with
the Yankees, has said he’s focused on helping his team win games
rather than set records. He has 42 saves this season for the
Yankees, who lead the American League Eastern Division and are
closing in on a playoff berth for the 16th time in 17 years.  A 12-time All-Star, Rivera has had eight seasons with at
least 40 saves since moving into the Yankees’ closer role in
1997 and is one of two relievers with two 50-save campaigns.  In helping the Yankees win five  World Series titles , he’s
also totaled a record 42 postseason saves, more than twice as
many as any other pitcher and 38 more than Hoffman, who retired
in January after  18 seasons , all but two with the  San Diego
Padres . He pitched in 12 postseason games with four saves.  Since Rivera posted a 3.15 earned run average in 2007 with
30 saves -- his second-fewest as a closer -- he’s logged a 1.85
ERA over the past four seasons. Rivera has one season remaining
on the two-year, $30 million contract he signed with the Yankees
during the offseason.  Whenever Rivera breaks the tie with Hoffman, he’ll probably
hold the record outright for an extended time. Lee Smith ranks
third with 478 saves, while John Franco and Billy Wagner are the
only other relievers to top 400. None of them are still playing.  Francisco Cordero, 36, of the  Cincinnati Reds  leads all
active players other than Rivera with 323 saves.  Fisherman’s Son  Rivera, the son of a Panamanian fisherman, has been
successful while predominantly throwing two pitches -- a sinker
and a bat-breaking cut fastball, which he learned to throw in a
1997 warm-up session and has called a  gift from God .  To contact the reporter on this story:
