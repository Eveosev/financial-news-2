Staff at a retail center near
Chester in the U.K. are taking lessons how to serve Chinese
customers as the number of tourists increases, the Financial
Times reported today.  Cheshire Oaks, a discount outlet owned by the McArthurGlen
Group, has recruited a trainer from  Hong Kong  to teach staff how
to deal with Chinese customers, the FT said, citing center
manager Colin Wilding.  Stores in  London , including the luxury department-store
Harrods Ltd., have installed Chinese-language cash machines for
customers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
