Economic growth in  Zambia , Africa’s
top copper producer, has averaged more than 6 percent in the
last five years, yet little has been done to alleviate poverty,
said  Michael Sata , head of the second-largest political party.  “I can’t understand how the economy can continue to grow
at more than 6 percent annually while more than 60 percent of
Zambians continue to wallow in poverty,” Sata, who leads the
Patriotic Front, Zambia’s largest opposition party, said in an
interview taped for the privately owned Lusaka-based Muvi TV.  “Our currency has also continued to lose strength,” he
said. “This is something a PF government intends to change.”  Sata will face President Rupiah Banda in the Sept. 20
election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
