Peacocks Stores Ltd., a U.K.
fashion retailer, is looking to restructure its capital base and
is in talks with its U.S. hedge fund backers Och-Ziff and Perry
Capital, the Financial Times reported today, without saying
where it got the information.  Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM)  and Perry Capital may
provide additional funds for the clothing retailer, according to
the FT. The restructuring plan follows the failure of Peacocksâ€™
negotiations this year to sell its Bonmarche unit to Duke Street
Capital Ltd., the newspaper reported.  The company has about 240 million pounds ($379 million) of
net debt, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
