German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said there won’t be any new measures introduced in the
euro area to spur economic growth. Speaking to reporters today
in Wroclaw,  Poland  after a meeting of European Union finance
leaders, Schaeuble also said there was no euro crisis and that
he couldn’t say when a review of Greek finances by the so-called
troika would be completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
