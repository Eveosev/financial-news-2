Yanbu Cement, a Saudi Arabian
cement maker, said that a production line scheduled to open by
the end of this month will be delayed because of a lack of oil
and natural gas needed to power its output.  “The major reason impacting the operation of the new line
5 is the non-availability of a fuel allocation,” general
manager Saud Saleh Islam said today in response to e-mailed
questions. The opening schedule will depend on the timing of
this allocation, he said.  The production line will increase Yanbu Cement’s annual
production capacity from 3.6 million metric tons to 7 million
metric tons.  Saudi Arabia , the largest Arab economy, is
increasing cement capacity to cope with a real estate boom and
demand from infrastructure projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
