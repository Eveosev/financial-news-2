Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said the European Financial Stability Facility should not get
the option to refinance itself through the  European Central
Bank .  There are “question marks” whether the EFSF would get a
banking license, Weidmann said today after a meeting of European
finance ministers and central bankers in Wroclaw,  Poland .
Financing of indebted states “via the central bank” would
represent “monetary state financing” that’s banned under EU
law, he said.  Weidmann declined to comment whether this position is
shared by his fellow colleagues in the ECB’s Governing Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
