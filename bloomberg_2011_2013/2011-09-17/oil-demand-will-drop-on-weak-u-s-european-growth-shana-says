Global demand for oil will continue
to decline because of the “lack of economic growth” in the
U.S. and  Europe , the Iranian Oil Ministry’s  Shana  news website
said today, citing Mohammad Ali Khatibi, the country’s OPEC
governor.  China ’s demand for oil was at “a desirable level,” the
news service said, citing Khatibi. Asia’s developed economies
were “in a better economic situation in comparison to European
countries but they are also experiencing falling economic
growth, except China,” Khatibi was cited as saying by Shana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
