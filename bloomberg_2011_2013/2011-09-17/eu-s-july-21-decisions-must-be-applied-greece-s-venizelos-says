Decisions made at the July 21
European Union summit to support  Greece ’s economy must be
applied to ensure the country gets the sixth and future payments
of its aid package, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said.  The timing of the sixth payment isn’t the problem, he said.
“Our problem is to ensure that we get the sixth payment and
each future payment with the best possible terms as we can’t
keep having a repeat of the same scenario,” Venizelos told
reporters in  Poland  after a meeting with European counterparts,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the  Finance
Ministry  in Athens.  To achieve this, the July 21 agreement must be carried out
and Greece must meet its obligations and return to primary
surpluses in 2012, he said. The issue is the “ambivalence” of
some euro-area states as to whether the July 21 accord is
sufficient and whether it should be implemented, he said.  “For us it is vital the decisions are implemented, as
while some of them are specific to the euro zone, most concern
Greece and the long-term sustainability of Greek public debt,”
Venizelos said, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
