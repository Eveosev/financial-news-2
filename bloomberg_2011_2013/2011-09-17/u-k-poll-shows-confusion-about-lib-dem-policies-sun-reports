Nearly two thirds of British people
don’t know what the Liberal Democrat political party stands for,
according to a poll  reported  in the Sun newspaper.  The YouGov survey found 63 percent of Britons didn’t know
what the party stood for, amid declining support for the junior
partner in U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s ruling coalition,
the newspaper said. The article did not say how many people took
part in the poll, or when.  Some 59 percent of people surveyed said deputy prime
minister and Liberal Democrat leader  Nick Clegg  was doing badly,
the Sun reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
