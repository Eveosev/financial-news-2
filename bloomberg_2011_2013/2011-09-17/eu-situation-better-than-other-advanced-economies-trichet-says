European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the situation in Europe as a whole is
better than in other major advanced economies and that
“mistakes” made by individual countries are being corrected.  “There is in some respect a situation which is
paradoxical,” Trichet told a press conference today in Wroclaw,
 Poland . “If I take the European Union as a whole, or the euro
area as a whole, you have a situation that is quite encouraging
if you compare with other major advanced economies,” he said.  “We will probably post at the end of the year a deficit of
public finance around 4.5 percent of GDP, when in other major
advanced economies it is in the order of magnitude of 10
percent,” Trichet told the briefing, which followed the
conclusion of a two-day meeting of European finance ministers
and central bankers. “It is also a level of outstanding debt
which is inferior” in  Europe .  “So taken as a whole, the European Union and the euro area
have a situation which is probably better than a number of other
major advanced economies,” Trichet said. “It is at the level
of individual countries that there have been, in our opinion,
mistakes made, individually, which are being corrected, and also
absence of sufficient surveillance. The correction is operating
now and I have to say that we encourage all of them to go along
this line,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
