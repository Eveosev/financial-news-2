Growth in new bank loans is “still
too fast,” with lending increasing at an annualized rate of
more than 18 percent in June and July, the  Hong Kong  Economic
Times reported today, citing the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s
Deputy Chief Executive Arthur Yuen.  The city’s de facto central bank may adopt measures on
mortgages if needed, the Chinese-language newspaper said, citing
Yuen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
