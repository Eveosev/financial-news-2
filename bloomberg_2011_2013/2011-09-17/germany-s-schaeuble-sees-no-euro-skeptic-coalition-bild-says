German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said a governing coalition between his Christian
Democratic Union party and a “fundamentally euro-skeptic”
party would be unimaginable,  Bild am Sonntag  reported, citing an
interview.  Schaeuble said he can’t conceive that members of CDU
coalition partner the Free Democratic Party, led by Philipp Roesler, the vice chancellor and economy minister, would vote to
take the party in a “euro-skeptic direction,” the newspaper
reported today in a preview of the interview to be published
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
