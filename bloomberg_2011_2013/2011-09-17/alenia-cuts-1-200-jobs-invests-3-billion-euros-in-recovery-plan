Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ’s Alenia
Aeronautica unit said it will cut 1,200 jobs, offering workers
early retirement, as it aims to reduce costs and increase
profitability as part of a recovery plan.  Alenia, which yesterday presented its business plan to
Italian unions, aims to make “targeted investments” and may
develop a “new civil aircraft,” the company said in an e-
mailed statement. The aeronautic company will invest 3 billion
euros ($4 billion) from 2012 to 2020, the Cisl union said in a
separate statement after the meeting yesterday.  “Our decisions must take into account the difficult global
economic situation, the cuts being made to the major
governments’ defence budgets and an increasingly competitive
market,” Alenia Aeronautica Chief Executive Officer Giuseppe Giordo said in the statement.  About 1,000 workers will be affected by temporary lay-offs
and Alenia also plans to outsource 500 workers and recruit 500
new workers, the company said. Finmeccanica will merge Alenia
with its Alenia Aermacchi unit in an effort to integrate its
aeronautics business.  A spokesman for Alenia, who wouldn’t be named for reasons
of internal policy, declined to comment on the investment plan
when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
