International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA, which owns British Airways Plc, won’t bid for Dublin-
based  Aer Lingus (AERL)  because of the Irish company’s 400 million-euro
($552 million) pension deficit, the Guardian reported,  citing 
Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh .  The parent company of British Airways wants to reduce costs
across its businesses by 400 million pounds ($632 million)
within five years, the newspaper said, citing a speech by Walsh
at the London Irish Business Society this week.  Walsh said he is interested in buying U.K.-based BMI and
 Portugal ’s TAP SGPS SA, the Guardian reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
