Imposition of a tax on financial
transactions would be “practical and valuable,” European Union
Financial-Services Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said.  “We’re only starting the debate on that and there’s no
agreement as yet,” Barnier told a press conference today in
Wroclaw,  Poland , after the conclusion of the two-day meeting of
EU finance ministers and central bankers. The European
Commission will make proposals on a financial-transaction tax
“in a few weeks,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
