A Greek exit from the  euro zone  is
“conceivable” if rescue efforts fail,  Spiegel  magazine cited
Horst Seehofer, chairman of the CSU party that’s in a governing
coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU, as saying in an
interview.  “If the Greek government and parliament don’t want to or
can’t follow this path any longer, we shouldn’t wait until the
financial markets force us to face reality,” the magazine
quoted Seehofer as saying in an e-mailed preview of the
interview. “A Greek exit from the euro zone must then be
conceivable.”  The “idea of  Europe ” will live on if the euro zone
splits, Spiegel cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
