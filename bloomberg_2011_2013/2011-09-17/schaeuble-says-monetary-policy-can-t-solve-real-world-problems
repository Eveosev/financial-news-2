German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said policy makers shouldn’t resort to using the
European Central Bank to boost the European Financial Stability
Facility’s lending capacity.  “Regarding leveraging, it depends on what is meant by
that,” Schaeuble told reporters in Wroclaw, Poland, after a
meeting of European Union finance ministers and central bank
governors. “One thing is clear, and I have said that in other
circumstances, most recently at our G-7 meeting in Marseille: we
don’t think that real economic and social problems can be solved
by means of  monetary policy . That has never been the European
model and it won’t be.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
