Discussions about whether  Greece 
should post collateral for any loans it gets from other
government are taking place “day and night,” Finnish Prime
Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said in an interview with the Latvian
newspaper  Diena .  The kind of collateral hasn’t been worked out, he said,
according to the Riga-based newspaper. The euro region will
“definitely not collapse,” he said, though it needs a
supervisory agency that ensures member states adhere to rules,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
