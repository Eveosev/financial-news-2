European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the euro “will always remain a
stable currency, while it’s essential that its members fully
respect their commitments,” according to an interview published
today in Italian daily La Stampa.  Stark said European institutions should have powers “to
interfere” in decisions regarding national budgets, La Stampa
reported. He also said that “non-conventional measures
adopted” by the ECB are “temporary by nature.”  Stark last week announced his resignation from the ECB
board in protest at its bond purchases. He will remain the ECB’s
chief economist until a replacement is found.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
