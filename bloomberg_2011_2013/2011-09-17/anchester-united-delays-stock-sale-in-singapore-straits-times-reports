English soccer club  Manchester
United  delayed plans to sell stock in Singapore because of “the
rocky share market,” the city-state’s  Straits Times  newspaper
reported, citing an unidentified person.  The sale was planned for the middle of October, according
to the article. A new date hasn’t been given, the report said.  Singapore’s stock exchange approved yesterday  Manchester
United ’s application to raise about $1 billion in an initial
public offering, two people with knowledge of the matter said,
according to Bloomberg News. Manchester United had been
reviewing the IPO schedule because of volatile markets, the
people said.  Qatar’s royal family is preparing to offer about 1.5
billion British pounds ($2.37 billion) in a takeover bid for the
club, the Daily Mirror newspaper in the U.K.  reported  yesterday.
A delegation from the Qatari royal family, headed by Sheikh
Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, will be in Manchester on Sept. 19 to
try to complete the transaction, the newspaper reported on its
website, without identifying its sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
