The Dutch government’s plan to
substantially reduce its stake in the finance industry within
five years could be delayed if there are economic crises,
according to its finance minister.  Such crises may also cause the government to recover less
of the money it spent bailing out the country’s finance industry
in 2008 and 2009 than previously expected, Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  wrote in a letter to parliament yesterday. The
letter included forecasts for how various possible crises may
affect the economy.  The former government led by Jan Peter Balkenende bought
Fortis’s Dutch banking and insurance units and its stake in ABN
Amro Holding NV for 16.8 billion euros ($23.2 billion) in
October 2008 after the company ran out of short-term funding as
customers withdrew deposits and investors lost confidence.
Additional aid pushed the costs of the bailout to about 30
billion euros.  De Jager plans to sell ABN Amro shares as early as in 2014
and said previously that it would be “incredibly difficult” to
recover taxpayers’ money spent on ABN and Fortis.  ING Groep NV, the biggest Dutch financial-services company,
received 10 billion euros of state aid and the government agreed
to assume 80 percent of the risk of a pool of Alt-A mortgage
assets. That may result in a 1.4 billion-euro loss for the
government in the worst case,  De Jager  said in the letter,
citing one of four external parties that calculated the value of
those assets for the government in September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
