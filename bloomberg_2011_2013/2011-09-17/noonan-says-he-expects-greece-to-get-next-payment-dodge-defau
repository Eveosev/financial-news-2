Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said European finance ministers and central bankers
didn’t discuss the prospect of a Greek debt default during their
meetings in Poland.  “The expectation is that  Greece  will meet its targets and
that money will be disbursed to Greece,” Noonan said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Wroclaw, Poland. “After
leaving this beautiful part of Poland today my idea of risk is
much lower than it was when I came” because “after the
discussions I was party to, I think the Greek situation will be
resolved.”  Noonan said euro-area parliaments would ratify proposed
changes to the European Financial Stability Facility “in EU
advance of mid-October.” Most governments will approve the IMF
changes in September, with a few remaining for early October
because of legislative timetables.  To contact the reporters on this story:
