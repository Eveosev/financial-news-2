Georgia’s National Intellectual
Property Center  registered as many as 37 varieties of local food
and beverages, including types of wine and cheese, to protect
them from being copied in other countries.  Chacha, a traditional liquor, has also been registered
under a law of  Georgia  “On Appellations of Origin and
Geographical Indications of Goods,” Irakli Gvaladze, the
center’s chairman, said by phone in the capital Tbilisi today.
The relevant documents have been sent to Russia, which banned
the products in 2006, he said.  Georgia expelled four Russian servicemen who it accused of
espionage in 2006. In response, Vladimir Putin’s government cut
road, rail, air and sea links, blocking imports of mineral water
and wine. It had previously banned other products such as fruit
and vegetables.  “ Russia  is known for many attempts of falsifications and
trademarking of Georgian delicacies,” Gvaladze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
