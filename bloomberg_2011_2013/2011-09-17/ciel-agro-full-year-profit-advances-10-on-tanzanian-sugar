CIEL Agro-Industry , a sugar
producer, posted a 10 percent increase in full-year profit
helped by its Tanzanian sugar operations.  Net income increased to 663.6 million Mauritian rupees ($23
million) in the financial year through June from a year earlier,
the company said in a statement published in the Port-Louis
based l’Express newspaper today. “Improved performance is
largely attributable” to “higher profitability” of its
Tanzanian operations, profits on sales of non-core investments,
and revaluation of lands, it said.  The company’s sugar operation in Tanzania had a record year
reaching 86,000 tons. Sales fell to 3.3 billion rupees from 4.6
billion rupees reflecting a “slowdown” in the  property market ,
said the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
