BP Plc (BP)  is open to a settlement for
all damages and fines resulting from the Macondo oil spill and
wants to reach an agreement early next year, the Financial Times
reported today, citing people familiar with the matter.  “We are preparing to try the case scheduled to begin on
February 27, 2012, and will not comment on speculation about
potential settlements with other parties,” BP press officer
 Robert Wine  said by e-mail today.  The final report on the oil spill disaster, published last
week by U.S. regulators, was seen as sharing blame between BP,
Transocean Ltd., the operator of the rig, and Halliburton Co.,
the company that provided cement to seal the well, the FT said.  The spreading of responsibility is unlikely to help BP in
reaching a settlement with the  Department of Justice , which is
undertaking a criminal investigation of the accident, the
newspaper said, citing U.S. legal experts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
