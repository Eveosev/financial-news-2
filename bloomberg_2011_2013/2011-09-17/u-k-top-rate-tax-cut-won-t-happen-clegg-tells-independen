U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  will block any attempt by Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  to cut the 50 percent top income tax rate, the
Independent  reported .  Clegg said in an interview with the newspaper that reducing
the top rate would destroy public confidence in the tax system.  “It is not going to happen,” he said. “Certainly not
until there is significant progress on giving tax breaks to
those on lower and middle incomes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
