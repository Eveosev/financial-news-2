German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said concerns in financial markets have their causes
in uncertainty how the U.S. government can deal with its  budget
deficit  as well as how the European Union copes with the fact
that some euro countries have too high deficits “that could
pose a danger to the stability of the euro zone as a whole.”  “We don’t have a euro crisis, we have a crisis in some
member countries,” Schaeuble told reporters after a meeting of
EU finance ministers and central bank governors in Wroclaw,
Poland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
