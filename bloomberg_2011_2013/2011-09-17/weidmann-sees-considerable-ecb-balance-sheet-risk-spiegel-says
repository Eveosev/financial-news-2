European Central Bank  governing
council member Jens Weidmann said the ECB must reduce
“considerable” risks in its balance sheet, Spiegel magazine
reported today, citing an interview.  “We must reduce these risks again, because German
taxpayers are assuming 27 percent of the responsibility for
these risks” due to unconventional measures such as bond
purchases, Weidmann said, according to an e-mailed preview of
the interview.  ECB intervention in financial markets reduces government
incentives to implement fiscal reforms, the magazine cited
Weidmann as saying. The political system is the only
democratically legitimate way to launch austerity programs or
rescue packages, the magazine cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
