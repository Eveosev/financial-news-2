Pakistan doesn’t plan to seek a
fresh loan program from the  International Monetary Fund  as it
has a comfortable balance-of-payment situation, Dawn newspaper
 reported  today, citing Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh.  The Washington-based IMF hasn’t disbursed any money to
Pakistan since May 2010 after the country failed to meet
conditions attached to a $11.3 billion loan first issued in
2008. In December last year, the IMF approved a nine-month
extension of the loan to give Pakistani authorities time to
comply with some elements of the agreement, including reduction
in the  budget deficit  and implementing a  sales tax .  Pakistan will continue to reform its troubled energy
companies and work for an economic stability so that it can
negotiate a new program in the future, if needed, the newspaper
cited Shaikh as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
