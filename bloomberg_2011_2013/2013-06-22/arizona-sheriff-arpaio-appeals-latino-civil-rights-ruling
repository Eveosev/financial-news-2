Arizona  Sheriff Joe Arpaio is
appealing a federal judge’s ruling that his office violated the
constitutional rights of Latinos who were stopped during
saturation patrols.  Lawyers for Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office
filed a notice of appeal yesterday in federal court in Phoenix.  U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow in May said that Arpaio,
who calls himself “America’s toughest sheriff,” and his
deputies had no authority to stop and detain people solely based
on the suspicion they were undocumented immigrants.  Arpaio’s department covers Arizona’s biggest county by
population, with 3.8 million residents. His methods, including
saturation patrols or “crime suppression” sweeps in
predominantly Latino areas in and around Phoenix, have made him
a hero to groups seeking a crackdown on unauthorized entrants to
the U.S. and a target of advocates for immigrants’ rights.  The case is Melendres v. Arpaio, 07-02513, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix).  To contact the reporter on this story:
