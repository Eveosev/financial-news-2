New York  Mets pitcher Jonathon Niese
was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a partial tear of
his left rotator cuff, the Major League Baseball team said.  The 26-year-old lefthander left in the fourth inning with
one out during the Metsâ€™ 4-3 win over the  Atlanta Braves  two
days ago. He allowed three runs on eight hits and struck out
five.  Niese is 3-6 with a 4.32 earned run average in 14 starts
for New York.  With Niese out, the Mets recalled righthander Greg Burke of
Triple-A Las Vegas of the Pacific Coast League. Burke, 30, began
the year with the Mets before he was sent down to Las Vegas on
April 18. He was recalled May 12 and allowed three earned runs
over 12 2/3 innings before he was optioned again on June 15.  Burke last pitched on June 18, throwing 1 1/3 innings at
Tucson, allowing three runs. Burke is 1-1 with a 6.55 ERA in
nine games with  Las Vegas . He is 0-1 with a 4.05 ERA in 21 games
with the Mets this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
