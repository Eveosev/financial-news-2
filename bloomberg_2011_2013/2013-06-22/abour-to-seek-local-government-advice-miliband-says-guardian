The U.K.’s opposition Labour party
will seek the advice of local governments on housing and work
programs, the Guardian newspaper leader reported, citing an
interview with leader  Ed Miliband .  “Too often in the past central government, Labour central
governments, told local government what to do,” Miliband said,
according to the newspaper. “We are reversing this. We are
going to get local government to tell us how it’s done.”  Miliband -- attending the party’s national policy forum
meeting in Birmingham today -- was scheduled to announce a local
government taskforce to advise the party’s policy review on how
the public sector can “deliver more with less,” the newspaper
said.  The Labour leader’s comments come as the Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  seeks 11.5 billion pounds in budget
cuts for the year beginning April 2015, before announcing his
spending review to Parliament on June 26.  “The last Labour government was able to plan on the basis
on rising departmental spending,” Miliband said, according to
the Guardian. “The next Labour government will have to plan on
the basis of falling departmental spending.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
