Aston Martin Racing Team driver
Allan Simonsen was killed when his car left the track “at high
speed” on the fourth lap of the  Le Mans  24 hours race.  The 34-year-old Dane was treated at the scene by doctors
from the Automobile Club de l’Ouest’s Medical Service before
being sent to the Circuit Medical Center, where he died, the
race organizers said today in an e-mailed statement.  Simonsen had participated in seven Le Mans 24-hour races,
the organizers said. He was driving an Aston Martin Vantage GTE
when it left the track at the Tertre Rouge corner at just after
3 p.m. local time. Officials are investigating the cause of the
crash.  “Tragically, and despite the best efforts of the emergency
services in attendance, Allan’s injuries proved fatal,” his
team said in an e-mailed statement.  Aston Martin Racing Managing Director John Gaw, said the
incident was a “terrible tragedy.”  The statement said Simonsen’s family have asked that the
team continue to participate in the race as a tribute. He was
driving the No. 95 car with fellow Danes Christoffer Nygaard and
Kristian Poulsen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
