The moon, in movie parlance, is
ready for its close-up this weekend as its orbit brings the
satellite nearer to Earth than at any time this year, making it
bigger and brighter than normal on the celestial screen.  The moon and Earth will be about 221,824 miles (356,991
kilometers) apart, 17,031 miles closer than usual, said Mark
Paquette, an AccuWeather meteorologist, in a telephone
interview. The close approach, called a perigee, will occur at
7:11 a.m. East Coast time tomorrow.  Paquette, who also specializes in astronomy, said the moon
will be a full one, and the phenomenon will be visible tonight
from about 8 p.m., when the moon is 99 percent full.  “It will seem bigger, especially if you see it earlier
when it’s low to the horizon,” Paquette said in the call from
 State College ,  Pennsylvania .  The “extreme supermoon” occurs about every 13 to 14
months and the planetary body appears about 14 percent larger
and 30 percent brighter than it does when it’s at its greatest
distance, called an apogee, in the orbit with Earth, Paquette
said.  The moon will be at apogee on July 7, he said.  Paquette said “supermoons” occur about three to four
times each year, though they aren’t as close as extreme
supermoons, he said.  AccuWeather said the Southwest and lower Ohio Valley into
the mid-Atlantic region and southern  New England  will have the
clearest skies. Rain and thunderstorms in the Upper Midwest will
making viewing conditions poor there.
