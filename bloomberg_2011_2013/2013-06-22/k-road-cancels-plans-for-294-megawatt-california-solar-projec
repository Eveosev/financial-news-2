K Road Power LLC , a closely held
renewable energy developer backed by  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s investment-banking unit, canceled plans to build a 294-megawatt solar power
plant in southern California.  K Road intends to surrender to regulators a 2010 permit for
its Calico project and has withdrawn its request to amend the
original design for the site, the New York-based company said
today in a  filing  with the California Energy Commission. “Due
to changed market conditions, we will not be able to move this
project forward, either as licensed or as proposed to be
amended,” it said.  K Road in 2010 bought the  project  near Barstow from Tessera
Solar and intended to switch the design from solar-thermal
systems to conventional photovoltaic panels. The company in
December  told  regulators it was addressing “transmission
issues” at the site that may impact the timing of the project
and its interconnection agreement.  Barclays Capital  in 2011 “made a significant investment”
in the company, according to K Road’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
