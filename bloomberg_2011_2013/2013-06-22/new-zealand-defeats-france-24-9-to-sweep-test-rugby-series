New Zealand beat  France  24-9 to
sweep their Test rugby series 3-0 and extend its winning run at
home to 26 matches.  World champion New Zealand scored the only tries of the
match at Yarrow Stadium in New Plymouth through winger Ben Smith
and replacement fly-half Beauden Barrett, who slid over in the
last minute in front of his hometown crowd. Dan Carter booted
four penalties, including a 50-meter effort, and a conversion to
lift his world-record tally of Test points to 1,399.  The top-ranked All Blacks, who moved to within four wins of
tying their longest winning run at home set between 2003 and
2008, won the series opener 23-13 before shutting out the French
30-0 last week.  Florian Fritz kicked a drop goal for France today and Jean
Marc Doussain added a penalty either side of half time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
