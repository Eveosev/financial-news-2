Juan Lagares hit a run-scoring
double in the sixth inning to give the  New York  Mets a 4-3
victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in a Major League
Baseball contest.  Phillies second-baseman Chase Utley, who was activated
yesterday for his first game since May 23 when he suffered an
oblique strain, went 0-for-5, striking out once at Citizens Bank
Park in Philadelphia.  The Phillies took the lead in a three-run second inning
before David Wright hit a run-scoring single in the fourth and
Eric Young Jr. drove in two runs in the fifth inning to tie the
score for the Mets. Lagares followed with his double.  Jeremy Hefner (2-6) allowed three runs on 10 hits and
struck out six in six innings for the Mets. Bobby Parnell got
his 12th save after pitching a perfect ninth inning.  Cole Hamels (2-11) gave up four runs on seven hits and
struck out five in six innings for the Phillies.  The Phillies (35-39) are third in the National League East,
7 1/2 games behind the Atlanta Braves, while the Mets (29-41)
are back 11 1/2 games in fourth place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
