Michel Barnier, the European Union’s
financial services chief, said he’s confident that EU ministers
can wrap up an agreement “in the near future” on how to handle
failing banks.  “The positions of the various states are difficult to
reconcile, but they are not impossible, which is why I remain
confident that an agreement can be found in the Council in the
near future,” he said in an e-mailed statement after
ministerial-level talks in  Luxembourg  failed to yield an accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
