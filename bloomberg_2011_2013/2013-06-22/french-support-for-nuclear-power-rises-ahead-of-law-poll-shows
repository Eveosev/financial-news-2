French public support for nuclear
power is rising ahead of recommendations on a new  energy policy 
law for the country, as fears about its dangers fade.  Some 36 percent of people surveyed said they favored
 France ’s use of nuclear power with only 14 percent saying they
opposed it, an Ifop poll released today for the newspaper Ouest
France showed. That compares with 32 percent in favor of nuclear
power and 20 percent opposed in July 2011.  Concerns about nuclear power rose in France after a March
2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami crippled  Japan ’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant, causing three reactor core
meltdowns, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate and leaving
about 132 square kilometers as a no-go zone.  French President  Francois Hollande  has pledged to cut the
country’s reliance on nuclear power.  Electricite de France SA ’s
58 atomic reactors currently provide more than three-quarters of
electricity, a proportion Hollande vowed to reduce to 50 percent
by around 2025.  Yet the proportion of people who say France should reduce
its dependence on nuclear power because of the energy’s dangers
is declining. When surveyed late last month, 41 percent held
that view, compared with 46 percent who said in March 2013 that
the country should reduce its nuclear dependence, the poll
showed.  The poll was conducted on May 29 and May 30 among 2,004
people age 18 or older and has a margin of error of 1.8
percentage points.  Recommendations on France’s planned law on energy policy
and the country’s power-production mix will be presented to
Hollande in September and the bill will reach parliament at the
beginning of 2014, Environment Minister Delphine Batho said on
June 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
