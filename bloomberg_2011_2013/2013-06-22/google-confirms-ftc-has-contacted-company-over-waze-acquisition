Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
largest search engine, confirmed it has been contacted by the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission regarding the acquisition of
mapping-application Waze.  The company wouldn’t comment on an investigation, said Niki Fenwick, a spokeswoman. Google said earlier this month it was
buying Waze in a deal that gave it new tools for helping users
navigate traffic with smartphones.  Google is undergoing scrutiny from regulators around the
world as it expands its product lineup and moves into new areas
such as mobile technology. The company underwent regulatory
approval by the U.S. and other countries for its $12.4 billion
acquisition of handset-maker Motorola Mobility, which became
part of Google last year.  The Waze deal was valued at about $1.1 billion, a person
familiar with the matter said earlier this month. Google didn’t
disclose terms in a blog post announcing the acquisition.  The  New York  Post reported earlier the FTC had begun
investigating Google over the Waze deal.  -- Editors: Jim McDonald  To contact the reporter on this story:
