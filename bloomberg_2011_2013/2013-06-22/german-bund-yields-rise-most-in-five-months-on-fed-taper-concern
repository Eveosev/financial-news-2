German bunds slumped this week, with
10-yields rising the most in five months, as speculation U.S.
policy makers will reduce asset purchases reduced demand for
fixed-income assets around the world.  Italian and Spanish bonds dropped for a seventh week as the
prospect of an end to Federal Reserve stimulus weighed on
higher-yielding assets. Greek securities slumped, pushing rates
up by the most in a year, while the extra yield that investors
demand to hold 10-year Spanish bonds instead of German bunds
widened to the most two months. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said after a policy meeting on July 19 the central bank may
reduce bond buying this year if the economy improves.  “This was more of a concrete proposal than the market had
been anticipating and as such we saw a massive selloff, notably
amongst all asset classes,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in  London .
“We saw equities move sharply, safe havens sell off across the
curve, peripheral yields far higher but also peripheral spreads
widening.”  Germany ’s 10-year  yield  rose 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, this week to 1.73 percent, the biggest
increase since the period ended Jan. 4. The 1.5 percent bund
maturing in May 2023 fell 1.9, or 19 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 97.97.  The Fed will pare its monthly bond purchases to $65 billion
in September, from the current $85 billion, and end buying
altogether in June 2014, according to the plurality of estimates
by 54 economists in a Bloomberg survey conducted June 19-20
after Bernanke’s press conference in  Washington .  Italy, Spain  Italy’s 10-year yield jumped 34 basis points this week to
4.62 percent after rising to 4.62 percent yesterday, the highest
level since April 3. The rate on similar-maturity  Spanish bonds 
climbed 33 basis points to 4.91 percent. The seven-week increase
in yields is the longest since November 2011.  The extra yield on Spanish 10-year bonds over German bunds
expanded 12 basis points this week to 319 basis points after
reaching 322 basis points on June 20, the widest level since
April 23.  Greek  10-year yields  surged 137 basis points this week to
11.30 percent, the biggest increase since May 2012. The rate
climbed to 11.64 percent yesterday, from this year’s low of 8.10
percent on May 22.  Demand fell at auctions of Spanish and German bonds this
week. Buyers bid for 1.84 times the 1.52 billion euros of
Spanish 10-year securities sold on June 20, down from 2.52 times
at a previous auction on June 6. The bid-to-cover ratio at a
German sale of similar-maturity bunds on June 19 declined to
1.53 times from 1.58 on May 22.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.6 percent this
year through June 20, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
Spanish securities returned 4.6 percent and Italian bonds gained
1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
