Stephen Strasburg  allowed one run on
five hits and struck out nine in seven innings as the  Washington
Nationals  topped the Colorado Rockies 2-1 in a Major League
Baseball contest.  Strasburg (4-6), making his 14th start of the season, got
his first win since May 31 after Ian Desmond hit a home run in
the seventh inning last night to put Washington ahead at
Nationals Park.  “He threw great,” Nationals manager  Davey Johnson  told
reporters. “We’ve been scoring practically nothing (for him).
It was a big win for him and for us.”  Manny Corpas (0-2) gave up one run on one hit in 1 2/3
innings for the Rockies, who lost their fifth straight game.  In two starts since returning from the disabled list on
June 16, Strasburg has given up one earned run and seven hits
over 12 innings.  “The big thing is you have to go out there with the same
mentality every time out regardless of what’s happened in the
past,” Strasburg said. “That’s pitching to contact, keeping
your team in the ballgame.”  Strasburg, 24, who signed a record $15 million four-year
contract, set a major league record with 41 strikeouts in his
first four starts in the 2010 season and went 5-3 with a 2.91
earned run average and 92 strikeouts in 68 innings. He threw a
mixture of fastballs that reached 100 miles (161 kilometers) per
hour, changeups and breaking pitches.  His career was interrupted by so-called Tommy John surgery
on Sept. 4, 2010, to replace a ligament in his throwing arm two
weeks after he injured it. He spent the 2011 season rehabbing
with minor league teams. Last season he went 15-6.  Johnson said Nationals’ outfielder Bryce Harper, who has
been on the disabled list since May 26 with bursitis in his left
knee, is expected to begin rehabilitation with single-A Potomac
on June 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
