Asian currencies tumbled the most in
21 months this week as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the central bank will probably taper stimulus that has
driven fund flows to emerging markets.  India’s rupee touched a record low and Malaysia’s ringgit
had its worst week in three years after Bernanke said on June 19
that $85 billion a month of debt purchases, also known as
quantitative easing, may be trimmed this year and ended in 2014
if the  U.S. economy  performs in line with Fed estimates.  The  Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies, dropped 1.1 percent since
June 14 to 115.51 in  Hong Kong , the biggest decline since Sept.
23, 2011. The rupee retreated 2.9 percent to 59.2675 per dollar,
the ringgit fell 2.7 percent to 3.2 and the Philippine peso lost
2.1 percent to 43.735.  “The prospect of less quantitative easing has caused
outflows and a selloff in Asian assets,” said Tobby Lin, a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “The
countries that had experienced the most inflows, like  South
Korea  and Southeast Asian nations, are being hit the most.”  Global investors pulled a combined $2.1 billion from
Taiwanese, South Korean, Thai and Indonesian stocks in the first
four days of this week, exchange data show.  More than $19 billion was withdrawn from funds investing in
developing-nation assets in the three weeks to June 12, the most
since 2011, according to data from EPFR Global. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the greenback against six major
counterparts, rose 1.6 percent for the week, while the MSCI  Asia 
Pacific Index of shares fell 2.5 percent.  Currency Intervention  Losses in regional currencies have forced central banks to
defend their exchange rates. The Bank of  Thailand  will step in
to curb excessive volatility in the baht if needed, Deputy
Governor Pongpen Ruengvirayudh said June 20 in Bangkok. Finance
Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said the same day he wants the Bank
of Thailand to “manage the foreign-exchange rate.”  Policy makers are watching the rupee and “will take steps
if necessary,”  Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor H.R. Khan
said yesterday. The central bank probably sold dollars around
the unprecedented 59.98 level to prevent the rupee from sliding
past 60, three traders said June 20, asking not to be named as
the information isn’t public.  Chinese Manufacturing  A report released June 20 suggested Chinese manufacturing
shrank more than expected this month. The preliminary reading of
48.3 for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics compares with the 49.1 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey and the final reading of 49.2 in May. Fifty is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  “The Fed’s stimulus outlook dominates the market and is
weighing on regional currencies and assets,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “Data indicating a China
slowdown is adding to the negative sentiment.”  Emerging-market currencies will remain under pressure until
year-end as concern over Fed tapering, which will probably start
in December, will continue to weigh on markets, Morgan Stanley
said in a research note yesterday.  Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea’s won dropped 2.4 percent
this week to 1,154.15 per dollar. Thailand’s baht fell 1.6
percent to 31.07, Indonesia’s rupiah declined 0.6 percent to
9,930 and Taiwan’s dollar weakened 1 percent to NT$30.280.
China’s  yuan  was down 0.06 percent at 6.1342, while the
Vietnamese dong slipped 0.2 percent to 21,036.  To contact the reporter on this story:
