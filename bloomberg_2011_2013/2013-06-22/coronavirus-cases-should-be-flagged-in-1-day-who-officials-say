World Health Organization nations
should investigate suspected cases of the deadly coronavirus as
a matter of urgency and report any probable infections within 24
hours of classification, health officials said.  In a bid to contain the virus that has already killed at
least 38 people, any cluster of pneumonia with unusual clinical
presentation should be probed as well as any immune-compromised
patient or healthcare worker with unusual signs of acute
respiratory infection, according to the plan endorsed by more
than 100 health officials at a WHO meeting in Cairo.  “At the moment we have an important window where cases
have still been relatively few and human transmission is
relatively limited,” Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director-general, said in a statement after the meeting at the United
Nations agency. “We need to exploit this chance to agree and
implement the best public health measures possible across the
board.” The Geneva-based WHO has 194  member states .  To contact the reporter on this story:
