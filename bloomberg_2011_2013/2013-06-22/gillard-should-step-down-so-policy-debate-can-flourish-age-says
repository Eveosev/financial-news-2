Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, facing poor polling and media speculation she may be
toppled in the coming week, should step down so policy-driven
debate can flourish, the Age Newspaper wrote today.  “Voters have been so distracted by internal and external
speculation about Labor’s leadership that efforts by the prime
minister and her ministers to enunciate a narrative, a strategic
vision, for the nation’s future beyond this year have failed,”
 said  the newspaper, published by  Fairfax Media Ltd. (FXJ)  “A big
majority of the electorate appears to have stopped listening.”  Gillard’s main rival, Kevin Rudd, who she beat in a
February 2012 leadership ballot, yesterday again ruled out
challenging for the top job. Even as polls show voters would
give more support to a Rudd-helmed Labor,  Australia ’s first
female leader has vowed she won’t resign. Parliament sits in
Canberra for the final time next week before the Sept. 14
election.  Speculation Labor would return Rudd to the leadership to
revive the party’s prospects for re-election resurfaced after he
started campaign appearances for colleagues in marginal seats
this month. Opinion polls indicate the Tony Abbott-led Liberal-National opposition is set to take government in a landslide
win.  “Julia Gillard will be prime minister at the end of this
week,” Matt Thistlethwaite, a Labor senator, said on Sky
television today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
