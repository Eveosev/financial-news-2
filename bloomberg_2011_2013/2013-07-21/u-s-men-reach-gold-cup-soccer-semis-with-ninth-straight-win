The U.S. routed El Salvador 5-1 for
its record-extending ninth straight win to advance to an 11th
Gold Cup soccer semifinal in 12 appearances at the tournament.  Clarence Goodson and Joe Corona scored first-half goals for
the U.S. in Baltimore yesterday, while Eddie Johnson, Landon Donovan and Mikkel Diskerud scored during the second half.
Donovan had three assists in addition to his 54th career goal
for the national team.  The U.S. faces  Honduras  on July 24 in  Dallas  for a spot in
the July 28 championship game against Panama or  Mexico , the
record six-time winner of the tournament featuring national
teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean.  The U.S., which lost 2-1 in a Feb. 6 World Cup qualifying
match in Honduras, won its fourth Gold Cup title in 2007 and
lost to Mexico in the past two finals. Honduras beat Costa Rica
1-0 in yesterday’s other quarterfinal.  This year’s champion will qualify to playoff against the
winner of the 2015 edition to decide which team represents the
region at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. If the same team
wins both tournaments, it will advance directly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
