Alex Rodriguez  will have a scan on
his left thigh today after going 0-for-4 yesterday in a minor-league rehabilitation game.  Rodriguez was shifted to designated hitter from third base
by the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre team after he experienced
tightness in his left quadriceps.  The leg will be examined today by  New York  Yankees
physician Christopher Ahmad at New York-Presbyterian Hospital,
the team said in an e-mailed news release.  Rodriguez is recovering from hip surgery in January and
said July 17 he planned to be in the Yankees lineup for
tomorrowâ€™s game at the  Texas Rangers . Today was to be the final
day of his 20-day rehab.  Rodriguez yesterday flied out in the first inning and
struck out in his next three appearances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
