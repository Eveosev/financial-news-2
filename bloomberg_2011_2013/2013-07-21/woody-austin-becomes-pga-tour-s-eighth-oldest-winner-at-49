Woody Austin became the eighth
oldest winner in U.S.  PGA Tour  history at 49 when he won golf’s
Sanderson Farms Championship on the first hole of a playoff.  Austin made a seven-foot birdie on the first extra hole --
the par-5 18th -- to beat Cameron Beckman and Daniel Summerhays
yesterday at Annandale Golf Club in Madison, Mississippi.
Beckman missed a five-foot birdie putt to extend the playoff
after the trio tied with four-round totals of 20-under-par 268.  Austin, who was  608th  in the Official World Golf Ranking,
received $540,000 for his fourth career PGA Tour win, which came
at an event that featured players who didn’t qualify for the
British Open. Austin also earned a spot in the  PGA Championship ,
the year’s final major, which is scheduled for Aug. 8-11 at Oak
Hill Country Club in Rochester,  New York .  Sam Snead  was the oldest event winner in PGA Tour history
at 52, while Art Wall, Jim Barnes, John Barnum, Fred Funk and
Craig Stadler all won tournaments after turning 50. Raymond Floyd was also 49, less than two weeks older than Austin, when
he won the 1992 Doral-Ryder Open.  The PGA Tour now moves to Ontario for the $5.6 million RBC
Canadian Open from July 25-28 at Glen Abbey Golf Club.  To contact the reporter on this story:
