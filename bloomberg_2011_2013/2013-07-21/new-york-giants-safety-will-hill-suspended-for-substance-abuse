New York  Giants safety Will Hill has
been suspended without pay for the first four games of the 2013
regular season for violating the National Football League’s
rules on substance abuse, the team said.  Hill, 23, will be eligible to return Sept. 30 in time for
the Oct. 6 game against the  Philadelphia Eagles . He will be
allowed to participate in training camp and preseason games.  Hill was suspended in October for four games after he
tested positive for Adderall which violated the league’s
performance-enhancing drug policy.  Last season he had 38 tackles and one forced fumble with
the Giants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
