More than 250,000 British jobs could
be created as a result of growth in the U.K. financial services
industry, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  About 47,000 positions could be added within the industry
itself, while there is potential for 218,000 to be added in the
wider economy, the accounting firm said in a report today. The
industry’s growth may cause a 2 percent to 3 percent increase in
the country’s gross domestic product, according to PwC.  U.K. businesses spent more than 113 billion pounds (172.5
billion) on financial services in 2010, the period for which the
most recent official data is available, PwC said. The financial
industry bought 90 billion pounds worth of goods and services
from other parts of the economy, it also said. The biggest
outlays from financial firms were on telecommunications,
 information technology , transport and catering.  “The financial services sector has a critical role in the
U.K. economy,” said Nick Forrest, director and financial
services economist at PwC. “In addition to providing credit, it
creates demand in other sectors and helps improve the flow of
capital around the economy.”  PwC’s calculations are based on a scenario where a “robust
regulatory regime” facilitates growth of the financial industry
and where economic conditions are also beneficial.  In an alternative scenario, where financial services growth
is constrained by weaker economic conditions and a regulatory
environment that “does less to facilitate growth”, U.K. GDP
could rise by just 0.2 percent in the period and only 12,000
jobs be created, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
