years, government forecasts show.  Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , a mortgage
provider based in the emirate, jumped 3.6 percent to 1.16
dirhams, the highest close in a month, after reporting a 40
percent increase in second-quarter profit.  “The strength we’ve seen over the last three quarters
clearly indicates strong expectations for earnings to improve,
and growing bottom lines are a validation of market strength
thus far,” said Amer Khan, a Dubai-based director at Shuaa
Asset Management.  The rally “points to how confident investors
are in the prospects for the U.A.E. economy to continue
recovering and growing,” he said.  The DFM and ADX are among the world’s top-five best-performing indexes this year, according to data compiled by

as the economic slowdown in Europe and  China  hurt its second-quarter sales. The stock advanced 1.4 percent, the most since
May 21, to 93.50 riyals.  “Numbers are weaker than estimates, though, given
affiliates also failed to meet estimates, this miss is
expected,” Sriharsha Pappu, a Dubai-based analyst at HSBC
Holdings Plc, said by phone. Pappu, who has a buy rating on the
shares, said analysts estimated  Sabic (SABIC) ’s earnings before the
company’s units reported results. “We’re looking for better
third-quarter results. This quarter is mostly down to pricing.”  Elsewhere in the  Middle East ,  Egypt ’s benchmark EGX 30
