Yemen’s economy is recovering from
its 2011 recession as construction expands and bank lending to
private businesses and consumers surges, Central Bank Governor
Mohammed  Bin Hammam  said.  “Borrowing by the private sector increased more than 18
percent in the first five months of 2013” after the central
bank reduced its benchmark  interest rate  by a total of 5
percentage points to 15 percent in October and February, Bin
Hammam said in an e-mailed response to questions. Inflation,
which had climbed to a 15-month high of 14.5 percent in May, may
ease to “around a single digit by the end of the year,” he
said.  The economy of Yemen, the poorest nation in the  Middle
East , may grow 4.4 percent this year from 0.1 percent in 2012,
according to International Monetary Fund estimates. Gross
domestic product contracted 10.5 percent in 2011 amid the
uprising that ended the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  “The  construction industry  is picking up and most economic
activities would be targeting going back to normal capacities
that were hurt during 2011,” the governor said. Foreign
reserves were $5.7 billion at the end of June, compared with an
external debt of $7.2 billion, he said.  This year’s budget envisions a deficit of $3.2 billion,
which will be financed in part by foreign aid, Bin Hammam said.
“If such financing does not materialize then the government
would take necessary actions to limit the  budget deficit  to
levels that could be financed from domestic non-inflationary
resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
