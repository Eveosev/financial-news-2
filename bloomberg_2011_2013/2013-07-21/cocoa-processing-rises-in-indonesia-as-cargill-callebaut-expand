Cocoa processors in  Indonesia  will
probably boost output by 25 percent to a record next year to
meet Asia’s growing demand for confectionery and chocolate
drinks, spurring higher imports by the third-largest grower.  Grindings, an indication of demand, will climb to 500,000
metric tons, said Piter Jasman, chairman of the Indonesia Cocoa
Industry Association, which represents 14 processors. That
compares with 400,000 tons this year and 310,000 tons in 2012,
according to group data.  Processing increased after Indonesia taxed bean exports in
2010 and as rising incomes across Asia boost demand for
chocolate. Higher grindings may support bean futures in  New York 
and help extend a global deficit. Chocolate confectionery sales
in the Asia-Pacific region will grow this year at more than
twice the global pace, according to London-based consumer
researcher Euromonitor International Ltd.  “When it comes to capacity for grinding, the long-term
strategy is moving towards  Asia ,” said Francisco Redruello, a
senior food analyst at  Euromonitor . “It’s where the strongest
growth for chocolate is coming from and at the same time we see
strong demand at country level.”  Sales in the region will expand by 5.2 percent this year to
859,300 tons, compared with global growth of as much as 2.2
percent, the company estimates. The Asian market, worth $13
billion last year, had a compound annual growth rate of 8.2
percent since 2008, Bloomberg Industries data show.  New Capacity  Cargill Inc. plans to invest $100 million to build a 70,000
ton processing facility in Gresik, East Java, the first such
plant in Asia, the company said May 7. The factory, expected to
be operational in mid-2014, will process beans into products
including liquor, butter and powder.  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the
world’s biggest maker of bulk chocolate and a supplier to  Nestle
SA (NESN) , is building a plant in South Sulawesi.  “Consumers’ taste buds and preferences for better quality
and better-tasting chocolate” are contributing to the increased
demand, Jean-Louis Guillou, country representative at PT Cargill Indonesia, said by e-mail July 18.  Higher grindings may boost imports. The bean harvest will
probably be little changed at 450,000 tons next year, pushing
purchases as high as 100,000 tons from 40,000 tons this year,
according to the Indonesian Cocoa Association, a growers group.  As investments pour in and processors expand, installed
capacity is set to climb by 14 percent to 800,000 tons in 2014
from this year, Jasman said by e-mail July 10. He’s the founder
of grinder PT Bumitangerang Mesindotama, known as BT Cocoa.  China, India  Slowing economic growth in  China  and  India , the two most-populous countries, may curb expansion in chocolate consumption,
raising the risk that less capacity may be needed and
potentially increasing pressure on margins.  China’s economy 
slowed for a second quarter through June, while India’s grew 5
percent in the last fiscal year, the lowest in a decade.  “We don’t expect any significant slowdown in the growth
for chocolate confectionery, especially in China, which is the
driving force in Asia-Pacific,” said Redruello. “If you look
at the GDP figures for the second quarter, you will see that
most of the slowdown is related to industrial output and to
 capital investment ,” he said.  Sales of chocolate confectionery in China will rise by 6.1
percent this year to 178,900 tons, Euromonitor estimates. Indian
sales will climb by 16 percent to 129,000 tons and those in
Indonesia will increase by 4.2 percent to 71,600 tons.  Processing in Asia rose 2 percent to 153,792 tons in the
second quarter from a year earlier, the  Cocoa Association of
Asia  said July 17. In  Europe , grindings rose 6.1 percent in the
same quarter and  North America  had a 12 percent jump.  Cocoa for September delivery in New York declined 0.9
percent to $2,343 a ton by 10:22 a.m. in  London , up 4.7 percent
in the past year. Demand for beans will exceed output in the
year started in October 2012, with Citigroup Inc. estimating a
shortage of 55,000 tons and the International Cocoa Organization
seeing a 60,000 ton deficit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
