The fight against inflation is
important for  rebuilding confidence  in  Brazil ’s economy and
boosting investment, central bank President Alexandre Tombini
said, according to newspaper Estado de S. Paulo.  A recovery in confidence is necessary to maintain the
process of gradual economic recovery, Tombini said, according to
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper. The bank’s mission is combating
inflation and that’s what it’s doing, Tombini said. Inflation
will be slower this year than last year’s 5.84 percent, he said.  It’s up to the government to decide on any fiscal
adjustment, the newspaper said, citing Tombini. It’s important
that the government make clear its fiscal goals and how it plans
to achieve them, Tombini said.  The recent weakening of the real will contribute to
inflation, Tombini said, according to the newspaper. Citing the
minutes to the July 9-10 central bank meeting, Tombini said that
a 20 percent drop in the real against the dollar spurs inflation
by one percentage point. Tombini said he isn’t concerned that
Brazilian companies have borrowed in dollars because they are
adequately hedged against currency fluctuations, according to
Folha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
