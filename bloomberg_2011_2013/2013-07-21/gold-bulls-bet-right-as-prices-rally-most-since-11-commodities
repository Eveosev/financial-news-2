Hedge funds  raised bets on a gold
rally before prices capped the biggest two-week gain in 20
months as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  damped
speculation that a cut in stimulus is imminent.  Speculators increased their net-long position by 56 percent
to 55,535  futures and options  by July 16, the highest since June
4, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Short
contracts fell the most since November after reaching a record
the previous week. Net-bullish  wagers  across 18 U.S.-traded
commodities jumped 28 percent, the biggest gain since March.  Gold surged 6.7 percent in two weeks, the most since
November 2011, as Bernanke signaled that decreases to bond
purchases aren’t imminent. It’s “way too early to make any
judgment” as to whether the Fed will start winding down its
stimulus program in September, he said while testifying before
the Senate July 18. Bullion fell into a  bear market  in April as
some investors lost faith in the metal as store of value.  “We are seeing some support for gold as Bernanke’s
statements tell us that the Fed wants to see a visible
improvement in economic conditions before they begin tapering,”
said  Michael Cuggino , who manages $12 billion of assets at
 Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX)  Family of Funds Inc. in  San Francisco . “The
longer-term reasons for owning gold, like capital preservation,
remain as easy money will continue to flow into the system.”  Gold Survey  Futures gained 1.3 percent to $1,294 an ounce on the Comex
last week, and extended that rally today, rising as much as 3.2
percent to $1,335.70, the highest since June 20. Traders are
bullish for a fourth week, the longest run since the bear market
began in April, with 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expecting
prices to rise this week. Nine were bearish and five neutral.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
percent added 0.9 percent last week, the fourth gain and the
longest rally since February. The MSCI All-Country World  index 
of equities rose 1 percent as the  S&P 500 Index  reached a record
July 18. The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the currency
against 10 major trading partners, fell 0.5 percent. A Bank of
America Corp. Index shows Treasuries returned 0.6 percent.  Bernanke’s remarks come after he said June 19 that the
central bank may start paring the pace of bond buying this year
and end the purchases around the middle of next year if the
economy improves. The Fed purchases $85 billion of debt each
month. Bullion more than doubled from 2008 to a record $1,923.70
in September 2011 as the central bank bought more than $2
trillion of debt.  Japan Buying  Gold rebounded 13 percent since reaching a 34-month low on
June 28 as the declines spurred physical demand. Tanaka
Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,  Japan ’s biggest gold retailer, said July
18 that its sales tripled in the second quarter from the
previous three months. Imports by  India  may climb to more than
900 metric tons in 2013 from 860 tons last year, and  China ’s
purchases may top 1,000 tons, up from 817 tons, the London-based
World Gold Council said July 17.  Most of the gain in the net-long position last week was
attributable to a retreat in short  holdings , which slumped to
61,002 contracts from 80,147. Long  contracts  increased 0.6
percent. The record-large bearish position had left prices
vulnerable to a “short squeeze,” which can magnify any rally
as speculators close out bets on a decline by buying back
contracts,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  said in a report July 17.  China ETFs  Holdings in exchange-traded  products  backed by bullion
plunged 25 percent this year, erasing about $57.7 billion from
the value of the funds. China’s first two gold ETFs last week
raised less money than planned. Prices are down 21 percent this
year. The declines signal investors see a reduced need for
“disaster insurance,” Bernanke said July 18.  “It’s not as if the market has turned bullish suddenly,”
said Nic Johnson, who helps manage $30 billion of commodity
assets at Pacific Investment Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,
 California . “The longs have not raced higher. The shorts in
gold were at a record, and some covering was bound to happen.
People had become very complacent in gold as it went up for so
long, and now the bears feel very vindicated.”  Money managers withdrew $436 million from gold funds in the
week ended July 17, according to  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks money flows. Total outflows from commodity funds were
$354 million, according to EPFR.  Commodity AUM  Commodity assets under management fell to a 32-month low of
$349 billion in June, from $367 billion in May, driven by
decreases in bullion ETPs, according to Barclays Plc. Precious-metal assets fell to $132 billion from $147 billion.  Net-long positions in crude oil climbed 8 percent to
304,383 contracts, the highest since April 2011, the CFTC data
show. Prices climbed for four weeks, the longest rally since
March. U.S. supplies tumbled by 27.1 million barrels in the
three weeks ended July 12, the most in data starting in 1982.  Funds trimmed the net position in copper to a short holding
of 15,673 contracts, from 26,284 a week earlier. China took
steps last week to give banks more freedom to set borrowing
costs, a sign that the government wants to spur economic growth
in the world’s biggest metal-consuming country.  A measure of net-long  positions  across 11 agricultural
products jumped 28 percent to 162,264 futures and options.
Investors trimmed their bearish corn holdings to 37,262
contracts from 55,767 a week earlier, which was the highest
level since data begins in 2006. Wheat net-shorts totaled
34,261, down from 47,844.  U.S. wheat sales to foreign buyers jumped 44 percent to
11.7 million tons in the marketing year that started June 1,
compared with a year earlier, government data show.  “Demand for commodities is gradually seeing a
turnaround,” said Joe Heider, a principal at Rehmann Financial
Group, which manages about $2.2 billion of assets. “Clearly,
the U.S. is doing well, and opportunities for growth remain in
China, even though it has slowed down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
