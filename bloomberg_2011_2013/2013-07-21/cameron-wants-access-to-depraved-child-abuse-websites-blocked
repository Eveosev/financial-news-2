Internet companies need to act to
block access to “depraved and disgusting” child abuse images
or face legal controls, British Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will say.  “We need to have very, very strong conversations with
those companies about saying ‘No, you shouldn’t provide results
for some terms that are so depraved and disgusting,’” Cameron
will say in an interview to be broadcast by the British
Broadcasting Corp. today “I think there’s going to be a big
argument there, and if we don’t get what we need we’ll have to
look at legislation.”  He said the extra steps he favors represents “an argument
on behalf of Britain’s parents and children I’m prepared to
have.”  During his interview on the “Andrew Marr” program,
Cameron also said he would like to see more restrictions on
access to legal pornography that can be seen online by children.  “There are rules about what films you can see in a cinema,
what age you have to be to buy alcohol or cigarettes,” Cameron
will say, according to a transcript of the interview provided by
the  BBC . “But on the internet, there aren’t those rules, so we
need to help parents with control.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
