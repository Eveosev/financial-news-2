Belgian King Albert II stepped down
after almost 20 years on the throne, preparing for his son
Philippe to take over as the steward of the economically and
culturally divided nation.  Albert, 79, signed an act of abdication before an audience
of 250 government officials at the royal palace in Brussels.
Philippe, 53, will be sworn in as  Belgium ’s seventh king at
12:15 p.m. local time.  Albert urged the assembled guests to “work unremittingly
for the cohesion of Belgium.” He said his son has “all the
qualities of heart and intelligence to serve our country very
well.”  Belgium’s kings play a more prominent role in political
life than other European monarchs, as Albert demonstrated in
helping break the record 541-day deadlock over the formation of
a government after the 2010 elections. Today’s royal handover,
on the annual national holiday, was designed to give the new
king time to settle into his role before the next elections in
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
