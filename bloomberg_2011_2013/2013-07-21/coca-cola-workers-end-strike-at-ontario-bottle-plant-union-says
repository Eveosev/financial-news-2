Workers at a Brampton, Ontario-based
bottling plant operated by  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest
soda maker, ended a three-week strike after approving a three-year contract, the Canadian Auto Workers Union said in a
statement today.  Production at the plant will resume tomorrow after the deal
was approved by 83 percent of workers, according to the
statement. Workers will receive pay increases in the second and
third years of the contract and won an agreement “that would
end demands to outsource existing work.”  “The real fight here was over the defined benefit pension
plan, with Coca-Cola pushing us to move to a defined
contribution plan,” Jerry Dias, assistant to the CAW National
President, said in the statement. “We were ultimately
successful in keeping the defined benefit pension plan and
improving upon it.”  The union also negotiated a weekend-worker program that
includes two 12-hour premium shifts to allow for 24-hour, seven
day-a-week production, according to the statement.  A call to  Kent Landers , a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, wasn’t immediately returned.  The Canadian Auto Workers Union represents about 700
employees at the bottling plant, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
