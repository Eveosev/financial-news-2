Colombia  will wait until its peso
weakens past 1,900 per  U.S. dollar  to issue $600 million in
overseas bonds planned for this year, according to Public Credit
Director Michel Janna.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas , who on April 3 referred
to peso strength as “the mother of all problems” because it
reduces profits for industry and agriculture, has sought to
weaken the local currency in part by reducing the amount of
financing the country gets from abroad.  “We want to make sure that the  exchange rate  is at a good
level,” Janna said in a July 19 interview in his Bogota office.
“Something close to 1,900 pesos, which is what Minister
Cardenas has said is a relatively comfortable level for the
government.”  Colombia’s currency strengthened to 1,882.37 on July 19
after a global selloff of emerging-market assets in May and June
pushed the peso to as weak as 1,940 on June 24.  The government said in February it will sell $600 million
in foreign bonds during the remainder of the year after issuing
$1 billion of dollar notes in January. The total planned for
2013 is 38 percent lower than the $2.6 billion the Andean
country had said in December it would issue in overseas debt.  The emerging-market selloff, triggered by speculation the
U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce monetary stimulus later this
year, helped push yields on Colombia’s dollar bonds due in 2021
to a 20-month high of 3.97 percent on June 25.  “We want to have stable yields abroad, probably even lower
than what we’re seeing right now,” Janna said.  Normalized Conditions  The market rout also pushed Colombia’s domestic borrowing
costs higher, with yields on benchmark peso-denominated bonds
due in July 2024 surging to a one-year high of 7.15 percent on
June 21.  As demand for the country’s longer-term securities waned,
the  Finance Ministry  last month pared back local debt auctions
by as much as half. In the government’s June 26 auction, it sold
300 billion pesos ($159 million) of fixed-rate bonds, known as
TES, compared with 600 billion pesos offered in auctions in May.  As conditions “normalize,” Colombia will sell at least
600 billion pesos of TES in biweekly auctions starting July 24,
in order to meet the government’s goal of auctioning 21.5
trillion pesos of debt this year, Janna said.  A decree that encourages pension funds to shift assets
abroad will probably be delayed until 2014, Janna said.  “We want to make sure we incorporate all the positions of
the industry into that decree,” Janna said. “There will be an
implementation period that will be long enough so that if
there’s any need for the market to accommodate, the market can
do it in a very smooth way.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
