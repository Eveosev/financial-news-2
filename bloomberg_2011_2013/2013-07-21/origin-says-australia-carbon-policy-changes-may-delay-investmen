Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) , Australia’s
largest electricity and gas retailer, said shifting government
policies to reduce  carbon emissions  will discourage investment
in power plants.  “With continual change in carbon policy, it’s very unclear
as to what other forms of generation you ought to invest in,”
Managing Director Grant King said in an interview today on the
Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s “Inside Business” program,
according to a transcript.  Australia’s Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd  plans to move to
emissions trading a year ahead of schedule and scrap predecessor
 Julia Gillard ’s policy should his Labor government win this
year’s election. The carbon price began at A$23 ($21.10) a
metric ton last year, rose this month to A$24.15 and was
scheduled to climb to A$25.40 in 2014. It will transition next
year to a floating price of about A$6, Rudd said July 16.  Opposition leader  Tony Abbott  has pledged to ditch the
carbon price system if he wins the election.  “A change in the carbon price from A$24 to say A$6 or A$8
is a very material change in the relative cost of generation
from coal and gas,” King said. “So it does mean to the extent
that investments were required, they will be delayed.”  The fixed price on emissions for about 300 of Australia’s
largest polluters was planned by Gillard to reduce the country’s
reliance on coal and help meet the target for a 5 percent cut in
greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 levels by 2020.  Abbott’s Liberal-National coalition also supports
Australia’s 5 percent reduction target by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
