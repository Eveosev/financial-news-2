Philippe was installed as the
seventh king of  Belgium , taking over as titular head of the
economically and culturally divided nation after the abdication
of his father, Albert II.  Dressed in the uniform of commander-in-chief of the Belgian
army, Philippe, 53, swore the inaugural oath in Belgium’s three
official languages, French, Dutch and German.  “I swear to uphold the constitution and laws of the
Belgian people, to defend national independence and territorial
integrity,” Philippe said in the ceremony in the federal
parliament.  Belgium’s kings play a more prominent role in political
life than other European monarchs, as Albert, 79, demonstrated
in helping break the record 541-day deadlock over the formation
of a government after the 2010 elections. Today’s royal
handover, on the annual national holiday, was designed to give
Philippe time to settle into his role before the next elections
in May 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
