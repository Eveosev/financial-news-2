Six Flags Entertainment Corp. (SIX)  is
examining the Texas Giant rollercoaster at its Six Flags Over
Texas theme park following the death of a woman on July 19, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  The  Arlington, Texas, Police Department  is also
investigating the incident, where the woman fell from the ride,
according to a  statement . Emergency personnel responded to the
accident at about 6:45 p.m. local time and pronounced her dead
at the scene.  The attraction has been closed since the incident, Sharon
Parker, a theme-park spokeswoman, said via e-mail. She declined
to identify the woman or provide any details of the accident
until the investigation by Grand Prairie, Texas-based Six Flags
is complete.  “We are committed to determining the cause of this tragic
accident and will utilize every resource throughout this
process,” Parker said in the statement.  The Dallas Morning News cited eyewitness reports saying
that the woman’s safety restraint may have been loose.
Investigators interviewed witnesses who said the woman was
thrown from the ride as it rounded a turn, the newspaper said.  The  Texas Giant  debuted in 1990 as a wooden coaster, and
was rebuilt and re-introduced in April 2011 as a hybrid wood and
steel coaster, according to the park’s website. It measures
4,920 feet (1,500 meters) in length and its highest elevation is
14 stories, according to the theme park’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
