Sifca Group , which owns  Africa ’s
biggest palm-oil refinery located in Ivory Coast, said it plans
to spend $417 million in the next five years on plantations and
factories in Ghana, Nigeria and Liberia.  The company, which is also West Africa’s largest rubber
producer, will use the 35 billion CFA francs ($70 million) it
raised through the sale of bonds last week to pay for the
expansion and will finance about 36 percent of the plan itself,
Chief Executive Officer Bertrand Vignes said in a July 16
interview. The rest of the funds will come from bank loans and
partnerships, he said. The total investment figure was in a
statement handed by the company to Bloomberg News the same day.  “Our strategy is to consolidate our footprint in West
Africa and to continue growing in the countries where we are
based,” Vignes said in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s commercial
capital. Sifca is “on watch for opportunities” particularly in
palm oil and rubber, in the region and continent, he said.  Sifca plans to boost palm-oil output 33 percent to 400,000
metric tons annually over the next four years, Vignes said last
month. The expansion comes amid World Bank estimates that demand
for the world’s most used cooking oil may double by 2020, driven
by rising consumption in  China  and  India .  Wilmar International
Ltd. (WIL) , the largest palm-oil trader, and  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) ,
the Singapore-based commodities trader that’s the second-biggest
rice dealer, are equal owners of a company that holds 27 percent
of Sifca’s shares, according to its  website .  New Plantings  Sifca is planting palm-oil seeds on 15,000 hectares (37,000
acres) of land in south-eastern Liberia and plans to develop
14,000 hectares of plantations in Nigeria, Vignes said.  The company is in talks with Wilmar to take a stake in a
plant in Ghana that will have the capacity to produce 1,000 tons
if oil daily, the company said in the statement.  Palm-oil prices, which reached a 3 1/2-year low on July 16,
are likely to “be a bit less favorable this year compared with
last year,” Vignes said. The contract for delivery in September
declined 1.5 percent to 2,257 ringgit ($707) a ton on the
Malaysia Derivatives Exchange in Kuala Lumpur today.  Sifca, which employs 29,000 people, is also equipping its
rubber plants in Ivory Coast and  Ghana  to be able to process as
much as 130,000 tons of the material this year, from 120,000
tons in 2012, Vignes said. The company owns five factories in
Ivory Coast, the continent’s biggest grower of the material, and
produced 151,000 tons of rubber in West Africa last year.  Sifca is planting rubber on 5,000 hectares in Ghana and is
also extending its plantations in Nigeria,  Vignes said. It
produces about 18,000 tons of rubber in each country, he said.  In Liberia, the company signed a concession agreement with
the government in 2011 to develop rubber on more than 25,000
hectares, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
