Serena Williams  beat Johanna Larsson
in straight sets to win tennis’s Swedish Open, her seventh WTA
title this year.  French Open  champion Williams of the U.S., the top seed,
defeated the Swedish No. 8 seed 6-4, 6-1 in Bastad for the 53rd
WTA crown of her career.  Williams, a 16-time Grand Slam winner, was knocked out in
the fourth round of Wimbledon by Germany’s Sabine Lisicki, who
went on to lose to Marion Bartoli of  France  in the final.  “It was really good to come here and win after a
disappointing Wimbledon, so hopefully this confidence will help
me for the rest of the year,” Williams told reporters.  World No. 1 Williams’s title haul this season equals her
tally last year and is one behind her highest number of wins, in
2002. She’s 51-3 in matches this season.  Yvonne Meusburger of Austria beat Andrea Hlavackova of the
Czech Republic 7-5, 6-2 in the Gastein Ladies tournament in Bad
Gastein, Austria, for her first WTA title.  Italy’s Fabio Fognini beat Argentine qualifier Federico
Delbonis in the final of the German championship in Hamburg to
win his second successive ATP title in eight days. He won the
ATP Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart on July 14.  Fognini had a 4-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 win over Delbonis, who
beat former world No. 1  Roger Federer  in the semifinal
yesterday. Fognini survived three match points in the tie-break
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
