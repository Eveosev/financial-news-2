The German  Defense Ministry  denied a
report in  Der Spiegel  magazine that delivery of the Airbus
Military A400M transport plane could be delayed because of a
mistake in the ministry’s certification procedures.  “The timely delivery of the German A400M, according to the
contract changes from 2010, is secure at this time,” the
Berlin-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The news
magazine reported earlier today that a certification body
responsible for approving the aircraft wouldn’t be ready for the
planned November 2014 delivery of  Germany ’s quota of planes.  Engine faults and cost overruns have affected development
of the transport aircraft, which represents  Europe ’s largest
defense program at about 25 billion euros ($33 billion).  Der
Spiegel  said documents from 2003 show that mistakes in the
original sales contract mean certification procedures don’t meet
German military standards.  The discrepancy has led Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere, already facing criticism for a scandal over the failed
project for the Euro Hawk military drone, to plan a new body to
oversee domestic certification of the A400M, the magazine
reported. The Defense Ministry said the process for certifying
the aircraft has “already been determined as far as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
