The Iranian rial appreciated 6
percent in the past week, on hopes the U.S. may delay further
sanctions on  Iran  following the election of its new president,
Hassan Rohani, the  Shargh  newspaper reported.  Since Rohani’s June 14 election, Iranians have been selling
dollars they bought over the past year while the domestic
currency was tumbling amid sanctions, the Tehran-based newspaper
said. The rial reached 30,500 yesterday after more than 120
members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter last week calling
on President  Barack Obama  to engage Iran diplomatically,
according to the daily.  Western nations suspect Iran wants to use its nuclear
program to produce weapons, and have imposed a seires of
sanctions to pressure it to curb its nuclear ambitions. Iran
says its program is meant for energy production and medical
research.  Unlike President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who advocated a
confrontational approach to Western nations, Rohani has promised
to bring more transparency to  Iran’s nuclear program  in an
effort to roll back U.S. and European Union measures against the
country. The sanctions have cut oil exports, pushed inflation to
more than 35 percent and cost the rial more than half of its
value against the dollar in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
