A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck
off the eastern coast of  New Zealand , rattling the capital city
of Wellington and causing minor damage and power cuts.  The earthquake hit at 5:09 p.m. local time Sunday, 57
kilometers (35 miles) south-southwest of Wellington, at a depth
of 14 kilometers, the  U.S. Geological Survey  said. There were no
reports of injuries or significant damage,  Sky News  said.  The earthquake, initially reported at a magnitude of 6.9,
was unlikely to cause any tsunami threat,  the Ministry of Civil
Defense & Emergency Management  said in an e-mail. It follows a
magnitude 5.7 temblor on July 19 that shook office towers and
sent workers diving under desks in Wellington.  “Police are working closely with civil defense and other
 emergency services  as we assess the impact,” said Acting
Wellington District Commander Superintendent Sue Schwalger in a
statement. There will be “disruption to train services” and
“road closures in the central business district,” she said.  New Zealanders are particularly wary of earthquakes after
185 people died in Christchurch two years ago, when a magnitude
6.3 shake largely destroyed the center of the city. The nation
sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanic and quake
activity.  Reports of damage ranged from broken windows to water
leaks, according to the New Zealand Herald. TVNZ also said four
people were hospitalized with minor injuries and that two had
been discharged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
