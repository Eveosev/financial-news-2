 Bill Gross  said he expects the  Federal Reserve  won’t tighten
monetary policy until 2016 at the earliest.  Treasuries had their biggest two-week gain in almost a year
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central
bank wouldn’t slow its monthly bond-buying program unless
economic conditions warrant.  “So bonds come out of their coffin & it’s not even
Halloween,” Gross, who manages Pimco’s $268 billion Total
Return Fund, said in the posting on Twitter. “Bernanke says
follow policy rate & we agree.”  Ten-year yields  retreated from the 2013 high reached July 8
as Bernanke told congressional panels last week it was “way too
early to make any judgment” about whether the central bank, the
biggest buyer of Treasuries, will starting cutting back in
September. The proportion of  U.S. government debt  in Total
Return, the world’s biggest bond fund, rose to 38 percent in
June, from 37 percent in May, according to data on  Newport
Beach , California-based Pimco’s  website .  “The chairman went out of his way to discourage investors
from assuming Fed tapering has been largely decided, which has
calmed bond buyers down,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $2.1 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in  New York . “The path of easing
will clearly be data dependent, and every report will be
intensely scrutinized as people are looking for any indication
of whether we are on a path of policy adjustment or not.”  Treasuries Rally  Treasury  10-year yields  fell 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 2.48 percent last week in New York,
Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The price of the 1.75 percent
note due in May 2023 rose 26/32, or $8.13 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 93 20/32.  That drop, combined with 16 basis-point fall in the
previous five days, was the biggest back-to-back decline since
the period ended Aug. 31. The yield touched an almost two-year
high of 2.75 percent on July 8.  The Fed chairman was “relatively dovish” in his outlook
on the  U.S. economy  and monetary policy, according to Mohamed
El-Erian, Pimco’s chief executive officer. Markets “took the
tapering too far” and 10-year Treasury yields may drop to 2.2
percent this year, El-Erian, who is also co-chief investment
officer with Pimco founder Gross, said in a July 17 interview.  Benchmark yields jumped 17 basis points on June 19 after
Bernanke said the central bank, the largest buyer of U.S.
government debt, may start dialing down its unprecedented bond-buying program this year and end it entirely in mid-2014 if the
economy finally achieves sustainable growth.  Unwelcome Yields  Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee last week that
tighter financial conditions as a result of rising yields over
the past two months are “unwelcome.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  has kept the benchmark
 interest-rate target  at a record low zero to 0.25 percent since
2008 to support the economy. Investors see a 40 percent chance
policy makers will lift the federal funds rate to 0.5 percent or
higher by December 2014, compared with 49 percent odds a week
earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Policy makers next
meet July 30-31.  Gross also added to holdings of mortgage securities in
June, the fund’s second-largest holdings. The proportion rose to
36 percent last month, from 34 percent in May.  Over the past five years, the Total Return Fund has
returned 7.7 percent, outperforming more than 90 percent of
competitors. It gained 0.7 percent over the past year, placing
it in the 71th percentile of its category, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Pimco, a unit of the Munich-based insurer
 Allianz SE (ALV) , managed $2.04 trillion in  assets  as of March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
