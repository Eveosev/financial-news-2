Foreign investors, the bulwark of
the U.S. government  bond market  as it more than doubled in size
during the financial crisis, are adding Treasuries at the
 slowest  pace since 2006 amid the worst rout in four years.  Holdings by non-U.S. investors rose 1.9 percent through
May, down from 5.2 percent a year ago data last week show, as
foreigners owned less than 50 percent of Treasuries outstanding
for the first time since March 2012. Overseas  central banks  cut
the amount of bonds held for them by the  Federal Reserve  during
the second quarter. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index fell
2.4 percent, the most since 2009, after Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said he might slow asset purchases as the  economy  improves.  Diminished demand comes as institutions recalculate their
expectations for yields. International buyers had kept pace as
the market expanded to $11.4 trillion from $4.4 trillion in
2007, supporting President  Barack Obama ’s efforts to end the
longest recession since the 1930s. The biggest sellers this year
are from the Caribbean, the domicile for hundreds of  hedge funds 
that are typically first to react to changes in interest-rate
policies.  “If foreign central banks are not an incremental buyer of
new Treasuries and the Fed is ‘going to taper, if,’ then the
Treasury will have to find another source” of demand, Thomas Atteberry, a Los Angeles-based fund manager at First Pacific
Advisors Inc., which manages $24 billion in total assets, said
in a July 18 telephone interview. “And that source wants a
higher  return  to commit their money.”  First Pacific only owns Treasuries that mature in a maximum
of six months, he said.  Debt Drop  International holdings of  U.S. government debt  fell $45.8
billion, or 0.8 percent, in April and May to $5.678 trillion, or
49.8 percent of bonds outstanding, based on  Treasury (BUSY)  Department
data released last week. The two-month decline was the first
since 2005.  Finance officials in  developing countries  that were trying
to depress the value of their currencies to boost exports
reversed course in order to prevent too steep a drop, Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in
 New York , said in a July 16 telephone interview. The firm is one
of the 21 primary dealers that are obligated to bid at the
Treasury’s debt auctions.  “This period when the Fed appears to be transitioning to
normalization of  interest rates  is of course a challenge to
reserve managers who need to hold  dollars  for fundamental
reasons,” Philippine central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said
in an e-mail response to questions July 18. The nation increased
its holdings 0.5 percent to $39.5 billion in May from $39.3
billion the previous month.  China Adds  The biggest  exception  was  China , the largest foreign owner.
The nation boosted its stake this year by $95.5 billion, or 7.8
percent, to $1.316 trillion, the most on record. The world’s
second biggest economy has added U.S. bonds in seven of the last
eight months, buying $25.2 billion in May as the  benchmark  10-year yield rose to 2.17 percent, then the highest level since
April 2012.  Central bank sales probably were “far more significant in
June,” and helped push  two-year  note yields to as high as 0.43
percent on June 26 from as low as 0.19 percent in May, Sebastien Galy, a senior foreign-exchange strategist in New York at
Societe Generale SA, France’s largest bank, said in a telephone
interview on July 16.  Yields for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, last week, to 2.49
percent, as the 1.75 percent note due May 2023 rose 26/32, or
$8.13 per $1,000 face value, to 93 20/32. The yield dropped one
basis point to 2.47 percent as of 12:12 p.m. in New York.  ‘Falling Knife’  The 10-year yield reached 2.75 percent on July 8, the
highest since August 2011, from a low this year of 1.61 percent
on May 1. The selloff escalated after Bernanke, following the
completion of a two-day meeting of the  Federal Open Market
Committee  on June 19, said the Fed might scale back its $85
billion a month of bond buying this year and end it by mid-2014.  “Our Japanese customers, who have been tremendous buyers
of Treasuries, stepped back because they don’t like to stop the
falling knife,”  Thomas Roth , a senior Treasury trader in New
York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc., a unit of Japan’s
biggest lender, said in a telephone interview July 18.  Yields have since dropped to as low as 2.46 percent on July
17, after Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee
that if economic “data are stronger than we expect, we’ll move
more quickly” to reduce purchases. If the numbers “don’t meet
the kinds of expectations we have about where the economy’s
going, then we would delay that process or potentially increase
purchases for a time,” he said.  Fed Benchmarks  Policy makers have said they won’t raise benchmark interest
rates, which they have kept in a range of zero to 0.25 percent
since 2008, until  unemployment  falls below 6.5 percent while the
inflation rate remains under 2.5 percent.  “There’s optimism about the  U.S. economy ,” Michael Pond,
the head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays Plc,
another primary dealer, said in a July 15 telephone interview.
On recent trips to  Asia , foreign officials “were hesitant, but
wanted to put on bearish positions” in Treasuries to reflect
that, he said.  U.S. employers added 195,000 workers for the second
straight month in June and wages increased as the world’s
largest economy gained momentum, while the jobless rate held
close to a four-year low at 7.6 percent.  Fund Outflows  The unemployment benchmark might be reached by the end of
next year, based on estimated growth in gross domestic product
of 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 2014, according to the FOMC’s
June central tendency estimates, which are higher than the 2.9
percent estimate of private forecasters in a Bloomberg survey.
GDP expanded at a 1.8 percent pace in the first quarter.  The improving outlook came as  Hong Kong  reduced its
holdings of U.S. government securities by 6 percent to $137.8
billion, Singapore also cut 6 percent to $92.2 billion and
 Thailand  slashed its total by 20 percent to $54.6 billion since
March, Treasury data show.  Private investors joined the retreat, pulling about $8.1
billion from mutual funds that invest in bonds during the week
through July 10, according to data from the Washington-based
 Investment Company Institute  released July 17. Assets flowed out
of the funds for six straight weeks, the longest stretch since
December 2008, and totaled $74.8 billion. Customers added $4.55
billion to U.S. equity funds during the period, ending seven
consecutive weeks of withdrawals.  No Value  “With yields as low as they were, and clearly the Fed
suppressing them below what their fundamental value would be,
people didn’t see value in the Treasury market,”  Thomas Higgins , a global macro strategist in  Boston  at Standish Mellon
Asset Management Company LLC, said in a telephone interview on
July 18. The debt management group of Bank of New York Mellon
has $167 billion of fixed-income assets.  Measures of projected bond market volatility show that
investors are becoming less concerned that yields will change
abruptly. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch  MOVE index  dipped to
a seven-week low of 77.45 on July 18 from 117.89 on July 5, its
highest level since December 2010.  Deutsche Bank AG Co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain
praised the Fed for fostering a “slow, smooth”  adjustment  in
the bond market as it plans to curtail debt purchases. The
central bank should be happy with how the bond market has
reacted, Jain said July 17 in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Yields on 10-year Treasuries will rise this year to 2.63
percent, based on the median of 67 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  Caribbean Holdings  The Fed pumped more than $3 trillion into the financial
system through bond purchases since 2008. It held a record $1.96
trillion of Treasuries on July 17, up $300 billion, or 18
percent, from the end of 2012. Foreign purchases totaled $104.6
billion through May, a 1.9 percent increase. International
investors had  raised  U.S. bond holdings by more than 10 percent
each year since 2006.  Treasury holdings by Caribbean nations fell $30.9 billion,
or 10.9 percent, in May to $253.2 billion, the biggest drop for
any country or group.  “American hedge funds domiciled in Greenwich, Connecticut,
that have their nameplates in the Cayman Islands were huge
sellers of Treasuries in May,”  Jim Bianco , president of Bianco
Research LLC in Chicago, said in a July 17 telephone interview.
Hedge funds, many of which are registered in the Caribbean,
“move a lot of faster than everybody else,” he said.  Inflection Point  Foreign central banks reduced custody holdings at the Fed
to $2.94 trillion as of July 17, the least since Feb. 6 and the
fifth consecutive weekly reduction. They owned $2.97 trillion on
June 12.  “There is a shift occurring with a kind of leveling out of
Treasury purchases,” Michael Brandes, global head of fixed-income strategy for Citigroup Inc.’s Citi Private Bank, with
$270 billion in assets under management, said in a July 18
interview. “We are coming to an inflection point in the U.S.
rate cycle with the trend for higher yields.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
