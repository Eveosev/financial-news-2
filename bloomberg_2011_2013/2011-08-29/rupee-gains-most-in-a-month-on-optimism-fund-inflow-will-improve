India ’s rupee gained the most in
almost a month on speculation global funds will buy emerging-
market assets after the  Federal Reserve  said it has the tools to
support growth in the U.S. economy.  The rupee and the Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index
rose for the first time in four days. Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke told a gathering of central bankers in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, on Aug. 26 that the world’s largest economy is
recovering and the central bank still has a range of measures it
could use to help the nation.  “Bernanke’s statement has been interpreted as an assurance
that the Fed will maintain adequate liquidity in the U.S. market
and this has improved appetite for Indian assets,” said
Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency trader in Mumbai at state-owned
 Corporation Bank . “The Indian stock market is also oversold
after falling for most of last week.”  The rupee rose 0.2 percent to 46.05 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
the biggest advance since Aug. 1.  Offshore forwards indicate the Indian currency will trade
at 46.46 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 46.59 on Aug. 26. Forwards are agreements to buy
or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
