Ghana ’s cedi dropped for the first
time in seven days against the dollar as traders bought the U.S.
currency to pay for imports.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 1.5295 per dollar, before
trading less than 0.1 percent lower at 1.5250, as of 1:48 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The cedi weakened slightly today on corporate demand from
general merchants,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at the
local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in a telephone
interview. “The currency will close weaker if the central bank
does not sell dollars this week.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
