The Libyan ambassador to  Zimbabwe 
was ordered to leave the country because he defected to  Libya ’s
National Transitional Council, Zimbabwe’s state-controlled
 Herald  said, citing a statement from the foreign ministry.  The ambassador, Taher Elmagrahi, is no longer recognized by
Zimbabwe, which has diplomatic relations with Colonel Muammar Qaddafi’s government, the Harare-based Herald said. Libyans had
committed an illegal act by hoisting the NTC flag at their
embassy, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
