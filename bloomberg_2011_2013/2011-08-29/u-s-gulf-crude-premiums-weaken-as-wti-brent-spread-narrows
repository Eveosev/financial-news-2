U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
after the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s discount to
Brent narrowed the first time in four days.  The gap between WTI and Brent October contracts contracted
99 cents to $25 a barrel at 1:08 p.m. in  New York . The spread
settled Aug. 19 at a record margin of $26.21.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 50 cents to $27.50 a barrel over
WTI at 10:40 a.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased 50 cents to
$24.50 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend lost 25 cents to $22.75 while Poseidon weakened 60 cents
to $22 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium decreased 75 cents to
$20.75 a barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to
80 cents. Thunder Horse’s premium weakened 75 cents to $25.75
above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $13.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The spread for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$11.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
