Chile’s peso rose to the strongest
level in three weeks as investors increased holdings of
emerging-market currencies after the  Federal Reserve  said the
 U.S. economy  is gradually recovering and a report showed
Americans’ spending increased more than economists forecast.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 465.15 per  U.S. dollar ,
the highest price since Aug. 4, from 466.06 on Aug. 26.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Aug. 26 that he is “more
optimistic” about the long-term prospects for the U.S. even
amid challenges from the slumping housing market and financial-
market volatility. A report today showed U.S. consumer spending
climbed more than forecast in July, indicating the biggest part
of the economy is holding up.  “Today we are seeing the Chilean peso following the better
mood and trading stronger,” Alex Pigatto, a trader at Nomura
Securities Inc., wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  Chile ’s central bank paid an average of 464.4 per dollar
for $50 million today, according to data posted on its website,
as part of a $12 billion effort to limit the peso’s gains.  Chile’s two-year interest-rate swap yield rose for the
first time in three days, climbing four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.60 percent at 12:24 p.m. New York time.  The two-year breakeven inflation rate gained one basis
point to 2.46 percent. The yield on the government’s dollar-
denominated bond maturing 2020 rose to 3.16 percent from 3.12
percent on Aug. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
