The harvest in the Canadian prairies
is 14 percent complete, behind the normal 17 percent pace for
this time of year, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  The harvest has made the most progress in Manitoba, where
29 percent of crops have been collected, ahead of the normal
pace of 24 percent, the board said today in a statement on its
 website . Nine percent of the harvest is complete in  Alberta ,
behind the normal 17 percent, while Saskatchewan has collected
14 percent of its crop, compared with 15 percent normally.  Warm, dry weather last week boosted crop progress, with
temperatures 1 degree to 5 degrees Celsius above normal. Only
“pockets” of northern Alberta have received frost, the board
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
