Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) , a Nigerian lender,
will seek approval from its shareholders to buy 75 percent of
 Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) , which was bailed out by the West
African nation’s central bank in 2009.  Shareholders will also be asked at a meeting on Sept. 26 to
approve the use of 53.5 billion naira ($345.5 million) it raised
in a public offer in 2007 to fund the transaction, the Lagos-
based lender said today in an e-mailed statement. The deal will
give Access Bank “controlling equity interest in the authorized
share capital” of Intercontinental, the bank said in the
statement.  Access’s shares fell to the lowest since November 2009,
losing 28 kobo, or 4.8 percent, to close at 5.57 naira in Lagos.  The  Central Bank  of Nigeria fired the chief executives of
eight of the nation’s 24 lenders in 2009 after a debt crisis
threatened the banking industry with collapse. It bailed out the
eight lenders, including Intercontinental, with 620 billion
naira.  Three of the bailed-out banks, Afribank Plc, Bank PHB Plc
and Spring Bank Plc, were nationalized by the government on Aug.
5 and given new names after they were deemed unlikely to meet
the recapitalization deadline. Five others, including Union Bank
Nigeria Plc, Intercontinental Bank, Finbank Plc, Oceanic Bank
International Plc and Equitorial Trust Bank, have signed
agreements to be acquired by other lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
