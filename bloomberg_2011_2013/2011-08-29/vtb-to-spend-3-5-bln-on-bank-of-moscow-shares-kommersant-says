(Corrects last sentence after Kommersant corrects a story
published Aug. 29 to say the new share issue will happen after
the buyout.)  OAO VTB,  Russia ’s second-largest
lender, may spend as much as 100 billion rubles ($3.5 billion)
to buy new shares of OAO Bank of Moscow, Kommersant reported
today, сiting an unidentified person at VTB.  VTB’s board will discuss the question on Aug. 31, the
newspaper said. VTB owns 46.48 percent of Bank of Moscow and a
new share issue will take place after a buyout of minority
shareholders, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
