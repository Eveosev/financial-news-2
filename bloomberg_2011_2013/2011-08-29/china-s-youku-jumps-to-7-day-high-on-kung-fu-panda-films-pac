Youku.com Inc. (YOKU) , China’s largest

Fu Panda” movies.  The company’s American depositary receipts soared 7.2
percent to $24.99 at 10:10 a.m. New York time, the highest
intraday level since Aug. 18.  The agreement gives Youku the right to release both “Kung
Fu Panda” franchise films on its online platform in mainland
China, Youku said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
