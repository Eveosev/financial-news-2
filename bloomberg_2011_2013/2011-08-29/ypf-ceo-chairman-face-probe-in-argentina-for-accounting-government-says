Argentina’s securities regulator
said it will  investigate  the chairman and chief executive
officer of  YPF SA (YPFD) , the nation’s largest oil producer, as part of
a probe into the company’s accounting.  Chairman Antonio Brufau, CEO Sebastian Eskenazi and other
executives will be investigated because some YPF financial
reports didn’t meet local accounting standards and time-lines,
the regulator said in a filing today.  Brufau is also the chairman and CEO of  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,
Spain’s largest energy producer and YPF’s parent company with
about 58.2 percent of the shares. Repsol has cut its stake in
YPF by about 26 percent since November through offerings in  New
York  and private placements, which included the sale of about 10
percent to the Eskenazi family in May for $1.3 billion.  Other executives named in the filing include YPF Vice
Chairman Enrique Eskenazi, YPF General Director Antonio Gomis
and YPF board member Luis Suarez de Lezo Mantilla, who is also a
Repsol executive director.  A press official for YPF in  Buenos Aires , who can’t be
named because of corporate policy, said the company will respond
to the agency’s requests in “due time.” Bloomberg put in a
request to speak with the executives named by the securities
regulator and didn’t immediately receive a response.  To contact the reporter on this story:
