China banned 100 songs from the
country’s Internet, including six from Lady Gaga and two from
Katy Perry, as the songs didn’t apply for a content review or
proper registration with the government, the Ministry of Culture
said in a statement on its website.  Websites must delete these songs by Sept. 15, the statement
posted on Aug. 19 said, adding that they will be punished if
they fail to do so.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
