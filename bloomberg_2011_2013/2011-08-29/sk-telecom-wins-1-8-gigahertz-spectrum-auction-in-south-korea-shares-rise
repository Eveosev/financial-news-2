SK Telecom Co., the largest mobile-
phone carrier in  South Korea , won the rights to use a key
frequency for fourth-generation phone service for 995 billion
won ($924 million) in the country’s first auction of spectrum.  The carrier won 20 megahertz of airwaves in the 1.8-
gigahertz frequency band, the Korea Communications Commission
said in a statement today.  KT Corp. (030200)  dropped out of the race
because the bidding was too competitive, the Seongnam, South
Korea-based carrier said in a statement. KT was awarded 10
megahertz in the 800 megahertz range for 261 billion won,
according to the statement by the company.  Bids for the 1.8-gigahertz band had almost doubled since
the auction began on Aug. 17, as South Korea’s two largest
mobile-phone carriers sought to secure more spectrum amid
surging data use before they begin 4G wireless services. SK will
use the frequency based on the long-term evolution, or LTE,
technology, the carrier said in a statement.  “The band is globally preferred,” Park Jong Soo, a Seoul-
based analyst for Hanwha Securities Co., said. “SK didn’t have
a proper LTE-related frequency. It’s better for them in the mid-
to-long term to get this frequency at a high cost than to lose
it.”  Shares in SK rose 2.1 percent to 147,500 won as of 11:38
a.m., while the benchmark Kospi index gained 2.7 percent. SK
Telecom began LTE service in  Seoul  in July and plans to expand
coverage nationwide by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
