Tiger Woods  will play in the
Frys.com Open in October at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin,
California, according to his website.  It will mark Woods’s first appearance at the event,
scheduled for Oct. 6-9, and his first start in the U.S. since
missing the 36-hole cut at this month’s PGA Championship.  The event is located about 40 miles south of Wood’s alma
mater,  Stanford University .  “I always enjoy competing in my home state, and this
tournament fits my schedule perfectly,” Woods, 35, said on
his  website .  The 2010 Frys.com event was won by Rocco Mediate, whom
Woods defeated in a playoff at the 2008  U.S. Open , his last
major tournament victory  “Any time Rocco is in the field, it’s always fun,” Woods
said.  The Frys.com Open is the second event of the U.S. PGA
Tour’s four Fall Series tournaments.  Woods hasn’t won a tournament since November 2009. He’s
fallen to No. 38 in the  Official World Golf Ranking  after
holding the top spot for a record 281 weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
