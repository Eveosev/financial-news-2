Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , a
developer of resorts in Europe and the  Middle East , fell to the
lowest level on record in Cairo trading after its chairman was
sentenced in an Egyptian court for violating securities laws.  Egyptian depository receipts, or shares of the company
trading in Cairo, plunged 9.1 percent to 7 Egyptian pounds, the
lowest level since at least December 2009, at 12:04 a.m. in
Cairo.  Chairman Samih Sawiris was sentenced to two years in jail,
a fine of 6,780 Swiss francs ($8,334), and bail of 2,720 francs
over disclosure violations, the company said in a statement
today. Orascom Development filed an appeal against the judgment
and initiated discussions about a settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
