Copper declined for a third day amid
stalling U.S. job growth and concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-
debt crisis will worsen, fueling fears that a weaker economy may
reduce demand for industrial metals.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
fell as much as 0.9 percent to $8,990.25 a metric ton, the
lowest level since Aug. 26, and traded at $9,000 at 4:12 p.m.
Tokyo time. The metal earlier gained as much as 0.4 percent.  Asian stocks and oil fell for a second day, following the
2.5 percent slump in Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures on
Sept. 2 after the U.S. Labor Department reported the weakest
payrolls reading since September 2010. The Dollar Index headed
for its longest winning streak in eight months, reducing the
appeal of copper as a rise in the greenback makes metals priced
in U.S. dollars more expensive to investors holding other
currencies.  “In the short term, the copper market is under downward
pressure from the weaker U.S. jobs data and mounting concern
about Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, together with an increase
in stockpiles in London and  Shanghai ,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  LME copper stockpiles climbed 1,450 tons to 466,075 tons on
Sept. 2, increasing for a second day. That was the highest level
since Aug. 22.  Growing Stockpiles  In  China , stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose for the first time in three weeks. The inventories
gained 5,532 tons to 107,790 tons, according to a survey of 10
warehouses in Shanghai, the bourse  said  Sept. 2. Stockpiles at
bonded warehouses rose 1,151 tons to 17,604 tons.  Copper for November delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.1 percent to 67,100 yuan ($10,505) a ton.
Futures for December delivery dropped 1 percent to $4.0835 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  Further declines may be limited by concern over tight
supplies, such as lower concentrate grade and potential supply
disruptions amid strong demand by China, Hwang said.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Peruvian copper
miners plan to hold a two-day strike over benefits including pay
increases starting Sept. 7, a union official said. Workers and
officials at Freeport’s Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde SAA unit
will take part in government-brokered labor talks during the
weekend in a bid to avoid the stoppage,  Luis Castillo , general
secretary of  Peru ’s Mining Federation, said Sept. 3.  The global market will likely remain in short supply for a
third straight year in 2012 on China-led demand. Demand may
exceed supply by 495,000 tons in 2011, the biggest deficit since
2004 and compared with a 214,000-ton shortfall last year, said
Akira Miura, executive officer of the marketing and raw-material
department at Pan Pacific Copper Co.,  Japan ’s biggest producer.
The shortage may shrink to 31,000 tons in 2012.  Aluminum was down 0.7 percent at $2,420 a ton and zinc was
little changed at $2,197 a ton. Lead lost 0.5 percent to $2,447
a ton and nickel was down 0.7 percent at $21,357 a ton. Tin
dropped 1.2 percent to $23,950 a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
