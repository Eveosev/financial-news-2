The  Czech Republic ’s benchmark stock
index rose to the highest in more than three weeks after a
report showed U.S. consumer spending climbed more than forecast
and the  Federal Reserve  said it had the tools to spur growth.  The PX gauge of companies increased 1.5 percent to 1,030.2
at its 4:28 p.m. close in  Prague , its highest close since Aug.
5. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and Czech coal-mining company
New World Resources Plc jumped at least 3 percent.  Global stocks extended gains after a report showed personal
spending in the U.S. rebounded in July, boosting optimism about
the global economic recovery. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
Aug. 26 that the world’s largest economy is not deteriorating
enough to warrant any immediate additional stimulus.  “Optimism spurred by Bernanke’s speech on Friday is today
spilling into European markets,” analyst Ondrej Moravansky at
Cyrrus brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report to
clients today.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest Czech power utility, added 2.2 percent
to 766.1 koruna, its biggest one-day gain in more than a month.
 Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)  surged 4.9 percent to
212 koruna, after the broadcaster tumbled 5.3 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
