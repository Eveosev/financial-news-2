Crude oil inventories in Cushing,
Oklahoma, were not fully visible last week in a satellite
survey, according to data compiled by  DigitalGlobe Inc. (DGI)   Stockpile totals in floating-roof tanks at the hub were
ascertained for none of the 233 tanks last week, satellite
images taken Aug. 25 and 26 by the Longmont, Colorado-based
company show.  The Energy Department said Aug. 24 that Cushing
inventories, including floating and fixed tanks, were 33.7
million barrels, a nine-month low.  Cushing is the physical delivery point for New York
Mercantile Exchange oil futures contracts and the largest crude-
trading and storage hub in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
