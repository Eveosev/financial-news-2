South African market today.  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT)  , an industrial holding company,
advanced the most in over a month, climbing 6.71 rand, or 4.7
percent, to 150.20 rand. Sales in the year through June
increased 8 percent to 118.5 billion rand ($16.7 billion),
beating the median estimate of 115.6 billion rand of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  DRDGold Ltd. (DRD)  , South Africa’s fourth-largest
producer of the metal, closed at its highest in more than three
months, rising 9 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 3.70 rand. The
company said gold production increased 10 percent to 265,179
ounces in the year through June.  Optimum Coal Holdings (OPT)  Ltd, a coal producer,
closed at a four-month high, adding 40 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
31.90 rand. Glencore International Plc, the global commodities
trader, acquired shares in Optimum on the open market, giving it

fuel from coal, rose the most in five months, increasing 11.15
rand, or 3.6 percent, to 320 rand. Oil extended its gain in  New
York  after a report that showed U.S. consumer spending climbed
more than forecast in July, spurring speculation of recovering
demand in the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. (SBK SJ), Africa’s biggest bank,
closed at its highest in more than a month, gaining 4.34 rand,
or 4.6 percent, to 98.83 rand. Investors bought South Africa’s
banks after their recent slide made their dividend yields and

analyst at Avior Research Ltd., said by phone from Cape Town.
Standard Bank has a dividend yield of 3.9 percent, compared with
2.8 percent for the benchmark index.  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  , South Africa’s second-largest
