African tea prices mostly increased
at a weekly auction in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa,
according to James Finlay (Mombasa) Ltd.  “Demand was stronger and prices dearer at today’s sale,
which had 109,008 packages on offer,” the tea broker said in an
e-mailed report today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
