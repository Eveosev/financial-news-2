Gasoline fluctuated on speculation
refinery units offline at plants owned by  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  and
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  after Hurricane Irene may curtail fuel supply and
as equities rose.  Futures swung between gains and losses as Sunoco shut a
crude unit at its Philadelphia refinery and Conoco’s 238,000-
barrel-a-day Bayway refinery in Linden,  New Jersey , remains
closed. The  Standard & Poor’s  500 index advanced 2.2 percent as
of 1:59 p.m. in New York amid optimism that the U.S. economic
recovery is picking up.  “All the move up was concern about supply disruptions,”
said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply at Truman
Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 0.1 cent to $2.9336 a
gallon at 1:59 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
traded between $2.8765 and $2.9513.  The supply disruptions caused by Irene have occurred with
U.S. gasoline inventories at the second highest level in five
years for this time of year, according to Energy Department
data.  Sunoco shut the crude unit after pumps in a tank farm that
supply oil to the refinery flooded because of Hurricane Irene,
according to a person familiar with plant operations. A fluid
catalytic cracker at the plant is operating at about half
capacity, or about 40,000 barrels a day, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.  Backwardation Narrows  The premium of the September contract versus October
futures narrowed to 14.3 cents at 2:04 p.m. The difference
surged to 16.62 cents on Aug. 25 as the path of Hurricane Irene
approached the U.S. Northeast, on concern that high winds and
flood waters would disable refineries for an extended period.
Futures are said to be in backwardation when the price for
prompt delivery is higher than that for later delivery.  “We’ll take that backwardation out of the market and just
go back to watching the equities,” Knight said.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 1.17 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.0218 a gallon.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.2
cent to $3.611 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
