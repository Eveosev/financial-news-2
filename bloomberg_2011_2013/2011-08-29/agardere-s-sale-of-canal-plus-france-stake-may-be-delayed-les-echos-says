Lagardere SCA (MMB) ’s plans to sell its 20
percent in stake Canal Plus France via an initial public
offering may be delayed by market conditions, daily Les Echos
reported, citing Lagardere Chief Financial Officer Dominique
D’Hinnin.  The sale is “probably not possible in current markets,”
the newspaper cited D’Hinnin as saying. “But we still want to
sell and we’ll be ready to take the slightest chance to do so.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
