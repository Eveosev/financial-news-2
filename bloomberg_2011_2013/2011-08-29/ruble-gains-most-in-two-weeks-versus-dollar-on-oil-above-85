The ruble strengthened the most
against the dollar in two weeks as oil,  Russia ’s chief export
revenue earner, climbed for a third day and a report showed U.S.
consumer spending increased more than forecast.  Russia’s currency appreciated 0.6 percent, its biggest
daily gain since Aug. 15, to 28.7690 per dollar by the 7 p.m.
close of trading in Moscow. The currency weakened 0.6 percent to
41.8200 per euro.  Crude for October delivery gained 2.2 percent to $87.26 a
barrel in  New York . Personal spending in the world’s largest
economy rose 0.8 percent in July, compared with a 0.5 percent
increase predicted in a Bloomberg survey, as autos sold at the
fastest pace in three months, the Commerce Department said.  Investors pared bets that the ruble will decline, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 29.0990 per dollar
in three months compared with 29.4600 on Aug. 26. The contracts
provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
interest-rate differentials and allow companies to hedge against
currency swings.  The movements against the dollar and the euro left the
ruble little changed at 34.6419 against the central bank’s
target currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together.  To contact the reporter on this story:
