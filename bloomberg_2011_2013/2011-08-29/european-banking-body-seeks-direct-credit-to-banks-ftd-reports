Andrea Enria, chairman of the
European Banking Authority, demanded that the European Financial
Stability Facility be allowed to give funds directly to banks to
shield them from financial difficulties,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing a letter to be sent to the council
of European finance and economy ministers.  Currently, the 725 billion-euro ($1.05 trillion) fund may
give money only to governments, which can then pass it on to
lenders, according to the report. The majority of the 27 EBA
members approve of the plan, while  Germany  is opposed, FTD said,
citing an unidentified person close to the German government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
