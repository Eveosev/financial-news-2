Gasoline in New York rose as
 ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s Bayway refinery in New Jersey remains shut and
 Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  operates its Philadelphia plant at reduced rates.  Conoco’s Bayway refinery halted operations on Aug. 27, as
Hurricane Irene approached. Sunoco shut a crude unit at the
plant and a fluid catalytic cracker is operating at about half
capacity, or 40,000 barrels a day, according to a person
familiar with plant operations.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor gained 1 cent to 9.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:13 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
2.01 cents to $3.0397 a gallon.  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  has returned its
Plantation oil products pipeline to service, Emily Mir, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The line has a capacity
of about 600,000 barrels a day, transporting gasoline,  jet fuel ,
diesel and biodiesel from Louisiana to the Washington, DC, area.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast held at 6.5 cents a gallon versus October futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
