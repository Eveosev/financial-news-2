Lotus Bakeries (LOTB)  NV, the maker of
caramelized biscuits and Peijnenburg gingerbread, said first-
half profit rose 20 percent as last yearâ€™s dollar-hedging losses
reversed.  First-half net income advanced to 11.3 million euros ($16.4
million) from 9.42 million euros a year earlier, the Lembeke,
Belgium-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Sales
increased 5 percent to 133.6 million euros.  Lotus Bakeries also said it will start marketing its
biscuits to hotels and catering companies in  Spain  directly
after agreeing to take over the customers of its local importer
as of October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
