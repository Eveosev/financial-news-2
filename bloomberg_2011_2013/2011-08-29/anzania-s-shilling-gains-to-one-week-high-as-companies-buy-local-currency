Tanzania’s shilling appreciated to
the strongest in a week against the dollar as companies bought
the local currency to meet month-end payments.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
climbed as much as 0.8 percent to 1,610.1 per dollar, the
strongest intraday level since Aug. 22, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It traded 0.1 percent stronger at 1,621.5
by 4:02 p.m. in the commercial capital,  Dar es Salaam .  “Demand is coming from companies seeking shillings to meet
end-of-month obligations like paying taxes to the Revenue
Authority and salaries,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer Stanbic
Bank Tanzania Ltd., Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said
by phone. “The trend has been in line with expectations of
companies buying shillings this week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
